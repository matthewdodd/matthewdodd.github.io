I suspected that the people in my own house had robbed me. At last I missed a hat of a particular description. I suspected my journeyman, whose name is Jeffreys, or the apprentice, had taken it. I saw the journeyman come out of the necessary. I went in, and found the hat. The necessary goes into the shore, and there is a place where any thing may be laid. In consequence of finding the hat, I charged the journeyman with having taken it; he confessed hiding it in the necessary, and said it was taken out of the shop by the prisoner, and that the prisoner had taken several, eight or nine, and had given them to his wife to pawn. In consequence of this information, I charged the prisoner with having stolen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150056"></xptr> them. The prisoner confessed he had taken them, and owned all the account of Jeffreys to be true. I found the hats at the several pawnbrokers.</p>

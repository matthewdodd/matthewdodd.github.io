             (police-constable P 90). On Tuesday the 28th of May, I was on duty, and saw the prisoner at half-past three o'clock in the morning at the end of Hampton-street, Walworth-road, getting out of a cab, with a large bundle; this attracted my suspicion, I watched him down the street, he turned up Church-passage, and I went round the Walworth-road to meet him; I met him opposite Newington-church; I asked what he had got, he said a sample of boots, that he had come from the country, and he was going to take them to North-street, Bayawater - I said I must take him to the stationhouse, he said he had no objection; in going along he said he was going to take them to No. 122, Holborn - I found the prosecutor's name on the boots.</p>

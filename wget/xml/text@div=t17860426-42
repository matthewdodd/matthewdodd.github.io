            ; my husband is a blacksmith, and lives in Rose and Crown court, Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>How long did the prisoner and his wife lodge in that house? - Nine months, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Where did you sup on Thursday night the 17th of March? - On the Thursday night, I had supped before I went to sup with the prisoner; he came in on the evening of the Thursday night, as near as I can guess, about ten, and he went up stairs, one pair of stairs higher, and he came down rather displeased, because supper was not done, and said, he would go out and get a pint of beer; but he did not go out; when he came in he made up to the draft-board, where there was a hat hanging; my husband said he would not have him go out that night but come in and sit down with him while the supper was ready; there was a bonnet hung up by the draft-board, and he pointed to it with his stick; he said, he thought it was a woman; bless me, says he, how I am deceived; then he sat down with my husband and me in our kitchen; then he said, he would send for a pot of beer, before the house was shut up, and he gave our apprentice the money, and he said he would go up stairs, and my husband should go with him; my husband had supped; and he said, never mind that Evans, you shall go up stairs with me.</p>
               <p>Was the pot of beer drank below? - No; the prisoner took it up stairs himself; then my husband followed him, by the desire of the prisoner, and I went with them; by that time supper was ready, and we four sat down to supper; and we supped, to all outward appearance, very agreeably; he helped his wife to a bit of the pork; when we had supped, it was a little after eleven; then my husband shook hands with the prisoner, and we both went into the next room; and was called again about one by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What sort of a call was it? - Mrs. Evans; when I went in, and when I came in, he said to me, now do you believe there is a man in bed with her; and I said Simpson, what are you talking of, there is nobody in bed with her; he said, they were gipsies, and had been singing under the window the whole night.</p>
               <p>Did you at that time look into the bed to see if there was any body there? - Oh, yes, there was nobody but the deceased in the bed; he then said if you will not believe, go to bed; for you will see more of them come up stairs; then I went to bed; then I was called up again about four in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did you go to sleep? - I dare say I did.</p>
               <p>What was the call then? - Mrs. Evans, Mrs. Evans, for God's sake come in.</p>
               <p>Whose voice was that? - Both parties, Mrs. Simpson that is dead, and the prisoner; I got up and went into the room, and when I came into the room, the prisoner stood on the off side of the bed, in his shirt, with his breeches, shoes, and stockings on; he was undressed in the same manner at one o'clock when I went in; she was in bed; I said, what is the matter with you Mrs. Simpson; and she said, he would neither sleep himself, nor let her go to rest; then he put his hand very coolly into his pocket, and pulled out a knife; I immediately cried murder.</p>
               <p>Into his breeches pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of a knife was it? - A clasp pen-knife.</p>
               <p>Was it clasped when he took it first out? - Yes, it was, and I cried murder; he opened the knife, and I repeated murder for God's sake; and he said to the deceased, d - n you, you bitch, I will run you through; then the prisoner made the knife to the left side, open, as she lay on her right side.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by the prisoner making the knife to the left side? - He made it to the left side, as though he was going to give the wound; but I did not know that he had.</p>
               <p>Take the knife into your hand, and make a motion, in the manner he did? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260088"></xptr> He held it in his right hand, and made a motion with the blade of the knife to the side.</p>
               <p>Where did he stand? - At the upper end of the bed, and looked exactly at her who lay in the bed.</p>
               <p>Then you being on the opposite side, could see distinctly the motion he made? - Yes, his face was towards her; he looked at her, he did not look at me; as near as I can recollect, it was the right side.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect which hand it was he took the knife out of his pocket with? - He certainly must take it with his left hand.</p>
               <p>Is he left handed or right handed? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Which hand did he open the knife with? - As near as I can tell, he must hold it in his left hand, and open it with his right; that is, as near as I can think; but my flurry was so great, I can hardly answer.</p>
               <p>What, did the woman lay covered? - She lay with the clothes mousled like from her shoulder; she was a very lusty woman.</p>
               <p>Were the clothes off from her left, or her right shoulder? - Her left shoulder.</p>
               <p>How low down might the clothes be off? - As near as I could see, with my fright and flurry, they were laid down off her shoulder.</p>
               <p>When he made a push towards her side, was it to the lower part of her side, or the upper part? - I cannot say; seeing no blood follow, I thought nothing of it; then Mrs. Simpson turned round immediately upon her back, and looked up at the prisoner, and said, Simpson are you going to murder me, and he immediately took the knife, and thrust it as she lay on her back, in the small part of her nose; she lay with her head rather turned; then the blood followed there in a most violent manner.</p>
               <p>Did he use any expression when he made that thrust? - None that I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing upon receiving that wound? - Nothing; I never heard her mention any thing.</p>
               <p>What did not she cry out? - They neither of them said a word.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him? - Upon my word I cannot recollect that I spoke, except to my lodgers, who came down stairs, they lodge in the garret; my husband came and stood at the door, and he said, Simpson, what have you done, have you cut your wife's throat; and he made no answer.</p>
               <p>What became of the knife? - He came round while I was washing the blood off her nose; Simpson came round to the place where I stood; I had the deceased's head on my arm, and was washing the blood off her nose, and was trying to stop it; then the prisoner came round to my side with the knife in his hand, and I said, Mr. Simpson, I wish you would give me this knife, upon which he gave it me; it was open when he gave it me.</p>
               <p>Was there any blood upon it? - Upon my word in that confusion I cannot say; I gave it to my husband, as he stood at the door; then with the assistance of my lodgers, we took her and helped her into the next room, into my child's bed, for fear any thing should ensue; I took her thinking if there was any thing of passion, she had better be out of the way.</p>
               <p>Was there any appearance of either of them being in a passion? - None, that I saw at that time, in either of them.</p>
               <p>Did the man appear to be in a passion when you first came into the room? - No, but what I made mention of; he looked in a very fierce terrible manner.</p>
               <p>Different from what he used to look? - Yes, Sir; I never saw him commit such a rash action before; he looked in a very troubled bad situation; I never saw him look so before.</p>
               <p>Did you put any clothes upon her before you moved her? - I put her on a clean shift; that was dirty on account of the blood and the water.</p>
               <p>Where did you shift her? - In her own room.</p>
               <p>In doing that, you did not take notice of her having received a hurt in her side?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260089"></xptr>- No; after I got her into my room, I asked him if he had not better go to bed, he came to the door, and made answer, he should not go into that bed to night.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said during the time you was shifting her, by either the prisoner or the deceased? - No; she never made any complaint at all.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of him after he said he should not go to bed that night? - He had his clothes on, and I said, he had better go to bed to his wife, and I said, I would make the child get up and come into our bed, which was in the same room; he laid down by his wife, and I believe he lay about ten minutes, I cannot recollect there was any thing said by either of them; then after I was settled in bed, he got up and blew my candle out that stood on the drawers, I said Simpson, this will never do, I shall not lay here in the dark, and I got up and struck a light, at that time he got off the bed, after I struck a light, and got out in the passage; he was disturbed and troubled in his mind as I thought; I cannot recollect any thing more of the circumstance, till after he had been out in the morning, and had been in again, which was about eight o'clock, then he came into the room, and he said, remember, Mrs. Evans, I gave you the knife.</p>
               <p>Where was his wife? - In bed; he said you have my knife; I said yes, but I do not choose to give it you; with that he said, never mind it; and he went out of the room, and went into his own room, and soon after he came out of his own room and came to my door again, with a pair of new buckskin breeches in his hand, and his plain shirt; and he said he was going to the Halfmoon, in Halfmoon-alley, at

            's; I saw no more of him the sore part of the day, till eleven or twelve; then he came into the room where his wife lay; and said, I believe one of her eyes is out; and I said, no Simpson, her eyes are as well as your's, it is only the wound in her nose; says he, I must send for a surgeon; then he went down stairs again, and nothing passed at that time; then I went out, and went to her friend to let him know the situation she was in, a gentleman where she used to have her trifle from; the gentleman said, I must get her advice for what was wanting, and he would give it me; I came home, and went and fetched a surgeon; by this time it was about two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. This friend used to pay her her annuity? - Yes; then I went to Mr. M'Larching in the Fields; he was not at home, he did not come to his time; then I sent for him again; he said he could not come; and she complained of being sore all over, then I sent for Mr. Taylor, that was about seven, or after seven, I cannot say justly; she said one of her ribs was very sore, and Mr. Taylor put his hand into her bosom, and felt it, and said, swelled indeed! and he bid me bring a candle, and he examined where she complained, and there he found the wound; that was the first time the wound was discovered; he took an instrument into his hand, and examined the wound, and I said, I hope it is not so deep as that; and he said it was, and he ordered me to make a poultice directly, which I did with bread and milk, and hog's lard; he ordered her a draught to compose her, and she slept, as near as I can recollect, near half an hour; then she grew worse and worse the whole night till the morning, when she expired.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning did she die? - At half after six on the Saturday morning; the whole night she lay in great agonies; she said, God forgive him, for I do; they asked her if she had any body to send to, and she said no; she said her misery was so great, she could not live many hours.</p>
               <p>When was this man taken up? - He was rather obstrepelous; she was then alive, and he said he would go up stairs to see his wife; I said, well, Simpson, you shall go up, and he sat down quite composed, to all appearance, and as soon as I went down, he pulled the pillow from her head, and mousled the clothes; I found them sowhen I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260090"></xptr>You told me, that after he had said he would not sleep in that bed that night, he went out, and you do not recollect seeing him till the morning, when he said, Mrs. Evans, remember I gave you my knife? - It was after he went out, he had the buckskin breeches, and after he had said one of her eyes was out, I had been to her friend; when he came in that night, I was in the kitchen, I went up with him, and when he came up, he seemed very composed; he sat down by the bed-side; there was nothing of anger or passion, and I seeing every thing was quiet, went down.</p>
               <p>How long was you down stairs? - Upon my word I cannot say; I left him there while I went out for a surgeon the first time; and when I returned, I went up to the deceased, and he was down in the kitchen; how he got down, or by what means, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>When you went up, what state was she in? - I found the clothes half way down as she lay in bed, and I saw the pillow laying at the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Did the deceased say any thing at that time about his coming up? - She said he had been pulling the pillow about, and she had rather not see him.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the particular expression she made use of? - She made use of none; says she, do not pother me, Simpson, let me alone; that was when he was talking about her eye being out. I hope, my Lord, if I am mistaken, you will be so good as to excuse it, it is a heavy affair, she was as good as a mother to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What age was the woman? - Fifty-two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. Evans, these two people have lodged in your house for nine months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know from what place they came to lodge with you? - Yes, out of Ludgate prison.</p>

               <p>Do you know how long they had been there? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You have said you never saw him behave to before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Upon what terms did they live together during the nine months you observed their conduct? - Very happy.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him beat her? - No; but I have said to her I would go to my friends; says she, Mrs. Evans, if I came to you for my support, then you should speak; if I like it, who has any business, my five shillings a week will always keep me.</p>
               <p>You say they lived well together? - Yes; his wife lodged with him in the prison backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>This poor man, I believe, has had a great deal of misfortune, and five shillings a week was all they had to live on? - That I cannot say; five shillings was all she had; she was always contented.</p>
               <p>What was the state of his health at the time this happened? - He was ill, to be sure; it was the first time of his going out.</p>
               <p>How had he been confined, had he any assistance from any body of medical prosession, at the time he came in, in the evening, to your room first; I wish you would describe a little more particularly to my Lord what he said about the hat? - He said he thought it had been a woman.</p>
               <p>Did not he say he had caught one at least, or any thing of that? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you ever heard him talk in that way before, about catching gipsies, or men in bed? - No, never before.</p>
               <p>They supped together very agreeably? - Yes, to all outward appearance.</p>
               <p>It was the prisoner that called you up the first time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the first thing he said to you, was, now, do you believe I have caught a man in bed with her; to which you answered, no, there is nobody in bed with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then what reply did he make? - He said there were gipsies under the bed singing.</p>
               <p>Was that the time he talked about the trap-door? - I come here as much on one side as the other; I do not come to tell you what other people have said.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - Something that it was a bad house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260091"></xptr>There was no complaint made by the wife, till he took the knife out of his pocket? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>What was the expression? - He will neither sleep himself, nor let me sleep.</p>
               <p>Did she say, he cannot sleep, or he will not sleep? - She said, he will not sleep.</p>
               <p>You cried-out, murder! how did you perceive him to look? - When I see a man in bed, sitting in that manner, and taking a knife out of his pocket, I had but little thought how the man looked; when he opened it, I cried murder, for God's sake!</p>
               <p>After he put the knife towards her side, it was that she asked him quietly whether he was going to murder here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he went out of the room, did he take a light? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his coming in at five, and saying he would go to the Spread Eagle? - I cannot tell the time.</p>
               <p>Did you see him before he went out on that day? - I did not.</p>
               <p>This annuity entirely ceased on the death of the wife? - It did.</p>
               <p>What was the man's business? - A barber and hair-dresser.</p>
               <p>How long before this did you see him? - I saw him in bed the day before.</p>
               <p>What time of day was that? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Morning or afternoon? - After dinner.</p>
               <p>Did he keep his bed? - He was in bed, but I never was in his room, except just asking how he did; I had no occasion to speak to him in the course of that week; his wife said he had a cold.</p>
               <p>Before that time, he behaved himself decently and soberly? - Soberly I cannot say; but sober or not, he always behaved well.</p>
               <p>Was he apt to be in liquor? - Like other people.</p>
               <p>Was he given to drink? - As every other man in business.</p>
               <p>There are some men that are sober men, there are other men that are often in liquor; which was he? - I must leave it to your Lordship.</p>
               <p>How do I know; I never saw the man in my life before, good woman? - I must needs say, I believe he was in liquor a pretty deal, or else he never would have made away with what he has made away with.</p>
               <p>Are you able to judge that night, when he came in, and when he mistook the hat for a woman, was he sober or not? - I may safely say then he was sober.</p>
               <p>When he was in liquor, how did he behave? - I never saw him any ways outrageous till that night.</p>
               <p>Had he, when in liquor, any tendency to be mischievous? - I never observed any thing of that kind.</p>

               <p>I am husband to the last witness. The prisoner came home on the Thursday night about ten, or rather before; he went up into his own room, and found fault with his wife, because she had not dressed his supper; they had a few words, but what they were I do not know; he came down into my apartment, and I desired him to fit down, and have a drop of beer.</p>
               <p>Was he drunk or sober? - Sober; I asked him to sit down, and next to the draft board that I have hanging in the room, there was a hat hung, and he makes to the hat, and said, God bless my soul! I thought it had been a woman, and he drew back again; after that, he sat down, and called for a pot of beer; we drank part of it; in the course of half an hour afterwards, he said, Evans, you may as well go up to supper; says I, Mr. Simpson, I have had my supper before, nevertheless, I will go up with you; he took the pot of beer into his own hand, and we went up stairs together into his own room; he sat down, and there was a bit of loin of pork roasting, and he turned it round, and basted it, and he took it up, and desired his wife to lay a cloth; and she said she had none; my wife fetched a cloth of her own, and laid it for her; they took the meat up, and had their supper; after supper, about half after eleven, we left them in good friendship, and went to our bed; I heard no more till about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260092"></xptr> one; about one, Mrs.

               <p>When he followed her, did he say any thing? - Not to my knowledge; after that, in about a few minutes they called, I awaked my wife, and she went to the room to them; and what they said, I do not know; I went to sleep; but after that, between three and four, the prisoner got out of bed again, and called, watch, watch, watch, several times over; I thought he was going down stairs, in the room of that he went up stairs, in my boy's garret, and what he did there, I do not know; I kept my own apartment; after that he came down, I called to him as he passed my room door, Simpson, why do you not go to bed; and he went into his own room, and in a few minutes after that, they both called.</p>

               <p>How was he dressed? - In his breeches and stockings.</p>
               <p>Any shoes on? - I will not be sure; the deceased sat on the side of the bed, all of a gore of blood; I said to him, Simpson, what have you cut your wifes's throat? and I drew back again; she said, she has got three men in bed with her now; do not you see them there now, these are gipsies, says he, I am sure they are; and they have got a trap door behind the bed, I am sure of it; whereas my Lord, there is no such thing as a trap door; my wife and lodger washed the deceased's face, and washed the blood off, and put a clean shift on, took her into my room and put her to bed to my girl; in a little time he came into the room, and I said to him for God's sake what is the matter with you, go to bed; he said, I will not get in there any more; I said, go then and lay down by your wife, and he did; during this time, the wife said nothing; then he got up and blew out the candle I had in my room; I said then to him, Simpson, if you cannot be quiet, go out of doors; accordingly my wife struck a light, and he went out; he went up stairs into the garret again, there I heard him make a noise, I jumped out of bed, and went up to him, he came down stairs, and went out of doors; my boy let him out; at about eight, he came back again; I was in bed, and he said, that he had been to the Spread-Eagle, in Bishopsgate-street, and had been tried there for killing a man; he had killed a man, he said he knew he had killed a man, and struck him through the ribs; and, says he, running through the street, after I got away, a man went to shoot me with a gun, but says he, I got away from him; then after that, he goes to Mr. Wood's that keeps a publick house in Halfmoon-alley, and carried a pair of breeches, and a shirt there; a little time after Mr. Wood and he came past my window, and Mr. Wood asked me if I would go and have a glass of any thing to drink; and we went to the Horse and Groom, the corner of Moor-fields; we had a glass each of us, and came away at about one, as nigh as I can recollect; he came back again; I was at dinner, I asked him to have a bit, he said no, then says I, have you been to the bankers? no, says I, you shall not go, I will go, or my wife shall; he directly started up in a rage, and said he would go to

               <p>When he was in the kitchen with you, had you any conversation with him, or had your wife? - No; when he came back again, I was resolved to see what he had, whether he had pistols or no; we searched him, me and another man, and I found he had nothing in his pockets at all; with that, says he, shall not I go and see my wife again? says I, go up stairs, and he went up stairs, and came down again, and I heard my wife say, he had used her very rough; and I thought it proper to chargean officer with him; and we took him to Mr. Wilmot's; and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Did any thing particular pass at the Justice's? - No; he said he had killed a man.</p>
               <p>When was the second examination? - On Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Before, or after the woman was dead? - After, she died about five o'clock; she said that Simpson had done for her; and she hoped God would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had not then any idea that the woman had received the mortal wound? - No.</p>
               <p>What did he say before the Justice? - I cannot say; the next day he was examined again, and he said, he had caught a man in bed with his wife, whose name was Williamson; and that he had killed him; that was a second time.</p>
               <p>Had he and his wife had any words? - I did not hear that they had, I did not hear what had passed between them.</p>
               <p>When they supped they were then sociable and agreeable? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How lately before he came home had you seen him, before he made a push at the draft board, and in what state did he appear to be? - Very bad; he said, he had a violent cold about him, and was in a very bad situation.</p>
               <p>You awaked by an out-cry before Mrs. Simpson came in? - No, Sir; Mrs. Simpson came in first; that was the first thing that awaked me.</p>
               <p>What answer did Simpson give you, when you desired him to go into his own room? - He said to my wife, that the gipsies were singing under the window.</p>
               <p>Have you ever said any where, that upon your desiring him to go to bed, that he gave you this for answer; that there were gipsies in the bed, and that they had a trap door behind the bed? - He did the second time.</p>
               <p>Whether on the first time of their coming in, he did not give that answer? - Not then he did not; after he got into his own room I heard him say so, before four o'clock; I heard him say so twice, both at the first time, and at four o'clock, I heard the prisoner calling the watch, I observed nothing to call the watch for; I desired him to go to bed.</p>
               <p>What sort of a noise did you hear in the garret? - A kind of rumbling of chairs, and things.</p>
               <p>At the time he said she has three men in bed with her, do not you see them, you had no idea she had received a mortal wound? - No; only the wound in the nose; at the time he came from the Spread-Eagle, he said he had laid there all night, that he had been tried for killing a man, and had been acquitted; he said he had a bunch of white ribbons, and he would bring them home for my wife to wear.</p>
               <p>Had he any? - No; the prisoner and his wife lived together very happy and very agreeable, as a man and woman need to do; this annuity was a principal part of their support; she was a very affectionate good worthy woman, and very tender of him.</p>
               <p>Did she ever complain of any ill treatment or brutality? - No, none in the least; only about four in the morning, just as they were going to bed she said, Simpson has done for me, and God forgive him.</p>

               <p>I am the husband of the last witness; on the 17th of March last, about three or four in the morning, or before that, I was awaked by the prisoner calling repeatedly to Mrs. Evans; Mrs. Evans got up to know what was the matter; he came out and went down stairs, and called watch, then he went up stairs, and threw down several things; the boy asked him what he wanted, he said he would let him know what he wanted; he asked t he boy where he was, the boy said at Mr. Evans's; he said no, he was at the Spread-Eagle; he went down, and went to his room; in a few minutes Mrs. Evans cried out, murder, murder, murder, Evans; I jumped out of bed immediately and ran down, when I came down, the deceased was sitting on the bed-side, in her shift, with her hand on her forehead, and all bloody; the prisoner was there, with his breeches, and shoes and stockings on, he looked at me in a very wild manner; they were going to wash her, but I returned; soon after that he came out of his room again, and came up a second time, and then Mr. Evans being a good deal exasperated, pulled or pushed him down, for making an uproar in his house; he then returned to his room; soon after he went up again to go to bed; Mrs. Evans hearing that, called her apprentice and I up; I heard him say to the boy, which way are they gone now? but, however, the boy shut the door, and I heard no more of him, I went to work for the day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say when you went into the room to him, he was in a very distracted state? - Yes, Sir, I spoke to him, he only stared at me.</p>

               <p>You was was sent to see this poor woman? - Yes; about eight in the evening, it was on Friday; I saw her laying on her right side, I asked her where her pain was, she said it was all over her body; I desired Mrs. Evans to go round, and she complained rather more of her back; and on looking towards the side that was next to me, there I saw the wound which Mrs. Evans had not seen before; the wound was on the left side near the blade bone, as far as I can recollect, it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260095"></xptr> pretty far back on the side; but the surgeon will give you a better description; finding it was pretty much inflamed, I ordered the woman to poultice it.</p>
               <p>Did you probe it, Sir? - Yes, Sir, and I suppose the probe might pass about an inch and an half, but finding an obstruction I did not pass it any further; I sent her a draught, I never saw her after.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of the man? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon, at No. 39, in Shoreditch; I examined the body at the desire of the parish officers; I discovered a wound on the nose, just at the junction of the bonds that form the nose to the bones of the forehead; the knife had entered just in the suture, where they join; it had penetrated a very little way; she had also a wound on the left side, between the seventh and eight ribs; the appearance of a large extravasation of blood under the skin; the external skin was formed into several blisters, containing a dark red fluid; I then opened the abdomen, or belly; I did not discover any thing particular in an unhealthful state, except a slight inflammation in the small intestines; afterwards we opened the breast or thorax, we discovered the wound between the seventh and eight ribs, about sixteen ounces, or thereabouts, of coagulated blood, in the left cavity of the breast; and also that some sharp instrument had entered the lungs; they shewed me a knife, and it appeared to have been some such kind of instrument; it had entered about a quarter of an inch, or near half an inch into the lungs; from the air escaping from the lungs, it had got underneath the skin, and had swelled the body up to a considerable degree above its natural size.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation on the ribs? - Yes; I also found, that it had divided an intercostal artery running along the inferior edge of the seventh rib.</p>
               <p>Was that in the direction of the wound? - Yes; it had passed with violence against the ribs, and there was a small notch made in the ribs.</p>
               <p>What do you suppose to be the cause of this poor woman's death? - The wound, and the consequence of that wound was the cause of her death.</p>

               <p>Court. Could you form any judgment whether any blood had passed outwardly? - I think there must have been some, but perhaps not much.</p>
               <p>Could you form any judgment how long that wound might have been given? - No, my Lord; externally, it appeared to have the appearance of an incipient gangreen or mortification.</p>
               <p>Is this intercostal artery that you describe a large vessel, or a small one? - Not a large one; perhaps about the diameter of a crow's quill.</p>
               <p>Were the mouths of the vessels choaked by the coagulated blood? - The vessels were quite divided; there was no blood in the vessels at that time; there was a large quantity of blood underneath the skin, so as to spread all down that side, and to the right side, and down part of the thigh, it was black all the way.</p>

               <p>I am a perfumer in Fleet-street; I have known the prisoner fourteen years.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you had occasion to travel with him? - I cannot exactly recollect the time; it is either between four or five, or five and six years; we went first to Lynn, and then to Cambridge.</p>
               <p>In the course of that journey, did you observe any thing particular in the conduct of the prisoner? - At Yarmouth he was taken ill of a nervous complaint, a trembling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260096"></xptr> and shaking; I sent for a gentleman, who gave him something; one of the mixtures was Hoxton's Tincture of Bark; when we got to Lynn, we slept in a double-bedded room, at the Duke's Head, in the Market-place; about four in the morning, or at least early in the morning, he waked, and said he had heard groaning and mournings all night, and could not possibly sleep, and wondered how I could sleep; I was astonished; he was out of bed, and walking about the room; I desired to go to sleep again, but he would not let me; he seemed uneasy in his mind from the road to Cambridge; when I had him in the chaise, he used to say, do you not hear the singing; what the devil do they sing for; sure you must hear them singing; do stop the chaise.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what sort of music it was? - Singing; he described one song to be Yankie doodle dandie; he hummed the tune to me.</p>
               <p>Did you apply for any other medical assistance, in the course of your journey? - No; in the evening at the Red Lion at Cambridge, I had a friend that supped with me, and as soon as he was gone, the prisoner was sitting in the room, and he started back in the chair, with his eye fixed full on the window, which was shut with outside shutters; says I, what is the matter with you? - says he, do not you see a woman looking at me through the window? I said, I see no such thing indeed; how can you be so ridiculous; I thought him very strange and wild again; some time after, he repeated the same thing, do not you see the woman again; she has now got a pair of spectacles on: I was very glad when I brought him to town.</p>
               <p>Did you communicate this to his wife? - I do not recollect, in particular; but I told every body that knew him, that I had any occasion to speak to about it, because it was so extremely strange and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to be a person disturbed in his senses? - I thought so.</p>
               <p>Now, as to his character for humanity, as far as you have had an opportunity of that coming under your observation? - As to humanity, I always believed him to be a very humane man, good natured, rather tender-hearted than otherwise; soft in that respect.</p>
               <p>You have had occasions of seeing him and his wife together? - Very frequently.</p>
               <p>Do you know upon what terms they lived? - I always understood they lived upon very good terms; I believe they lived upon very good terms.</p>
               <p>I believe you made some resolutions about his travelling with you again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did not you apply to any medical man at Cambridge? - No; I thought I should get him to town next day, and therefore I did not.</p>

               <p>What were his own words? - He said he was at the Spread Eagle, and I said he was; he came a little further, and there was a table fell down, and he said they have put them in my way, that he should not get to me, and he came to the bedside, and laid hold of the bed's foot, and then he went away.</p>

               <p>Did he talk to you as if he knew you? - Yes; he went down stairs, he came up the second time after the murder was done.</p>
               <p>What passed then? - He came into the room; I said, who is there; he said, me; and I called out for a light; then my master came and pushed him down stairs; he said nothing more that second time, that I recollect.</p>

               <p>In what state did you find him? - Very bad in bed; a violent pain in his bowels; he said he was very droughty, and had cold shivering sits; I saw his wife each time; she was taking care of him; they were upon good terms; I called on the Tuesday evening, about eight; I asked Mrs. Simpson where he was; she was ironing a shirt; she said, poor creature, he is just gone out, but he is very ill; I asked her where he was gone; she said, she believed to Wood's; I went to Wood's, but did not find him; and going home, he came behind me, and tapped me over the shoulder; I asked how he did; he said he was very well; so he asked me to drink, and we went into a house with a long passage; as soon as we got into the tap-room, he turned short round; says he, what did we come here for; he walked on directly towards the door; I followed him; then he came back, and said, we will have a dram at the bar; I told him he had better not drink any liquors, as he had been bad; he said he had had nothing to drink all the day.

               <p>I keep the Half Moon; I saw the prisoner on the Thursday afternoon, as near as I can recollect, it must be about four o'clock, and I rather wondered that I had not seen him during the course of the week, for he generally used to come once or twice a day into my house; he seemed in a violent palpitation, and he said he had been very ill, and had been in his bed; I observed nothing more than a violent agitation and shaking, and he hovered over the fire, and signified that he had been very ill; he observed to me at that time that he should go over and get shaved, and he did come through my house about ten that night. On the Friday morning, just turned of eight, I saw him; I made very particular and strong observations upon him; he came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260098"></xptr> into my house, and he seemed violently disturbed, and appeared very wild; I asked him what was the matter, and he turned short round to me, and with a very gloomy appearance, he observed that he had committed a deed, which, he said, when he had related it to me, would make every drop of blood in my veins run back; I made use of a vulgar expression, and said, it must be a d - nd strange story, indeed, Simpson, to operate so powerfully upon me; he seemed rather confused, and said it would, and turned to the fire, and said he would tell me; he sat down; he did not tell me immediately; he staid in my house the course of two or three hours; he was out once; I urged him to relate the tale; he said that he had found a man in bed with his wife, and he had stabbed him in the body, and he made no doubt but the stab would do for him; and he clapped his hand upon his wrist, in this manner, and said he had run a knife into his body thus far; I immediately proclaimed him mad; says I, the man is disordered, knowing the disposition of the man, I was sure, in my own opinion, that he could not commit the act; I proceeded to ask him, in consequence, where he had been to commit this fact; he said he had been at the Spread Eagle all the night; that he had laid there; that is, after he had caught this man in bed with his wife, and stabbed him; that he went to the Spread Eagle; that they brought the man there; that he had been tried at the Spread Eagle, and acquitted; that they had made him a present of some white things, to wear as a proof of his innocence; this confirmed me in my idea that the man was out of his mind; I told him, was I in possession of a strait waistcoat, I should certainly put it on; and in the next place, I said, you will be either in bedlam or in a mad-house; then, said he, you do not believe the tale I tell; I said, no; then, said he, I will go and fetch Mr. Evans, and he will prove it, for he knows it to be a fact; he went away, and came back again in about ten minutes with a pair of buckskin breeches and a clean shirt in his hand; they were wrapped up together; and he asked me leave to go into the parlour and shift himself, which he did, and he brought me his dirty shirt and his buckskin breeches to take care of for him; he said Evans was coming; he said he could not think, for his wife was some years older than him, what could possess the old fool to take a young fellow to bed with her; what, says I, is he a young fellow? yes, he is a young fellow; he said he would take me to see him, if I chose to go; I rather detained him; I told him I was going out, I asked him to take a walk with me, which he agreed to. Prior to that, he fancied he saw chimney-sweepers dancing in the street; he said to my waiter, in my hearing, he tapped him on the shoulder, see there, John, says he, see the chimney-sweepers dancing in the street; at last we went out together, and it was my intention to call on Evans; we went there; he was sitting at the work-board; I asked how he did: Simpson and I went in, and we all three went together to the Horse and Groom in Dagger's-court; we were there about six or seven minutes; nothing particular passed; I was not informed by Evans of any thing about it; I asked him to go with me, but in Moorfields he altered his mind, and said he would go to the Change; I saw him about three in the afternoon; he came with a stranger, a hair-dresser; he asked him to drink, and they had a glass together; he invited this man to call at my house, to spend an evening with him; he had a pen sticking across his mouth, as if he was writing; his eyes were open, his hat cocked up, and not in the usual way, but wild and extraordinary; he continued with me ten minutes, I saw no more of him till after he was taken up; she always spoke of him, and he of her, on good terms, and happily.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Having known this man twelve months, did you ever observe any thing particular in his behaviour before this day, that this unfortunate behaviour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260099"></xptr> happened? - The most that ever I observed in his behaviour, was a kind of stupidity about him.</p>
               <p>Court. I rather suspect that he was apt to be prevailed on to drink a little? - He was a man that was free, when he was in liquor; there was a kind of stupidity, a kind of inactivity, but not disposed to be quarrelsome or mischievous; on the Sunday afternoon, when I went to New Prison, the man was frantic in my opinion, and Mr. Yardley observed to me, that he thought it feigned; I said, I did not think it was; I was not afraid to go to him alone, for I was very sure that the man was so harmless, that he would not hurt man, woman, or child if he knew it; now this I only give you as a proof of the opinion I had of the man.</p>

               <p>I am a fishmonger in Leadenhall-market; I have been acquainted with him a good many years, I have several times observed something remarkable in his conduct; I believe about five, or between five and six years ago, he had been into the country along with one Mr. Sharp, and some time after he was returned, I was in his company at the Spread-Eagle in Gracechurch-street, spending the evening with a few friends, and the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>Court. How soon after his return? - I fancy it may be about a week after, or not quite so long; he came in and he sat himself down close to me, there were several people there, I cannot tell who they were; he took notice to me, that as he was coming along through the gateway of the Inn, he had met a large black hog, and it would not let him pass, and fought him, and he at last persevered, and it bit him by the legs, he then sat down a little, and was much discomposed, he then imagined that there were three people behind the curtains, and he desired us to look at them, and that they made faces at him.</p>
               <p>Was that a mere imagination of his own? - Yes, there was no such thing, and that about the hog, I took it at the time to be his illness, a kind of light headedness, or insanity; I was frightened at the time, he was that evening just got up, and come from home, he had been in bed for a day or two; I have observed at different times in his company a rambling, and a kind of light headedness.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing, whether that was increased at all by drinking? - It generally was when he complained he was ill, or that he laid by from his work for three or four days, or a week.</p>
               <p>What did you take his character to be as to good nature and humanity? - I never saw any thing hurtful, or of bad disposition in him, and I have been a great deal in his company.</p>

               <p>Was you acquainted with his wife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On what terms did they seem to live? - Very agreeably.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You have not been in his company since he failed, as when he was in his prosperity? - I have not been in his company much these two years, only a little while before this happened.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing in his behaviour then? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, the prisoner at the bar stands indicted for a crime of a most enormous nature, that of the murder of his own wife, by stabbing her with a pen-knife: the enquiry has necessarily gone into a very considerable length, not only on account of the discussion that was necessary to establish a fact against the prisoner, but also on account of the particular nature of his defence.</p>

               <p>Upon the result of the whole evidence, it seems to be a fact of which there can be no reasonable doubt that this poor woman received her death by the hands of the prisoner at the bar, and that it was done under no circumstances which could in any degree, in point of law, operate either to justify or mitigate the fact; so that if any crime can be imputed to the prisoner, in respect to that fact, it must necessarily be the crime of wilful murder; because there is nothing in the case which could in any degree provoke, or justify a man being provoked, to commit such an outrage as this was, in the deliberate manner in which it appears to be committed; and therefore it was truly stated to you by the Counsel that opened the prosecution, that it would ultimately come to the question, whether the prisoner was guilty of murder, or of no crime at all; and in order to lay a foundation for you to believe that he was guilty of no crime at all, you must be satisfied, at the time this fact was committed, his mind was in such a state of distraction, that he could no longer be sensible of the internal distinction between right and wrong, and more especially the distinction between the affection that was due to an affectionate wife, and this savage outrage he committed upon her; and that though his hand was guilty, his heart was free from that act which the guilt of his hand would otherwise impute to him. Upon the whole result of the evidence, in which there is no contradiction, it seems to be most clearly ascertained, that this man is in no confirmed habit or state of lunacy; that he is by no means like an idiot, but has sufficient sense to govern himself, and to be answerable for his conduct; that generally speaking, he has been in possession of his right mind, and that if there be any foundation to excuse him from the guilt of this homicide, in consequence of his being insane at the time, it is the ground of an insanity, temporary in its nature, which arose in consequence of a particular circumstance taking effect only during a particular period, and that at this moment, for any thing you learn to the contrary, and at a very short time before the fact was committed, this man was perfectly in the possession of his senses; and this thing is that which makes this enquiry so extremely<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260103"></xptr> serious, because it would be a dreadful circumstance, if the bare enormity of the offence was to be suggested as a foundation to excuse the man who could be wicked enough to commit it; and the possibility of the man who meditated a crime of this kind, forming a plan which might lay a ground of excuse, makes this sort of enquiry, in which you can have very little assistance from any thing that was done at any series of time previous to the fact, and still less satisfaction with respect to the conduct of the prisoner since the fact; it is on this account an enquiry, far more serious than those enquiries are which end in insanity; for in those cases it has generally come out, that the party is in a state of habitual insanity which would justify his being delivered into an actual state of confinement; now, from the present case, I see nothing that we can draw any conclusion of that nature from. This is a man who has seen better days; married a woman, who was something older than himself, with some final provision made for her, and they had lived no ne degree of respect for some time, having apprentices and servants; but by degrees, probably, I should think from the general scope of the evidence in consequences of intemperance, having neglected his business, and ruined his health, he comes from the prison of Ludgate to these lodgings, living with his wife in a considerable degree of distress and poverty, but at the same time with a reasonable proportion of affection and regard; the circumstances of the fact which appears to have been committed, are certainly such circumstances as cannot easily be accounted for on any other grounds, than grounds of insanity. It is not true, that the Jury ought to find the insanity of such a person sufficiently established; it ought to awaken the attention of every body to look out for such a case, and to expect to see it proved, and to view carefully, and with great caution, all these circumstances attending the state of the fact; not withstanding there wants in the evidence any thing that looks like a probable foundation that looks like ill will; for there is not a centilla of evidence, except the man's going up stairs, and expressing some displeasure at his supper not being ready, in which they cannot, on being cross examined, express the words of the displeasure, or whether he was out of humour or no; and beyond that, the fact itself is committed in a manner that was immediately open to observation and detection; the man seemed industriously to call in witnesses to see the fact committed; having in that extraordinary manner committed the fact, with frequent opportunities, (for they did not know the extent of the mischief) with frequent opportunities to get off; he makes use of none of them, but goes about in that state in which he is described, running backwards and forwards where the fact was committed, and where the woman lay languishing, and to the last moment he seems to have no thought or idea of getting away, or escaping the hands of justice. These are circumstances that belong to the fact, in their own nature so extraordinary, as to lay every considerable ground of probability that that would turn out to be a case of lunacy; and when you come to examine the rest of the circumstances, it appears that there is the strongest ground to believe that is the case. This man appears to have been five or six years ago on a journey to Lynn and Cambridge, with Mr. Sharp; to have first, as I can collect, betrayed some degree of a mind disturbed in consequence of a nervous complaint that was then upon him; Mr. Sharp has satisfactorily proved that, and the proof of it is confirmed by the last witness Mr. Sanders, who tells you, that the prisoner came to a public house which he described, and there discovered marks of what the witness calls light headiness, talking wildly of a black hog, and of seeing three people that were moving the window curtain, and were making mouths at him, and insulting him, when in truth no such thing passed; these were certain marks of a mind agitated by a certain degree of lunacy; and you find, that the week before this accident happened this man was again ill of a nervous<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260104"></xptr> aguish complaint; he had been confined to his bed several days, and it was not till Thursday night, having been in bed three whole days, and part of a fourth, that he broke out into the unhappy outrage that produced this enquiry. You find he had pork for supper too; and though in the houses of persons that are better judges of what is to be done with sick people, one should hardly expect to find a supper of roast pork for such a man, yet these lower people think that eating and drinking is the only thing for a fever, and the moment they can be prevailed upon to eat, they are well; and therefore I do not at all wonder that the first idea was a hot supper; this supper was had, except a single circumstance mentioned by one of the witnesses of his expressing some dissatisfaction that it was not done to his time; this supper was had in great good humour, he inviting two of his neighbours to sup with him; he had drank one glass of gin, or anniseed, before; he drank some beer at his supper; he eat a meat supper; he had been ill of a nervous complaint for some days, and it is not at all improbable that this had slown to his brain, and had produced a considerable degree of delirium; for in a short time after they had been in bed, he first of all calls out, makes a noise and alarm, expresses a great uneasiness, thinks there are gipsies in the bed, and people in his room; that there are men in his bed, and then proceeds to the idea of some man being in bed with his wife; the people he calls in find there is no man there, no ground at all for this alarm of his; they compose him, they succeed; he returns to his bed again; the alarm is soon raised again, and the wife is alarmed by the state of her husband; they both call out to the family to come in; they come in, they find this man sitting in his breeches and stockings, and probably shoes, and in his shirt by his bed-side; Mrs. Evans enquires what's the matter; he talks of there being gipsies in the room; and then draws his knife, unclasps it without any circumstance of secresy, and with great deliberation thrusts the mortal wound, and with an evident design, I think, to stab some person who appeared to him at that time to be the proper object of his resentment, after he had done this, and made another stroke at this poor woman, which made the blood flow, and Mrs. Evans desiring to have the knife, he gave her the knife, made no attempt to rush out, but stood there with a stupid kind of look, probably full of the idea that seemed to have impressed his mind, that it was somebody else he attacked; you find, after this he is still uneasy, discontented, lays down in another bed with his wife for a moment; then he goes up stairs, talks to the apprentice about his being at the Spread Eagle; an idea which you see afterwards is drawn out into some form in his mind; for afterwards he says he has been at the Spread Eagle, and there he was tried for the death of a man he had killed, and was to have ribbons on his acquittal. Now, unless you can see reason on this evidence to collect that all this was fraud, and all made up for the purpose of having an opportunity, in a way that would not expose him to personal risk, to destroy his wife, this is plain and evident insanity. I have looked to see if there was any thing in the evidence, from whence so deep and so abominable a practice could be suspected of him; and here the general course of life you have heard of the man, of his inoffensive manners, and of his gentle conduct towards his wife, come to be material; for it is almost impossible that a man would deliberately form a scheme of destroying his wife, and conduct it both before, at, and after the act, with that astonishing regularity with which this madness of his seems to be managed. Therefore, if you should not see reason on this representation, to entertain any considerable degree of doubt of the state in which this man was, I think I need not go further and state the whole evidence; I confess, my own mind is satisfied with respect to it; therefore, if you should be of the same opinion, I think that public justice will be satisfied, if after this long enquiry, on the ground of a temporary insanity, which this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260105"></xptr> man had laboured under for four or five days before this fact, you think that this man is not guilty of the crime imputed to him in this indictment.</p>

               <p>Court. Oh, if you wish to go out, I must state the evidence to you; because if you do not feel it at once in the way in which I have stated it, it is fit I should state the whole evidence to you.</p>

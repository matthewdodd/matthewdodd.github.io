                  </hi>. I live at No. 67, Eagle-street, Holborn, and am a French polisher; the prisoner is my wife. On Friday week I was with her at a public house—there was no one in particular with us; there were several persons there—we had three quarterns of gin between three of us—the other person was a woman; I cannot say her name—that other woman had one glass, I and my wife had the rest—we drank in our turns—I do not think my wife drank more than I did, or that I drank more than her—we went to the public house about 8 o'clock, and left it between 11 and 12 o'clock—we both</p>

               <p>went straight home—there had been no quarrelling or words between us at the public house—when we got home, my wife began quarrelling with me; it was about a jealous feeling, I think—it was about w—s, or something of that description—I cannot remember the words that she said—she took a knife, and said she would do for me, or some words of that kind; I cannot tell what words she said before she took the knife, there was such a multitude of them—this quarrelling did not go on many minutes before she took the knife from a small table, and she made a <hi rend="italic">chop</hi> at me with it—I guarded it off with my hand, and begged her to be quiet—the knife made a cut on my hand—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pointing to it</hi>); it bled—I begged her to be quiet; and said, "See what you have done," and I showed her the cut in my hand, which was bleeding—she was then standing in the room—I cannot say whether she had the knife in her hand then, or whether she took it up afterwards—she then became quiet for about ten minutes or more; but before that, before she had used the knife, a woman came in from the adjoining room, and begged her to be quiet—I cannot say who that woman was; they bad only been in the house one day—I do not know that she is here—she went back into her own room again before the prisoner took the knife—after I bad shown my hand to the prisoner, and she had been quiet about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, I laid down on the side of the bed with my clothes on—I had not done anything to the prisoner; I had not laid my hand on her—I did not say anything to her beside what I hare now told; I only wished her to be quiet—I was lying on the bed, closing my eyes and going to sleep, when I felt a stab in my eye—I rose up on my arm and halloed out—I saw the prisoner; she ran out of the room screaming, and I saw a knife in her hand, and as she went out she said, "I have stabbed him? I have stabbed him?"—I still lay on the bed, and hallooed out and knocked with my feet en the floor till the policeman came—I was afterwards taken to the hospital, and was there from Saturday morning till Thursday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon, at Gray's-inn-lane Hospital. The last witness was brought there about 2 o'clock in the morning of the 19th—I examined him; he had a wound through the right upper eyelid, dividing the whole lid and wounding the outside of the eyeball, a small cut on the nose, one cut on the lip, and two cuts on the right hand—the wound on the eye was severe, and it was dangerous—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted by this knife if it were used with violence—it does not appear to be a sharp knife—the wound on the face was very slight; the wound on the lip was more severe—he is not likely to lose his sight—the wounds on the nose and lip were in such a direction that I think they could have been inflicted at the same time with the wound in the eye, by withdrawing the knife.</p>

I went up to the second floor front room—I found the prosecutor lying on the bed, and the prisoner sitting in a chair by the side of the bed; she had this knife in her hand—one of the lodgers in the house came for me; I do not know his name, he is not here—when I got in the room the prisoner said to me, "I have done it! I have done it! take him to some hospital"—she did not appear to be intoxicated; she appeared to be rather excited—she was sitting on a chair, and when she said, "I have done it! I have done it! take him to some hospital," she rose up, and said, "I will go with you"—she seemed rather excited; there were no tears—I took the knife out of her hand, and took her to the station, after I had sent one of the other lodgers for another constable—I remained in the cell with the prisoner till 3 o'clock; Robert Adams, another constable who stops at the station, was in the cell part of the time—while I was in the cell, the prisoner said, "If I get out, I shall soon be here again"—she then said, "I will <hi rend="italic">pay him out</hi> for putting me in this cold place all night; "that was between 4 and 5 o'clock, when she had been there an hour and a half.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Joseph Brandeis, a sugar<lb></lb>refiner, at Stratford-le-Bow. The prisoner was employed on his premises, as a carpenter, for about three weeks—on 5th Nov., about 12 o'clock, Mr. Lambert called him into the counting-house, as he was leaving to go to dinner—Mr. Lambert asked him, in my presence, what he had there, and he took this piece of sugar out of his pocket, saying it was only a little piece of sugar—when the policeman came he searched him—here is about three-quarters of a pound of sugar—it is worth about 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a few nails, a pencil, and some little articles, were found on the prisoner—after the officer had searched the carpenter's shop, he produced another piece of sugar, which corresponded with the sugar which the prisoner had—when the prisoner pro<lb></lb>duced the piece of sugar from his pocket, he said, "I hope you will let me off this time; I have never been in trouble before."</p>

HORRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this the first time you have ever told anybody that he said that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think I mentioned that before; I am quite sure it took place—our sugar is not all like this—these other pieces were not found on the prisoner—we have a German carpenter working on the premises—we have a large quantity of sugar on the premises—the men working about there may have taken a piece of sugar to put in their beer—the German carpenter may have done it—the men are allowed sugar for their tea—we do not know that they take it for their beer—we have a number of pieces about the sugar-house—we do not spill a great deal outside the sugar-house—the prisoner came here on bail.</p>

On 5th Nov., about 12 o'clock, I was called to Mr. Brandeis's sugar-factory, at Stratford, and the prisoner was given into my custody, for stealing this piece of sugar—I took him into custody—I went to the carpenter's shop, and found a piece of sugar, about three quarters of a pound, concealed under the bench where the carpenters work—I have not got that sugar here—I searched the stable, and found about one pound and a half of sugar wrapped in a handkerchief.</p>

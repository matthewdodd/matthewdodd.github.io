I lost two 20 l. notes, and one 10 l. note; they were taken from my pocket whilst I was asleep. I saw them the evening previous before I went into the house. I never saw the prisoner before. There were two girls in the same room; the prisoner slept in the same room also. I missed my property about six o'clock the next morning. The prisoner had quitted the house, but the two girls were still in the room. I know the notes; I took them the day before, at No. 24, Lombard-street, that is the banking-house where I took them. I should not have known the numbers and dates of the notes, had I not gone to the banking-house to enquire, since they were stolen. I saw a ten-pound note, and a one-pound note, before the magistrate. The prisoner was in custody at that time. He said, he picked them up on the floor of the room where he slept. I applied to an officer, and the prisoner was taken about ten o'clock the same forenoon.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. How was this money concealed about you, was it loose or in a pocket-book - A. It was loose in my coat pocket.</p>

I immediately went to Franes's house; Franes has kept it for a number of years. In consequence of some information which I received there, I apprehended the prisoner a few hours afterwards, about ten o'clock, I found him in a public-house, drinking at the bar, and I found upon him, eight one-pound Bank of England notes, three three-shilling pieces, and some halfpence. I traced him to the houses where he had changed the notes, and all the persons are here. The prisoner was very much in liquor.</p>

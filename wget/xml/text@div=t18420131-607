                  </hi>. I am wagoner to Mr. Rayment—I came to London on the 11th of January, and received, amongst other things, twelve bales of bacon, which were in sacking—they were placed in the hind part of the wagon, and fastened with chains and ropes—I left London and arrived at the Black Horse, at Enfield, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening—I took the horses out, and at that time my wagon was safe as I brought it from London—I took a light and looked round it—the wagon was then before the door of the Black Horse—I then went into the parlour, and was there three quarters of an hour or an hour—the two prisoners were there, drinking together—Maddames went out for about ten minutes—he then came in again, then went out, and was out about the same time—he then went out again, and was out about half-an-hour—each time when he came back, he began to talk with Warner, and when he came back the last time his hands were black and greasy—I went out, and looked at the back of my wagon—I called the ostler to bring a light, and found the ropes which had fastened the tilt had been cut—the sacking which the bacon was in had been cut open—I missed some bacon—I called the landlord, and told him what I suspected—the policeman was sent for, he came and took Maddames—we asked him to look at the knife—he said he had not got it, Warner had—we asked Warner—he pulled it out, and gave it to the policeman—the knife was greasy, and a bit of the wrapper of the bacon was in the heel of it—the wagon was about six yards from the room I was in.</p>

I was called to the Black Horse—I saw the two prisoners there—I asked Warner to let me look at his knife—he pulled it out—I took it, and opened it—I saw it was very greasy—a piece of the sacking was shut in the heel of the knife—I asked Warner if it was his knife—he said it was, that he had lent it to Maddames during the day, that he dropped it on the tap-room floor, and he took it up—I took Maddames into custody.</p>

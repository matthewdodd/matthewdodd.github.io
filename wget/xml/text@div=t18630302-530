                  </hi>. I reside at 84, Blackfriars-road, and am a doctor of medicine—the writing of this letter of six pages (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the prisoner's; I am well acquainted with it—he was formerly a tutor to my sons, start twelve years ago first—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given to me by Mr. Wood—this printed paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), addressed to the "Cook at 84", I hate no doubt is the prisoner's writing—I gave him notice to leave; he did no leave voluntarily—I have since received letters from some of my patients—the prisoner bad due notice before the end of the term. (<hi rend="italic">The paper were here read—one was headed, "The brutal Sheas of Blackfriars" and contained absurd and insulting remarks upon different members of the family; the one addressed to the "Cook at</hi> 84," <hi rend="italic">was, "Beware of the bloody and brutal Sheas they robbed and murdered a poor sick man, who had worked for them for fifteen years.</hi>") There is no troth at all in those libels, that I have starved him, or prevented his employment, or anything of that kind—there is not a word of truth in any of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How long was I in your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know the precise period, fourteen or fifteen years—you performed your duties to my satisfaction the greater part of the time; not latterly, certainly not for the last year—I did not dismiss you, out of sympathy and charity; I very seldom saw you—I never cautioned you that you did not do your duty—I never saw any paper that you left on the drawing-room table—you had notice to quit a month before you went—to the best of my belief, Mrs. Shea gave you that notice.</p>

               <p>Chelsea; I received this long letter, and gave it to the prosecutor on 18th February this year—I believe Dr. Shea is a gentleman very much respected; I have no reason to suppose anything to the contrary.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, stated that the writing of the six pages of letter had afforded him great gratification, in as much as it was a truthful statement of the circumstances—that he left Dr. Shea's voluntarily—that nothing was said to him about leaving, and that they had deprived him of the means of living.</hi>

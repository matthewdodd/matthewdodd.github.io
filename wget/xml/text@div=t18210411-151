            . I live at the Naval school, Blackwall. On the 24th of March, between half-past six and seven o'clock, I had been drinking at a public-house, in Winkfield-street. I had received these notes from Grote and Prescott's, and had it all safe in my pocket-book, which was in my jacket pocket. I was the worse for liquor, but not insensible. I went into a shop for half an ounce of tobacco. Evans came in and asked me to walk up stairs with her. I went to the front room - first floor, and found Simmonds there - I staid about five minutes. Evans went below leaving us together; she said it was her sister's room, but her house was over the way. I went over into <placeName id="t18210411-151-crimeloc932">George-yard</placeName>

               <p>"He will only give me -</p>
               <p>"mentioning some sum, what I forget. I found myself in an awkward predicament - Evans said I will take it, and I gave it her - what it was I cannot say - it was either 18 d. or 2 s. I had given it to Simmonds and she gave it to Evans. Simmonds came and leant over my left shoulder or under my arm, and took my pocket-book from my pocket, and went down stairs immediately - I jumped up and followed her. Evans did not attempt to hinder me - - this was Saturday. I saw her again on Wednesday week following - they were taken in Shire-lane, Temple-bar I have not recovered my property. I am positive of their persons.</p>

I had seen two or three girls about an hour or two before. This happened about half-past six or seven o'clock. I had received the money in payment for board wages, of some of the lads on board.</p>

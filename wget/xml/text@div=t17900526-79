               <p>Court. Did you go and leave him behind, when you got the warrant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you, after he refused to go with you, go and get a warrant? - Yes; I went out first, and stopped some time; and then I went and left him at his own lodging.</p>
               <p>Was he there when you came back? - He was not there.</p>
               <p>Was there any indorsement upon the bill when he gave it you? - At the time he gave it me there was not; but after I discounted him the bill, he wrote his name, and where he lived, upon it.</p>
               <p>There was an acceptance upon it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. He is a foreigner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - Five or six months; he used my house for beer; I keep the White Lion, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>This is his real name and direction, on the bill which he gave you? - Yes; I knew where he lived.</p>

               <p>I am book-keeper to Mr. Grill. About the beginning of April, Mr. Scott came to the compting-house of Claes Gill, a merchant, in Dunster-court, Mincing-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the name on the bill? - Mess. Grills and Maracho. The witness, Mr. Scott, asked if this bill was a good one? I told him if it was meant for Mr. Grill, it was not worth one farthing; that we knew nothing at all of the drawer; and he went away seemingly very much disappointed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grill has no partner? - No; he is the Swedish consul, and lives in Dunster-court, Mincing-lane.</p>

               <p>I executed a warrant on the prisoner; and when I came to question him where the acceptor of the bill lived, he told me he was a clock-maker, in Mincing-lane; I went to Mincing-lane, and I could find no such person.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you take the prisoner with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Blackett. This is the bill that Mr. Scott brought to our house; it is not Mr. Grill's acceptance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. It does not purport to be Mr. Grill's acceptance? - No.</p>
               <p>To Freeman. I think you have retired on your fortune: are you still an officer? - I was at that time.</p>
               <p>It is since this you retired? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now you are a gentleman on your fortune: you did not ask the number where the watch-maker lived in Mincing-lane? - No; he gave me no direction of the number.</p>
               <p>And you did not take him with you? - No, for this reason: when I informed him I had been there, and could find no such person; he said he was gone to Birmingham; and so he told the magistrate.</p>
               <p>You went in all the courts? - Yes; I believe there is but one.</p>
               <p>Who did you enquire for? - For Mr. Grill, the clock-maker; that was the direction he gave me: when the prosecutor told him he had been to the Swedish consul, the prisoner said, that is not the person.</p>
               <p>Then he never pretended this was Mr. Grill, the Swedish consul? - Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>He spoke English perfectly well? - Yes, you will hear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I submit that this foreigner did not say it was Grill, but Grillo, the watch-maker.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>First my prosecutor makes a misdate in the day; he mentions my bringing the note to him the 1st of April; and I brought it to him the Easter Monday, which I believe was the 4th; and I offered him if he would take this note upon the usual discount, I would pay him what I did owe him? upon which he said, yes; and I gave him two shillings and eight-pence discount, and paid him his debt: the note I had received from Grillo and Marachot, on Good Friday; Grillo alone gave me the note for him and his company; it is only signed by him; he gave me the note in my room, in fetching his work; I am a watch-gilder and watch-case-maker; I never was at his apartments; he told me he kept a private house; and that it was next door to a sugar-baker's in Mincing-lane.</p>
               <p>Was you ever at his house? - I never was at it.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to tell the prosecutor that any body knew him? - Because he always paid me very honest.</p>
               <p>What was your reason for refusing to go and shew the house? - He told me the direction; that it was next door to a sugarbaker's: after I gave this note to Mr. Scott, he told me that that note was not good; and I knew that this Grillo had much commerce in Birmingham.</p>
               <p>But if you knew he was in Birmingham, why did you not tell him so? - He had the note two days after.</p>
               <p>But as soon as you knew he was not in town, you should have informed him of it? - Mr. Scott did make no scruple of the note at the time; I have had notes of him before, and they were always honestly paid.</p>
               <p>To Scott. Have you ever received notes from the prisoner at the bar, that have been honestly discharged? - I once received a note that was drawn on Cox in Shoe-lane; and that note was paid.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Cox, the jeweller, you mean? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him an exceeding good character.</p>

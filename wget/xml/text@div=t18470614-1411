                  </hi>. I am wife of Joseph Bayley, a printer, and live in Dunning's-alley, Bishopsgate-street. On Sunday, the 23rd of May, about four o'clock in the morning, I was in my own room, next door to the house, No. 16—I heard a noise of something falling, which appeared to come from the next house—I went down stairs, and into the passage of the next house—there was no light there—I heard Mr. Fitzgibbons, the prisoner's wife, calling for a light—I got a candle, and took it into the house—I got into the passage, and saw the deceased, peter Doyle, laying on the floor—a person who had forced the door open, was standing by him—I did not see the prisoner near him—he came out at the door as I gave the light—that was a very few minutes before I went into the passage—I saw nothing done to him—I saw a girl there—she did nothing in my presence—the deceased did not appear able to get up—I am sure he was in liquor—just before I went away. I heard him say, "I am dead man, I am a dead man!"—between ten and eleven o'clock, which was some hours after, I saw him put into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to go to the hospital.</p>

On Monday morning, the 24th of May, a few minutes before two o'clock, I came home, and heard very low talking, and a great bustle, as if things were falling about—I sleep on the first floor—I went on to Fitzgibbon's stairs, and heard peter Doyle say, "I have got you down; I will give it you now"—I am certain it was Doyle said that—the voice came from the prisoner's room—I waited, and listened, and head the prisoner say, "Mary, take him away, he is murdering me"—the room door opened and I ran away—I heard a very great noise, as if somebody had fallen, or was thrown down stairs—there are two flights of atairs—there is only a small landing on the first floor—I think he could only have fallen down one flight—it sounded to me as if he got up and then said, "Now if you will came in the yard I am the man for you"—it appeared the voice of the same man who said "I have got you down"—after that I heard a great noice in the passage, as if they were all fighting together—Mr. Fitzgibbons called out, "Mr. Bayley, give me light"—I took it to her, pushed the street door open, and saw Peter Doyle lying on the passage floor, right behind the street door—Mr. Fitzgibbons was lying by the side of him—she had hold of him round the neck, crying out, "You are hurt, you are hurt"—the prisoner was standing at the foot of the stairs, about two yards from Doyle—he was doing nothing—they were all very drunk indeed—the prisoner afterwards went to his own room—I stopped down stairs with Doyle—he said to me once or twice, "Do not touch me, I am a dead man"—he did not seem in great pain—he laid very quiet till I went to help him—I said, "Do not lay in the passage"—he said, "Do not touch me"—I afterwards took him up to Mr. Fitzgibbon's bed-room—he was put to bed there—he was quite quiet during the night—I did not sit up with him—I went down to my own room—I kept awake—now and then I heard him give a slight groan—in the morning he was removed to the hospital—I did not see or hear any blows struck by anybody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. On the 23rd of May, about half-past eleven in the morning, the deceased was brought there, suffering a great deal of pain—he appeared very faint, and complained of pain in the stomach—he died on the Tuesday evening,</p>

               <p>about seven o'clock—the day before he died he asked me what I thought of him—I told him I thought him excessively ill, and I was afraid he would not get better—he had a clergyman with him—I should say that he thought he was dying—I saw him the following morning, about half-past six o'clock, and gave him some brandy-and-water—he said it made no difference what he took, he was sure he was a dead man.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean death was caused by the general effect this had produced on his constitution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he never rallied from the time the injuries were inflicted—the inflammation had not arrived at a sufficient stage—the rupture of the bladder would necessarily have produced death—there are only one or two instances on record, I believe, where the case has been otherwise—the rupture of the bladder might have been caused by failing down stairs with the bladder in a distended state, or more likely by being knelt upon, or by pressure of any kind—I could not form an opinion one way more than the other.</p>

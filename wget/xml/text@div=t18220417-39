            . On Saturday, the 23d of March, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I received six shillings from Mr. Webb. The prisoner Leach was present. Mr. Green who was present, said he would see me out the back way, for fear I should be robbed; and Leach said he would see me frighted; so I went out with him in front. I was going home to Phillip Street, Curtain Road; Taylor, was outside the door; we all three went together to the Swan. He (Leach), asked Taylor to have some beer. We went in and had two pots of beer; we all three went in, and two or three doors off Taylor threw an old coat over me; Leach was a few yards before, and threw me down, and took the money out of my left-hand. I had 5 s. I had lent him 1 s. as we came along, as he asked me. I got up directly and cried Stop theif! I saw Leach before me but could not see Taylor; I told him I had lost my money; he said</p>
               <p>"If you run round the corner, you can catch him." Leach went on; I picked up the coat and walked on, and saw Leach at the corner of Essex-street, Kingsland Road; he said I shall stop here. I went home and told my father. I am sure Taylor robbed me. I knew him before. They were taken on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner TAYLOR. Q. Did you not give me the money. A. No, I did not see the coat till he put it over me.</p>

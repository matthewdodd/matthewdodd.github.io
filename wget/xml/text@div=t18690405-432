A note addressed to William Rumble, 361, Old Kent Road, will be sure to find me. Tours truly, William Rumble.")—On Monday the 18th, he called again, about 12 o'clock—(I had written to him appointing the 18th)—I said, "Well, I received your note, but your prophecy was not correct, I have as yet received no letter from the Admiralty"—he said "But you will in a day or two"—I said "How do you know that?"—he said "I find out through my friend"—I said "He must be pretty high up, who is he?"—he said "I cannot mention names"—I said "It is not Mr. Childers, I presume"—he said "Not very far from him, though; he is pretty high up"—I said "In the event of your receiving 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, would you keep the whole of it, or would you have to share it with any other person?"—he said "I should have to divide it with my friend"—I said "Well, as I have no official information as yet, I am not certain that your information is correct"—he said "You will see I have great in<lb></lb>fluence, and when you want your accounts passed, I shall be able to show you how to do so quickly; however, I will call again in a day or so, and let you know how things are getting on"—he called again on the 22nd—he then told me that the contract was smashed up—I had offered for all</p>

All the other tenders received have been declined. R. Duodas, Storekeeper-General of the Navy. The Registrar of Contracts")—I asked if that letter was obtained through his influence—he said "Most certainly," and that if he had not used his influence I would not hare got it—I had also tendered for the Woolwich, Chatham, Sheerness, and Devonport contracts—I asked him how it was I had not got that—he said I was much better without it; that they were great humbugs down there, and there was great difficulty in getting stuff in—he said he would let me know when I would he publicly called on to deliver any of the wood—I asked him to call on Monday—he said he was going to Staffordshire, and could not call again until Monday week—I made an appointment with him for the Monday week—on that day he came, but I 'did not see him, and he called the next day, which was the 2nd of February—I had then received three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, in a letter from inspector Clark, from Mr. Brady, the Registrar of Contracts to the Admiralty—Rumble called on the 2nd, and said I should have the papers that night—I asked if he would introduce me to his friend—he said he could not do that, but he would invite me to dinner, and I could meet him casually, in the same way as was arranged with some Birmingham firm—I asked if he would have to divide anything with another—he said, "Yes, two"—I said, "Two besides yourself?"—"No," he replied; "one besides my<lb></lb>self"—I then handed him the three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, saying he could look at them when he got out of the office—on Wednesday, the 3rd, I saw him again, and he said I could go up and sign the contract, and send in the wood as soon as I liked, and that I would get my money in four days afterwards—he added, "He was much pleased, and will give you some larger things when he knows what line you would like."</p>

Dear Sir, I am requested to inform you that you have not been instructed with reference to the above in consequence of pressure of business, I will call in the morning")—I stated that I would not undertake to say that when Rumble called he did not say, "I believe this is the first time you have contracted"—I believe he said he was in a position to render me assistance in carrying out the contract—he may have said that I should have a great deal of difficulty in carrying the contract through, and that he could help me; I have no recollection of it—if I said so before, no doubt he did say so—I believe I said in reply, "I have my agent, and I do not need your assistance"—I should think that the interview on the Monday did not last longer than five minutes—when I asked him as to the sources from Which he obtained his information I believe he said, "You must not ask me questions as to who my friends are"—on another occasion he told me he would let me know when the timber was to be delivered—I said fiat my cross-examination that, at the interview on 2nd February, I went to my safe and brought out my cash drawer, placed it on the table, and sat down opposite to him—I did not say to him, "Now, if I give that which is there, pointing to something in the cash box, I won't tell you what it is, what shall you do with it?"—I did say, "Supposing that I gave you some<lb></lb>thing, do you keep it all to yourself, or divide it with someone else," or words to that effect—he said he would divide it between two—I thereupon handed him the three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I do not recollect that they were in paper—I cannot say that they were not in an envelope—I said to him, "You can look at them when you get out"—I asked him to introduce me to his friend—he said he could not, but he would arrange to do so at a dinner—I don't think he said anything about getting up a dinner for the purpose—he very likely said on leaving the room, "If you want anything, let me know"—the value of the timber for the contract I got would be about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. delivered—the profit upon that is very doubtful, I cannot give any idea what it is going to be yet—I had no elm timber in stock at the time I tendered for the contract—I had not been advised to have an agent in this matter, I had an agent—I can't say that I was advised to have bun—I acted upon my own judgment in employing him—it is James Roberts—I believe he has been a Government contractor, but not within my knowledge—I am not aware that he has not had any contract with Government for some time—I really don't know anything about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Registrar of Contracts and Public Securities to the Admiralty—my office was at Somerset House; it has been removed now—up to 17th February the prisoner Gambier was a first-class clerk in the Storekeeper-General's Department, and occupied room No. 15—when a tender is made by a person who is desirous of contracting with the Admiralty for a naval contract, it is put into a box, which is opened in the board-room, at the time appointed, in the presence of the Storekeeper-General of the Navy and a Lord of the Admiralty—in the usual course, the lowest tender is accepted on the spot—a formal contract is then made—we call the man, or his agent, into the Board Room, and tell him his tender is accepted, and he signs a memorandum in the Board-books—I read the tender, and it is taken down as what is termed a treaty paper, end a minute is made to accept, under* the proper column—the tender is taken down on the treaty paper by one of the Lords of the Admiralty, and on a duplicate by the Storekeeper-General—I have here the treaty paper of this particular contract—that is the same kind of paper tempt to generally used for the purpose—there is a column indicating the prices at which the various persons have tendered; their lordships then consider which tender should be accepted, and when they have determined that, a minute is made under the man's name, "Accept this tender"—one twisty paper is initialed by the Lord of the Admiralty present, and the other by the Storekeeper-General—this was a special case, this was not accepted at the time—in oases where it is not practicable to accept on the spot, as for in<lb></lb>stance in this case, where the prices have to be calculated, to see which is the lowest tender, the parties are told they will be written to—when the contract is accepted, a minute goes to the Storekeeper-General, who instructs his clerk to write to the contractor, telling him of the acceptance of his tender—the minute is on this paper—the whole of the papers go to<lb></lb>gether, tender and all—those papers, in the ordinary course, would find their way into room No. 15, where Gambier was; if they weft to White-hall to be decided, they would come back to the Storekeeper-General; the register clerk would open them, and he would then take the direction of the Storekeeper-General, or his chief clerk, what to do; but Mr. Girdlestone can tell you better than I can the detail of his own of tee; it to not in my department—in this instance the various tenders were taken up to the Contract Office, for the prices to be calculated, to see which was the lowest—I have here the different tenders which were sent in—I took them up to the Contract Office; they were opened on 12th January—Mr. Maxwell's</p>

G.")—I believe those to be Mr. Gambler's initials, but Mr. Girdlestone will tell you—Mr. Gambier is the corresponding clerk—that letter would come up to him by one of the messengers from Whitehall—it would come under cover, addressed to the Storekeeper General—I imagine the record clerk would open it, but I should prefer Mr. Girdlestone telling you the details of his own office—this is the authority to me to draw the contract—this is written at Somerset House, in Mr. Gambier's office, and sent up to my room by a messenger—my clerks see it—after the matter is concluded it is all public—Mr. Dundas's office was at Somerset House—this letter was written in the office—it comes through Mr. Gambier, at least through his office; he is the chief clerk of that branch—I don't know that these are his initials, I can't speak to them—when I get this document I draw the formal contract, and summon the contractor to sign it—I did not summon Mr. Maxwell that day—I have the contract here that I drew up—I first of all put it in the hands of a clerk who has charge of that duty in my department, to write a letter to inquire into the solvency of the proposed surety—I do not send this back to Mr. Gambier to copy, I keep it as my authority—I do not send anything to Mr. Gambier after that, not till we send the formal contract to be copied—that gives instructions to the dockyards to receive the timber—I don't recollect who the clerk was who wrote that paper, I think it was Mr. Heath—it is a regular printed form, and merely has to be filled up and sent off—it was Mr. Dundas's duty to write to the contractor, announcing that his contract had been accepted—I believe Mr. Gambier would have to do that—that memorandum informs me that they have done so—that would be done before it comes to me—this memorandum informs me that a letter has been written under the direction of Mr. Gambier to the contractor, announcing that his tender has been accepted.</p>

I am a clerk in the Storekeeper-General's office, Somerset House—Mr. Gambler was, in January last, a clerk in the first class, second section, of the Storekeeper-General's office—there was one clerk above him, Mr. Girdlestone—when a tender is opened a minute is made and sent out to be acted upon—I do not know anything about the tender; I have nothing to do with it, I simply act upon the minute made—Gambier was in the first class, second department, and the tender would go to him for distribution in the first instance, in the course of busi<lb></lb>ness; he got as early information as anybody—it would go to him at once when it was accepted, and he would have to act upon it; to write a letter to the contractor—it would come to him, and he would send it to the proper clerk, a gentleman at the correspondence desk—Mr. Dixon and I were it the correspondence desk in January—this R. D. indicates that the tender is accepted; it is what we call an acquaint—this is the result of the minute, not the minute itself—the minute would go to Mr. Gambier'a office for dis<lb></lb>tribution—there are several branches of the office, and paper go to one or the other according to the nature of the business—Gambier would simply send it on to be acted upon; that is, writing a letter to the contractor—before that document there would be a minute, which would go to him; he sends the minute to the correspondence clerk, who writes the acceptance, I which is sent to the Storekeeper-General for signature; after he has signed it, it goes to the Record office, to be copied and dispatched—it ought, in the course of business, to go to Mr. Gambier again after it is signed, and he sends it on to the Record office—it is usually dispatched by post—envelopes are kept in the office, with the Admiralty stamps on them, everyone em<lb></lb>ployed in the office has them—I should not let anybody who called in carry off an envelope—I have no recollection whether this particular contract was accepted on the 27th.</p>

On 15th January I received instruc<lb></lb>tions from Mr. Brady, and communicated with Mr. Maxwell—I made an arrangement with him that Rumble was to call there on 18th January, and I went there about 12 o'clock, and saw Rumble, but he did not see me—I was in a side room, and he might have seen me if he had turned his head, but he did not—he went into an inner room, and remained there, I should think, about ten minutes—he went in and saw Mr. Maxwell, and I heard Mr. Maxwell say, "I received your note; your prophecy was not correct, I have not received a letter"—Rumble said, "But you will in a day or two"—Mr. Maxwell said, "How do you know that?"—Rumble said, "I found out from my friend"—Mr. Maxwell said, "He mutt be high in office"—Rumble said, "I cannot tell names"—Mr. Maxwell said, "It is not Mr. Childen?"—Rumble said, "Not very far from him"—Mr. Maxwell said, "Have you to share?"—Rumble said, "Yet, with my friend"—I was not in the room with them—I was in the passage, and the door was open—nobody was there but Mr. Maxwell and Rumble—I did not hear the whole conversation—I left some minutes before Rumble, thinking he was going to leave—in consequence of instructions I received, I kept a watch on Rumble—I saw him at Waterloo Station on 20th January, about 10.15 or 10.20 am, walking about the platform of the Richmond line, and about 10.30 Gambier, who I did not know before, left one of the trains which came into the station, came out at the wicket gate, and Rumble went up to him and commenced a conversation—they walked down the back stairs into York Street, and over Waterloo Bridge into Lancaster Place, and there they parted, and Gambier went into Somerset House by the entrance in Lancaster Place—I did not hear what they said, but they were in close conversation, and frequently stopped—I saw them next morning, the 21st, at the same place and time—Rumble was waiting with another person, a stranger to me at that time, but who I now know—they waited till about 10.30—Mr. Gambier arrived by the train which came into the station, and Rumble ran to speak to him, and turned to the strange gentleman and introduced him to Mr. Gambier, I only judge from the action—they then all three walked the same way in conversation for twenty or twenty-five minutes—it is a little more than half a mile—Mr. Gambier then went into Somerset House by the same entrance, and the other two went away—on 23rd February I saw them all three again at the</p>

            . I don't remember the 21st of December, but I gave the prisoner some shillings - I cannot tell what day it was, but I gave them to him between whiles - I received some money of Mr. Tisley, and some of Mr. Blackmore; the prisoner stopt me on my road home, and took it away from me against my will; I did not cry out - I did not tell my mother of it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Where was the money when he took it from you? A. In my right hand; there were a great many people passing, but I did not cry out - my mother asked me if I had any money, and I said no; but I told my sister if she would not tell mother, I would tell her, and I told her I gave the money to Roberts.</p>

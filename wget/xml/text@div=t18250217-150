               <p>BENJAMIN LANE. I work in the New Road, Holloway, for a Mr. Mortlock. On Wednesday evening last, about six o'clock, I was going along <placeName id="t18250217-150-crimeloc886">Sun Yard</placeName>

She had appointed to come there to me; but as she did not come, I then searched my pocket, and found that a sovereign and two half-crowns were gone. I then went to the watch-house, and got an officer; and on her he found a paper, which had a sovereign and 1 s. 6 d. in it; she said, that was all she had got, for she had changed the two half-crowns to buy some things with - the officer said, that would not do; he must have more - and, as we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170072"></xptr>went to the watch-house, she said, she would make up the money. I do not recollect that I had told her what I had lost; but I told the people at the watch-house. I had not drank any thing before that, but the pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you think it was wrong to go with this girl? A. Yes; I own it was. I had 1 l. 10 s. when I went to her lodging. I drank nothing that day. I found her in the house where I had left her: it is adjoining the public-house. I told her where I was going - I had dined in Dean-street, which is five or six miles from where I work. I had 5 s. left in my purse when I went to her room. I had 31 s.; and gave her a shilling.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's room, and told her he accused her of robbing him - she said she had no money but the shilling he gave her, and two shillings in the drawer. I went to search her, and when I put my hand under her arm she drew back; I said I must do my duty - she then put her hand in herself, and took out this paper, containing a sovereign, and 1 s. 6 d.; she said if he would drop the charge she would give him the money to make up the two half-crowns; that she had been to market, and bought a bit of beef.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the girl say in your hearing whether she had taken the money? A. She said she had changed the two half-crowns.</p>

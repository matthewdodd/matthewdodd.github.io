After they had called for a pot of beer, they sent out for some meat; after they had some more beer and some gin, the reckoning came to one shilling and eight-pence: when they called for their reckoning to be settled, Prosser said Basnet should pay; Basnet said he should pay: says Prosser I have no silver; says Basnet, I have none; then how shall we pay the reckoning? You must change one of these guineas: says he, I will. Basnet says to me, give the change for this guinea: Prosser starts up and says, no, Mr. Blaker shall not give change, I will give change: I gave the guinea to Prosser, and Prosser gave Basnet all shillings, except half a crown; and Basnet looks at them in his hand, and says, I think there are some here not very good, and hands two of them to me: says he, do you like those shillings for the reckoning? I said they are not good, and returned them. He turns to Prosser again, and says, the landlord will not take this money. Basnet says, here is more bad, I dare say, look at it; and he gave them to me to look at; and there was ten bad, all strait together; and then he gave me the rest of the change together, among which was two more bad shillings, and a bad half crown: says Prosser, do not make any words, give me my money back. Basnet gave it him all back, and Prosser gave me eighteen-pence in good silver for the reckoning: says I, there is two-pence more to pay, which they paid after a little dispute; a gentleman sitting by followed me, and says, Mr. Blaker, those are bad people; I sent for a constable, and told my wife to get change for half a guinea.</p>

On the 17th of December I asked the prisoner for change of half a guinea; and he gave me ten shillings and a sixpenny piece; I examined it immediately, there were two bad shillings, very bad; on my complaint, he gave me two more equally bad: I did not return the two first, I gave them to my husband, and I saw him mark them. (The four shillings produced.) Here are two with them, taken out of Prosser's pocket afterwards; six in all.</p>

               <p>I was a servant to Mr. Prosser: he keeps a chandler's shop in Newtoner's lane, Drury-lane, and for some time before this his wife was ill; she is since dead, and I took the money in the shop. I remember taking several shillings and six-pences many times in change, and my master has scolded me when he has come home, finding some of them bad. I have taken three pounds worth of silver in a day: but what could I do? my mistress was ill, and I had to attend her and the shop both. (An half crown produced.) I will swear to taking this half crown, I took it for a bushel of coal in the evening.</p>
               <p>I suppose after your master gave you such hints, you did not take so much, but was more carefull? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Counsel for the Prosecution, What sort of an half crown was that you took? - It was plain on one side, and a faint head on the other.</p>
               <p>When was it you took it? - Some time back, in January, about three weeks before my master was taken up.</p>
               <p>When did your master take it out of the till? - The morning he was taken up, he took it out with a quantity of silver.</p>
               <p>When was you first called upon to speak to this half crown? - Nobody at all has called upon me.</p>
               <p>Who told you, you should see this half crown here? - His wife that is dead and gone did.</p>
               <p>How came you to say then, nobody had spoke to you at all.</p>

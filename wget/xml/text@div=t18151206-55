            . We reside at No. 81, Watling Street. in the month of October last, we packed up some goods for Surinam. We packed up two excise trunks on the 7th. and another on the 10th. In the trunks on the 7th. were ginghams in No. 1, and shawls in No. 2. In No, 3, on the 10th there were handkerchiefs and six pieces of cot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060032"></xptr>ton cambrick. These goods were to be shipped for Surinam, in the ship Henry, Captain Mosely, and we employed Messrs. Jacklyn and Williams, as our lightermen. On the 30th of October, these goods were taken from our warehouse to Galley Quay, where I went and saw them on the 31st, in consequence of some information which was given me. They were not then in the state we sent them. The exterior matting was nailed in a very slovenly manner, and they had every appearance of having been opened. When we sent them, they were all locked, and the key of each fastened to the handle by a string, and nailed with small tacks. In consequence of this change of appearance, we opened the trunks to examine them; and found they were evidently plundered; about a third part of each were gone.</p>

On Tuesday morning the 31st of October I saw him going down the river on the upper side of Execution Dock, in a skiff of ours; he had the three trunks in question, and a tilt in that skiff. I stept into that skiff and ordered him back. I perceived the mats of one of the trunks was quite loose, in consequence I put them into another boat, and took them to Galley Quay to remain there until we sent to Mr. Wilcock. In consequence Mr. Wilcock came down, and I was present when they were reexamined.</p>

            . I am a lighterman, in the employment of Messrs Williams and Jacklyn. On the Monday the 30th of October last, I received the directions to take them to Blackwall, and ship them on board the Henry, Captain Mosley, I had two ships goods to take. The vessels on board of which they were to be shiped, were lying at Limehouse. Which is short of Blackwall, if I should have time that night; but if not time, I was to bring them back to Gally Quay. I left Galley Quay, at about half past three. I delivered the two ships goods at Limehouse, and then proceeded towards Blackwall. In consequence of something which passed between me and a person named Spendlove, he came on board me after I had passed Limehouse, he brought a chisel with him, which he said, he would have brought; that chisel was to open the trunks. As we were going along, one of trunks was opened by Spendlove; something was taken out, which he asked me to fell, saying, he thought they were silk shawls. They were some shawls and some muslins. Spendlove and I agreed to go to Gates's; but before that, we were to go to Rammages's; Rammage occupies a public house, close by the engine house, at Blackwall, close to the River; at high water, you can step from his back door into a boat. Spendlove went on shore first; he took something, the contents of the trunk with him. Spendlove came back to me, and then I went on shore. I went into Rammage's by this back door, and saw him at the bar. I went up two pair of stairs into a room, by his direction; presently Brown came up, and Rammage came up afterwards. When they were both there, twenty-nine shawls and about eight or nine pieces of muslin were produced; they were up stairs in this room; I did not see who brought them up; I brought some up; I brought shawls; Spenlove had taken muslins. I, Brown, and Rammage, looked over the things Spenlove and I had brought. Rammage said, they were rubbishing things, and were going out to the Negroes in the West Indies. I don't know whether Rammage knew me; he knew I was a lighterman. I knew Brown before; he was a <rs id="t18151206-55-deflabel311" type="occupation">rigger</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18151206-55-defend574 t18151206-55-deflabel311"></join>. Spendlove came up, and he asked Brown what he thought of them; Brown said, he did not know what to think of them; but if he had them at home, he should be a better judge. Spendlove told him to determine something about them; he said, he did not know what to determine; he had only a five pound note in his pocket, and if he wanted money, he could have that. Spendlove and I came down. Rammage left the room before we came down; he did not say any thing. We first went into a lower room; but Rammage took us into a room over head, because he said there were some mates of East Indiamen below us, and they might hear us. Mackarel, (not in custody,) was then taking care of the boat, whilst I and Spenlove were in the house. I met Mackarel in the passage of Rammages's house, as I was going up; in consequence of what he said to us, I saw the prisoner, Ridgeway; Ridgeway and Mackarel had some private conversation together, and then I and Mackarel went down again from the house to the lug-boat; we took a lighted pipe of tobacco; when we came to the back door, the lug-boat was gone; in consequence of something that had been told us, I expected that I should find it along side Mr. Nott's barge; Ridgeway and Hastings worked for Mr. Nott. The barge was about a quarter of a mile from Rammage's house. I was taken in a skift belonging to Messrs. M.Kenzie and Grey, for whom Mackarel worked. I found the lug-boat along side the empty barge; when I came on board the barge, Hastings came out of the barge cabin. I also found Spendlove and Ridgeway in the cabin of the barge; two of the trunks were in the lug-boat, and the third was in the cabin of the barge; it was taken there in my absence.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060033"></xptr>Mr. Reynolds. My Lord, I am for Hastings. Does your lordship think that my friends on the others side are entitled to give evidence of more than one felony. He has given complete evidence of one committed by the witness and him, Spenlove, who is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. I must hear the whole; because if there be two felonies, as you say, I must see whether they are connected or not.</p>
               <p>Witness, Re-examined. There was a light on the cabin, and a tilt over the cabin head, which was to prevent the light from being seen. I found one trunk in the cabin of the barge, which had been opened, and the goods were laying on the cabin seat. When the goods had been taken out, the matting was nailed over again; Ridgeway drove the tacks. That trunk was put back into my boat, and another taken out, and put into the barge. That trunk was the trunk which had been opened before; I was not in the cabin at that time. I remained out with Hastings, and was in my own boat along side; I did not hear them at work inside. Then I saw Spendlove with some pieces of dark blue paper in his hand, and he said, they were cambricks; he said, they would do very well. Then that trunk was nailed, and put back into the boat, and the third was put into the barge; it had red shawls or handkerchiefs in it. There was a man came to take away a sailing barge, to which Nott's barge was moored; that was while I was outside. Spendlove said, that he had taken shawls out, and they would do very well. After the sailing barge was moved, we made Nott's barge fast to lighter. Spendlove said, that he had made the trunks up, and had made all correct. The end of one of the trunks was uncovered, and I told Spendlove of it, in the hearing of the others; he said, I would see to that in the morning, and put some tacks in. The last trunk was opened whilst I was away with Hastings, in getting up his anchor; I was gone about a quarter of an hour, and when I came back, the trunk was replaced. Then Spendlove and Ridgeway went up with the barge. Mackarel had gone in his skiff while I was away. Hastings went up Bow Creek with a loaded barge. Spendlove and Ridgeway took the things with them. I did not see the goods after I left the cabin. I let my boat drive up with the tide, and put the tarpaulin over the three trunks. I passed Ridgeway and Spendlove off the Folly House; but did not speak to them. I came up to Galley Quay at ten minutes or a quarter before eleven. My trunks remained on board the boat all night, and in the morning, I put them into a skiff, and was going down with them, when Mr. Williams came on board me, and made me turn back. The trunks were then searched in the searcher's office; I was in the searcher's office while they were examined. Mr.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. I saw the Trinity yacht at about half past eight on the night of the 30th; they made the barge fast to a lighter which was along side the Trinity yacht; we did not hail the Trinity yacht; but a ma me on deck, and he hailed us; he said, you must not lay here' for this lighter has been laying here for two days, and we shall cut her adrift. Hastings said she was not going to lay there above a quarter of an hour, for she was going to lay astern of the vessel which was astern of the yacht to load stone in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall. It never accourred to me to rob these trunks until I saw Spendlove.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by Mr. Gurney. We could not have managed to rob the other trunks without a cabin to couceal us, and a light to see by.</p>

            . I am a lighterman. I know the prisoners Hastings and Ridgeway; Hastings was my apprentice, and the other was in my employ. On the 30th of October, they were ordered by me to go to Bow Crcek, to navigate two barges, to take a loaded one up, and bring an empty one down; the empty barge had a cabin. In going after them, I found the loaded barge in its place; but the empty barge was not in its proper place; nor were the prisoners, Hastings and Ridgeway, to be found. Afterwards I found the empty barge by the lower tier of the town of Blackwall, I saw a skiff made fast to the back door of Rammage's house; I went into Rammage's, and Ridgeway and Hastings were both in one box in the tap room. I took Hastings backwards, and asked him how the barge came to be there in the place where it was? he told me that they brought her down Bow Creek without an anchor or cable, and they were forced to fasten her to a sailing barge; as the flood time came, the sailing barge turned their barge adrift, and he had been in search of her all night, and found her by day light in the morning at Greenwich, and they could not save tide with her any higher than where I found her. I gave them orders to come to Town.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On Tuesday, the 31st of October, I went to Brown's house, in consequence of an information which I received from Flygar; he lives in Wellesley-street, Poplar. I found a piece of muslin and a handkerchief in the passage of the house; Mrs. Browne was in the passage at the time they were picked up. Browne was not at home I also found in the same bundle, a piece of blue print, and four pounds in bank notes, and also some silver. From the information of Flygar, I went to the house of Gates, and found some handkerchiefs, in two separate paper parcels. All these were at Gates's; I found them in a chest of drawers. On one of the papers is the name of Spendlove; it was so when I found it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. Gates was not at home when I found these things, and for any thing I knew to the contrary, did not know these things were in the house.</p>

Mrs. Browne brought some property, seven pieces of muslin plain, and one piece striped; I did not like to buy the striped piece, and was to give two shillings a yard for the other; she only mentioned five pieces. She was paid four pounds ten shillings; besides a deduction for six yards of blue cotton which she purchased.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews.

            . In the first place, all of these seven pieces of muslin, the fag ends of which have been torn off, are similar to some we packed up in trunk No. 1, they are exactly the same sort; I cannot say positively, but I believe they are our property, I now look at a piece of striped muslin, found in the bundle which Mrs. Browne dropped in her passage; that I can swsar to. I now look at the piece of red Turkey bandanas, commonly called red handkerchiefs; I can swear to them; I can swear they were in box 3. I next look at the things found at Gates's; one of them, an article of the same sort, I can swear by the mark, and the rest I firmly believe to be ours. I look at this piece of paper with the name of Spendlove on it; it was an envelope to a dozen shawls, and I can swear to some hand writing upon it, it is mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. My Lord, I submit here are two felonies, and I submit my learned friends must elect upon which they will go.</p>
               <p>COURT. If the first be a distant felony, there is no principal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. My Lord, I submit that it is a distinct felony, and that the property which was taken in the first instance, cannot affect Rammage, as there is no principal in that felony; and the second does not affect him at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews, &amp; Mr. Marshall, as counsels for the other receivers, submitted the same objection to the Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, submitted that it was all one transaction, and each individual acted his part of it allthough at different places, and different times.</p>
               <p>COURT. It is a matter of fact to go to the Jury. whether the transactions are distinct or not. The latter felony does not affect Rammage, nor do I think it goes to Browne, nor the other receivers.</p>

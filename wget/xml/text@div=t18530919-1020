                  </hi>. I am porter to John and Richard Longman, seal engravers, of Waterloo-place, Pall-mall; I live in the house. On Saturday night, 27th Aug., there was nobody in the house but me; I secured every fastening, and west to bed about a quarter past 10 o'clock—I slept in the attic—about half-put 2 o'clock I was alarmed by the creaking of a door—I got up, looked over the banisters, and saw a light—I put on my clothes, lighted a candle, went down one flight of stairs, and armed myself—I heard a rustling noise and footsteps—I was going down to the bottom of the house, and saw the prisoner and another man making their escape—they shut the street door after them; I found it unlocked but shut—I heard the street door open and shut, and I threw up the window, and gave an alarm—I then saw the prisoner getting up the area; he got on the coping stone, and got over, and the other one got over the gate opposite the front door—I saw them both get over the area railings—they ran towards Pall-mall—I saw a constable almost directly, and let him in, and another constable went in pursuit—I found an entry bad been made into the back kitchen; they had taken down two bars in the window, a square of glass was broken, and the window was open—the door leading from the front to the back kitchen was broken open, and also the door leading from the front kitchen—the lock of a closet in the front kitchen had been picked, and I found on the table a silver coffee pot, a pair of silver candlesticks, four silver forks, and two silver spoons, which had been locked up in the closet the night before—these are the articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they belong to Richard Longman—these five spoons (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine; they were in the closet when I went to bed—I went into the shed, and found a double skeleton key, a screw driver, a gimblet, and this wrapper (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> driver, and live at No. 9, Hudson's-terrace, Earl-street, Westminster. On Sunday night, 27th Aug., about half past two in the morning, I was walking my horse across the bottom of St. James'-street, and saw two men get over the railings of Mr. Longman's house—an alarm was given, and they ran towards Charing-cross—a policeman came up, got into my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I drove on and overtook the prisoner; the policeman took him, searched him, and put him in my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he is one of the men who got over the railings, I never lost sight of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

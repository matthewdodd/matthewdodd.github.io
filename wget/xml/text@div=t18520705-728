                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and am now lodging at 6, Ship-alley. On 29th Feb. the prisoner and I were in the brig <hi rend="italic">Sicily</hi>, which was on her voyage from Liverpool to the Spanish main—we had a few words in the forecastle, and he came across from the side of the forecastle on which he was, knocked me down, and got on my chest, and he got his two thumbs into my eye—I called out for help, and some of the men pulled him off me—when I got up he was in the middle of the forecastle—I told him it was a very unfair thing to make a treacherous blow at me like that, and if he wanted to fight to come up on deck—I got on the ladder, and asked him again to come—he would not come, but stopped at the bottom of the ladder and aggravated me as much as he could, and I kicked at him—it caught him on the side of the face, but made no particular mark—I then came on deck, and he came after me; he ran at me—I stood in my own defence, and we fought—he allowed he had had enough, and I did not strike him any more—I went down in the forecastle in ten or twelve minutes—I do not know whether he was down before me or not—I sat on a chest a few minutes, and he said to me, "You see what you have done"—I said I did not want to see, because I had settled all concerns on deck—he said, "I will catch you by-and-by"—I said, "You should have caught me at the time; I do not wish to have any more concerns with you"—he got up and said something, but what it was I cannot say, and made a rush at me—I got up in my own defence,. and he made two or three blows at me—I did not know that he had a knife at first, but when I saw it I called out to John Burns, who was present, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, he has got a knife"—with that he put the knife into me here (<hi rend="italic">at the left side</hi>)—I ran up on deck, and fell on deck, and did not know anything for seven days after—the wound is here now—I am not properly well yet, and do not expect I shall be as long as I live—I was about fourteen days off duty, and for two months I could do but very little work, and there was fourteen days deducted from my wages—I asked the prisoner if he would pay me the deduction, and I would let the case drop—he said he would not pay me a fraction—I spoke to the captain about it, and he told me to take him up directly.</p>

O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is John Burns here to-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I believe the prisoner's friends have bribed him to keep away. I heard Burns examined before the Magistrate—I only had one fight on deck before this occurred, and no blows afterwards—I challenged him on the ladder to fight—that was after he struck me in the forecastle, before we went on deck—I did not challenge him again after the fight—I kicked him in the jaw—that was before the fight—it was after the fight that he stabbed me; there were no blows struck—he was standing up when I kicked him, but I cannot say in what attitude—I never heard him complain that one of his teeth was knocked out, till the ship arrived at the St. Katherine's Docks, when I said something about the deduction of wages, and he said if I would put a tooth in his head, he would give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and if I would put two, he would give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not go to him after I kicked him, and say I would give him the same thing again—I heard Burns examined—the prisoner did come to me and show me a wound in his cheek—I told him I did not wish to have any more concerns with him—I did not tell him I would give him as much again—he showed me his face from the opposite side of the forecastle—I was sitting</p>

               <p>down when he ran at me to stab me, and I got up, knowing he was a blood<lb></lb>thirsty man—Burns came up as a witness on the prisoner's side, as he expected, but the statement was in the log-book, and he could not go against it—there was only the prisoner, and Burns, and me in the forecastle at the time this happened—the prisoner is a Frenchman—we were four months on the same voyage afterwards—I never spoke to him from the time this happened till we got into the dock.</p>

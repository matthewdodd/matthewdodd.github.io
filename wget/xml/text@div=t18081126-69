No, the child was at the door; she came in for a pint and a half of beer; I was present at the time; it was measured to her in a quart pot; she told me she was going to take the pot to No. 4 in Elim court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suffer her to take the pot - A. Yes. I asked her in what part of the house she was going to take the pot to; she told me in the next room to Mrs. Diner; she left my house, and I saw her take the pot out of the house; that was on Saturday evening she had the pot. On Sunday morning the man called for the pot, the pot was not to be found. A man came and asked me if I had lost any pots; I told him I had lost one; he told me if I would go to Hatton garden office I should see them. When I served her with the beer I served her with one pot; she had two; how she took the other I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any pots in the possession of the woman with the child in her arms - A. No; when I was interrogating Hayes they brought me the other woman with five pots upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they were all connected together - A. I do not know. I have heard they are mother and daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Hayes where she lived, and how she got her living - A. Yes; she first said that she lived in Drury lane; I wanted to know the number, I told her if she did not give an account of herself I would send her to prison. I have kept the pots ever since.</p>

            . I live at No. 23, Great Saffron hill. The publican sent for a constable to take some woman in custody on suspicion of stealing some pots; I went after him; they had got the prisoner Hayes, examining her in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman prisoner with the child - A. Yes; I stood at the street door; there was a mob round the door, I heard the young one, Cline, say, they had not found any thing upon the prisoner Hayes, they might as well let her go; the publican's son said then, there was another woman; he went to see her; I said, by her discourse I think she is a companion with her; he and I took her into the back parlour, and we took these five quart pots away from her clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say when they were charged as being companions - A. The old one said pray let my daughter go and keep me.</p>
               <p>Q. The one that she called her daughter was in possession of the pots - A. She had got her gown and apron over them.</p>

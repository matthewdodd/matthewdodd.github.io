                  </hi>. I keep the Richard Cobden beershop, at Barking. The prisoner came to lodge in my house three weeks before 1st Sept., 1855—he gave his name as George Coleman—on the night of 1st Sept. the prisoner was in my house—he did not go to bed—he went into the bedroom, as if intending to go to bed—he followed me up stairs to his bedroom, and bid me good night—a man named Gosling found the door open, and called me down, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning—that was the back door, leading to the back yard—I had fastened that door myself, on the previous night, with two bolts, one at the top, the other at the bottom—I missed a watch from the bar, after I had been down ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; and I missed another watch from the bedroom, up stairs, where I had been sleeping—it was my wife's father's watch—I might have seen it a week or a fortnight before—there was a gold ring missing, which I had seen a fortnight or three weeks before, in the looking glass drawer, in my bed-room—I also missed a shawl—there was another lodger in the house besides the prisoner—he was in a room adjoining my bedroom—that man was ill—I had heard that man in his bedroom during the night—the prisoner was gone when I came down in the morning—he did not return before I fetched him away from Woolwich, on 6th March—there was a pair of trowsers taken away, and a waistcoat—these are them—they are my property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am wife of the last witness. My husband made the house fast on the night before this happened, and I saw the prisoner go to his room—I heard him go down stairs soon after I had been in bed—I did not hear him come back, because I fell asleep—I had another lodger in the house, but he was ill—my husband went down first in the morning—I came down, and found the door open—I missed a watch from the parlour, and a clean shirt, which I had left on the table in the bar when I went to bed—I went to the bedroom, and opened the looking glass drawer—I missed my father's watch and a ring—I went to the prisoner's room, and his bed had not been slept in—that watch and ring must have been taken before I went to bed—the prisoner had been in the room before, cleaning the window—a pair of trowsers was lost, and a shawl, from the room where the prisoner slept—they were in a drawer under his bed—I found the drawer open, and these things were gone—I can identify them as belonging to my</p>

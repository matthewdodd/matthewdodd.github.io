On 22nd September I received these eight florins from the inspector and some information—on 1st October I went to the Caledonian Road Police-station and saw the prisoner; I said, "I shall take you in custody for uttering 10 counterfeit florins on 20th September to Mrs. Haydon"—he said, "I took them in change for a sovereign in a public-house bar in Seven Dials"—I said, "You know the name of the house?"—he said, "No, but I can find it"—I took him by train to Dalston, and was waiting there for a cab when he escaped from me down Hobart Street—he got over a wall and dropped down about 17 feet on to the North London Railway—I went after him and he ran along the line towards Hackney; got up an embankment and I lost him—that was a mile from where he escaped from me; I had had him in custody about half an hour—I saw him again five or six hours afterwards in Southgate Road, a mile and a half from where I lost him, and took him—his whiskers had then been shaved off—on the road to the station he said, "I am very sorry I got away."</p>

               <p>Q. What might be the value of it - A. One hundred and forty-nine pounds is the exact sum it cost me; I sent him to the Castle Inn, supposing that the Macclesfield waggon went from thence, which was not the case. The waggon not going from thence he brought it back again to my house, and laid it down in the passage while he went to the back part of the premises to enquire from whence it did go, which I understand is in Basinghall-street, and before he got back again into the passage the parcel was gone. I saw the parcel again before the Lord Mayor, and swore to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Will you favour me with the name of your partner - A. I have no partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is this passage - A. There are two entrances into my house, a private one, and the other adjoining the house, both are part of the house, and under the same roof. Before I made the alteration it was the only door by which you could enter.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290010"></xptr>Q. It is not the common entrance to your dwelling-house - A. No, it is not; it is only the entrance to my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body sleep in that part of the warehouse - A. A man sleeps in the warehouse. You go into the open air from the warehouse before you get to the dwelling-house. The passage leads into the yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. It is the lower part of the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you have made a separate door, with out going into your dwelling-house - A. Yes. It is in the parish of St. Albans, Wood-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the occupier of the whole house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Did you deliver the parcel yourself to the boy. It is not likely that I did. The parcel was laying to go to such a place. He knew his business. I suppose he took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him bring it back - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that is what you heard from somebody else - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CAROL. I am fourteen years old next October. On Saturday, April the 6th, at half past six o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner at the bar with a bag on his shoulder in Aldermanbury postern, Cripplegate; knowing him to be a bad character I stopped him and laid hold of him by the collar; he instantly shoved the bag off his shoulders, as if he would shove it upon me, and rushed out of my hands. I holloaed out stop thief, and pursued him. Two or three people attempted to stop him that broke him from running so fast. I overtook him and brought him to where he had throwed the bag. He was not out of my sight at all. I brought him back to the property, it laid in the road. I left the property and followed him about twenty or thirty yards. I took him and the bag to the sign of the White Horse, Cripplegate-buildings. I marked two letters or the bag, A. H. and left it in the care of Mr. Henshaw, that keeps the White Horse public-house. I took the prisoner to the Compter, and when I came back to take the property away Mr. Henshaw told me somebody had been after it. This is the wrapper, the Alderman desired me to give it up the silk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Did you go straight on or turn the corner when you pursued the prisoner - A. It was in Aldermanbury, all the way along.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you had no time to observe where the parcel was - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of the parcel - A. Yes, I ran after the man, but when I ran after the man I turned round and saw the parcel.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Mr. Maddick. Look at that wrapper - A. I know it to be my wrapper, which contained one hundred and forty-nine pounds weight of silk; these directions were to the wrapper; I cut the wrapper open, and saw it was my silk. The alderman gave me my silk back again, and ordered me to produce the wrapper here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

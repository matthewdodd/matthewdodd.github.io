                  </hi>. I was formely inspector of the Metropolitan Police—on the morning of 18th February, about 5 o'clock, I went with other officers to 31, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel—I opened the door by means of a latch and proceeded up stairs to the first-floor back room—the door was securely fastened—I forced it open and went into the room—I there found the prisoner sitting on the side of the bed, and the female prisoner (<hi rend="italic">See next case</hi>) in bed—I told him I had received instructions from the authorities of the Mint to look after him, he was suspected of coining—I said, "We come here to search for counterfeit coin and coining instruments"—he said, "Oh, God blew you, Sir, you will find nothing of the kind here, you may search"—at that time I saw him stooping, removing a piece of cloth, which was a substitute for a hearth-rug, by the side of the bed—(he was undressed)—I said, "What are you doing there, man?"—he replied, "Looking for ray stockings"—I went to that part, and underneath the rug which he removed, I found a piece of loose board about ten inches long and six inches wide, underneath which I found a tin box, containing five half-crowns, finished, separately wrapped in paper, eleven shillings, finished, also separately wrapped in paper, two shillings, un<lb></lb>finished, and two sixpences, all of which I believe to be counterfeit—I placed them on the table and said, "I think that this is proof positive that my in<lb></lb>formation is correct"—he said, "I am guilty, I am the only guilty one, spare my wife, she knows nothing at all about it, we made them after she went to chapel last night: I had a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> from the chapel," meaning Whitechapel, "come to assist me to turn out a few things on a Sunday night, my wife knows nothing about it, I am the guilty party"—he was then in the act of putting on his waistcoat, and I said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "Nothing, Mr. Brannan"—I searched him, and in the pocket I found this woollen bag or purse containing a franc, a good shilling, and fourpence farthing in copper—I believe the shilling has been in plaster, and that from it one of the moulds was taken—I made a further search, and under the fire<lb></lb>place there was some broken plaster which had apparently been used for moulds, some sand in a basin, a spoon, which has been produced, and all the necessary implements for making, colouring, and coating counterfeit coin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>.

You said you had a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> from the chapel to assist you, but the person you allude to I will swear has not lived in Whitechapel for these ten years—I did not disturb a man named Lidett, who lived there with his wife and child, but I have disturbed many persons there since Christmas.</p>

I went on 18'th February with Brannan and other officers to the prisoner's premises, 31, Lambeth-street—on the mantel-piece I found this piece of glass, with plaster of Paris on it—in the cupboard by the side of the fire-place I found an iron spoon with</p>

               <p>white metal adhering to it, some copper wire which had been dipped in solution, and a cup which was wet at the time, and had evidently had solution in it; that is all I found—I took the prisoner into custody—I heard him say in the room what Mr. Brannan has stated—on the road to the station he told me he was guilty, and he would go with Mr. Brannan to see what he could do with the Mint authorities to get his wife off, she knew nothing about it.</p>

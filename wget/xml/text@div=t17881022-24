               <p>When did you, as his servant, take the possession of that house? - On the Tuesday before the 12th of October, that was Tuesday, the 7th of October; I kept there that night; I came on Saturday night, and slept there that night.</p>
               <p>Were there any goods of Mr. Allman's brought into the house at that time? - Yes, there were to the amount of some hundred pounds; they were silk for waistcoats; and different kinds of men's mercery goods; I left it about nine on the Sunday morning; and I left nobody at home; I secured the house, by double locking the door that comes into the shop, and likewise the street-door, and the door that parts the shop from the passage; the street-door opens into a passage, but then there is a door out of the passage into the shop; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220034"></xptr>spent my day from home; I returned to the house, as near as I can recollect, about ten minutes before seven in the evening; the shutters of the windows were all secure; when I returned to the house, I observed the windows safe; I had uneasiness in my mind, or I should have staid supper in the city; I found the windows were safe; I put my elbow against the street-door; it was safe, but I had an idea that I heard something of rustling in the passage of the house; I went on a few yards further, and I could not be satisfied but something was amiss; I returned again to the door.</p>
               <p>Was it dark or light? - It was, to the best of my recollection, a fine night.</p>
               <p>Was the evening so far advanced as to be dark? - Why, it was dark to be sure; on my return to the door, I stood opposite, and I felt in my pocket for my keys to open it; while I was feeling in my pockets, the door opened; the situation of our passage is such, that the great wide part of the stair-case comes immediately to the opening of the door; the door opens inside; the prisoner, Messenger, must have stept up in the situation we found the passage afterwards with bundles; he must have stept up the first or second stair to have got an opportunity of coming out; upon the door opening, I saw Messenger's face close at the door; he must have been on the first or second step of the stairs leading up stairs; I was so surprized at seeing a man genteely dressed coming out of the house that I had not the opportunity of seizing him; he passed me, and run across the street; I immediately called out stop thief; and immediately the other prisoner came out in the same manner that the other had; and in attempting to follow the other out of the house, I seized him by the collar; he struggled with me; and I still kept calling out stop thief; I said to him, what business have you in that house? he replied, he was not in that house; he was then off the pavement opposite the door; we were struggling in the street; after we had struggled some time, he then struck me violently on the face; there were a number of people standing by, and I begged of them, for God's sake, to assist me in taking him.</p>
               <p>Did you secure him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time lose him from you? - No, never till he was secured; I have no sort of doubt but he was the man that came out of the house; the other man, I could not tell any thing concerning him, till they brought him up, that was, I suppose, seven or eight minutes after; I do not think it was more than that; he was brought back in the custody of Tucker and others; I knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>Was you sure of him? - I was sure of him; I said, that is the man.</p>

               <p>Are you now, upon your oath, sure that he was the man who passed out of the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt upon it? - None.</p>
               <p>What lamps are there at your door? - The lamp over the street-door comes exactly over the opening of it; and opposite, or nearly opposite is a tavern, which has two large lamps.</p>

               <p>What distance is that from your door? - Why, it is a narrow street.</p>
               <p>From the assistance of those lamps are you now able to swear positively that Messenger was the person that came out? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Were either of them searched in your presence? - No.</p>
               <p>Where had you left the goods when you went out of the shop? - They were not packed in the situation I found them in.</p>
               <p>What state did you find the inside? - On going into the house, or at least on opening the door of the house; when I found that Pocock was properly secured, I went and pulled the door to, and got some friends to assist me in searching the house.</p>
               <p>Was there a spring lock? - There was a latch which this key opened, and by pulling it to, it becomes fast; we got lights, and went over immediately to the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220035"></xptr>and opened it with this key that opens the latch, and got admittance; but we found, in pushing the door open, it was incumbered; we could not enter but one at a time; when we entered the house, we found three parcels in the passage; and the shop door was quite open, and one parcel ready packed up, which was thrown on a bed in the shop; I immediately searched round the shop to see that nobody was concealed; I searched the cellar, and went up stairs, but we found nobody in the house.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of those goods that were packed up in the different parcels? - I suppose upwards of a hundred pounds; they are here; they have been secured from that time to this; they are exactly in the same state they were found in; they were in four bags.</p>
               <p>Whose property are those things that you so found packed up? - The property of Mr.

            .</p>
               <p>Did you see the keys afterwards examined with the door? - No, I did not then, but I have afterwards; they opened the door; the bags were not Mr. Allman's property.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Sheppard.)</p>
               <p>How long have you lived with Mr. Allman? - Since the Tuesday before this.</p>
               <p>Where have you lived before? - I have lived in Milk-street, and in New-street, with Mr. Burnell, near a twelvemonth; he is in the hardware way; I lived before that, with Mr. Gray, in Milk-street; before that, I lived with Mr. Lane, in Leadenhall-street.</p>
               <p>Have not you lived with Mr. Starkey? - Yes, near a twelvemonth; I quitted that six years ago.</p>
               <p>How came you to quit his service? - I lived with him, as collecting clerk, near a twelmonth.</p>
               <p>Then tell the gentlemen of the jury for what reason you quitted his service? - I went down into the country to my friends.</p>
               <p>The reason of your quitting his service? - The reason was, that there was some little deficiency in the cash that was not made up; the cash accounts were not so correct.</p>
               <p>There was a deficiency? - Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Then he turned you out of his service? - No, sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>Did not he turn you out of his service, because there were deficiencies in your cash accounts? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not Starkey turn you out of his service, because there were deficiencies? - I never saw Mr. Starkey but once after the time I left him.</p>
               <p>Did not he turn you out of his service because you embezzled his cash? - I left his service, I imagine, for that reason, I suppose it was.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was? - It was the reason, no doubt.</p>
               <p>After having been turned out of Starkey's, where did you go to live afterwards? - With Mr. Lane, at Leadenhall-street, near a twelvemonth; he was a bookseller; I was there as shopman.</p>
               <p>Did you manage the till there? - No, I had no management at all there; I received the money sometimes; I quitted his service merely on disagreement.</p>
               <p>About what? - Why, about coming home one night rather later than usual.</p>
               <p>That was not the first time? - Yes, I believe it was the first time; I staid in his service for about a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>But were you not turned away? - I went away not disgracefully.</p>

               <p>Was you turned away? - I was: I was in Milk-street with Mr. Gray for three years.</p>
               <p>How came you to quit him? - Why, upon a disagreement.</p>
               <p>On which side did it begin; was not you turned out of his service? - I was.</p>
               <p>What was the cause of being turned out of his service? - Why, I had rather drank too much.</p>
               <p>Was there no other reason assigned, upon your oath? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220036"></xptr>Was there no other reason assigned? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there no dispute about cash accounts there? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then getting drunk was the only reason? - The only reason.</p>
               <p>Did you never live with any body in St. Martin's-street? - I never did live with any body in St. Martin's-street; I lived in St. Martin's-lane, with one Mr. Hall; I lived there eight years.</p>
               <p>How came you to quit that service before you went to Starkey's? - It is so long time ago I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Why, I believe, it is a circumstance which you cannot easily forget; was it not about a money account there? - No, it was a disagreement between Mr. Hall and me.</p>
               <p>What was the cause of this? - Through words.</p>
               <p>Did not you quarrel with him on account of monies that you had received? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>On account of any effects then? - No.</p>
               <p>Not in consequence of a dispute relative to some of his goods? - I swear not; after that I went to live with Mr. Grosvenor, in Foster-lane; I quitted him on the failure of business; after that, I went to live with Mr. Lockwood, in St. Martin's-lane; I was not turned away by him; I quitted him to take Mr. Starkey's place; I had no dispute with him at all.</p>
               <p>Did you know Mr. Allman before? - Some years.</p>
               <p>Who lived with him in the capacity you afterwards did? - He had only opened the shop on the Monday preceding; there was a young man that he had there; his name is Urry.</p>
               <p>Do you know a Mr. Lee? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Has he any concern with Mr. Allman in business? - None that I know of, nor Urry.</p>
               <p>Are you sure neither of those gentlemen are concerned with Mr. Allman in business? - I do not know that they are.</p>
               <p>You were put into this house to superintend and take care of those goods, and to manage the business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nobody lived there but yourself? - None, excepting Mr. Urry; he attends as shopman; he is to receive wages; I had the custody of the goods; I went out at nine in the morning, to Mr. Gray's, in Milk-street; I set off from there about six.</p>
               <p>This was an odd sort of prepossession of yours; you say, your mind was uneasy? - It was.</p>
               <p>Are you subject to those prepossessions? - I do not know; I was then; I mentioned it at the place where I was at.</p>
               <p>When you went out in the morning, did you lock the door, or only shut the door after you? - Yes, I locked them both.</p>
               <p>I think the first thing that occurred to you, was, you thought you heard a rustling in the passage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you knock at the door? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you walk away? - I walked away five or six yards, with an intention to go to my brother in the neighbourhood; but I immediately had an idea that I was not sufficiently easy in my mind, which made me return; my intention to go to my brother continued but very little time; then I saw the door open; I was on the same side of the way.</p>
               <p>What way did the person you took for Messenger go? - Across the street, towards Bedfordbury; I saw nobody else near the door.</p>
               <p>Did nobody pass you but Messenger? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>I think you say, you was surprized to find a person of so decent an appearance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When Messenger went out, and Pocock came out you collared him directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him? - No further than after I had laid hold of him, I asked him what business he had in the house; he said, he was not in the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220037"></xptr>Upon your oath, did not he tell you, he would go where you pleased, but that he would not be dragged and pulled about in this way; and before he struck you, he said, I will not be dragged? - I do not recollect ever hearing any such word mentioned; with my endeavouring to secure him, I might not pay attention to every thing he might say.</p>
               <p>Then you do not mean to deny that he did say so? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Messenger, in a little while was brought back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you return? - It was six o'clock when I set out; I drank coffee at Mr. Gray's; and staid from two till six; I had occasion to call to deliver a message for Mrs. Gray, and I called there; Mr. Gray wanted particularly to go out; he was going out of town; he drank tea rather sooner than usual.</p>
               <p>Then what makes you so sure that you got home between six and seven, that it might not be earlier; how are you sure that you left his house at six? - It was a fine evening.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear it was in the twilight, that the sun had actually set, and that the darkness of the night had came on? - Yes, I look upon it it was; it wanted about ten minutes to seven; the lamps were all alight.</p>
               <p>How long had you staid it the place, at which you had called for Mrs. Gray? - Not, I suppose, above five or six minutes; it was about six when I left Mrs. Gray.</p>
               <p>Having this strange prepossession that all was not right, when you got home, how came you to be satisfied with barely pushing your elbow against the door; why did not you go into the house? - I thought it was safe then, but hearing the rustling in the passage made me return.</p>
               <p>Did you push against the door so as to make a noise? - I pushed it with my elbow.</p>
               <p>Could any body hear you on the inside? - Yes, I suppose they could.</p>
               <p>Still this door opened almost immediately, and these people went out? - No, sir, it was by my going.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Every thing appeared to be right when you came back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You left one place because you drank too much? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And another because you kept too late hours; and a third, because having a great deal of money to collect, at a brewer's, there was a deficiency? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say, that was afterwards made up to Mr. Starkey? - It was.</p>
               <p>What might be the amount of it? - I cannot rightly tell; my father settled the deficiency; and so far from any differences, my father dealt with him for twenty years, and my brother deals with him now.</p>
               <p>Did you apply to Mr. Starkey for a character? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, another of the Prisoners Counsel. You did not see this till after Pocock and the other had been some little while engaged? - No.</p>

               <p>Are you sure that the lanthorn dropped from under Pocock's coat? - I am sure, I picked it up; and it was very warm; I felt it through my gloves; I supposed it had been lighted; it might be a light then for aught I knew; Pocock was secured then; I did not go home to the house at all; there was a crowd; I never saw the other prisoner till I saw him at Bow-street office; I am a shoe-manufacterer; I live in Cheshire; I was a stranger, accidentally passing by; I should have been at home but for this business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard. How many men were struggling together? - There were but two when I came up besides Pocock; they had hold of him, and they said, for God's sake, help; there were several people standing by when I came up to them; when the lanthorn fell numbers interfered.</p>
               <p>There must have been a great confusion? - No, there was nobody near, they stood at a distance, except these two that had hold of him; I went to Bow-street office next morning, to know what was become of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>You have been promised of course, a part of the reward? - I have not, and I declare to God, I would not take any reward if it was offered to me.</p>

               <p>Did you happen to be in New-street on Sunday, the 12th of October? - No, I was not; all that I know about it, is this, I was in Bedfordbury lighting my lamps; as nigh as I can tell, it was about twenty minutes, or a quarter before seven; I had only one lamp to light.</p>
               <p>Was it dark? - It was just to say dark; Oh, no! it was moon-light; the first thing that I heard as I was going out of Bedfordbury, was, I heard the cry of stop thief; that appeared to come from New-street then; I looked up Bedfordbury, and I saw a gentleman running down Bedfordbury; I was on my ladder with a light in my hand; I saw Mr. Messenger running down New-street, on the opposite side of the way to that I was upon.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else running at that time, in that direction? - Not a soul; I crossed over the way, and caught Messenger by the arm; and I said, sir, I hear stop thief, and I do insist on your stopping;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220039"></xptr>Mr. Messenger made me answer, that he was the person that called stop thief.</p>
               <p>Were you able to tell whether that was true or not? - I am very sure it was not.</p>
               <p>Did he cry stop thief? - I do not know that he did; I said, I did not know that, but I wished to detain him; Messenger, as I had him by the arms, he threw him- himself from me, and gave me a blow on the side, and knocked me down backwards; I got up again as fast as I could, and called, stop thief, stop thief, and I ran after him; there was a young man that was in a public-house, about three or four doors down, and he ran after him; I never lost sight of him till he turned the corner to go up Chandos-street; he was not a minute, nor half a minute out of my sight, only till I turned the corner; the taylor, this man that is a witness, Ross, was close by him; I saw him turning towards Round-court, in the passage that goes to Round-court; I ran immediately up to him; when I came up to him, Ross had got Messenger by the collar; and an iron crow Ross had in his hand; says Ross, I have the bird in my hand; either d - n him, or something, I said, well, let us bring him up Bedfordbury; we shall soon find what he has done; coming up Bedfordbury, we met Wilson and a number more, and the other man; and he, asked if we had got the other; we said, yes; and as soon as Wilson saw him, he said, aye, that is the man, I will swear to him; he was taken to the watch-house; I saw him searched, and there three pick-lock keys, which are to be produced, and some silver and halfpence were found upon him.</p>

               <p>Is the man you saw Ross pursuing in Chandos-street the same man that gave you the blow? - Yes, I am very sure of it; he was not out of my sight half a minute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It was some time before you got him to the watch house? - Yes, the clock struck seven when we were in the watch-house; he was searched immediately.</p>
               <p>He was some little time out of your sight, and out of the sight of every body? - No, for Ross, who stopped him, was close to him.</p>

               <p>Was there any body before Messenger, running? - No, sir, not one; he was the first man I saw run; I saw him knocked down by this man; I pursued him down the court, and took him at the end of Vine-street, which is in the court; I threw him down, and when he fell down the crow was thrown from him; (A crow produced.) I have had it ever since; I never parted with him till I got him to the watch-house; going along we met Wilson at the top of Bedfordbury; I recollect somebody saying, that was the man.</p>

(Wilson produced the true key to it) The bags are all sealed up, with the initials of my name upon them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What did you do? - A. I struggled to keep it from him as much as I could do; then he pulled me from the box, and put his knee on my throat; he kicked me on my face; I called for assistance.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon your neck - where was it, upon your neck, or upon the side of your head? - A. Upon the side of my head.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not speak any more than you know - are you quite sure the prisoner is the man? - A. I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you went directly to the engine-house, and made your complaint there? - A. I did immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any moon, you say it was a very fine night? - A. There was no moon.</p>

               <p>Q. You just now told me there was no moon? - A. I felt his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask you what you felt, I ask you whether there was any moon? - A. Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock at night was it? - A. A very few minutes before twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. This was last Saturday week? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. That is no answer to my question - when you were before the Magistrate, it does not appear that you said any thing about the man's face? - A. Oh, I knew him by his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you tell the Magistrate so? - A. I knew him by his face, and his smock-frock, and every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How came not you to acquaint the Magistrate? - A. I told him, as far as I could, the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, when you were examined by the Magistrate, did you tell him you knew the prisoner's face? - A. I knew his face very well.</p>
               <p>Q. That is no answer to the question; why did you not tell the Magistrate so; I have got your examination before me, you did not say a word about the prisoner's face then, only of having felt his hand and he wanted two fingers, why did you not tell Mr. Storey so, that you knew the prisoner's face as you have been telling me now? - A. I know it well.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask you what you know, why did not you tell Mr. Storey? - A. I am telling the truth before God and man.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you what reason you had to know him - did you see the prisoner's face so as to know his face? - A. I did, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell Mr. Storey that you saw the man's face, or any thing like it; I want to know how it is that you came to mend your evidence now; state when it was that you felt his fingers were missing? - A. I felt his fingers were missing when he took hold of me first in the watch-box.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you feel it with? - A. I felt it with my hands, and saw it too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the place where they were wanting; this is further too, did you feel it with your hand, or on the side of your throat? - A. I felt it with my hand and on my throat, I felt it every way; he never spoke a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you could see the place where the fingers were wanting? - A. Yes, I could see and feel them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that at the time you were pulled out of the box, whoever it was that pulled you out, that you saw that that man wanted two of his fingers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you light enough to see that? - A. Yes, I always felt it.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask you what you always felt, I ask you what you saw - Do you mean to swear, that at the time you were pulled out of the box, that you could see there were two fingers wanting on the man's hand that pulled you out of the box? - A. Yes, the moon shined.</p>

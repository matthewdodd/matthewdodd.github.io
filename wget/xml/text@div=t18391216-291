                  </hi>. I live with William James Stevenson, a linen-draper, in Ratcliff-highway. On Saturday afternoon, the 30th of November, I was called to serve the prisoners at the drapery counter—there was a great quantity of calico on the counter—they wanted to look at some satin ribbon—I said, "May I trouble you to come on the opposite side?" and from the way in which they moved from one counter to the other I suspected, they had stolen something—Cronin had a cloak on—I shewed them several pieces of ribbon, but they said they were too dear—I asked what price they wanted—they said, "About 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-yard"—Stratford was the one that spoke—they made a move at the time, and I said to Cronin, "Excuse me, Ma'am, will you allow me to look under your cloak, as I suspect you have stolen something?" and under her arm, concealed under her cloak, I found this piece of calico, which had been on the dra<lb></lb>pery counter where the prisoners stood in the first instance—I had seen it there just before they came in—they were standing quite close together—Stratford was nearest to it, but she could not have taken it without the other seeing her—they must have taken it before I came from the other part of the shop to serve them—I sent for an officer, and gave them in charge—they said nothing when I found it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called to the prosecutor's shop, and received the prisoners in custody with the calico—they were searched at the station-house—nine duplicates were found on Cronin, and a pair of scissors on Stratford, but no money on either—in going along Stratford said to Cronin, "Don't allow the police to handle you," and in taking her to the police-office next morning she asked if she was going to be sent to the Old Bailey—I said I did not know.</p>

I asked Stratford to go in with me and look at some ribbon—the calico laid on my cloak—she took it up and said, "I wonder how much this is a yard?"—the young man crossed and said, "I think you have some calico"—I said nothing, and he sent for a policeman.</p>

Cronin asked me to come in and see about some things—the calico was lying on the counter—I said, "I wonder what this is a yard?"—I gave it to her to look at, and the young man crossed the counter and said, "Excuse me, I think you have got some of my calico."</p>

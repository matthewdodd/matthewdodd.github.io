               <p>every day occurrence"—the cabin was open when I went—when I took Barker I took a key from him which he said he had had to lock the cabin—I then went to Mr. Gardner, and Martin went with me—Mr. Gardner came back with us, and I took James and Barker into custody—in the afternoon, I went to Harradine's house about half past 3 o'clock—he is a marine store dealer—I there found two ten gallon cans full of oil, and a cask holding from thirty to thirty-six gallons besides—there was very little water mixed with it, and very little dirt—I have samples from the different places—this one is from that that was in the cask at Mr. Harradine's—this is from the cans found on board the barge—this other is from the cask on board the barge—I found seventy gallons on board the barge, and fifty-two gallons at Harradine's—I went to James's house on Sunday night, and he met me at the door—I told him I wanted to see what he had got in his house—I went in, and saw Martin sitting there—he said, "Halloo! Mr. Everest, I have just come to have an understanding about this oil"—I satisfied myself that there was no oil on the premises, and I called Martin out and took him into custody.</p>

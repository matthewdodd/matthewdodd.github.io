            . The prisoner has been twelve months in my employ. On the 20th of December he had a quantity of my lead in his possession of different descriptions - whether this is part of it I cannot say; he had had it about two days - I do not know how much he had; but I gave him some of this description, and some of the same size pipe as this; I believe it to be the same; I had bought 1 cwt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there much pipe among it? A. Yes; I gave it him to take care of; I am working at the same row of buildings as Darby; what I gave him was to be melted down; I bought it in Homer-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On your oath, do you believe this to be part of what you gave him? A. I can only say I gave him lead of this description; it was of the same appearance.</p>

I am a tailor and hatter, of 5, Limehouse-causeway, St. Anne's, Limehouse; the prisoner lived with me twice as servant; first for eleven years and a-half, and there was an interval of about nine months between the first and second service; he is twenty-nine years of age—he was apprentice to me—on the evening of 16th October, I left the, house, the prisoner remained there and Samuel Hemmings my apprentice—I received information about 10 o'clock, returned as quickly as possible,</p>

               <p>and found the house on fire, both the cellar and kitchen—the cellar adjoins the kitchen—the tube that goes from the kitchen to the kitchen-stairs had been on fire, as also was the cellar and staircase; the door leading from the kitchen to the coal cellar was burnt—the whole room was blackened and scorched—the joists on which the shop-floor is placed were very much burnt—there was no fire when I left the house, only in the kitchen grate—I have had no quarrel with the prisoner—I am not in any pecuniary difficulties in particular—I have been answerable for two heavy loans, and have them to pay; but I had arranged everything for them to be paid—there was nothing that made it appear as if I had been in any difficulties; but the prisoner was quite aware of all my circumstances—he stays in the shop all day.</p>

I am apprentice to last witness—on Sunday evening, 16th October, I was left alone with the prisoner—when my master went out it was about half-past 6, I left directly after my master; the prisoner remained behind, alone in the house—there was no fire in any part of the house except in the kitchen-grate; it was a very small fire—I re<lb></lb>turned to the house soon afterwards, in consequence of receiving information as to the state of the house—I found the house totally on fire; I found no one in the house—I did not see anything of the prisoner—I got in up stairs through the window; there was an engine before the door playing; the police were there, but not inside.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector</hi>). From information I received on the night of 16th October, I went to the house of Mr. Greenaway; I got there a few minutes after 10 o'clock—I saw smoke and appearance of flame issuing from the front grating, from a cellar under the shop—there was an engine at work—I went in the house with Mr. Fogo, of the fire-brigade; the prisoner was not there then, he came in shortly afterwards; he was questioned as to the cause of the fire, he said, "I was asleep on the stairs, and I was woke up by the smell of smoke and gas, and thought there was an escape of gas, and lit a piece of brown-paper and went down stairs to find where the escape of gas was"—Fogo then asked him to point to where he was, and he felt about the ceiling of the kitchen, and after a few minutes pointed out a part of the gas pipe that had been burnt away, near the kitchen-door—Fogo did not say anything to that at that time—a few minutes afterwards I went down into the cellar, and I asked the prisoner what was the first thing he did after he found the house was actually on fire; one of the fire-brigade men was present at the time; the prisoner replied, "I went up stairs, and got my master's writing-desk"—a few minutes passed, and I referred to some wood that had been burning in the cellar, and I said to the prisoner, "What wood is this?" he replied it was wood for lighting fires; I said it was very strange, it was my duty to inquire about the matter—I then again asked the prisoner what was the first thing</p>

               <p>he did when he first found the house actually on fire, and he laid, "I went up stairs and got my own clothes; "I reminded him then that he had told me he went up stairs and got his master's desk—he made no reply to that, but appeared confused and agitated, and he said, "What is done I have done, do what you like with me"—I then toot him up in the passage, left him in charge of a constable, and sent for Mr. Greenaway—I asked in his presence, "Which is the constable that heard this man confess that he set this house on fire?" the prisoner immediately said, "I have wilfully set the house on fire, and would have done' it last Sunday night but Mr. Green-way did not leave home in time"—that was in the presence of the fireman and many persons—the prisoner was then taken to the station, and when there I reminded him of what he had said in the cellar, about the escape of gas and the writing desk, the prisoner said, "That is all false, what I have said since is true, that I have set the house on fire"—I did not at any time ask him his motive; some person in the crowd asked him his motive for doing it, and he replied, "I did it because my master was in difficulties about two loans, one for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and I believe the other was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 74<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then appeared excited and confused—he was perfectly sober—no inducement was held out to him to make that statement, to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman of the district fire brigade, living at St. Mary Axe—on the evening of 16th October, a little before 11 o'clock, I went down with an engine to Limehouse-causeway—I found No. 1 engine of the London Fire Establishment at work—I saw three, if not four, distinct fires in the house—there was no connexion between the fires—they were on two different floors—one was in the middle cellar in the basement, and one in a passage quite distinct from the cellar; the other was under the stairs leading from the passage up to the first floor—the side of the stairs; was burnt within a few feet of that; immediately over the stairs there: was a cupboard with a quantity of loose wood in it, and the outside of the door was scorched—the prisoner came in some time after I was there—I asked him if he knew the cause of the fire? he told me he did not—I said, it appeared very strange; and I asked him to go below to show me what he knew of the place—when we took him below he looked very wild, and said he smelt something—he then felt along the beam, and there was a small pipe burnt; he said he thought it was the gas—I went out to give orders, and then went in again—I saw the prisoner again—I heard him say he had done it wilfully—a person asked him what motive he had; he said it was in consequence of his master being responsible for two loans, one for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and rather than let his master's property be taken away by others, he would sooner see it burnt—I did not hear him say anything about the previous Sunday.</p>

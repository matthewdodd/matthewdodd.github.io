               <p>How do you know she whipped the watch out of your fob? - Because she went out along with me and I felt her do it, and saw her give it to another person, then I went round to several, and I could not tell who had it at last; I saw the prisoner about seven weeks after in Fleet-market, I took her into custody, I was in danger of my life at the first time, I did not know where there was an officer, tho', I have been two years in London, I am a stranger to that part.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was it before you went to any magistrate to inform him? - It was two days, we could not find her, then I saw her seven weeks after in Fleet-market, I knew her perfectly well as soon as ever I saw her, she was with two women, I laid hold of her, and sent for a constable, I am sure she is the same person.</p>
               <p>Court. What could be the reason when you was robbed, you did not take her? - I did not know where to go for a constable then.</p>
               <p>Did not you know where there was any office for the administration of Justice? - I carry out goods as a porter.</p>

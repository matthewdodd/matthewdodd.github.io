I am a member of the firm of Batten &amp; Co., 126, Lower Thames Street, wholesale grocers—I was carrying on business in 1859 at the same place—prior to 1859 the prisoner had been in my service as 'a traveller—in the early part of 1859, or the end of 1858, I called his atten<lb></lb>tion to some deficiencies in his accounts—he made some explanation to me, and for a time I was satisfied—in consequence of some communication I had with a customer I again sent for him in reference to moneys not being paid—his explanation then was not satisfactory, and I told him that I considered it my duty to prosecute him—he appealed to me on behalf of his wife and children—I was moved by that appeal, and made up my mind not to prosecute—I obtained from him a written document, of which this is a printed copy—the original has been lost—(<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi> London, March 1,</p>

I hereby acknowledge that I have, whilst in your employ as traveller, appropriated various sums of money belonging to you, amounting to upwards of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had col<lb></lb>lected on your behalf, and I hereby further acknowledge that I was not driven to commit this fraud by being inadequately paid, as I was in receipt of a salary of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and all expenses, not exceeding one guinea a day, and I hereby authorise and empower you to publish this acknowledgment of my guilt, and to use the same in any manner you may think proper so to do; at the same time I beg to acknowledge your kindness in not prosecuting out of consideration to my wife and family, Charles Nutley.")—On consent<lb></lb>ing to forego the prosecution the prisoner signed that statement—his ser<lb></lb>vice then ceased with us—some time afterwards I heard that he was spreading reports about our firm, and I had that statement printed, and sent copies to various customers—he still continued to annoy us, and in 1861 I instituted proceedings against him at the Greenwich Police Court, and he then entered into an undertaking not to molest us, which was in these terms—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I beg to express my sincere regret for the annoyance to which I have subjected you by the publication of certain scurrilous and libellous placards, letters, &amp;c., and for which you have commenced a criminal prosecution against me; I now confess that my statements in those publications reflecting on your character are entirely false and without foundation, and hereby retract and publicly apologise for the same, and I authorise you to publish this if you think proper to do so. Charles Nutley, April 1st, 1861.")—In consideration of that being given I was willing to stay any further criminal proceedings, and I did so—after that He entered the employ of Messrs. Cross &amp; Gordon—he remained' some little time there, and afterwards I was not molested for three or four years—since that time I have received, I should think, between fifty and sixty post-cards, all of a similar character to these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—before he was sum<lb></lb>moned before the Magistrate at Greenwich his house was placarded from top to bottom with documents of a similar character—these are some of the cards I received—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Sept, 1871, James and Isaac Batten, 126, Lower Thames Street, London, E.C.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 191.) About half-past three o'clock on the morning of the 7th of May I was on duty at Northalt, fourteen miles from London—I saw Allen at the prosecutor's hay-stack—he scraped up an armful of hay from the bottom cut, took it to the load which was ready for him to take to market, and pushed part of it in between the trusses—while he was doing so some one called him, and he walked away with part of it under his arm into the yard—as soon as he was gone I went and informed the prosecutor—I did not see any one else.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, residing at Northalt. I received information—I got up directly, saddled my horse, and watched Allen about a mile and a half on the road—he was my servant—the cart was to go to the Hay-market, to Mr. Sims the salesman—it was laden the night before—I allowed him a truss of hay for his horses the night before, part to be in the sack and part on the load—he had no right to go to the hayrick to take any more—I went to the Ealing station-house, and told the policeman—I after that heard that Allen was in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He had a right to a truss of hay? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—about 20lbs. was in the sack, and 34lbs. in the cart, but he had about 50lbs. in the sack the night before, and there ought to have been about 20lbs.—I saw a quantity of hay in the sack which belonged to me.</p>

I received information, and went to the Feathers public-house, at Ealing—Allen pulled up to the trough, and gave his horses some water—he then pulled out an armful of hay from a sack by the side of the cart, and put it under the horse-trough—he did not give his horses any thing to eat—he and Meacock, who is ostler there, stood talking together at the time he pulled the hay out—Allen then pulled out another lot of hay, and put that under the trough—Meacock was still standing by—Allen then drove on—I ran and took him into custody—I took him to the station-house—I went back, and saw Meacock with the hay (about 30lbs.) going across the yard—I asked what business he had with the hay—he said the farmers allowed him the hay for water.</p>

My master says I took 30lbs.; it was never weighed; it was only three handfuls I took from the cut and tucked a part in between the load, and the rest I took into the stable for my horses before I went out; it was only a bit of hay I left for the water.</p>

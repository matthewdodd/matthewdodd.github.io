                  </hi>. I am the son of John Hammond, and am in his employ. He did keep a shop at No. 170, High-street, Shadwell, on 30th of May—nobody slept in that shop; it adjoins a house kept by Mr. Joseph Purcell. You can go from Mr. Purcell's shop to ours—I fastened the door of my father's shop at half past 10 o'clock, on the night of 30th May—we were to get into the shop in the morning by going through Mr. Purcell's—I have been shown some waistcoats and other articles by the policeman, they are my father's property; they are not in the same state as when I left them—I left them in a wrapper, and at the back of the shop, when I saw them again they were in a handkerchief—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Joseph Purcell, of High-street, Shadwell—he slept there, and lived there on 30th May—the lower part of the house is divided into two shops, Mr. Purcell occupied one, the other was Mr. Hammond's clothes shop, I was there on 30th May—about half past 10 o'clock at night I thought I heard a noise, I went and opened the door of my master's shop expecting my master or mistress—I was just by the door, and I saw this boy (the prisoner) come out of the next shop and run away—I hallooed out, "Robbers, Robbers!"—some men were standing by and they ran after him—I went to the station afterwards and saw this boy there—I know him again—before I went to the station I went to Mr. Hammond's shop, and the clothes were tossed about the shop, and some were in a bundle, tied up—that bundle is here—the things were down on the floor—there is a rail for hanging clothes on, and that was lying inside the door.</p>

Q.</hi> How do you get into Mr. Hammond's shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Through our shop—I tried the door to see whether it was fast—when the roan ran out he closed the door, and the rail which the clothes used to hang on fell down—the door of Mr. Hammond's shop is close by my master's shop door; there is only just a partition between them—the man closed the door, and ran away immediately—I had no light in my hand—there is a lamp at the corner, three or four houses off—I had never seen this man before, to my recollection—when I saw him again he was alone—they told me they had caught the man—I did not leave my master's to go after him—I stood a little way from the door.</p>

Thieves!"—we ran down Fox's-lane; my brother officer ran faster than I—I went into a lodging house—I saw several persons, but I did not see the prisoner—I came to the door, and then I went in again, and saw him sitting by the fire, with his coat and hat off—I said to him, "You are the roan I have been looking for"—he said, "What for? I live here"—the landlord said, "You don't live here. I never saw you before; I thought you were running after one of the sailors"—I took him, and found his hat under the table—I found on him twopence, and some lucifers—I went to the prosecutor's shop, and found this bundle of clothes in the further part of the shop, they were moved from a lot of others—there were three waistcoats, two Guernsey frocks, and other things.</p>

               <p>Valentine. I found her again at Islington, she was stopped there, and esquire Palmer sent me a letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Valentine. He told me he took the landstaff * off her foot, and told me where I should find it.</p>
               <p>* A landstaff is a piece of wood, about three quarters of a yard in length fastened with a lock to the lower joint of the fore leg, to prevent the horse from rambling, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Wright. I never saw the prisoner till he was stopped with the mare at Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say about the mare?</p>
               <p>Wright. I was not with him then, I was about my business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at all, after the mare was missing?</p>
               <p>Wright. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Then tell the court what passed.</p>
               <p>Wright. I asked him what he had done with the landstaff, and he told me he took it off the mare's leg and threw it into the land-surrow in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say he did with the mare?</p>
               <p>Wright. That was not asked him.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose di d he take off the landstaff?</p>
               <p>Wright. In order to ride her.</p>
               <p>Q. To ride her how, or where?</p>
               <p>Wright. I did not ask him that question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body ask him in your hearing?</p>
               <p>Wright. I do not know, not I, I asked him, how far did you come, and he said from Barton, that is about 4 miles off from us.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what is become of the mare?</p>
               <p>Wright. We had her home with us from Islington,</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you?</p>
               <p>Wright. That is, Valentine and I.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he come by her?</p>
               <p>Wright. She was at an inn.</p>
               <p>Q. to Valentine. Have you got your mare again?</p>
               <p>Valentine. I have.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you by her?</p>
               <p>Valentine. She was taken up at the Angel and Crown at Islington.</p>

            . I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner at the bar to the Angel and Crown at Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent for you?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Mr. Waters and Mr. Marston, the prisoner was coming on the mare's back to Smithfield, they asked the price of her.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the mare?</p>
               <p>Parsons. She is a black one, I went with the prisoner before esquire Palmer, there he confessed he had taken her out of Bedfordshire, from a place called Bedford Houghton.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Where did you lose your mare from?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost her from Bedford Houghton fields; a place called Houghton Conquest in Bedfordshire.</p>
               <p>Q. to Parsons. How came the prisoner to be suspected?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Mr. Waters had bought the mare for four guineas at the inn, and gave him a guinea earnest, and then he gave him liberty to go and fetch two vouchers, he went and did not bring any to his liking, so he took the guinea again and stopped the mare: when before the justice he first said he stole the mare from his uncle, but at last he named the field, and said, he had her out of that; I had forgot the name of the field till I heard it now mentioned again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor by at this confession?</p>
               <p>Parsons. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did he say he had it out of your field, or name a field belonging to you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not mind, I thought he mentioned some field of his uncle's.</p>
               <p>Q. to Parsons. Are you sure he mentioned Bedford Houghton Conquest ?</p>
               <p>Parsons. He did, and he mentioned two mens names in that country, that he said had a hand in taking her, and his worship granted a warrant to take them up, and Mr. Valentine brought up a letter from a justice of the peace there to show that there were no such people living there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

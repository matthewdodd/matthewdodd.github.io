            . On the 4th of August, a little before two o'clock in the morning, I was in the parish of St. Giles, <placeName id="t18270913-54-crimeloc334">coming down towards Holborn</placeName>

I received a blow on the side of my head, which knocked me right into the kennel; a person had asked me the way to Holborn. I received the blow directly, and fell straight forward into the kennel; two more came up - (the prisoner was one of them) they pulled me on my side, tore my pocket out, and part of my shirt with it - they got 18s. 4d. out of my pocket, which was all the money I had. As I was rising up to run after them, the prisoner struck me in the eye, and knocked me against the brick wall - it cut my eye open - I was almost stunned. Jones the watchman was five or six yards off, and I told him to take charge of him directly - I never lost sight of him. I was covered with blood, and very severely used. Jones took charge of him in my presence without my losing sight of him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the man who struck you against the wall is the man the watchman laid hold of, and that he was never out of your sight till he was secured? A. He never was - there were two more engaged in it. I cannot swear he is the man who took my money, but he is the man who struck me when I was rising - He said "You have not got enough yet" - that was after my money was taken - he struck my head against the wall - I was stunned at first. I never lost sight of him all the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What charge did you give to the watchman? A. I told him to take charge of him, for he had robbed me and struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give charge of me and my wife for robbing you of your hat? A. I did not - I never saw your wife. I saw a woman run away with my hat while I was rising before he struck me - I did not charge her with any thing.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning in question, I was crying two o'clock up George-street, and just at the corner of Ivy-street, the prisoner passed me - the prosecutor called out to me to take charge of him; the prosecutor was lying with his back against the wall, and his face covered all over with blood - he had a very large cut under his right eye; he was about five or six yards from the prisoner, when he desired me to take charge of him; he said, in his presence, there were three men, that two ran away, and the prisoner stopped by; and as he recovered himself, he knocked him down where I found him - that his hat fell off, and some woman came by and took it away - he said it was some woman, but that he did not know whether it was the prisoner's wife or not - the prisoner then called two men by their names - Kelly was one I know; they came up directly, and he said to them,"Have not I been drinking beer along with you;" they both said they had been drinking beer with him - I took him to the watch-house, and the two men followed me down - when I got there, Furzeman, (the officer), said the prosecutor ought to give them in charge as well - the prosecutor said, "I cannot swear to them, but I will swear to him," and they were discharged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not standing still when he sang out watch? A. You was standing when I came up; he did not say he gave charge of you for robbing him of his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say get up, "For if he had robbed you, he would not stop here?" A. I said no such thing; I went before him and stopped him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see any blows given? A. No my Lord - I went up as he called watch as loud as he could; I was within three or four yards at the time, but just at the corner; there was nobody near him but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me touch him? A. No; I was coming down the street, and he cried out "Take charge of that man;" he was coming towards me in a direction from the prosecutor.</p>

            . I am a patrole of St. Giles. I heard the prosecutor call watch, and went instantly to him - I was standing in George-street, opposite the chapel, about thirty yards from Ivy-street, where this happened; when I got up, seeing the prosecutor bleeding, I asked him what was the matter; he said he had been knocked down by that man, whom Jones had got in his custody - they were then all three standing together - I asked the prosecutor how it happened; he said there were three of them, but he was knocked down by a young man; that one came up and asked him the way to Holborn, which he told him, and then received a blow which knocked him down; that they pulled his pocket from him, with 18s. in it, and as he was rising up, the prisoner struck him in the eye; he was bleeding very much indeed; we took him to the watch-house - he gave the same account there, exactly; as we went to the watch-house the other two men who followed us down, went before us two or three times, and said, "Was it me struck you?" he said, "No, I can swear to that man, but not to you" - and at Marlborough-street, I took him in among other prisoners, and he picked him out from five or six.</p>

I had a pint of beer at the public-house, and gave Kelly a drink out of it; as I came along I saw this man calling Watch! - I stood to see what it was about, and he said, "I give charge of that man for robbing me of my hat;" I said,"Why, here are the men I have been drinking with this moment" - I called the men, and they went to the watch-house, but they would not let them speak a word - Jones said, "If he had robbed you, he would not stop here;" he never took charge of me - I walked down to the watch-house, knowing myself innocent; this man followed me down, and charged me with robbing him of 18s.; the constable who entered the charge, said he was not sober; and at the office, I stood with four or five prisoners - I was telling them how our precious lives might be sworn away innocently; this man came in and said, "Yes, and I will make you pay for it;" he came into the office, and swore I robbed him of 18s. 3d.; the Magistrate said, "Are you sure this is man?" he said, "No, I am not, but I am sure he is the man who hit me" - I am innocent, as God is my judge; if I had been guilty, I would not have stopped like a fool, and looked at the man; the watchman can say the same.</p>

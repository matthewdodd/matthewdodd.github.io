                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 51.) On Sunday the 8th of september, about twenty minutes before ten o'clock, I was in Highgate-lane. on my beat, walking aiong, it was very dark—the prisoner came out of the hedge, and said, "Stop!"—I asked him what for—he said, "What have you got?"—I asked him what business that was of his—he said,</p>

               <p>"What you have got give to me, or I will knock you down with this stick" (holding up his stick across my face)—he held it by the thick end, and held it as if about to strike me—I drew my cutlass, struck at the stick, and knocked it out of his hand—the flat part of the cutlass fell upon his right shoulder, and knocked him backwards—I went to turn my lamp on, but found it was out—I went to the Spaniards public-house about one hundred and fifty yards distance off, and got a light, returned to the prisoner, and found him down upon the ground, where I had left him—I turned my light on, and he said, "Oh, it is a policeman, is it? had I known it was a policeman I would not have done it"—I am sure he is the same man, for I once had him in custody before—I could discer his face without a light, and knew him—he said, "I will give you all the money I have got if you will let me go"—I told him he must go with me to the station-house—I refused to take his money—I then sprung my rattle—the sergeant and three men came to assist me—I asked him to go to the station-house, he said he would not, and I and the sergeant carried him there upon the stretcher—there was a small graze upon his right shoulder—it merely grazed the skin off—I struck his stick away with the cutlass, because I thought he was going to knock me down—he was near enough to knock me down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> On Sunday afternoon, between two and there o'clock, I was on Hampstead-heath—a gentleman gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for drink—three or four soldiers came in and drank, and I paid for three or four pots of beer—at last the landlord would not let me have any more—I found it was getting dark—I was going to Highgate, and going down the lane, by Lord Mansfield's park, I leant against the railing to rest myself, and fell fast asleep—the officer came up to me, shoved his lantern against me, and sung out "Holloa! you must go to the station-house with me—I know you"—I said, "I won't go"—he collared, and dragged me—I said, "If you take me, you will be forced to carry me," and in about ten minutes of a quarter of an hour three or four policemen came and strapped me down on the stretcher, and carried me away—I own I had too much beer to drink that night, but I never struck at him—I have lost ray leg and thing and am very lame.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ for eight months—a short time since sergeant Archer called, showed me some print, and asked if I knew them—I said yes, they were my property and my partner's—I picked out a hundred and odd, which were mine—these are them—they are a great many of the damaged prints—I did not authorise the pri<lb></lb>soner in any way to take any—I have been in the trade twenty years, and never heard till last Saturday night that there was an understanding in the trade, that the men may take these first impressions.</p>

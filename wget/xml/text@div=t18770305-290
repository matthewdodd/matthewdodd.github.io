                  </hi>. I am a widow carrying on business in Regent Street as a lady's boot and shoe maker, and have done so for twenty-eight years—in 1866 I became acquainted with Mr. Jones, who acted as my solicitor—from 1866 to September, 1874, I had been in the habit of advancing money to him in bills and promissory notes—on 1st September, 1874, he came to me about the Basingstoke Canal—this book contains entries which I then made—he told me there was a good offer of the property and he and his father would form a co-partnership in it—asked him what sum he would require, and he said 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said I was to pay 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. his father 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and himself 2,000l—he was to have one-third share—the canal was to be purchased out of the Court of Chancery—I was to</p>

               <p>pay 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. pounds deposit then—he said he had already paid 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to his office in Chancery Lane, on 1st September, and paid him 495<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cheques and notes—he said he would introduce me to the manager of the London and Westminster Bank, and he sent word-to him for that purpose, but the reply was that the manager was out of town—he called on me in the evening, and I gave him the remaining 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on October 12th I signed a blank piece of paper—he said he required my signature and his father's, as it related to the Basingstoke Canal—I did not observe a stamp on it. (<hi rend="italic">The paper pro<lb></lb>duced was a bill for 5,0001., and was dated the 12th October</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">and endorsed by the prisoner</hi>.) The next payments I made to the prisoner were November 7th,50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10th, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 11th, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 12th, 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he also pledged my plate for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 9th December I paid him 120l, and in January, 1875, from 1st to the 8th, in different sums, 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 22nd, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he afterwards asked me to pay 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as my third-share of 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he said he had paid for repairs to the tunnel, which I paid him—he shewed me a memorandum of the repairs—relying on the representations he made to me I paid him the sums mentioned—I signed the agreement produced. (<hi rend="italic">This agreement was dated the 1st December, and was between Sophia Frampton, Thomas Alley Jones, and Joseph John. Alley Jones, who agreed to purchase the Basingstoke Canal for</hi> 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to be paid by Sophia Frampton</hi>, 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">by Thomas Alley Jones, and</hi> 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">by the prisoner, who was to have a third-share of the profits in consideration of his services, each party paying a third of the expenses for repairs and working of the canal, and to receive a third of the profits, or a third of the purchase-money if sold</hi>.) The prisoner's father, who is a solicitor, was present—the prisoner produced his father's cheque for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purchase of his share—on 2nd December I signed another agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This was similar to that of the 1st December, adding, should either of the parties die, the survivors should have the option of purchasing his or her share, and that balance-sheets should be prepared half-yearly</hi>.) On the 24th November, 1875, the prisoner told me he had sold the canal to Mr. Brady, of Austin Friars, for 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that Mr: Brady was going to form a company, taking 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for himself and we were to have 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, that Mr. Brady had paid' to the London and Westminster Bank 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to guarantee the carrying out of the contract, and as I had not paid all my 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he asked me for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a deposit on the guarantee—I had not the money—he said it would only be wanted for a few days—I gave him a bill for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The bill was dated 24th November</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">on the London and Westminster Bank, signed by Sophia frampton and endorsed J. Alley Jones</hi>). Belying upon his statements I gave him the bill to place as a deposit with the manager of the bank—I was to pay it off by instalments, and I paid four instalments of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner, and Mr. Edgar changed the prisoner's cheques for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and' 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the other 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I gave to the prisoner to pay into the bank on the 24th December, 1875, as he said it must be paid that day or we should lose our purchase, and it would be a great pity as the manager of the bank had introduced Mr. Brady to the transaction—afterwards Mr. Edgar spoke to me about the two cheques, and in result I paid him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as part of the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had advanced—in April, 1873, the prisoner came to me and said he wanted to finish the works of the tunnel—I then enquired about Mr. Brady and the prisoner made some vague answer, said it was sot quite settled, but he must have—the money to finish the tunnel, and asked if I would become responsible with, his father and his brother-in-law</p>

               <p>for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to—which I objected—the loan was to be obtained from the British Mutual Investment Company, of, Ludgate Hill Circus—he said his father had deposited deeds with this company as a guarantee that he had made over his own furniture and carriages to them, and that I ran not the least risk, it was merely a matter of form—I believed what he said and signed a promissory note which Mr. Martin has—I have been called upon to pay upon this document, and the prisoner has without my consent deposited deeds of mine relating to some property in Chancery—I was also sued in the Court of Bankruptcy and was obliged to liquidate—in September, 1875, the prisoner, owing me 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. independently of the Basingstoke Canal property, came to me and told me that a Mr. Potter would lend 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on some costs, but he had to release some copyhold property from the Copy-hold Commissioners for which he had to pay 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I would advance that sum the prisoner would be able to pay it me back, and also the 200l, towards the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as his clerk was present and confirmed his statement I went with the prisoner to the Bank of England and paid in 184<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6d—he had the remainder in cash in sums of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—relying upon his representations I gave him those sums.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My business is limited, but very select; I attend to it personally—I have heard that the prisoner was trying to move the Court of Queen's Bench—I have been very ill; I am not well to-day—my debts in the liquidation amounted to upwards of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had transactions with Mr. Jones, in 1866, relating to bills of exchange upon which I received interest every quarter amounting to about 10 per cent.; I can get 10 per cent, any day for my money; I do not require more—I first heard of the Basingstoke Canal in 1874—the prisoner came to me very frequently at that time and was some<lb></lb>times an annoyance to me—I never asked him to come—it was not intro<lb></lb>duced to me as a speculation, but as a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> property—we did not go into particulars, I reposed full confidence in him and in his father—I cannot remember all he said; I do not recollect his having stated that if a com<lb></lb>pany was formed the canal would be worth three or four times as much as it would cost—the agreements were read over to me—a portion of the canal was then used—I understood that if the tunnel were repaired the whole of it could be used—the prisoner told me he was going to bring forward a hill in Parliament—some part of the canal was to be used for supplying water to the Metropolis, but he did not give me the particulars—that is my signa<lb></lb>ture on the agreement produced. (<hi rend="italic">This agreement was dated 18th September</hi> 1874, <hi rend="italic">between the same parties and Charles Doims, and was an agreement to purchase the canal for</hi> 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and to pay</hi> 1,200. <hi rend="italic">deposit</hi>.) I never had a copy of that document delivered to me—I never heard Douris' name men<lb></lb>tioned, and I do not believe that is my signature, though it looks like my writing—the prisoner kept back the chief agreement, which I ought to have had—I asked the prisoner what the blank piece of paper was that I signed—he said it was a bill for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him he had had 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had only borrowed 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I felt unhappy about this bill, and he was told if he did not return it I would advertise him in every paper in London as it was a fraud and forgery—the bill was returned a few days after, it having been out of my possession for some months, and I told his father I would advertise him—I was told it was deposited with a man that sold seed, for 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am sure the bill was not all drawn except the date and my name, it was a blank piece of paper—this did not happen in July, 1874, as the transactions did not begin till November—the agreement for the</p>

               <p>purchase of the land was not put an end to—Mr. Jones brought me back the bill, and I understood he had paid 2,036<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not remember a bill discounter asking me to verify the signature—the memorandum book produced was my laundress' book; that is why some leaves are torn out—the entries are copied at the same time—I keep memoranda in a petty cash-book which I have got, but I have not kept the bits of paper from which those entries were copied—the dates 19th, 29th, and 31st October, and 6th November refer to the times when the prisoner had money for the canal—I did not say that if some other gentleman than Mr. Domis had been my trustee I should have been satisfied—I did not think him a suitable person—I doubted the prisoner in 1875, as I heard something wrong about him, and I went to his house and saw his father and himself—they did not tell me that Domis was the purchaser of the canal in trust for us all, until after I accused them of the fraud, then my confidence was all gone—I said in my deposition "I should have been satisfied if I had chosen the trustee"—the prisoner gave me the address of Mr. Brady—I have never seen this letter before. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was dated 8th December</hi>, 1875.) The prisoner did not state what the canal would realise annually, he would never give me parti<lb></lb>culars; I was always asking him; I did not expect 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from it; I should, have been satisfied with 10,000?., and I was not to receive that at once—that is my signature to that agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This agreement was dated 22nd December</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">and recited the agreements of 1st and 2nd December, and stated the terms upon which Mrs. Frampton, having given up her interest, should re-enter the partnership. It was signed by T. A. Jones, J. A. Jones, and Sophia Frampton</hi>.) The prisoner told me he was solicitor for Mr. Potter in conducting the opposition to the Hampstead Small-pox Hospital—he did not say his costs were over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Hudson sued me on a bill—I explained the matter to him, and afterwards employed him as my solicitor; I cannot state the time—he is not my solicitor now—I next went to" Mr. Emmett, a solicitor, about the bankruptcy, and he made an appointment to see the prisoner, which the prisoner never kept, and I was obliged to com<lb></lb>mence criminal proceedings, as the prisoner would not do right.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. In February, 1875, as the prisoner had caused me so much anxiety, I signed the agreement of December 6th, 1875, but there is another to counteract it, and I never relinquished my interest—I first heard of Domis about a year after he had purchased the property—I believe Mr. Domis is the prisoner's brother; he was called as a witness at the police-court.</p>

I am an auctioneer, carrying on business at 35, Cannon Street—in September, 1874, I was instructed by the prisoner to pay Mr. St. Aubyn a deposit of 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of 5,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. purchase-money for the Basinstoke Canal—I drew the cheque produced in favour of Mr. St. Aubyn on 14th September, 1874, on the London and County Bank.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I acted for Mr. St. Aubyn, who, I believe, bought the canal from a Mr. Winnie, and was the liquidator of the Canal Company, which was being wound up in the Court of Chancery—I do not know the particulars of the application to Parliament to supply London with water—Mr. St. Aubyn made a profit on the sale.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at New Wandsworth, and am a solicitor—I bought the Basingstoke Canal, from Mr. Winnie for 2,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and afterwards mortgaged it to a client of Mr. Ellis, and after that negotiated with Mr. Warren, who agreed to obtain a purchaser, and I received a 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque from the prisoner as a deposit on a price which was subsequently reduced to 4,026<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the mortgage was for about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but has since been reduced to about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are other charges to be paid—besides the 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I have</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I paid the 2,100?. into the Court of Chancery—the mortgage was subsequent; I afterwards made a cheque to secure 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Kimber and Ellis, who were to sell if they could, and if a large sum was obtained they were to have a bonus—as they could not sell it, I tried to do so to several people, and sold it ultimately, to Domis—I did some repairs, and I believe the prisoner repaired the Graywell Tunnel—the portion of the canal repaired and used for traffic made a return of about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

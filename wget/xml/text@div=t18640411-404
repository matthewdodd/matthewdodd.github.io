                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Smart of Fenchurch-street—on 2d April, shortly after 3 o'clock, I was serving in the shop with Mr. Smart and Francis Ormandy, when the prisoner came in and asked for two ounces of cannister tobacco, which came to one shilling—she tendered the lad a sovereign and Mr. Smart gave her change, a half-sovereign, three half-crowns, one shilling, and a sixpence, which he put on the glass counter by the prisoner, she having removed from one division to another—she had a child in her arms which she rested on the case while the change was being given—she then said to the other woman, "You wait, my dear, for the tobacco, and I will take the change and go on"—she then said, "Can you give me all silver?"—Mr. Smart said, "It is inconvenient on a Saturday, but I will try and oblige you"—she inquired the price of the tobacco, he said, "One shilling"—she turned round to her friend and said, "My dear, we only paid 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it the other day here"—as she said that the change was by her side, and she placed her hand over it, took up a half-crown, and replaced it with a counterfeit one—I picked it up, saw that it was bad, and said, "This is what you came in here for and not for the tobacco"—I sent the lad for an officer, and then saw that the whole of the change was on the counter as before—I marked the bad half-crown at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist of Fenchurch-street—on 2d April the prisoner came in with another woman and a child—the prisoner asked for some tobacco, and before it was delivered to her she put down a sovereign—I put the change on the glass portion of the counter, a half-sovereign, three half-crowns, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were all good—I had examined the money in the till a few minutes before, and I do not think any money had been put in since—I saw Jones go round the counter in front of the prisoner—she wished me to change the half-sovereign for silver, which I objected to do but afterwards consented—she then turned to her friend and said that she had purchased the tobacco before at a lower price—I saw her take up one coin and put down another, which Jones took away, and she immediately put down another, a good one—Jones then said that she came, not to pur<lb></lb>chase tobacco, but to ring the changes, and gave her in custody with the bad half-crown—she said, "Send to a silversmith and test it; I am quite certain it is good."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was the half-crown when Jones took it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the glass portion of the counter—it had just left her hand and he took it immediately—she took up the three and had them and the counter<lb></lb>feit one in her hand at the same time—she then laid three down, and when Jones took away the counterfeit she put down the fourth half-crown—she first put down one, then two, and within 3 or 4 seconds the fourth—the</p>

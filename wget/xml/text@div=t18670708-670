                  </hi> I live at 31, Parker Street, Drury Lane, and am a cabinet maker—about 10.30 p.m. on the 10th June I was standing at my door—I had been remonstrating with some boys who had interfered with my little girl, and as I was turning round to go in Mack seized hold of me and struck me by the side of the eye—another one struck me on the head—there were three or four of them—I was knocked down and</p>

               <p>whilst I was down they kicked me about the head and body—they broke my little finger—when I came to my senses I missed my watch and chain, and my hat—Mack is one of the chief—I have no doubt about him—Holden is very like the party that stood at my left-hand side.</p>

                  </hi> I am ten years old—on the 10th June I was with my father at the door—he was speaking to some boys—Mack came up, caught father by the coat, and beat him about the head and body—father fell, and while he was down Mack kicked him in the head—while Mack was dragging father out Holden hit him on the eye—I am sure Holden was one of the men—they all ran away—a constable was fetched, and I was taken to Cross Lane, where I pointed Mack out.</p>

About 10.30 on the 10th June I was fetched to Mr. Garrett's house—he was suffering very much, and bore traces of having been ill-used—a description of Mack was given to me by Catherine Garrett—I took her to Cross Lane, and there she pointed the prisoner out—I took Holden into custody last Sunday night, about half-past eight—a description of him was also given to me by the last witness—on Sunday night I was talking to her at her father's door, when Holden passed down the street, and she pointed him out—I told him the charge, and he said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mack's Defence.</hi> I was in a public-house, and was the worse for liquor. Holden fetched me home, and when we passed the prosecutor's door he called Holden a thief, and I, being the worse for liquor, struck him. I do not believe Holden had anything at all to do with it.</p>

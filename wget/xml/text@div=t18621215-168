Between 10 and 11 o'clock on the night of 18th November I was passing Queen-street, and saw the five prisoners come out of No. 9, the prisoner Donovan occupies No. 9—I saw Burnes carrying a wicker basket, which appeared to be very heavy, and there was something shining at the top of it like silver, and Osborn and Robson were carrying another basket—I saw them turn round, they caught tight of me, and then went into No. 10, which is also occupied by Donovan—I afterwards went to No. 10 with Sergeants Holmes and Cole, and in a cellar of that house we found two baskets full of plated articles; the baskets were of exactly the same description as those I had seen them carrying before; they were both quite full, piled up—the articles have been identified by the prosecutor—we then went to No. 9, and in the front parlour found Burnes and Donovan—I told Burnes I should take him into custody for stealing a quantity of plated goods; he said, "All right;" we then took him to the station—the houses are lodging-houses.</p>

On Saturday week, 22d Novem<lb></lb>ber, I apprehended Wilson; another man was with him—I took Wilson for loitering in Castle-street, Leicester-square, and having in his possession housebreaking implements; he had a crowbar, a screwdriver, some matches, and a piece of soap—he walked very quietly with me till we got to Jermyn-street, when he made a sudden jerk, and ran twenty or thirty yards—I took him again, and as I took him he dropped the crowbar, which I picked up, in Regent street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, E</hi> 20). On Wednesday, 3d Decem<lb></lb>ber, I met Robson in Wells-street, Oxford-street, and told him I wanted him for being concerned, with four others in custody, in breaking into Mr. Adam's shop—he said, "I don't know anything about it"—he then said, "Who are the others in custody?"—I said, "Donovan, Burke, and Seeley"—Seeley is Wilson—he said, "I don't know them; I was not with them"—I then took him to the station, in George-street—he was placed there with lots of others—Ackrill was sent for, and identified him—he then said, "I own I was with them that night when you saw me, Mr. Ackrill, but I know nothing about the robbery; this is the effect of keeping bad com<lb></lb>pany; Seeley has often wished me to go out with them, but I told them I would not; he then has called me a fool, and said I had not got nerve enough."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, E</hi> 12). On Wednesday, 19th of last month, about half-past 8, I went to the prosecutor's house, 87, Oxford-street, and examined the premises—I found a glass-case broken open in the front shop, apparently by this knife, which was found there, as it exactly fitted into the mahogany woodwork—I went down into the warehouse, and through a water-closet, and over a small area leading from the water-closet I found that some one had been down, from the fresh marks—I then went out into the street, and discovered that the iron-grating, which had been fastened down into the foot pavement, had been forced up, and the brick-work of the house forced out—that was the way accross had been obtained.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Wilson's Defence.</hi> According to the statement of Ackrill, he saw five of us come out of No. 9, and go into No. 10, when we saw him. Is it likely that we, knowing him to be a police-constable, should have left those baskets there for an hour and a half? He does not say I carried a basket.</p>

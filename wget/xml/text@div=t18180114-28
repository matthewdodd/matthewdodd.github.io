On Monday morning, December the 22d, he not coming as usual raised my suspicion; I went to his grandmother's, with whom he lived - I could not find him; I returned to my warehouse, and missed four ends of pelisse cloth. The next day his grandmother gave me a letter from him, stating that it was owing to his getting into bad company that he had done what he had. I went to Rumford on the 24th of December, and found him there - I asked him about 13l. which he said he had received from a Mrs. Burt - He said he had appropriated it to his own use. I asked him if he had taken any thing else? he said he had taken four ends of pelisse cloth, and pledged them. I asked him for the duplicates - He said he had destroyed them. - He said he pledged two at a house at the corner of Queen-street and Watling-street, and the other two in London-wall. I asked him if he had any money? he said he had 1l. and a few shillings in his trunk - I found 6l. in it, which he gave me. I told him he must go to town with me - He went to his grandmother's with me - I gave him in charge. I went to the pawnbrokers, and found two pieces at Messrs. Watson and Co.'s, in Watling-street, and the two other pieces at Purse's, in London-wall. They were my property. He had lived sixteen months with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you would not prosecute me if I made a full confession - A. I said I would not prosecute for the 13l. - the four ends are worth 36l.</p>

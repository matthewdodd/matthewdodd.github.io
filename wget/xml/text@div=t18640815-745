I am a single woman—I live at 27, Great Wild street—previous to. 28th July I was living in the same house with the prisoners—I had a child—the female prisoner had the care of it for about four months—the father of the child was in the habit of sending me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month by Post-office order—the female prisoner was aware of that—she has received it for me, and the male prisoner also—on 27th July I received the Post-office order for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as usual—on 28th I was in Clare-market with Mary Aim Green—I had not got the Post-office order then, Green had it in her pocket; she bad received it for me—we went into Princes-street—I had</p>

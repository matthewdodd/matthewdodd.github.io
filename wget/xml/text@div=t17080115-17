He was a second time Indicted upon the Coroners Inquisition, for the Murder of the said Jacob Hamson; the Evidence for the Queen, depos'd that the Deceas'd, on Sunday the 25th of October, was found in a Ditch Murder'd. That the Monday following there was information given of part of the Deceased's Watch being found in Moor Fields by the Prisoner; that making enquiry after him, he was found playing at Cards, at the Black Boy in Chisel street, and the outside Case of a Watch, with part of the Movement was found upon him, which was prov'd to be the Deceased's; the Evidence further depos'd that between 6 and 7 a Clock the Saturday Night before the Murder was discover'd, the Deceas'd went from Aldersgate with design to go cross the Farthing Pyhouse Fields, to his House at Hoxton, that he had his Watch about him then. A Porter that was going to Hoxton about 8 a Clock the same night, (near which time it was suppos'd the Fact was committed) depos'd that he heard a noise of Men coming down Stairs at the Painters, in the Farthing Pyhouse Field, and that one of them came to him and ask'd him after an unusual manner, whether he was going this way or that? that he stamp'd with his Foot, and spoke very Stern to him: this Evidence believ'd the Prisoner was the Man, but could not be positive. The Prisoner in his defence, said that he found the Watch Case and the several pieces near the Steps in Moor Fields, on Sunday Morning, and brought divers to prove that he was elsewhere the time the Fact was suppos'd to be committed, and that when he found the Watch Case, he discover'd it to his Acquaintance in a publick Alehouse.

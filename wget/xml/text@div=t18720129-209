                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi> 649). On 9th January I was with Olley in St. Martin's-le-Grand—Burgess spoke to me, and I followed the prisoner down Aldersgate Street into Goswell Road and Sutton Street, where we stopped him, and told him we were police officers, and should like to know what he had in his pocket—he said "I shan't tell you"—I said "We shall detain you, and take you back"—he said "It is part of a sewing machine"—I said "Where did you bring it from?"—he said "Where I work"—I said "Where is that?"—he said "Singer's, in Cheapside"—I said "Let me see it"—he said "No, I had rather go back to the place where I brought it from"—we turned for that purpose, and I said "I do not like to put you to unnecessary inconvenience, but if you like to show us, perhaps we may be satisfied"—he pulled out this, and said "Here they are"—I said "Had you authority to bring them away?"—he said "No, I can't say I had"—I said "What are you going to do with them?"—he said "To take them to use as a pattern to make others from"—I said "I am not satisfied;</p>

               <p>I shall have to take you back"—he said "Very well"—we started with him between us—he wrenched away from us, and ran away—he fell down, and Olley apprehended him, and took him to the station, where I charged him with unlawful possession of the articles—when the charge was read over, he said "Well, I stole it; there is no pretence for saying that I did not"—I said nothing to induce him to say that.</p>

I manage the business of the Singer Company, 147, Cheapside—Isaac Merritt Singer is one of the partners—they have also premises at Glasgow and New York—the prisoner has been in the service since November, at a guinea a week—it was his duty to do work on the premises, but none off—I directed Burgess to watch the pre<lb></lb>mises, and on the 20th January I heard that the prisoner was in custody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of our sewing machines, it is worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when complete—those two pieces consist of a number of parts screwed together—he had no authority to take them off the premises.</p>

I am foreman to the Singer Sewing Machine Company—the prisoner was a mechanic, working on the premises—if he wanted any portion of a machine he would apply by order to the shop—I went to his bench after he was taken, and found in a box under it a portion of a sewing machine covered over with emery cloth—I produce the corre<lb></lb>sponding part of the machine, making it complete—it is a new machine.</p>

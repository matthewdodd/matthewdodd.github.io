                  </hi>. I live at 9, Hay's Court, Soho—the prisoner was married to my sister, Ana Greeders, about twenty or twenty-one years ago, at Plumstead Church—I was present and saw them married, and signed the register as one of the witnesses—my sister was here yesterday—they lived together somewhere about ten years—the prisoner was in prison a month, and his wife came home to her mother's, at 204, High Street, Hoxton—when the prisoner came out of prison he wanted to come there, but I said if he came home I should go out—I have seen the prisoner many times during the ten years they have been separated—he used to come up and down the neighbourhood and annoy me—he said we had got his wife, and he had a right to be there—that lasted about four or five weeks—it was about two years ago that I last met him—I did not have any conversation with him then—I did not speak—I had not seen him for two years till lately—I think this last two years is the longest time that I had not seen anything of him—I don't know where he was living, but my sister was living at home with us—she did not see him when she was with me, but I believe she used to meet him very often.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 72, Three Colt-street, Limehouse, and am a baker—on 26th April I went to bed about a quarter past eleven—I left my house safe, locked up—on the following morning at about a quarter to 5 o'clock I was awoke by the police—I let the police in—from what they said to me, I looked about the house—I found the parlour in great confu<lb></lb>sion, and several half-burnt lucifers lying about the floors both of the shop and parlour—they had not been lying about the floor the night before—the parlour was in good order when I went to bed—I also missed some currant cake and pastry from the shop, sugar tongs from the parlour and spoons from the kitchen—I then went up stairs, and on the second floor the window opposite the staircase was unfastened—that overlooks the adjoining premises, which is the yard of a public-house—there is a grammar-school next door</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070113"></xptr>
               <p>but one—that is at the back of my place—that was all I missed till I went to the police-station, where a quantity of property, worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was shown me, which was mine, and had been in various rooms of my house—these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all mine—they were safe that night when I went to bed—there is a window at the top of my house that was closed but unfastened, when I went to bed—there were evident marks, inside and out<lb></lb>side, of somebody having been there—inside there were marks on the wall as though a person had placed his foot or toe against the wall; and outside there were some broken slates—the marks of the toe or foot were just on the skirting—I do not know the prisoner at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Does that property belong to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It does; the clothing was made at my tailor's, Mr. Smith, of Bloomsbury, where I was living at the time—my wife purchased the flannel—the house and the goods in it belong to me—I have been in possession of the house since last Christmas—it is not my own property; I rent it—the shoes belong to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you get the sugar-tongs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have had them some five or six years—they are not silver—I purchased them in Shoreditch—there is a mark inside them—I can swear to them—they were used the last thing at night.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 321). About a quarter to 4 on the morning of 27th April I found the prisoner lying down behind a sign-board on the roof of the grammar-school, the back premises of which are very near to Mr. Marsh's—he had a bundle in his hand, and I ordered him to come down; he did so, and threw me the bundle—I asked him what he did up there; he said he got up there to get out of the way—I asked him what he had in the bundle, and who it belonged to—he made no reply—I then took him into custody, and took him to the station-house—I found on him two coats, a pair of trousers, boots—he was dressed in them—the flannel was in the bundle—I also found sugar-tongs, three tea-spoons, and the coin—they were all in his pocket—the coin was loose in his pocket, and the little bag also—after searching him, I went back and found that the premises of Mr. Marsh had been entered by a window at the back I believe—there was a slate broken outside, and the marks as if the print of a man's toe or boot had been against the wall—it would be possible to get into Mr. Marsh's premises that way, over the roof of the bouse—the things I have produced to-day are the same that I took off the prisoner; I have not changed them at the station, nor anybody else.</p>

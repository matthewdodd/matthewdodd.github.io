                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Chandler, a baker, in Fleet-lane. On Wednesday evening, the 16th of June, the prisoner came and asked for a pennyworth of biscuits—I served her—she gave me a bad shilling—I told her it was bad—she said she had taken it of a gentleman at the corner, and if I would give it her she would take it back and change it—I would not let her have it—she went away, and did not return—I put it apart from all other money—Bowerman, the officer, afterwards came in—I gave him the shilling, and described the person of the woman—I saw the prisoner in custody next day—I am sure she is the woman—I had seen her many times before.</p>

On Saturday night, the 16th of April, about ten minutes past eight o'clock, I was in Southampton New-road, Tidman's-fields—I heard the slates cracking—I stood opposite for some few minutes, and saw two persons pass through the sky-light on the top of the house No. 2—I fetched another constable and a labourer to my assistance—I sent a man to No. 4, to know what business they had there—I heard some lead thrown off from the roof against the back-door, where I stood, and the prisoners came down through the rafters from floor to floor, Marrott in No. 1, and Finch in No. 2—I took Finch into custody on the rafters—I have examined the lead thrown down, with the roofs, and find it had come from the sky-light—it fitted exactly, nail-holes and every thing.</p>

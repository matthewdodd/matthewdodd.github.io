                  </hi> I live at Stratford, and work for Mr. Tanner—on the 26th of July, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner struggling with another woman—she got away from her, and jumped into the river Lea—I saw her go under water, jumped in, and took her out—I had never seen her before—I am sure she is the person.</p>

                  </hi> On the 26th of July, in the afternoon, I was with the prisoner at the Green Man—her husband came up, and I heard words pass between them directly—she upbraided him with forbidding her to see her child—they had many words, but I did not hear all—she was in a very ex<lb></lb>cited state—she had been drinking previous to coming to Stratford—her hus<lb></lb>band and her walked on towards the river, which was in his way to his mother's, where his business took him—they parted, and she said she would drown herself—I reasoned with her as long as I could, and held her as long as I was able, but she got away from me, and jumped into the water—I do not believe she was conscious of right or wrong at the time, from the state of excitement she was in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) About half-past six on this evening I went to the river and found a man had just taken the prisoner out of the water—she was very much excited, and had been drinking a little, but not so much as not to know what she was about—she was insensible for a minute or two after she was taken out—I took her to the house, her husband came to the door—I asked for admittance, he slung to the door, and said she should not come in—he came out, struck me, and told me I might take her where I liked—I got another constable, and we took her to the station in a truck.</p>

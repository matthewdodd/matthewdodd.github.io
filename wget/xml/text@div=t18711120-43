                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 45). On Sunday night, 24th October, I was on duty, in the Caledonian and Camden Roads—I passed the Hollo<lb></lb>way Congregational Chapel, which is at the corner of those two roads, about 12.30—I saw the glimmer of a light in the chapel—I waited a short time and then I saw it again—I jumped over the wall and tried the south door, opened it and went in and saw the three prisoners—they ran back in the church—I ran after them and collared Goodrich—I was then hit by Ward, with a life presever or a wooden stick, I could not say which, and Goodrich and I fell—McKenzie and Ward then dragged me into the church-yard—I called out "Come round here, here they are"—McKenzie threw his <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> at me and ran away—I got the assistance of another constable and took Goodrich to the station—I found on him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a knife, and ten keys—I went back to the church with Samuel Green—I found a bottle of aqua fortis, this centre-bit and this holland cover and towel, by the vestry door—and these wedges and the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> were afterwards picked up where McKenzie flung the the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> at me—I examined the chapel door and found marks on the inside—entrance had been gained by a window, about 10ft. from the ground—it was pulled out—the vestry door was burst open and also the door where I went in—I found the chalices in the cellar of the vestry" Which had been burst open—one of them had been used for drinking wine out of—they had been taken out of the bag—I went to Marlborough Street Police Court, last Monday week, and saw McKenzie—I indentified him as being one of the men who were in the chapel—I saw Ward in custody and identified him as one of the men.</p>

On the 7th of <hi rend="smallCaps">JUNE</hi>, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner loitering in High-street, Shadwell—I afterwards saw him wrangling with two gentlemen—I asked him to pass on, and touched him on the arm, and in doing so, I discovered something in his pocket—I asked what he had got there—he made no reply—I then put my hand into his pocket, and took out this quart pot—I asked bow he came in possession of it—he could give no account—he said he had come for a pot of beer—I took him to the sta<lb></lb>tion, and found this glass in his other pocket, with "Johnson, Ship, Execution-dock," on it—I went to Mr. Johnson, and informed him.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a draper's shop in Nile-street, Hoxton. On the 25th of March the prisoner came with another man, my young man show<lb></lb>ed them some black silk handkerchiefs, and while the other man was look<lb></lb>ing at the handkerchiefs, the prisoner put his hand into the window and took this ribbon from a box there—I asked my young man if he had taken any ribbon out of the window—I then went to the prisoner, and charged him with it—he said, if I thought he had got any ribbon, I might search him—I took this ribbon from his right-hand coat-pocket—here are eighteen yards in one piece, and the other has been out—I had seen the prisoner's hand in a position to take them—hit companion asked him how he came by them—I believe he made no answer—while I went to look for a police-man they both <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> by me—I gave an alarm, and the prisoner was taken about fifty yards from my door.</p>

I really think a sovereign ought to do, this reward that I have offered, and which I am quite willing to give;" in fact, I authorised the housekeeper to give 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if the dog was brought back—he said he could not get the dog for less than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then asked him to go down with me to Shoreditch where the dog was, as I wanted to find out about him myself; I would give him something for his trouble, and prosecute the man who had it—he said he could not go down with me to the place; he had no objection to go with the little page, a boy about fourteen or fifteen—if I would give him the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would bring me the dog back afterwards—I did not do anything more then—I told him I must consider this first; I did not know whether I could trust him with the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if he called at my office at 1 o'clock I should then decide—he came to my office at 1 o'clock—I then repeated to him that a sovereign, or two, ought to have been the sum which he should have taken and no more, and he again said he could not take less than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then gave him the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and asked him when he would bring back my dog—he said, "In an hour and a half, at half-past 2 I shall be here with the dog"—I would not have given him more than 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I could have helped it—I saw the prisoner next within two minutes of half-past 2 at my office with the dog, which was tied to one of the desks—one of my clerks had received it—I then said to the prisoner he was either the thief himself or an accomplice; that he had had six months before, and he would not get rid of me so soon as that, and the quicker he walked out of my office the better—he was rather confused, and said, "I am not the party who stole the dog or an accomplice," and he gave me a paper with the name of the man who stole the dog, as he said, but I did not take any notice of it—he went out of my office and the next morning I went before the Magistrate, a warrant was granted, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

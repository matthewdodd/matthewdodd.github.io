                  </hi> I am a plumber and gas-fitter, 102, Shoe-lane; I previously lived at No. 60, the prisoner's house. On Saturday evening, 13th Nov., I was standing at his door, and saw <hi rend="italic">Jury grimaldi</hi> pass me quickly, and go into the back counting-house, attached to the prisoner's shop—the prisoner was there, and asked Grimaldi, "Have you got them?"—he said, "Yes; here they are, all right," and he took some balls from his pocket—I know these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be them by the colour—the prisoner placed them in a drawers, in a little table with several drawers to it—I saw money pass from the prisoner to Grimaldi, he put it into his pockets and departed imme<lb></lb>diately.</p>

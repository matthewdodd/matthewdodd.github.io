A gentleman, who was behind me, sprang forward and seized the prisoner, who immediately threw my pocket-book under a cart.

            . I was standing talking to a friend in Watling-street, on the 9th of June, about thirty yards from the corner of Friday-street; I saw the prisoner, and two other suspicious looking characters on the other side of the way. I observed to my friend, that they were after no good, and I would watch them. I had scarcely made the observation, before one of them went in front of the last witness, who was walking along, and just as he came between the post and the corner, stopped short, and the other two closed up. I then saw the prisoner at the bar, thrust his hand into his pocket, and pull out the pocket-book. I immediately sprang forward, and collared him; upon which, the other two men made their escape, and the prisoner threw the pocket-book under a cart. He was taken into custody by an officer, and immediately taken before the magistrate at Guildhall.</p>

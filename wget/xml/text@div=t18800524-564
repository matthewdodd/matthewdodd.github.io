                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Bennett, living at New Barnes, in the parish of Senn, Surrey, on the Guildford and London road, about opposite to where this stack of straw of Mr. Hilder's was standing—on 19th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188005240086"></xptr>
               <p>May, about 12.40, I flaw that the stack was on fire; it was a small flare—I went towards it in a minute and saw the three prisoners at the end of the stack—they were not all three together—Algar came as if he had come in from behind me; which way he came I could not tell, it was so very quick—the other two were close against the burning stack—they each had a bit of stick in their hand—the fire had caught the straw and they were trying to put it out as it lay under their feet, but the fire came round so quick that we all had to get out of the way—that was the first thing I saw—they were not stamping on the straw, they were hitting it with the pieces of wood—I had looked at the stack about five minutes before—it was all right then—there was not a soul near it, I could not see any one, if then was they were behind me or between the hedge and the rick—I saw no one but the three prisoners when I first went across—I told them to be off, they had no business there—there is no path there, the stack was on the other side of the hedge, about 100 yards from my door—the road is between it and my house; the stack might be about half way, about 50 yards from the road—the prisoners had no business there—they did not go away when I told them to be off—I did not see them go—the foreman of the farm. and some men came soon after—the fire burnt right out—there was do means of putting it out—I should think it had been on fire two or three minutes when I first saw it—neither of the prisoners made any observation to me when I spoke to them.</p>

About 1.45 on 19th May I received information and went to this stack while it was on fire—in consequence of what I heard I went and apprehended the prisoners at Ripley—I found them there together about 3 o'clock that afternoon—I charged them with setting fire to this straw stack of Mr. Hilder's—they all replied together that they were not near the place at the time when the fire broke out, that a gentleman on a bicycle first told them of the fire, and asked them to go back and help put it out, and they went—that was all they said.</p>

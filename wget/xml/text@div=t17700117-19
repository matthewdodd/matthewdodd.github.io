On the 5th of this instant, a little after three in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our shop, and desired to look at some black silk lace; she said the same sort she had had a few days ago, at 2 s. 8 d. a yard. There were two customers in the shop. There was a drawer of black lace at the lower part of the counter; she made up to that; I went and took out three cards, and laid them down by the side of the drawer. One of the customers desired me to cut her off a yard of ribbon, saying she could not stay. I did, and at the time glancing my eye towards the drawer, I saw the prisoner make a motion with her left hand, which drew my attention. She then sat down upon a stool, and put, as I then thought, some lace under her left-hand side; I looked, and missed one of the three cards that I had put by the side of the drawer. I observed by her motion, she shoved it under her petticoats, and put it into her right-hand pocket, with her right-hand: then she got up and stood behind a lady that was looking over some double blonds; during this time, I was doing up the yard of ribbon. The lady wanted change for a guinea; I could not change it: I said it was the same, she might pay another time: she went out of the shop. Then I went up to the prisoner, and said, Is any lace here that will do? She said, I find that is gone that I had of before, and you may have more in two or three days, and I'll call again, and went out of the shop. I went out after, and took her about the midway of the window and brought her back again, and said, You have got a card of lace in your pocket. I took her in as far as the compting-house door. She took the card of lace out of her right-hand pocket, and threw it down before me, and said, There it is, let me go. I said, I cannot possibly, we must have some further conversation. I rung the bell, and my master came down. I took her into the compting-house, and asked her her name. She would not tell me, nor her place of abode. At last, she said she lived in Smithfield, and I had five children. I said, Can you send for any person of character to speak for you? She said she could not, and was rather impertinent. I sent for a constable, and took her to the Mansion-house; it was too late for an alderman there. I took her to the Compter; and before Mr. Alderman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170017"></xptr> Turner, the next day. ( The lace produced in court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember ever seeing her in your shop before?</p>

               <p>I took a piece of lace up to look at it; I happened to be a little hard of hearing; I did not understand what he said; I went to the door to look at it, and he pulled me back, and I throwed it on the ground.</p>

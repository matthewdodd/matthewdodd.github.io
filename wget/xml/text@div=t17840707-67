               <p>I am a constable, I apprehended the prisoner on the 11th of June, between twelve and one in the morning, at the corner of Bethnal-green parish, I heard a noise that I thought was the noise of horses, I drew myself up a court, and two men came along with four sheep, I suspected them to be stolen; when they passed me I walked after them, and I seized the prisoner, and asked him where he was going, the sheep were walking before him, and he following them; I asked him where he was going with them sheep, his answer was, damn your eyes, what sheep; says I, the sheep you had in custody just now.</p>
               <p>Court. Were the sheep in view when you had this conversation? - I did not see the sheep that instant, my eye was too much upon the two men.</p>
               <p>Are you very sure this man was driving the sheep? - He was not out of my fight, the sheep were walking before him, there was a word spoken from one to the other, and then a blow, damn your eyes, says they, hit them, they will run fast enough by and bye, but which of the men said so I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070098"></xptr> tell, whether it was the prisoner or the other man I cannot say.</p>
               <p>And did they hit the sheep in consequence? - There was a blow.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner or the other man any thing in his hand at that time? - I did not perceive any thing.</p>
               <p>What prevented you, darkness? - No, it was light enough; I heard the blow and the words, but which spoke the words or struck the blow I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You are very sure this is one of the two men that was driving? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not you in liquor? - I had been drinking, but I was not in liquor, it is a thing I am not addicted to, I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you present when the prosecutor first saw the sheep? - No, I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Were the sheep the prosecutor saw the sheep that that man drove? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What sort of light was it? - It was not very dark nor very light.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman, going our beat, we met with these four sheep in Brick-lane, nobody was with them at all, I ran after the sheep, I said it will be the best way to take them to the watch-house; the prisoner was there, and saying something I do not know what; I put the sheep in the church yard, the next morning they were owned.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is this Brick-lane from the place where you stopped the man? - About ten yards.</p>

               <p>I was a drinking on this night till half past twelve, at the corner of Cock-lane, the White Horse, going home a young woman was in company with me, and I went to see her home; returning home I was asking for some gin, this man followed me, and asked me if I saw any sheep, I said no; says he I will be damned if you are not a liar, for I saw them; I saw he was in liquor, and I said you are drunk, and he took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Court to Yardley. Did that man appear to be in liquor? - As much as I am now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Then he took another man and let him go: I never offered to get away; says he, you damned rascal, I should not be afraid of taking fifty such fellows as you! says he, you have no call to pitch none of your gammon to me, because you know I am up to every thing of that sort; says he, have you any money, can you call for a gallon of beer, I said I had not, says he you are a pretty fellow. Then he told me if he got the reward for the sheep that he would turn me up at the Old Bailey, and if not, he meant to take my life away. I had some witnesses yesterday, but they would not stay any longer on their own expences.</p>

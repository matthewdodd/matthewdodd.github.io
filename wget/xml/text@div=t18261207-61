On the 2d of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner was brought into the shop by Turner, the officer; I had not seen him before; I was in the shop about three o'clock, and then went into the parlour behind; I was absent five or ten minutes, but was never out of the house; my son had gone out, and I desired him to shut the door after him; it is half glass - it was quite shut, for the bell rung when it opened - I heard him shut it. I had been to the desk about half an hour before, and I left in it a wooden bowl, containing a half-crown, and another containing some halfpence; I heard the door open and the bell ring, but thinking it was my son I did not attend; I heard the handle turn round - a bell rings in the parlour when the door opens; I heard a cry of Mother! I ran into the shop, and saw Turner bring the prisoner in - my son was there. I described what money I had, and Turner produced it; I missed the half-crown and halfpence from the desk.</p>

            . On the 2d of November I went out, and shut the door after me; I fastened it, and it could not be opened without turning the hasp; I returned in about five minutes, and found the door standing open; I saw a stranger at the desk where the money is kept - I went up and asked what he wanted there; he said, "Did not you hear me knock?" I said, "What business have you at my father's desk?" and immediately called Mother! he instantly ran out of the shop; I pursued, crying Stop thief! Turner was coming out of his house - he joined in the pursuit, and he was taken, without being out of my sight; he had the desk open, but I did not see him take any thing. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I am an errand-boy. I was in South Molton-street between three and four o'clock, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I looked across the road, and when the prisoner came to the corner, by the public-house, he threw something from his hand, inside the passage of the public-house, which, from the sound, I could tell was money - I heard it jingle; I picked up, on that spot, a half-crown and some halfpence, which I gave to Turner, who then had him in custody - he is the man who threw it away.</p>

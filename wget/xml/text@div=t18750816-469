I live at 25, St. George's Place, Borough, and am a brewer's, servant—the prisoner and I worked together—I was with him on 26th July, about 10.30 in Long Lane—a band of music came up as a lodger was shifting from one house to another—we only went into one public-house, and when we came out we saw the prisoner with four men and an oldish and a youngish woman; one of whom had a jug—that is the woman (<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Ward</hi>)—I identified her before the Magistrate—the band struck up again and I caught hold of Wood's neck and began skipping along; the women were on the kerb, and there was hardly room for us to go by, and I went against the woman—she said "Where are you running to, you fools?"—I said "All right mother, no offence"—I did not spill her beer at that time—the prisoner said "You nearly shoved my mother down, you b----monkey, if you are two big navvies I am not frightened at you, I would fight either of you"—Wood said I would not demean myself to hit you, I could eat eight of you before breakfast—I said to the prisoner "Look here, the best thing you can do is to go home and get your supper"—we were walking away to get out of it, as I did not want to have any bother, and he said "Can you make me go home and <hi rend="italic">get</hi> my supper?"—I said "No, I don't want to interfere with you at all"—he said "I would knife the b----pair of you"—I saw him go like this, twice, but I saw no knife—there was a woman on each side of him, and they rushed at him to pull him back—Wood, who was five or six yards away, said "Bill, collar him he has stabbed me"—I went up to him and saw blood running out of his trousers—I looked for the pri<lb></lb>soner at the public-house, but could not find him—I afterwards picked him out at the station from ten or twelve others—I am positive he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer's man and live in White Street, Borough—on Monday evening, 26th July at 11.20 I was in the Coach and Horses with Watts—I had come out of my lodging to hear the band, and Watts" caught hold of my neck to pretend to make me dance, and hit against a woman with a jug in her hand—the prisoner said "What the b----h—do you want to shift up against my mother for, you are a big puppy"—he went on abusing Watts, who told him to go home to his supper—the other said "You are two big navvies, I could do the two of you, I would knife the pair of you in a second"—I said "Why you little hound I could eat eight of you before breakfast"—he rushed at me and stabbed me in the thigh—I felt the blood running down, and called out "Collar him Watts, he has stabbed me"—he then ran away—the prisoner is the man who stabbed me—I afterwards identified him—I had had no quarrel with him.</p>
               <p>

On Saturday night, the 3rd of February, my wash-house was entered between half past six in the evening, and eight the next morning; my washhouse adjoins the kitchen, and is attatched to the dwelling-house. I was in the wash-house at half past six, the evening previous, and told my servant to fasten the wash-house; but did not see her do so. I was in the wash-house at about eight o'clock the next morning, it was then day-light; my servant is not here. I missed the property in question from the wash-house and the accounting-house; the lead was on the top of the copper to keep the setting from wearing.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Sunday morning, the 4th of February, I took the prisoner into custody, in Cross-lane, Long Acre, at about eight or nine; I found the property in question on him. I asked him where he got it, and he said, he had found it. I told him that was very improbable, and on taking the lead out of the basket, I found it had been taken from the rim of a copper; I found the other things in the basket, and in the bag; and on taking him to St. James's watch-house, he told me he was very much distressed, and had not got a farthing; I took care of him and fed him; and on going down to Marlborough-street, I there received information of Mr. Skeet's house having been robbed.</p>

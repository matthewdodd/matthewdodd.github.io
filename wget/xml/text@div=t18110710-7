            . I live in Pell-street, Ratcliffe Highway. The prisoner came with a man that passed as man and wife to take a lodging at my house about six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her sleeping from her lodging any night - A. Yes, on Friday night, the 7th, the night that they mentioned; she came home on the Saturday, the next day, and had something for dinner, and went out again, she said she had business to do. About nine or ten in the evening she came home again, the first time that she came she brought change of a one pound note, she said she had no pockets on, she asked leave to lay it on my table.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see whether she had any more at that time - A. No, not at that time; when she came home in the evening, between nine and ten o'clock at night, she brought in change for another pound note, she brought a person in with her, she called her Betcy; they sat down in my room, and talked about some notes that the prisoner had in her pocket, and Betcy asked the prisoner if she had not got a five pound note; she said, what is that to you; afterwards I saw her bring out three or four notes, but I did not see a five pound note; she took them out of her bosom to look at them, and put them into her bosom again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she sleep that night - A. Her husband would not let her in the room to sleep with him, and I let her stay in my room all the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of her having been taken ill on the Friday - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. While she was in your house was there no complaint of illness - A. A little too much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the husband the first night that she slept out - A. He slept at home in his own lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the husband - A. He is a day-watchman in the New London docks.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen any money or notes in the possession of the prisoner before that - A. No, never. On the Friday morning before she went out she asked me to lend her sixpence; I lent her sixpenny-worth of halfpence. On Sunday she told me that she had paid all her debts in the neighbourhood.</p>

             I am a police officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Monday the 10th of June, on searching her I found this box in her pocket, a one pound note was in it, and eighteen shillings in silver. Under the bed, in this pocket, I found two one pound notes, and a two pound note, and laying upon the table in the room I found to the amount of one pound, and two shillings in halfpence, all in papers. There were a pair of old pockets which Mrs. Gregg's servant found, the prisoner claimed them; in the pockets there were fourteen-pence.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Should you know the notes if you looked at them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The first thing I have to say if it meets with your lordships approbation, I ask for the money that was taken from me, and the next thing is, I am indicted by Mrs. Johnson, which I presume to be her name, her husband is a Dutchman I believe, he is master of the Alexander. She requested me to go down to the Docks to see her, and at the time I called upon Mrs. Rusk, where I had before seen Mrs. Johnson. I found she had removed; I went to her lodgings, I was not very well, Mrs. Johnson behaved in a very discreet manner, and I staid there for the evening, and this young woman came in, and agreed to be her servant for her board, and so much a week till Mr. Johnson came home. In the morning I got out of bed, Mrs. Johnson gave me a shilling, and asked me to get something to drink. I went down to Cannon-street, the wine-vaults was not open. I went to three different places before I found a wine vaults open; I went home; she said, you take a little, and I will, and we will lay down again. That was done. In the morning Mrs. Johnson asked me to come down and take a cup of coffee; I did. I then said, as I have been out all night, which I ought not, I will go home. I went home in the course of the afternoon, Arnott would not let me come in, this lady said I was welcome to sit in her room all night. I am in the habit of receiving every year thirteen pounds four shillings and eight pence; I was asked from where I got it; I said I would rather stand by the consequence than send for the person that allows it me</p>

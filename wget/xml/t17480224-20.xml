               <p>Q. When did you mark them?</p>
               <p>Keys . The fourth of February; about eight at night I went out for about two hours, and when I came home I went to the till, and three of those shillings were gone; I spoke to the Prisoner, and said I believed he had robbed me; he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out 4 s. and 6 d. and there were two of my shillings among them, and another was in his side pocket, and the Prisoner confessed he had robbed me of that money.</p>

             . I saw the Prisoner take money out of his master's till twice.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you see it?</p>
               <p>Holbert. I was concealed in a sugar hogshead.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you Mr. Key's servant?</p>
               <p>Holbert. No, I am his father's servant.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do there?</p>
               <p>Holbert. I was ordered to go into the hogshead to see what I could see.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go into the hogshead?</p>
               <p>Holbert. About seven o'clock at night on the fourth of February.</p>
               <p>Q. What, to watch?</p>
               <p>Holbert. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to watch for?</p>
               <p>Holbert. Why, to see what I could see.</p>
               <p>Q. What, to see any particular person?</p>
               <p>Holbert. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did this hogshead stand?</p>
               <p>Holbert. Just before the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the Prisoner any candle?</p>
               <p>Holbert. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why this money was not put into the till till eight at night? Did you see him take any out of the till?</p>
               <p>Holbert. Yes, I was in the hogshead twice.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the other time you got into the hogshead to watch?</p>
               <p>Holbert. The first time was the second of February.</p>
               <p>Court. That does not agree.</p>
               <p>Keys. He was in twice that night .</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you there ?</p>
               <p>Holbert. From seven till ten .</p>
               <p>Q. How often did the Prisoner come to the till in that time?</p>
               <p>Holbert. Twice, and took out money both times. Mr. Keys came home about ten o'clock, and he said he believed he had robbed him, and bid him pull his money out, and the Prisoner pulled 4 s. 6 d. out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they marked ?</p>
               <p>Holbert. Some were marked, and some were not marked.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the mark?</p>
               <p>Holbert. I do not know the mark because I did not see them marked.</p>
               <p>Keys . There were three persons more there, but I thought there was no occasion for them here.</p>

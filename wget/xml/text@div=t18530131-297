                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 611). I was on duty in Leadenhall-street on 6th Jan., about ten minutes before 6 o'clock in the evening I heard the crash of a window or the breaking of glass—that attracted my attention, I looked towards the place and saw the prisoner turning from the window—he ran across the street—I ran after him—he ran from Leadenhall-street to Lime-street—I pursued him for about 100 yards—I only lost sight of him for a second or two—he went between some wagons, and I went round them—when I caught him he resisted violently, and I felt something fall on the ground, and this watch was picked up by a person-who came up at the time, and gave his name John Turner, but he did not give evidence—I saw him pick it up close to where we were standing—this is the watch—the prisoner had these four chains in his hand when I took him—this ticket of the watch was entangled with these chains, and this small ticket of the chain—I ascertained whose window it was that was broken, it was Mr. Brown, No. 110. Leadenhall-street.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see me leave the window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I did not see you go to the window—I felt the watch fall—I felt something fall—I took the four chains out of your hand—you endeavoured first to get away, and then you put your hand behind you, and I struggled with you a few minutes—I got your hand and opened it, and in it was the four chains—I remarked to you, "You did not know I was so close"—you said, "No, if I had I should not have done it"—your knuckles were all blood, and when you washed them at the station you said you thought some of the glass was in them—you told me in going to Moor-lane station, that if you bad got off, you should have had the laugh at us, for you should have had a good <hi rend="italic">haul.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Charles Brown, a jeweller, No. 110, Leadenhall-street. On that evening I was in the parlour adjoining the shop—the shop is about twelve feet long—I suddenly heard a crash about twenty minutes past 6 o'clock—I ran out and found one window smashed, and a vacancy in the chains—there were some watches in front of the chains hanging in the window—I did not ascertain what was missing—we could not ascertain among so much stock—the window was full—there was nobody in the shop but me—I closed the shop immediately, and went to the station—I saw the prisoner before I got to the station—I know nothing of him—the policeman showed me some chains, and I identified them as being the property of my employer—I know them by their appearance, and this ticket is my writing—they are both my writing, one is for the watch, and one for this chain—this ticket belonged to this chain—we have not taken stock since to ascertain what is missing—I do not think there is any other watch gone—I cannot speak as to the chains—this watch is my master's—it is worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

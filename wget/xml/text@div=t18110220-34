            . I am an officer. On Sunday night, about half past six, I was in Bishopgate Street, I met the prisoner with this glass under his arm, I asked him what he had got, he told me a glass, he was going to get it new framed, I told him I thought it very odd to get a glass framed of a Sunday night, I took him into a house, I searched him, and found a crow and two picklock keys, and two or three matches upon him, I secured him and took him to the Compter. The prosecutor applied to me the same night, saying that he had been robbed of a glass, I never let him see the glass till he came before the Lord Mayor, there he described the glass, and claimed it as his property. Here is a nail with which the glass was fastened, I found it on the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this court from where you stopped the prisoner. - A. About fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know the glass to be my husband's property, we have had it between twenty and thirty years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Sunday I was out drinking all day, on my coming home at night, I met a man whom I formerly knew, he asked me if I would take a few things home with me, which was a glass, two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200028"></xptr>keys, and a piece of iron about a foot long, he said he was going to have his things seized for rent, I consented, and was stopped by the officer and sent to the Compter. This is the first time I ever was tried, I am innocent of what I am charged with.</p>

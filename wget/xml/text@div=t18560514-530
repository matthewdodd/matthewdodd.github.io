                  </hi>. I am a printer, in the service of Mr. Hopcroft, of Mincing-lane. The prisoner was a journeyman in the same employment—I was ordered to watch him, and did so on the night of 23rd April—it was about 2 o'clock when I gave him in charge—I saw him take some paper, roll it up, and put it into his hat—I ran down into Mincing-lane, got a policeman, and told him to look into the prisoner's hat—he found these three sheets of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then counted the paper that the pri<lb></lb>soner had been working on, and found it twenty sheets short—I had counted the paper before that night, and it was all right—the paper was double demy—the prisoner had no right to take it, unless his employer allows him, but I often take home a sheet of paper.</p>

METCALPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You often take home a sheet of paper when it is spoilt, and unfit for printing on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—one of these three sheets are spoiled, this one—I should have felt at liberty to take that away—if the paper is too wet it cannot be printed on, but is not spoiled; it cannot be printed on at that time—I am the person who damps it before it goes to him—the paper when found was not as it is now, it was like this (<hi rend="italic">crumpled up</hi>)—the prisoner could not see me, but I was where I could command a view of him; I was in the dark in the office at the oppo<lb></lb>site corner—he was at No. 42, Mincing-lane, and I was at No. 1, the opposite corner, looking for the purpose, but, for all the prisoner knew, he was alone—he had had, for some weeks, a latch key to let himself in and out at night—he had access to all the paper—this was in the middle of the night—there are no blinds to either house—1,036 sheets are allowed for every 1,000 to be printed, the thirty-six sheets are for waste—I do not know whether a man may take away the thirty-six sheets if he does not spoil any, but I have often taken a sheet of paper home—there has been no prohibition in the office to taking away paper under any circumstances—there is nothing defective in the other two sheets, but one of them has been torn since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Hopcroft, a printer, of Mincing-lane.

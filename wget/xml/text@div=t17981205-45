             sworn. - I am an apprentice to Mr. Feather. On Friday last my mistress called up stairs, that somebody had robbed her; I ran down Red-lion-street and Lamb's-conduit-street; I turned up East-street, leading to Harper-street; I got Information that they were gone into Harpur's-'s-mews; I pursued, and took Bertles into custody, he had no property upon him; he got from me, and ran into the George, in Boswell-court; I saw the prisoner Cole run out of the Mews. When I came back, he was in my master's shop, that was about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards, the box was then upon the counter.</p>
               <p>JAMES HOUNSON sworn. - I am servant to Mrs. Lewis, in Devonshire-street, Queen-square; I saw the prisoner Cole take a japan box off the counter of Mr. Feather's shop, in Red-lion-passage; I was going into the shop at the time; he ran across the square with the box in his hand; I did not pursue him, because I am a little lame; I did not see Bertles till he was brought back to the shop; there was nobody in the shop at the time I first saw him; Mrs. Feather was sitting in the back room; the box was brought back by Frederick Jones.</p>

               <p>FREDERICK JONES sworn. - I live in Lamb's-conduit-passage; I was coming from Great James-street, and as I was crossing from Theobald's-road, I saw the prisoner Bertles with something concealed under his apron, but I could not see what Cole was by the side of him, but I did not see any thing that he had; I am sure the prisoners are the same persons; I did not much like the look of them; they ran up Lamb's-conduit-street, and I ran after them, a little way on the other side of the way; as they were running along, one of them knocked a coachman under a coach; I afterwards told a young man that I was sure one of them was gone into a public-house in Old North-street, the sign of the Spotted Cow, and he went in and brought Cole out; I saw Bertles pull off his apron, wrap it round the box, and drop them in Harpur's-mews; I picked them up. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>THOMAS HUDDLESTON sworn. - I am a shoemaker; as I was at work, I saw the two prisoners at the top of Red-lion-passage, in the square, standing hill, as if they were going for East-street; they returned back again almost immediately, and seemed then as if they were making for Prince's-street, and then I saw Bertles turn back to Red-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050052"></xptr>lion-passage, and the other I lost, but presently afterwards I saw him again; I cannot say which way he came, but I saw him go into Mr. Feather's shop; Bertles was going backwards and forwards in the square; I then saw Cole come out again, with the box in his hand, he cried out, "they are after me, they are after me; "I then went to Mrs. Feather, to know if she had lost any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pursue? - A. No, I did not; I saw them brought back, and the box; and I am sure they are the same persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that is the box? - A. I am positive to the box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cole. Q. Why did not you pursue me, if you saw me with the box? -

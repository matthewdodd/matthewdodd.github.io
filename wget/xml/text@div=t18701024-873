I am a pocket-book maker, and live at 6, Henrietta Place, Peckham—on the night of the 10th October, about 11 o'clock, I was in the Rosemary Branch public-house—I stayed there till 1 o'clock, when the house closed—I was sober then—while I was there the two prisoners came in with another man—the landlord knew me and he let me out of the side entrance into Southampton Street—the prisoners went out at the front-door—I heard footsteps behind me when I was some little distance from the house—as I was going round the corner to my house the prisoners caught hold of my arms, and they almost strangled me—I could not call out or do anything—the third man came in front of me and took my watch-chain that hung in front of my waistcoat, the chain broke and left my watch in my pocket—they all three ran away—I am quite sure the prisoners are two of the men that were there—I took hold of Stedeu, he got away and I followed him—he went into a house in South Street, and I stopped out-side</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 374). On this morning, I was in South Street Camberwell—I saw the prosecutor there—from what he said to me, I knocked at the door of No. 62—Stedeu answered the door; he was un<lb></lb>dressed—I asked him if he was at the Rosemary Branch with the prosecutor that evening—he said "I was"—the prosecutor said "That is the man who robbed me"—the prisoner said "I know I was in the house the whole evening, but I know nothing of the robbery"—the prosecutor said that Diamond Row, and another man came up from behind and snatched his chain.</p>

From information I received, I went to Diamond Row between 7 and 8 in the morning, and found part of the chain where the robbery took place—I apprehended Surridge, and charged him with being concerned in the robbery—he said, "I was in Stedeu's company last night, but I don't know anything of the chain."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

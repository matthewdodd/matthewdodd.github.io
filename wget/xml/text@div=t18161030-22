The prisoner came into my master's warehouse, and enquired for a strange name, and asked me if we manufactured figured sarsnets. I told him, no, that we only manufactured plain goods. He then asked to see a piece. I put a piece on the counter before him, and he asked what was the net price of it, as he was going into the country, and he would pay money for it. I went to the desk to see what was the net price; that was about three yards from me; and he walked over to the press where the goods were kept. That was opposite the counter, and he remarked what long lengths they were; and he said he had got a friend waiting at the door, and he would go and ask him to come up. He then left the warehouse, but did not return. I was not alarmed. It was four or five minutes before I suspected any thing. We had only one piece of sarsnet in the house. I do not know when I had seen it before, but I know I did not sell it. I did not look for that, as there was only one piece, and I did not miss any of the others. I did not miss that plain piece until two or three days afterwards. I cannot swear it was taken that day. I have never seen it again.</p>

On the 16th of June, when I went to bed, I had a crown, four half-crowns, and one shilling in my trousers pocket - the prisoner slept in the top room, in the same bed with me; nobody else slept in the room - I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock; he was then in bed, and appeared fast asleep - I got up between six and seven; he was in bed then, and before I left the room I missed my money - I informed him; he said he knew nothing of it, that he was very short of money, and intended to ask me to lend him 1s.; I do not know whether the door was locked - an officer was sent for, but before he came the prisoner, who had been down stairs five minutes before, expressed a wish to go down stairs again - I said I had sent for a Policeman, and if he wished to show himself innocent he would remain; he said then he must ease himself in the pot - I went out of the room, looked through a space between the post and the door, and saw him take the money out of his pocket, wrap it in a piece of newspaper, and place it behind the bed - I then entered the room, and found the money between the bedstead and the wall - he denied putting it there.</p>

I had a pair to pawn, which I either changed another pair with my brother for, or they were my own, I do not know which; but on searching my box I could not find the duplicate, and do not know what had become of it; I made an affidavit that I had lost it, and got the trousers; my brother however claimed them - he was on good terms with me till this robbery was found out; since that he has struck me, and I am in danger of my life; I have a note in my pocket from him, saying, "If that hell-hound, named Elcocks, comes into any place where I am, he is in danger of his life."</p>

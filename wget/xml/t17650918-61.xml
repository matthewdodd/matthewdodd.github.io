            . I am a receiver, or agent, and have an office in Crutched-friars. The prisoner at the bar came to me some time in June, and told me she had a probate of a will, which lay in the hands of Mr. Faulkner, proctor, in Doctor's commons; but she had not money sufficient to pay, and therefore could not get it out: She desired me to pay the money for her. I asked her some questions as usual, but particularly asked her for a parish certificate of the minister and churchwardens, setting forth she was the person she pretended to be; she not bringing that, I declined acting in it. Some time after, she came with this probate in her hand; (holding one in his hand). In consequence of which, I made search, and found there were wages due; but I would advance no money till she could get a certificate. She pleaded poverty, and I let her have a crown, or some such matter, till she could get the certificate: She came on the 26th of July, and brought a certificate; I was then ill in bed: She came again on the 27th; I was then below stairs: the certificate appeared very fair, and I gave credit to her; but as the money could not be immediately got, she begged I would let her have a little. There were several people that came with her, they were very clamorous: some said, they would wait no longer for their money; one said she was indebted to them so much, and another so much. I said, when she has it, undoubtedly she will pay you, or endeavour to settle in some manner among you: that did not satisfy them; they were very clamorous. Then she addressed me to let her have some, to give each of these people something, or she should be arrested: in consequence of which, I let her have three guineas and a half. I went up stairs to my bureau, and she with me; I wrote the body of this note. and called up my lad, he saw her make her mark. Before ever I wrote her name, as is usual, I said, what is your name? notwithstanding her having applied to me before: she told me her name was

               <p>Q. Did you ask her if she could write? Hooper. I think I did; it is usual to ask a person, Can you write? I then paid her the remainder of the money, to make the first three guineas and a half; but the money I paid her before, I can not exactly say. I think it was on the 20th or 21st of August,

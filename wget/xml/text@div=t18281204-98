I married Langham; for the last four months he has lived with that woman - he has used me ill; I threw myself into the canal, and, unfortunately, a bargeman took me out; Langham knew every thing about this; he said, "Go away, you can get your living at service;" I said, "If I go away I will leave my country;" I met him in Bishopsgate-street; and asked him for a shilling - and said, "What am I to do?" Wood has been living with a woman for nine years.</p>

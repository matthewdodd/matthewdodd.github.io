                  </hi>. I am a surveyor's clerk, of 8, River-streeet, Myddle<lb></lb>ton-square—on Saturday evening, 27th September, about half-past 6, I was standing at the corner of Farringdon-street, near the Holborn-hill end—I saw the prisoners together—there were two ladies and a gentleman looking in at a shop window—the prisoners were very near them—the ladies moved from there towards Snow-hill; the prisoners followed them—I watched them—on going up Snow-hill, Green went in front of the ladies, while Austen was behind them—I saw Austen put his hand into one of the ladies' pockets and draw a purse from it—he then called out, "All right," and Green came from the front of the ladies, and they both turned into a court—I saw the purse in Austen's hand open, and he gave something from it to Green—they then walked together down to Victoria-street—it was coin that he gave him, rather a dull colour; it was not pence; it was silver if anything—Austen</p>

               <p>went into the Victoria public-house—Green went and stood with his back against the barriers of Victoria-street—he then crossed the road to a man who was standing outside the public-house, and gave something to him; I could not say what it was—I called the constable, Crouch, and gave Green into custody; at least I told him to keep his eye on him while I went after the other man, but I could not find him.</p>

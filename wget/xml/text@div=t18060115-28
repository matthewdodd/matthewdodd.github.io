               <p>Q. Did you loose any of your property on the 8th of December? - A. I lost my purse, I was sitting in the bar at past twelve o'clock at night, I was sitting up till my family had put every thing to rights; having been ill for two days I dropped asleep, while the prisoner was in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been in the bar? - A. He had been in and out of the bar all the evening, he lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been backward and forward in the bar several times? - A. Yes, he was like one of our own family.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner? - A. I do not know; he said that he had property to receive at the India house, he came into the bar to supper, my family was gone to bed, I was there and he was left there, and when I awoke, he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at supper when you fell asleep? - A. No</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150024"></xptr>Q. What was the last thing that you observed him to do before you fell asleep? - A. He had some peppermint to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been asleep? - A. I might have been asleep perhaps half an hour, I got up and went to bed, I did not miss my purse till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he placed respecting of you when you went to sleep? - A. He sat at a table not far from me, because our bar is very little. The next morning when I came down stairs, I missed my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you felt your purse before you found that you had lost it? - A. That evening, I had given change just before eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you put your purse in your pocket again? - A. Yes, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the purse? - A. Two ten pound notes, two five pound notes, two ones, two or three half guineas, and three or four seven shilling peices.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it that you missed your money? - A. It was near ten o'clock; when I came down stairs he was gone, out of the house; I said to my husband that I thought he had got it, he went out of the house a little before nine o'clock, I never knew him to go out of the house before for the three weeks that he had lodged with me; my husband followed him, and he was brought back again; I see him brought back between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass on his being brought back? - A. My husband accused him of picking my pocket, and he denied it; they took him into the parlour and insisted on searching him; I was present, he refused being searched, they insisted again on searching him, he said it is all right to my husband; when he came into the bar they took the purse from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the purse here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce it (the purse produced)? - A. This is it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is your purse? - A. Yes, the money has been in it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there the same coin that you had in it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the notes folded up in the same way? - A. I cannot say, it was folded up in the same way then as it is now. There is two ten pound notes, there is only one five now (there is one five gone), there is two half guineas, and four seven shilling peices, I am positive that was in my purse.</p>

             sworn. This man came to my house on the 19th of November and he continued there till the 8th of December; during that time I used to let him make free with any part of the house below stairs, he was in the habit of spending a great deal of money, I could not account how he came by it, such as two or three guineas a day, he treated every body that came into the house; on the morning of the 8th of December my wife missed this purse, in consequence of that I made diligent search about the house; to see that it was not mislaid about the house; we found that it was not so, she supposed that he had taken it from her. In St. Martin's Lane I heard of him; he was gone with another man, I sent two or three people after him, at last a man came and said that they had found him at the Green Man in St. Martin's Lane. I went down myself, and took a constable with me and brought him back to our own house, we took him into the parlour and desired the constable to search him, he refused being searched, he wished, he said, to speak to me at one corner of the parlour, I of course heard what he had to say, he said all was right; I suppose he meant as to the money, however he said that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand what he meant by it? A. I judged it to be so; however he wished to speak to me in the bar a second time, after his things began to be stripped off to be searched, I went into the bar, he followed me with the constable, and he gave up to me the purse into my own hands; I took the purse into the taproom, and laid it on the table, and told it out for the constable to witness what it was that was brought back. The two ten pound notes I took of two gentlemen in partnership next door, I backed them; and one five I took of one Betts, No. 4, Fleet-lane, in Fleet-market; I rather objected to it when I took it, they have never been out of my possession since.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they bank notes? - A. Yes; as to the other five, I do not know what became of that; as to the two one-pound notes there is nothing particular on them, I was satisfied that they were good, I took no further account of them; I can swear to the notes that I have marked; I sent him to St. Martin's watchhouse, and from there he was taken to Bow-street, and from there he was committed to Tothil-fields.</p>
               <p>ROBERT - sworn. I am constable; Mr. Dellear came to me on Sunday morning, about ten o'clock; I went with him to the Green Man and apprehended the prisoner, and brought him back to Mr. Dellear.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then? - A. He refused being searched, he wished to speak to Mr. Dellear in the bar, he took the purse out of his pocket, and put it into Mr. Dellear's hand; Mr. Dellear said that was his purse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On that said night, when I was going to bed with my candle in my hand, I found that purse on the floor; I said to myself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150025"></xptr>I suppose I shall find an owner for that in the morning; I sat in the tap-room, a man came in, and says good morning to me, I had spoke to him before; after sitting a little while he says, I want to go out to get my shoes cleaned, he said will you go with me, I said with all my heart, I will go out and get my shoes cleaned; after that he asked me to have some beer, and he and I went into the house together that he had been speaking of, we sat a little while together, and the prosecutor and the constable came in, if I had any intention of going off with it, or had taken it with a design as is represented, I had time enough from three o'clock in the morning till eleven, but I did not intend any such thing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called no witness to character.</p>

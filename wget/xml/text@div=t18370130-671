                  </hi>. I am a surveyor of the Thames police. The prisoner was brought to me by King, on Monday, the 2nd of January, with this copper—I asked where he brought it from—he said from the Victualling office—it was some he had been at work upon that day, and not being marked, he had brought it away—I had said before, if it came from the Victualling office it was marked—he said, no, it was not—I went the next day and saw Sir John Hill—I ascertained where the prisoner had been at work, and I found one of the cisterns of the fire engine had been recently torn up, and a portion of the copper had been torn away—the cistern of that engine was lined with copper—I compared this with what remained—there was red paint inside the copper cistern—this is the lining of it, and here is some of the red paint on this—it is of exactly the same substance and size, and this edge fitted the edge where it bad been soldered—I cannot say whether the other parts corresponded—it has been bent up.</p>

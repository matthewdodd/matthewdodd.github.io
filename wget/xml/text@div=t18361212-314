                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my service about five or six months—I missed a considerable number of things—I found these two pair of shoes at a pawnbroker's shop last Thursday—I do not know when they were missed—I am not able to say that they have never been sold—I do not think it at all likely—she admitted having received them of a boy in my employ, but who had left my service the week before—I found him, and took him to the station-house, and they did not think it sufficient evidence to detain him—the prisoner was then remanded until the following Tuesday, and then I found the boy—she and the boy were in my service at the same time.</p>

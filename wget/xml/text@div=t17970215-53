             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am gardener under Mr. Witney, in Mr. Wegg's service: On the 3d of February I covered the cucumber plants, and made them all safe; they were very healthy when I covered them up, which was about five in the evening; the mellon ground is entirely surrounded with walls; there are two doors; I bolted one and locked the other at dusk, and left them all fast; that was about a quarter after five, when I left my labour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the ground first the next morning, or the head gardener? - A. We were both together, about seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it been light then? - A. Not above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had they grown up? - A. They were making the fourth shoot.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these high walls? - A. The south wall was twelve feet high, and the east wall about ten feet high.</p>
               <p>Q. How long would it have taken the persons to get over the wall and do this business? - A. I I suppose they might have done it in half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How many walls must they have come over? - A. Two; about seven in the morning I came into the garden, and saw the frames disturbed, and two seed leaves broke off in the frame.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they been at any other place than the frame? - A. No; I cannot say how many plants were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in pots, or in the ground? - A. In the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. - Q. You left this place, and left them safe at five in the afternoon of the 3d of this month? - A. A quarter after five.</p>
               <p>Q. In the country at that time it is light till pretty near six o'clock? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. You say then there are two walls; if I understand this garden, there is one wall encloses the whole ground? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not a man have got into the garden, if he was so disposed, and do what you have described in less than half an hour? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a door to the garden, and a door to the mellon ground? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man had been so disposed, he might have broke the door? - A. The doors were fast; we could trace the wall they got over, by the assistance of a pear tree.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it light on the 4th of February before seven o'clock? - A. It might be light before seven, but that was the time we went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been light half an hour? - A. I don't know but it might.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning? - A. At half past six.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light then? - A. Day was broke at the time we got up.</p>

             again called. Q. You told us you saw the plants at one in the afternoon? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time after that go into the garden? - A. I did; I saw the frames, they appeared to be safe, they were left according to my direction.</p>
               <p>Q. At seven in the morning they appeared to be distrubed; did you discover by what way the persons that had done this mischief came in? - A. They came over the south wall into the kitchen garden, after that over another wall into the mellon ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom had you the seed from, that produced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150081"></xptr>those plants? - A. I don't know whether I had them from Mr. Bailey. or not.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state were the plants? - A. Fit to stop the second time; they had put forth two seed leaves, and a rough leaf makes the fourth leaf.</p>
               <p>Q. What time would it take the persons to get in and do all the mischief they did? - A. I suppose they could do it very well in half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, you suspected the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did; he had formerly worked there; he was then gardener to Dr. Nicholas; I went to Dr. Nicholas's garden on the 6th, and I found there fourteen plants; I lost nineteen in all; I knew them by the mode of stopping; after they bring forth their first shoot, I pinch that off; I have a particular mode of doing it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the plants appear in Dr. Nicholas's garden? - A. They had not in the least advanced, and appeared a little confused by shifting about; one of them had lost two seed leaves.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any seed leaves that you observed in Mr. Wegg's garden? - A. I found two seed leaves by the frames.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the kind of ground in Dr. Nicholas's garden? - A. I did; the mould about the plants was not the same fort of mould; there were old oak tan and rotted leaves, which was the mould I planted them in, about the root of the plants.</p>
               <p>Q. Who furnished you with that mould? - A.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. These sort of plants are not easily to be purchased? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they growing? - A. They were turned out of pots, and growing in little hills.</p>
               <p>Q. They might have done all this in half an hour? - A. I think they might.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the garden at six o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The witness says, before he went away he matted these plants up; did you unmat them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At six o'clock, when you left them, day had not shut in, had it? - A. Yes; it was not day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light? - A. It was between light and dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Day-light was not shut in? - A. It appeared to me to be.</p>

               <p>Q. Any other gardener with equal skill with yourself might have grown these plants? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Q. If the prisoner had such seed, such sort of plants might have sprung up in Dr. Nicholas's garden? - A. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>MARK WHITLOCK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am gardener to Mr. Stevens: In consequence of what I heard from Bailey, I went to the prisoner at Dr. Nicholas's garden, and looked at his cucumbers; I looked in the frames, and saw them in pots; they appeared to me as if they had been removed; he told me he removed them out of his bed, because his bed was too hot; his bed had burnt, and he removed them to take the burnt mould away, and put the other mould there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to you to have suffered by being in too hot a bed? - A. No; one I observed had the seed leaves broke off; then I left him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were not told of the loss of any cucumber plants? - A. No, not then, of the loss of any one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You went to call on this gardener to see his cucumber plants? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He shewed them with the utmost readiness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other cucumber plants? - A. Yes, smaller; I cannot say how many plants or pots.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150082"></xptr>Q. This was in Dr. Nicholas's garden, in frames, and any body might see them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner told you he had removed them, that the bed they were in was too hot? - A. He told me the bed burnt, and he put other mould to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. They did not appear to be burnt? - A. No; he took them away, or they might have burnt.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Witney.) You say you have a particular method of stopping these plants, by pinching them off? - A. They come up two feed leaves, then they break out a rough leaf, and then I stop the next that appears; that stops the first joint.</p>
               <p>Q. Other people may do that sometimes? - A. Sometimes they may.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say it is a method peculiar to yourself; may not other gardeners do the same? - A. They may.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Bailey stop the same way? - A. I believe he does, I don't know any other that do.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Whitlock? - A. I don't know that he does.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Whitlock). What is your method of stopping these cucumber plants? - A. A very common method; as soon as they come into two leaves, I stop the next that appears.</p>
               <p>Q. You stop them by taking off the third leaf? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (To witney.) Will your method of stopping the plant, and Whitlock's make the plant have the same appearance? - A. If it is stopped at the first joint in my method, it will have the same appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Whitlock.) Do you stop in the same way? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am gardener to Lord Galloway. I sent Whitlock to Dr. Nicholas's gardener to see his cucumber plants; I went on the 6th with young Mr. Wegg, Dr. Goodenough, and Whitney, Mr. Wegg's gardener.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know these plants of Mr. Wegg's? - A. Yes; I have been in the habit of calling on Mr. Wegg frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Dr. Nicholas's, did you see Mr. Wegg's plants? - A. I saw the plants in the frame; I saw three holes of plants in the hills, and one in the pots.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to ascertain whether they are Mr. Wegg's plants or not? - A. I believe they were, for I had four pots of the same plants in my frame, one of them was turned out of the pots, and there were found some oak tan, and leaf mould, half a bushel or more, which I had given to Mr. Wegg's gardener.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that tan was the same? - A. I believe it was the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mould of that sort in the beds of Dr. Nicholas? - A. No; I looked round particularly, I could not see any of that sort; I particularly noticed one plant had lost the feed leaves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Mr. Wegg's frame, whether there were any feed leaves there? - A. No, I did not; the gardener told me they were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe they were Mr. Wegg's plants, or not? - A. I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You believe the tan and leaf mould were the same you had given to Mr. Wegg's gardener? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear it was the very mould you gave him? - A. I swear to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Is leaf mould and tan used by any other gardener? - A. Yes, if they have it; it is not every one that has it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been in Dr. Nicholas's garden before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, whether he had any of this sort of mould, you don't know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to stop in the same way as Mr. Wegg's gardener? - A. Yes; we both make a practice of stopping in the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any other gardeners that stop in the same way? - A. Some do, and some do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had seen these plants at ten miles distance, should you have known them? - A. Equally the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a plant that had lost a feed leaf before? - A. Yes, many.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is not uncommon? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you observe, in Dr. Nicholas's garden, any feed leaves that had dropped from the plant? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in the frames of Dr. Nicholas's, if there were any mould of this fort? - A. I did, in particular, and I could find none.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I came down on Saturday about three o'clock, and they told me the garden was robbed, they mentioned to me the circumstances I have heard related in Court, and I went on the Monday to Dr. Goodenough, and got him to go to Dr. Nicholas to apprize him of it, and go to the melon ground, and then call me when they got to the ground; I went in after the declarations they made to me; I had the prisoner apprehended, I did not make any observation on the plants; I saw the ground taken up, the mould appeared to me to be different, but I am not a judge of it.</p>
               <p>Dr. NICHOLAS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live at Ealing, about a mile from Mr. Wegg's, the prisoner was my gardener</p>

               <p>Q. Do you use tan in those melon frames? - A. That I don't know; the gardener is permitted to manage those things in his own way, I paid for dung sometime before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You don't know whether you had these plants or not, you leave that entirely to your gardener? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some dung sometime before? - A. Yes; I saw the beds made, I have no reason but to think the prisoner was an honest man, I committed a great deal to his care.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether as a gardener he was skilful in his line? - A. I thought him very skilful.</p>
               <p>Q. As being skilful, you would not be surprized to see curious plants in your garden? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this melon ground in your garden? - A. No, in an island adjoining to the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Cucumbers find the way to your table pretty early? - A. Yes, as early or more so than some of my neighbours.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were you present when the people came in about this business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the bed made of to grow these in? - A. Dung and mould.</p>
               <p>Q. No hot-bed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not use oak tan, and leaf? - A. I don't know; gardeners use different things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you help to make the bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any tan or leaf mould? - A. I cannot tell what sort of stuff, there was a mixture of many different things; there might be tan and leaves, I dare say there were.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you dare say there were? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you borrowed tan or leaves from any gardener? - A. No.</p>

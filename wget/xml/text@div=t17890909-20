               <p>I am a constable; last August I took charge of this prisoner, and another man, the 3d of August, and this lead; these four pieces were in the handkerchief that the prisoner had, I think I can swear to it; there are ten pieces in the whole, four were found on this man, and six on the other.</p>

               <p>I am a plumber, I live at Stanmore, this lead was delivered to me and Mr. Finch, by the constable, to see whether it matched the mausoleum from which it was taken, I fitted it, and it matched not only one piece, but all the pieces; I was at work on the church on Saturday, and on Monday morning I missed this lead; this mausoleum belongs to the Duke of Chandos, it stands in the church-yard; I am positive this lead was taken from that mausoleum.</p>

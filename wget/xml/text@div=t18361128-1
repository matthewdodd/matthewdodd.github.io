                  </hi>. I keep the Fox and Knot public-house, in King-street, in the parish of St. Sepulchre. On Sunday night, the 6th of Novem<lb></lb>ber, I went to bed at twelve o'clock—my family consists of my daughter and servant—the prisoners came in for a pint of beer at half-past eleven o'clock that night, but they did not sit down—there was nobody in the house but my daughter, my servant, and myself—I did not see what became of the prisoners after they drank their beer—I was the last person up—the house was all fastened safe—the door was locked and bolted—it has a spring-lock—the window was fast for any thing I know—I know the girl fastened it at night—the till is a small drawer in the bar, which is always locked—I locked it myself that night before I went up stairs—there might be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I cannot tell to a shilling—I took the keys up stairs with me—about four o'clock in the morning the watchman came up stairs, and called us up, saying somebody had broken into the house—I got up, and went down to the bar—I found the lock of the bar broken open, and the till lock was broken open—I had locked them both be<lb></lb>fore I went to bed—the money was gone from the till; also seven tea-spoons from the till, and the sugar-tongs from the sugar-basin—the prisoners had their beer in the tap-room—I saw them go out of the house, and when they went out I saw my servant fasten the door—I found the door just as it was when we went to bed—it had not been unfastened at all—it was a spring-lock—it was locked and bolted—the key was not left in the lock—the parties must have come in at a side window, as I found it open when I came down stairs—I think that was fastened when I went to bed—my servant always fastens it—a snuff-box and a dial were taken out of the parlour, and two shawls of the servant's from the kitchen—the dial was on the chimney-piece when I went to bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman of St. Sepulchre's. I was on duty on the night of the 6th of November; and at four o'clock, as I was coming round the corner, I observed the side door of Mrs. Pettinger's house open—I went in, and found the bar door open—I turned out, and called my brother watchman to my assistance, and called Mrs. Pettinger up—the lock was wrenched off the bar door—I left my brother watchman in possession, while I went to the watch-house to inform the inspector.</p>

               <p>but no case to it—I then said I must lock them up as being the party—I did so, and took them before the Magistrate—I asked them if they had been at Mrs. Pettinger's, and Lapham acknowledged he had been there, and left between eleven and twelve o'clock—Mead denied it, and said he met Lapham in Farringdon-street.</p>

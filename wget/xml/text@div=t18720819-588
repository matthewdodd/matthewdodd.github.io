On 1st August I was on London Bridge about 12 o'clock, with two other officers—I saw the two prisoners come on to the bridge, where there was a great crowd in consequence of the race for the coat and badge that day—they walked over the bridge, eyeing several gentlemen and feeling their coat-tail pockets—they went to the Surrey side</p>

               <p>of the bridge, and came back again—Williams placed himself by the side of a young gentleman who was looking over the parapet, and Warren was a short distance off, behind another gentleman—Williams put his left hand under his right arm by the side of the gentleman—he then left the gentle<lb></lb>man, touched Warren on the shoulder, and they both crossed the road—I went up to the gentleman that Williams had just left, and saw his watch chain hanging down—I spoke to him, and we pursued the prisoners—Williams saw me coming, and ran to the Surrey side of the bridge—I caught hold of Warren, and called after Williams—he was stopped by Gilbert and Randall—I told Warren I should charge him with being concerned in steal<lb></lb>ing a watch—he said "I have no watch"—I said "I know you have not; your companion has got that"—I took him to the station—I believe he gave an address to one of the other officers.</p>

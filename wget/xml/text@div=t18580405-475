                  </hi>. I am a tailor, residing in the Old Kent Road. On Monday, 15th Feb., I saw the prisoner in Gnildball Yard—at that time a woman of the name of Spurway was indebted to me in the sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Iattended as a witness—the prisoner subpoenaed me on the previous Satur<lb></lb>day, in an action which was to be tried there—he was recommended to me as an attorney—I had some conversation about this debt which was due—I told him a person owed me a small amount, and she had said she would pay me if it ever lay in her power, but I could not take any proceedings against her, because I had taken some goods back, reducing the amount of the bill from 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner said, "Oh yes, that is to be got easily enough; that is all right enough"—he said, "I will call upon you this evening, to see what the amount is"—he did call; he then said, "Pro<lb></lb>ceedings must be taken in the Proctor's Court to recover the debt," as the debtor was a widow, and had not administered—I afterwards saw him at the Five Bells public house in the evening—he said he had been to see Mrs. Spurway—he said she had stated that she could pay the debt, but would not pay it without giving me further trouble—I said, "That is very strange;"and he said I should have to take proceedings in the Proctor's Court, and that immediately, because he said she had stated, she had paid everybody else, but would not pay me—he had previously told me he should require 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to take these proceedings, and that would be the expense of the Court—he asked me if I could advance him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. towards those pro<lb></lb>ceedings—Itold him I would let him know in the morning, and he left me his address; that was No. 11, Douglas Street, Deptford—I saw him on the following morning—I then paid him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he had said before—I stated, when I gave him the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that that was to enable him to take proceedings against Mrs. Spur<lb></lb>way in the Proctor's Court—I think he said it would soon be got, or something to that effect—I came with him to London on the next Wednesday—Iafterwards found we came to Chancery Lane—I went into a court with him—I swore to something, and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was by at the time—Ialso went to what I have found was the Court of Common Pleas Office—he then asked me to advance him summons—he told me Mrs. Spurway had been served with one summons, but he must have a second</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185804050177"></xptr>
               <p>summons to bring her before the Judge to show cause why she refused to pay when she paid the other creditors—I saw the prisoner again on Thursday; I had some conversation with him then—he sent for me from the Five Bells tavern to say a gentleman wished to see me; I went over and found it was him; he said he had seen Mrs. Spurway, and she wished to put a stop to the proceedings; I asked in what way; he said she proposed to pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in fourteen days, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week until the debt and expenses were paid—he said the money must be paid into court—he did not say what court, but I understood the court in which the proceedings had been taken—I said I had no objec<lb></lb>tion to take the money in that way—he said, to save us the trouble and expense again, in case she omitted any payment, we must have a Judge's order, and that would cost 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him if we could not do without that, and said, "Don't you think if Mrs. Spurway's father was to be answerable, it would save the expense of a Judge's order?" and he said, "No, a Judge's order must be sighed," and then, after my solicitor was empowered; in case she omitted any one payment, to put in a broker on the following day—I then agreed to advance him the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and gave it to him—on the following Thursday morning he drew a paper to state the amount of the debt and the costs he paid—Isaw him on the following day, Friday; he made a claim for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. costs; he said that was for costs incurred in the proceedings; 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for office fees; and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. his own charge—I did not pay him anything—nothing was said on that occasion about paying the instalment eight days—on Friday I made this proposal to him, I would pay part of the expenses, and did he think Mrs. Spurway would pay the money with fourteen days, and not to interfere with the Judge's order, or any other proceeding takes against Mrs. Spurway—he asked me what I would be towards the expenses; I said, "Do you think 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would do?" he said, "No, that would not induce her;" I said, "I will be half the expenses, that will be 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" he said, he would go and see Mrs. Spur<lb></lb>way—Iafterwards saw Mrs. Spurway—I made inquries about the prisoner—Igave him into custody on the next Wednesday—he never accounted to me for any money he received—I never gave him any authority to receive any money from Mrs. Spurway—he told me on Friday morning he had served Mrs. Spurway with a Judged order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Were you not witness in the case of Ashton v Steel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you subpoenaed me—I do not know anything about asking you for the expenses—Miller and Son's address was on the back of the subpoena—I did not know you were not a solicitor, I believed you to be the attorney in the case—you told me if I called on Miller and Son they would pay me—I saw you attending court at the trial with Mr. Miller—I did not suppose you were a clerk—on the morning of the trial I met a witness in the cause, of the name of Wells, I mentioned to him about Mrs. Spurway; I told him that a person owed me a little money, and I did not know is what way I could get it; was there any way of recovering it?—I did not ask him if he thought you could get in the money; I swear I did not say so—I asked him if he could tell me whether there was any means of getting this money—I did not, upon the representation of Wells, come to you, while you were dining, and state the whole circumstances, and ask you whether you would undertake to collect the debt; I came to ask you whether there was any means of getting the money—I did not tell you I had already sent two men there, and they were not able to get it—I did not tell you at the time I was speaking to you about it, that they could not get it, and that I would give you 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to do so—yousaid it could be got easily enough—you did not state you were merely a clerk; you said you would consider whether you would have any thing to do</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185804050178"></xptr>
               <p>with the case—I said I had sent one person; you stated you would call in the evening, you did so; you then arranged to call on Mrs. Spurway—I saw you go over there—I did not before you left my house say a second time I would give you 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I never mentioned 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you said that would be the expense of the Proctor's Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not these the words you used before I went over, that you had employed two separate men to get the money from her, but they were "duffers," and would not stick to her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not; I told you I had spoken to one man, who was a debt collector, but I had not received any answer, and you said you could soon get the money, but it was no use to put it into a debt collector's hands—I did not say I intended to serve her out, and if you would stick to her, I would give you 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., whether you got it or not—I did not call at your house the next morning, and urge you to go again and see her—I called upon you, because you asked me to advance you 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I came to tell you I would advance you 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. towards the pro<lb></lb>ceedings—Imet Wells as I was coming down to your house—I did not ask him to come with me to your house—I met him at New Cross; he was going towards London; I did not ask him to turn back and come, he proposed to come—I asked you what the expenses would be, and you said you would guarantee they would not be more than 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—you did not tell me you would not act unless under the advice of a solicitor, and that it would be necessary to have a solicitor—I did not urge you then to undertake the matter, and say I would give you 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for your trouble—I did not say, "If you will come up to my house I will give you 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. now"—I advanced you 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Wellswas there—that was not as a part of the payment you were to receive; it was to take proceedings in the Proctor's Court—I did not tell you that the collector told me I must administer before I could go into the County Court—I did not say before the Magistrate at Greenwich, that I knew you were not a solicitor—after you first called on Mrs. Spurway, you told me she said she could pay the money, but would not pay without giving me further trouble—I did not tell you that she said she had been told she was not liable, as she had not administered—she told me herself she had not administered—I know a man named Fogo, who attends the Greenwich Police Court—he did not advise me to take these proceedings against you—Iwas sent to him by the Police to ascertain if you were a solicitor—I never heard his name mentioned other than by you—he told me since that you were to have been articled to him, but that you were not a solicitor—Wells never called on me on the Friday the money was received; nor in the evening; I did not see him on that day—I did not say to him, on his calling,"Wells, Mart has got the money, he has done wonders, I am perfectly satisfied with all he has done, and he is going to call on me to-morrow to receive some further instructions, and I am going to pay him?" I swear I stated to him on Saturday, when he asked me how I got on with Mrs. Spurway, that the money was to be paid within eight days, and you were to get a Judge's order, and receive the money on that day week—you did not, when you received the money, come over and tell me.</p>

               <p>I should do that—I saw you go into a shop to purchase two pieces of paper—thatwas after I swore the affidavit—you did not ask me to lend 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Wellswas not there—I understood the papers were to take out a summons—yousaid, "Come along, we can go to work now"—I do not know that Fogo told me it was a writ and copy you bought—it was a law stationer's shop; I know the technical name, because Fogo told me—you did not ask me to lend you the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you did not tell me you were going to take out a writ against a man who owed you money—I did not ask to see the papers bought—I saw you make out some papers in a coffee shop—you did not say you were going to see Mrs. Spurway again before taking proceedings—I afterwards went with you to some square; I do not know where; you left me outside when you went in—I did not tell you to see Mrs. Spurway—I gave you the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the Five Bells Tavern for a Judge's order—you told me you saw Mrs. Spurway overnight; you said she wished to put a stop to the pro<lb></lb>ceedings; you said Mrs. Spurway proposed to pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in fourteen days, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week until the debt and expenses were paid—I do not know that you said you could obtain a Judge's order upon that if she would consent—a con<lb></lb>sent to an older was not to be taken to Mrs. Spurway to sign; you did not say if she signed the consent you would require 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the balance of the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you were to be paid—you came to my house next on Friday morning—I asked you what you meant by going to Mrs. Spurway, stating that you were Mr. Pawson's solicitor—I did not say to you that if you went to Mrs. Spur<lb></lb>way she would pay you, or that she had sent to know if it would be all right for her to pay you—I was not at home when she sent to know that—I told you distinctly not to take the money of her, but to let it be paid into Court—Idid not tell you when you first went to Mrs. Spurway that I relied upon the amount of her debt to pay Pawson's bill; I merely said the goods were purchased at that warehouse—you did not tell me you had seen Mrs. Spur<lb></lb>way on the Thursday night, and she had refused to sign the consent, or to pay the money by instalments—you told me the Judge's order was served upon her; you did net say she would pay at once if I reduced the debt—I saw you go into the house; I agreed to take off 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when you came back you did not tell me she had paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in discharge of the debt; you said you had made an arrangement that Mrs. Spurway was to pay 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within eight days—I said, "You have taken off more than 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I did not intend to be more than one half, but never mind—you did not promise to call on the morning of Saturday to pay the money—I was at Greenwich on Monday; I went to the police court to know what I was to do, as I was quite sure you had done me out of my money—I was told to go to Fogo; I never asked you for the money—I told Wells on Saturday that I was to have the money on that day week, that it was to be paid into Court, and I was going with you on that day to get the money out.</p>

               <p>Nichols with a subpoena; I did so; he asked me for his expenses; I told him I was only a clerk, but if he looked on the back of the subpoena, he would see the address, and if he called there they would pay him; when I was attending the trial, he spoke to me about a debt; I told him I woould call and see what could be done; he agreed to give me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my trouble; I told him a solicitor would be required, as he would have to administer, and he could not make her pay without; he told me if I called on Tuesday, he would let me have 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I called on Mrs. Spurway; she said she was not liable; I told her if she did not pay, proceedings would be taken against her; Nichols and I went to London, and I prepared an affidavit of the; debt being due; I then asked him to lend me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I was to have, because I wanted to issue a writ against a; person who owed, me 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I had no money with me; I called on Mrs. Spurway again, and suggested she should pay by instalments of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; I saw Nichols, who said he would take it in that way; I said it would be necessary for him to sign a consent, and if Mrs. Spurway would sign it, a Judge's order could be taken out; I called afterwards again, and Mrs. Spurway said if Nichols would reduce the debt, she would pay at once; Nichols agreed to reduoe half the expenses; I took 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Nichols said he was sorry I took off the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as I should have had that for my extra trouble; I said I was quite satisfied, and the widow would have the benefit; I saw Nichols at the New Cross station, and I told him I would pay the monay then, he ran away, I went after him to pay, I saw him and Fogo talking, and then he gave me into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I remember seeing Nichols on the morning of the trial of Ashton v. Steel—he spoke to me about some debts owing to him, and of Mrs. Spurway's—he asked me if I knew any one who could get them in—I told him, I knew the prisoner had done similar transactions for other parties—I met him on Tuesday morning, he said, he was going down to Mr. Mart's house; would I go with him—he said, "He has arranged with Mrs. Spurway, and he wants 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., would it be right to give it?"—I said, I had no doubt it would be all right—I went down with him to the prisoner's house—he agreed to pay him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and asked if that would be sufficient—the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was for any trouble he might have in getting Mrs. Spurway's money—hesaid, "I will give you 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down to-day;" that was to be in part of the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not hear any thing said about the Proctor's Court—on Friday I called on Nichols, I asked him how the affair was going on—he said, Mart had arranged with Mrs. Spurway, and he was perfectly satisfied with what had been done, and the money was to be paid over on the following Saturday.—Imet him on the Saturday afternoon, and he said, you had taken Mrs. Spurway's money—I said, "If there is anything wrong, Mr. Mart will make it all right; let us go together to him"—he said, "I have something better coming off on Wednesday; I shall not trouble myself"—he did not say, "I am done"—perhaps he might have said something to that effect; that he was dissatisfied—on Wednesday, I heard the prisoner was taken before the magistrate—I called on Nichols in the evening; I asked him how he was going on—he said, "Oh, it's all right, I have got him locked up; I shall want you to go to-morrow morning to swear that the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid to take out proceedings in the Proctor's Court"—I said "I shall do no such thing; I never heard any thing of the kind mentioned, the money was to be for Mr. Mart's trouble"—I never offered money to Nichols for Mr. Mart.</p>

               <p>lived in that way more than ten years—I live in Frauds Street, Deptford—Ihave known the prisoner three years; not very intimately—I recommended him to Nichols—I did not tell him he was a solicitor—I swear Nichols said, the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was to be for the prisoner's own trouble—I did not hear it said, that it was for his own trouble and the expenses—I was called as a witness before the magistrate—I adhere to the statement that the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was for his trouble—Mr. Nichols said, "If that is not enough, I will pay you more," and Mart said, "I shall be satisfied;" I adhere to that.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition was here read.</hi>)—"I am a shoemaker. I called upon Mr. Nichols on Friday—he told me he was perfectly satisfied with what Mart had done; that the money was to be paid on the following week—Iwas present at Nichols' when he paid the prisoner 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he was to have 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—I did not hear that Mart was to have this for his own trouble, or whether it was for legal expenses."</p>

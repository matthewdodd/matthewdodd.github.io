               <p>I was coming out to give my wife some instructions, and I heard the cry of stop thief; the prisoner was running very swift, and many following him; it was Saturday, the 30th of March, about seven in the evening, in White-horse-court I stopped the prisoner; he had under his coat this parcel of handkerchiefs; I had my handkerchief in my hand when I seized him, and in the scuffle the handkerchiefs dropped.</p>
               <p>Did you see him drop the handkerchiefs? - I swear he dropped them, for there was no soul near till my niece came and picked them up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whereabouts was it that I was stopped? - About four or five doors from my own door; the prisoner shuffled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180007"></xptr>the handkerchiefs from under his left arm.</p>
               <p>If you saw me shuffle the handkerchiefs, why did not you pick them up? - I called for a light; I could not see them.</p>

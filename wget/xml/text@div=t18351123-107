               <p>we are Parliamentary agents. The prisoner was our clerk on the 4th of September, and had been so since January or February, 1834—he had never been authorized to discharge bills due from our house, but it was his practice to do so, and we always expected the bills to be brought in by him—Messrs. Vachu, the law-stationers, do business for us—they live in Parliament-street—on the 4th of September, or on the day preceding, (as far as I can recollect,) the prisoner came to me, and stated that Messrs. Vachu were anxious to have a little money from us—he presented a bill for business done by them for us in the Yarmouth election case—I have no doubt that, in consequence of that, I wrote a cheque, as I find here one drawn on that day, and signed by myself and partner, Mr. Joseph Sherwood—I did not write a banker's name across it, for Mr. Sherwood keeps an account of the bankers' names, and I do not know them—I merely write "and Co." upon it—the other part was to be filled up by Messrs. Vachu—this cheque was obtained from our bankers, by Mr. Sher<lb></lb>wood.</p>

Vachu to get the money without its being paid into a banker's the words "and Co." being across it—we had cash to a greater amount than this in Messrs. Drum<lb></lb>mond's hands—we were neither the richer nor the poorer while this cheque remained in our possession—our from consists of Thorpe, Pritt, and Sherwood; and we sign our cheques so.</p>

Sherwood's clerk requested we would make out this bill, without reference to other business—this must have been shortly before the 4th of September, because the business did not conclude till the middle of August—I have no recollection of making any application for the payment—I am pretty certain I did not do it—the prisoner did not call and pay it.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I live at Mr. Edward Law<lb></lb>ford's, Victoria Terrace—I met the prisoner at a public house about 10 o'clock at night, on 28th June—there were three or four girls there, they mixed themselves in our company, and there was an old woman there; I think, perhaps, she was the mother—the prisoner spoke very lovingly to me—when we went out we were making love, and I asked her to go and sleep with me at her house—she said, "Yes," very willingly, but she had not got the key of her house to take me home—I said, "I am not going to sleep in the street; I shall not allow you to sleep in the street, you may come and sleep with me if you like"—I went with her, arm in arm, to my own door, in Victoria Terrace—having entered the house, I felt myself tired—the prisoner said she was not well—I gave her a glass of water—she took off her upper dress—I was so fatigued that while undressing myself I tumbled into my bed—the prisoner was then sitting down with a glass of water in her hand—I got up again, and took the key out of the lock of the door, and put it in the pocket of an old coat that was hanging up—the prisoner did not lie down on the bed when I went to bed, she was sitting still—I went to sleep, and I awoke in the morning about 6 o'clock—I looked about, and said, "I had a woman here last night, what has become of her?"—I found my watch was gone, and a coat and waistcoat, and a <hi rend="italic">porte mon<lb></lb>naie</hi>—I went to my friend, and went with him to the police station, and took a policeman to my house—when I went with the prisoner to my house, my friend Charles was with me—he wished us good night at the door—no other woman went with me to the house—I think I saw the prisoner once afterwards at her mother's, but she hid herself when she saw me—I know the prisoner is the woman—I knew her four or five weeks before—I had nothing to say to her, only shaking hands—after the policeman took her I saw her at the station—I have never said that I believed she was not the woman—I recognised her immediately—I knew her mother after the theft—they were together at the public house that night—the mother had been drinking with us, but I think she had left before we went away—she did not accompany us.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I live in Victoria Terrace; the prosecutor lodged in the same house. I did not observe anything on that Saturday night, but on the Sunday morning, between 2 and half past 2 o'clock, I heard the breaking the lock of the door which awoke me, and then I heard a person walking along the passage, and go out and shut the street door, and pass by the window—it</p>

               <p>was quite daylight, and I saw it was the prisoner; I am quite sure she is the person—I saw her distinctly, her bonnet was trimmed with blue—she had some bundle under her arm under her shawl, and something black hung down—I saw a pair of scissors on the next morning on the floor of the prosecutor's room, and a broken poker—I knew the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She came to the police station, and there was another young woman there for something, and she asked the prosecutor whether it was me or the other young woman; she did not know which; she has gone by another name; the prosecutor pointed me out to her, and she said at the public house that she was sorry he had not told her more, for she would swear anything; she said her landlady was always finding fault with her for speaking to Basten, but she always would, and she drank with him.</p>

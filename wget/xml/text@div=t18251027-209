I said, "You have the note in your hand" - he said, "It is 2 s. 3 d.," which he paid, leaving the debt just 4 l. - he said, "Now I owe you 4 l." He began to be a coal-merchant some time in 1821, and I received directions from him about supplying beer - he contracted a bill for beer and other things at his house, between 3 l. and 4 l.; I knew of the supply of these things; he said he was going into the coal line, and he expected some money from the West Indies, and he would pay me altogether - we used to keep his account chalked up - he used to come to my house to spend his evenings, and was frequently looking to the place where his account was chalked up; he had an account of it rendered to him from time to time - he sometimes came and ordered the beer, and sometimes it was sent by my lad; I am sure he had the account delivered to him - there was no dispute between us at that time. He brought the bill one day to my wife in 1821, and said to her, in my presence, that he would not have his wife and his father-in-law to know it for a good deal - this was the bill for between 3 l. and 4 l.; my wife wrote it out, and my son delivered it to him - this bill was entered in the book I have here; it is partly my wife's writing, and partly my son's. After this I delivered him a second bill in 1822 - part of that was for beer for the coal-heavers - he came himself, and ordered us to let the men have sometimes one gallon, and sometimes two gallons of beer; there was none delivered to them but one gallon without his orders. The beer delivered to him in 1822 was by his order - it was sent down to the water-side to the men - when it was carried out I sometimes marked it up myself, the boy used to come back and say, "There is so much to set down to Mr. Leslie," and it was entered in the book from time to time - he used to come very frequently, and say, "That account of mine is getting very long. I must have it cast up." He used to come two or three times a week; he never called upon me to pay me any money, or said I owed him any till his affairs became embarrassed. There was an account of 15 l. 1 s. 8 1/2 d., which I delivered myself, after I was served with a copy of a writ, but I had delivered a similar account about October 1823 - after I left my house; that I can swear on my oath; he came evening or two after, and said it was all right but one gallon of porter; he never in his life said that it was not right till the action was brought against me - I owed him 14 l. 13 s. for coals, labour, and carting - so that there was 8 s. 8 d. owing to me. He has since been discharged under the Insolvent Debtors' Act - I was the assignee; this book was all that was handed to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you deal with him for any bushels of coal? A. Yes; but I always paid for them regularly. I never set off the account for the beer against these coals; when he had been at my house we never made any sort of balance - he never paid me any money but that 4 l. 2 s. 3 d. - I can swear I never stopped it out of the coals - I never was answerable to a person of the name of Best; nor did the defendant ever lend me any money to pay Best - I never requested him to pay Best any money; there was a 5 l. note given to Best, one night in my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you not give him credit for the amount of his bill, when you sent in your bill? A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270104"></xptr>thought it was not necessary - he had sent in my bill for that amount.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did not Mr. Leslie pay you 4 l. 2 s. 3 d., on one occasion? A. Yes; it was for beer and spirits - and I believe there was some borrowed money. There was no part of it for money I had lost in playing with him.</p>

             Re-examined. Q. Who do you live with now? A. Mr Berry. I once lived with Mr. Leslie about twelve months. I then went to live with Mr. Smith, for about eighteen months - I went in 1822, and left in 1824. When I lived with Mr. Leslie, he was carrying on the coal trade - he often went to the public-house kept by Mr. Smith. I used to go and order the boy to bring the beer for Mr. Leslie's coal-heavers, to the water side; he used to have coals in every two or three weeks, and then there was a certain allowance of beer, which was chalked up at Mr. Smith's over the beer engine, sometimes by Mr. Smith, and sometimes by Miss Smith - this went on regularly and fairly, while I lived with Mr. Leslie, and afterwards, while I lived with Mr. Smith - when the chalk-place got full, it was put in the book. I have heard Mr. Leslie say, it had better be put in the book, as the place was full. I cannot swear that he said that more than once in my hearing, this was while I lived with Mr. Smith - I do not know that I saw Mr. Leslie go more than once to look at the chalk score; he spent his evenings there frequently, but I never heard any dispute about the chalk score, nor saw any account in writing between them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever fetch any beer for the coal-heavers? A. Yes; it was for them - but Mr. Leslie used to tell me it was to be put up for them - he never gave me any money for it. - I never saw him but once look at the chalk-score - I never heard him say to Mr. Smith, that he thought the coal-heavers had too much beer, and not to trust them so much.</p>

            . I am a coal-porter. I assisted in delivering coals to Mr. Leslie, when he carried on business - they then got their beer at Master Smith's - the allowance was according to the quantity of coals - I remember one night, some time ago, Leslie coming to Mr. Smith's house and saying, he never would pay for this gallon of beer we had had - he said it, I suppose, about a dozen times in the room where I was - he called Mr. Smith to bring the bill, and he did bring it - it was 15 l. 1 s. 8 d. - I did not hear him say whether the account was true, or whether it was not - I did not see him pay anything; nor hear him say what the difference between them was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you leave working for Mr. Leslie? A. I have not worked for him this twelve months, or more - I had no dispute with him - I will swear that he never charged me with any misconduct, or with taking any of his property; we parted on good terms - I never saw Mr. Leslie pay for any beer that we had, nor did I ever receive any money to pay Mr. Smith. - I never heard Mr. Leslie say we were having too much beer, and not to trust us too much - I am employed by the parish in which I live, when I have nothing else to do. I go on Fridays and Mondays, and have 1 s. a day for it - Mr. Smith never advanced me any money when I was in distress - I do not owe him a farthing.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Smith's about November, 1823, when there was a dispute about a gallon of beer - Leslie said he never ordered it, and would not pay for it - he had a bill in his hand; I understood it was 15 l. 1 s. 8 d., - he did not dispute any thing but the gallon of beer - Mr. Smith asked him to balance the bill, and said there was a balance due to him of 7 s. or 8 s. - he said that Leslie's mother-in-law had reported about the neighbourhood, that he owed him for a five of coals, and he could not get the money; and he wished the account to be settled between them - Leslie denied having the gallon of beer, but said nothing against the balance of 7 s. or 8 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was going on in the house? A. The men were sitting drinking their beer; I saw no game going on, nor any pack of cards - I saw the bill in Mr. Leslie's hand, and he handed it round to the company and said here's a "Bill delivered" - and "Bill delivered" - "What does bill delivered mean?" and he asked if that was a proper bill to be delivered; but he did not object to pay any thing, only the gallon of beer. I understood that gallon of beer to be in the bill - because he said it was not legal, and he would never pay it. I am in the habit of having beer there, but I do not owe 1 d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he say about it? A. He held the paper in his hand and said, here's a "Bill delivered" - and "Bill delivered" - I don't understand it?" He did not say any thing about any gambling debt that I know of - he did not say any thing about this being for money lost at play.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was at the public-house the night the last witness was there. I saw Leslie, and heard the dispute about the gallon of beer. I saw only one account which was handed over, and he asked me to look at it, but I did not; some words occurred, which caused the bill to be brought forward, concerning what Mr. Smith owed Mr. Leslie. Smith said, "What is the reason you suffer your father-in-law, or mother-in-law, to say I have had five chaldrons of coals, and you can't get the money for them - you have my account, and I have your's, and there is very little between us;" the bill was held up by Mr. Leslie, who said "Here's a pretty bill, what does it mean." Mr. Smith said, "I can't give the bill every time, but if you look at the different times you will see what it is for - I let your men have beer from time to time, and considered it the same as you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you have the bill in your hands? A. No; I did not see any of the items of it - he did not complain of any of the items; he read these words from the account. After he had read "Bill delivered," and</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I remember being at Mr. Smith's in 1819, or 1820, when he kept the Lord Exmouth, in Catherine-street. Leslie was there and Mr. Smith, and several other persons were sitting in the parlour.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270105"></xptr>I saw Leslie give Mrs. Smith a 5 l. Montgomery note, and told her to take part of the bill - she went out of the parlour, and came back with a 1 l. note, and asked Leslie if he knew what note he gave her; he said it was a 5 l. Montgomery note. Mr. Smith then asked what odd money there was - he said 2 s. 3 d. Mr. Smith then went out, and came in behind Mrs. Smith, and brought in the change of the 1 l. note, which he handed to Mr. Leslie - and Leslie said "Now I owe you even money, just 4 l." I am not positive about there being any paid for what we had that night by Leslie, but he lent me a 5 l. Montgomery note that evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who repaid this? A. I did that day week. I asked Leslie for it in Mr. Smith's presence. I had been intimate with Leslie before, but he had never lent me any money - he asked Mrs. Smith if she thought it was right, and she said "Yes." I suppose he meant, if it would be safe. Mrs. Smith said, she would lent me one, if I wanted it. I cannot remember that Mr. Leslie said, he regretted there had been so much trust about the beer.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is that your book containing Mr. Leslie's account? A. Yes; It is entered by my wife and my son; this other book is one delivered by the Insolvent Debtor's Court to me, rendered up by Mr. Leslie.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your daughter in London? A. No, she is married, and gone into Yorkshire two or three months ago. I attended before the arbitrators in this cause; I told my daughter there was no necessity for her coming here; I heard that Mr. Ford was inquiring after her, and my wife said she was at Pocklington.</p>

I remember a person named Wyard being in his service; he was discharged for receiving money and applying it to his own use; I am a freeholder of Middlesex; I heard of Mr. Leslie being in Mr. Smith's debt; when I called on Mr. Smith for a bill, he said "He owes me money."</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to HENRY SMITH. Q. Where is your son John? A.

            . I am a labourer. I was a coal-porter, and have delivered coals for Leslle, at several times, from 1821 to this time - on those occasions the beer was always brought down to us at the barge - either Mr. Leslie or his wife sent the money down to us for it - I worked for him sometimes once in a month, and sometimes once in two or three months - I never heard any charge given about credit - I heard Mr. Leslie say to Smith, "If you trust these men with any beer in my name, I will not pay you, by God" - he said this several times.</p>

Leslie was then in Whitecross-street. - I did not tell Leslie or his friends what had passed, but I spoke to his attorney in a few days, and the attorney told me it was necessary for me to be here, and say what he had told me - when I told the attorney I had got that answer, he did not make any overtures to settle.</p>

               <p>HENRY SMITH Re-examined. Q. When was the first item in this account? A. It is for beer sold in 1821, 3 l. 15 s. 4 1/2 d., which Mr. Leslie had a great deal of for the bricklayers, while they were building his house, before he began to be a coal-merchant.</p>

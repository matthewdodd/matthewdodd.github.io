            ; he was apprehended at Paddington, near the White Lion; he was taken to the White Lion; I asked him where he got the five pound note which he had given to his sister to get changed, he denied that ever he had given her one, she was afterwards called into the room in the prisoner's presence, she was asked where she got the five pound note that she changed at Mr. Bone's; she replied of her brother the prisoner, he then said he had given it her, he was then asked where he got it, he said he could not tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Q. Were you with Adkins when lie applied to the girl - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe when the girl was first applied to it was represented to her that her brother had passed a forged note and you duly wanted to trace it - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200038"></xptr>They said they supposed it was a bad one, the mother did, we let it pass we did not want to alarm them.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether Adkins did not convey to her that you only wanted to trace the note because you thought it was a forgery - A. I do firmly believe Adkins did not.</p>
               <p>Q. However the impression on the poor girl's mind was that it was to get her brother out of trouble, supposing it was a bad note, and you only wanted to trace it - A. Perhaps it might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. The mother suggested it and you let that pass - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she told you that she received it from her brother, before that suggestion of it being a bad note arose - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. You are a Police officer of Bow-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner - A. Yes, on Tuesday the 5th of September at Paddington near the White Lion public-house, I told him that I was an officer of Bow-street. I was come to apprehend him on suspicion of stealing two five pound notes, he said he did not know any thing about it, I then asked him where he got the five pound note that he had given to his sister to get changed at the public-house, he said that he had never gave her a five pound note. I asked him two or three times at the place where I apprehended him, and then I took him to the White Lion, and then he was asked by Mr. Sparke the last witness, he denied it then. The sister was then brought into the room, she was asked where she got the five pound note that she changed at the public house, she said that she had it of her brother in his presence, he said then that he did give it to her, but he did not know where he got it: there were many questions put to him where he got it, he positively denied knowing where. I took him down to the office, and then went with Mr. Sparke to search his father's house, we searched the father's house and found nothing. The next morning I went with Mr. Sparke to a Brewhouse, there we traced the other five pound note, it was taken from Mr. Lloyd at the White Lion. When I went back I asked the prisoner if he had his breakfast, he said he had, I told him that the other five pound note was was traced to Lloyd, he began to cry and said he was sorry he had told me a story when I apprehended him, he did give the five pound note to his sister and the other five pound note he gave to Mrs. Lloyd. I asked him what he had done with the letter that he had taken out the note, he said he had tore the letter, I then asked him what he had done with the money, the ten pound; he said he had lost a great deal of money when he was first employed in the post-office by not knowing the marks of the letters, he had made use of that money for the purpose of what he had borrowed to make up the deficiency that he was behind; he cried very much. I asked him if he would like to see his father, he said No, he was ashamed to see him.</p>

            , who is a widow and keeps the house. On the night of the 5th of May, about twenty minutes past ten o'clock, I went to bed. My mother was out nursing; I have a child and a housekeeper. I am a widower; I fastened the door and shut the windows, and about one o'clock was disturbed by a noise in my bed-room; I had only shut my bed-room door-I laid still three or four minutes, and heard a person breathe; I drew back my curtain and saw a person by my bed-side; it was moon-light. He went out directly, and I followed him into the yard and seized him; he told me not to strike him, but to call the watch. Mrs. Sutcliffe the lodger called the watchman, and he was secured. I found two umbrellas, a knife, and a basket, moved from the passage into the yard - I suppose he had been in the yard before, the umbrellas hung outside the kitchen window. Mrs. Sutcliffe's parasol and umbrella were also there; I found the kitchen window had been pulled back, it was secure at night, shut, but not fastened. The kitchen is on the ground floor, and so is my bedroom. When we got to the watch-house I missed two shillings out of my breeches pocket, and he said he had taken them out of my pocket, they hung on a chair by the bed-side.</p>

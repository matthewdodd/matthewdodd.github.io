            . I live at Ridgment, in Bedfordshire, near the Duke of Bedford's. Being at work, at Stanmore, I came to London last Saturday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176406070012"></xptr> was a week, to see my son, who is an apprentice to a blacksmith, in Moor-fields: I had had two pints of beer at a public-house, in North-Audley-street; I left that house about twelve at night, and went to another in Tottenham court-road; going from thence to see my son, it was near one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Warren. I was as sober as I am now. I had not been out of the house four or five minutes, before I was attacked: I was easing myself, and the prisoner came behind me, and threw me down on the stones, and began to rifle my pockets; I got away from him, and ran up Oxford road; there I saw him again, and he down with me again, by kicking up my heels, as I ran along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any weapon he had?</p>

               <p>Warren. No, I saw none. He then fell upon me, and I hollowed out for the watch; but he got hold of the handkerchief I had about my neck. So that I could not make much noise; he had like to have throtled me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>Warren. I cannot remember that he said any thing to me, either of the times; he got his hand to my coat and breeches pocket, but the watch came so sharp upon him, that he had not time to take my purse: I had fast hold of his hand when in my pocket: two watchmen came when he was upon me, and took him to the round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any thing from you?</p>
               <p>Warren. I lost a six-pence and some halfpence out of my coat pocket, and my handkerchief from my neck: my handkerchief was found upon him at the watch-house; (produced and deposed to): there were a shilling and some half-pence found upon him in the watch-house. I do suppose I should have lost my life, if help had not come.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 5th of May, at night, as I had just called the hour two, I heard a man crying out in Soho-square, in great distress, seemingly; I darkened my lanthorn, and ran towards the noise; I found the prisoner upon his knees on the prosecutor, as he lay on his left side; the prisoner jumped up, and said; watchman, I charge you with this man, meaning the prosecutor. I said, friend, I shall charge you, for I believe you to be the aggressor; I took him by the collar, and

            , another watchman, came to my assistance: the prisoner said, are you taking me to the round-house? and attempted to slip off his frock, to get away from me; then I knocked up his heels, and we were forced to knock him down two or three times, before we could master him. We took him to the watch-house, and delivered him to Mr. Green, the constable of the night: when in the watch-house, Mr. Warren said he had lost his handkerchief; then the prisoner delivered it out of his hand to the constable; we secured his hands as we brought him along, so that I know he had it not in his hands then; but the first of my seeing it in the watch-house, was in his hand; he must have taken it from his pocket; he was searched, and a shilling and some halfpence were found upon him. The prosecutor said that was not his money; his was a six-pence: the prisoner said he got the handkerchief from him at the first attack, as it came off the prosecutor's neck, and he kept it.</p>

            . Between the 5th and 6th of May, I saw two men running along, the prisoner at the bar was the last of them; he cried Stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Bettoe. This was some distance from Soho-square: I made a blow at the prosecutor, expecting he was the thief, but I missed him; my staff flew out of my hand: when I came up to my box again, I saw the other watchman running, and I followed into the square; when I came there, I found the prisoner in his custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you first saw them running?</p>
               <p>Bettoe. It was very near a quarter of an hour after: the prosecutor said he had lost his handkerchief, and sixpence and some half-pence. Kelly seemed to talk as if there had been a quarrel betwixt them: as we were going to the watch house, the prisoner endeavoured to make his escape; we had much ado to get him there. I heard him acknowledge the handkerchief was the prosecutor's handkerchief, and that he got it in the struggling, as it slipped off his neck.</p>
               <p>Matthew Green, the constable, gave the same account as the watchmen did, as to what passed in the watch-house. *</p>

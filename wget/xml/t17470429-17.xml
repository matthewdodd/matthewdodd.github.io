            . What have you to say against the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Ellis. On the 24th of March last, in the Evening, I was coming from Leaden-hall , this Man, the Prisoner, was behind me, and I felt his Hand in my Pocket; immediately I turned round and said, You Rogue, you have picked my Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner do?</p>
               <p>Ellis. I will not swear that he took the Handkerchief out of my Pocket, I will swear he had his Hand in my Pocket, and I caught hold of his Hand, and then I saw my Handkerchief down on the Ground; I took hold of him directly, and said he had picked my Pocket; I took my Handkerchief off the Ground just by him and I.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What will you have him asked?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether there were no other Persons passing and repassing .</p>
               <p>Ellis. I felt his Hand in my Pocket, and seized him.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Have you any Witnesses?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have none but my Master, and he is out of Town.</p>

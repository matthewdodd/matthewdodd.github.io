                  </hi>. I live at No.10, New Inn-passage, Clare-market I have known the prisoner for the last eight years—I have dealt with him in books occasionally for the last two years—I have lost a good many books, and these seventeen I am quite positive are mine—I did not sell any of them to any body—I lost these, I should think, within the last four months—the value of them is 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., altogether—they are my property.</p>

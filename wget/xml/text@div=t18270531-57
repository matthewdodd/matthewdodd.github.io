On the 11th of April the prisoner came to the shop and looked out a coat, waistcoat, trowsers, and a cap, which he put on; he tendered me a paper in payment, which I read, and told him it was of no service; he said very well, he could get it changed at his agents on Tower-hill; I sent a man there with him to receive the money, and ordered him not to part with him without it.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Shoobridge's employ. The prisoner had put these clothes on; I went with him to receive the money - he had talked of drawing money out of the Bank, and in Cornhill I said, "There is the Bank" - he said, "No; there are plenty of banks;" he went into a banking-house in Lombard-street, and produced the paper; the clerks laughed at him, and told him it was of no use - he then said he would go to Tower-hill - I said, "Where there?" he said, "Oh! to some place there; never mind;" I said he must return and settle with Mr. Shoobridge, and as we returned he ran from me in Bow-lane, but I followed and secured him.</p>

            . I only know that the prisoner was brought back to my shop - I desired him to pull off the clothes, and gave him in charge; there was then no appearance of his being wrong in his mind, but there is now no doubt of his having been deranged for some time.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

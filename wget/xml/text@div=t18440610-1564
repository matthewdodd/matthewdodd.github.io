I am an artist, and live at No. 21, James-street, West<lb></lb>minster; the prisoner Emma was engaged to assist my nursery-maid, and had been with us about a fortnight—she slept at home. On the 21st of May I received a letter from my wife, with a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in it—I put it into my dress<lb></lb>ing-gown pocket, and on going up stairs at night I put it into my dressing<lb></lb>case in a hurry—I am sure I put the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and letter in and locked it, but a slight portion of the corner of the letter was visible outside—I opened my dressing-case next morning, about seven o'clock—I found the letter had fallen down in the box, and the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was missing—I recollect the note had the name of Scott and Co. on the back of it, but do not know the number.</p>

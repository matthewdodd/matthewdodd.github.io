That he went into the Kitchin, and found the Prisoner sitting at the End of a Table , and saying to him, have you kill'd the Maid? But he made no answer. Did you fire the Pistol? He reply'd, I did shoot; and putting his Hand in his Pocket, gave him the Pistol . That he ask'd the Occasion of his doing it, but he gave no answer; and that the Maid did not live above 10 Minutes. This Evidence being ask'd, if there had before been any Quarrel between them?

            . I am the son of Ann Wall, and live in my mother's house. I know the prisoner; he used to sleep with me. On the night of the 20th, he was not in bed with me; I heard some silver fall from the bed to the floor; I was just got into bed; I was not asleep; it was about a quarter before eleven. I felt on the bed, and there was silver there also. I kept my clothes in a box, in this room; this box was not locked. I searched my box, and missed two coats and a pair of trowsers. I had had six shillings worth of silver in the pocket of the trowsers; the silver which I found on the bed and on the floor was that which I had in the pocket. I had seen the prisoner going up stairs at about four o'clock that afternoon. I did not see him after that. He had lodged three or four weeks in the house. I valued the two coats at two pounds ten shillings, and the trowsers at ten shillings; I had not worn them much; they stood me in ten pounds five shillings when I purchased them. I can't tell rightly how long I had worn them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus. My mother is a widow; it is her house. The silver was emptied out of the pocket; he did not take that. When I saw him at four o'clock, he was considerably the worse for liquor. I saw my clothes on the morning of the 20th, they were safe then.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, at Poplar. I have seen the prisoner before; he has pawned several things with me. He offered the coats to pledge with me at a few minutes before eight in the evening of the 20th of November. (Coats produced.) I suspected he had stolen them, and therefore stopped him and the coats.</p>

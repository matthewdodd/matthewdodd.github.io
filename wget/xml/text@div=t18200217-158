I only knew the prisoner a few days before the robbery; she called on me two or three times that day. I was quite a stranger in this country, and agreed to lodge with her; she said she had moved her things, and I had better move mine. She persuaded me to go out with her. I left my lodgings with her at half-past six o'clock. She took me into a public-house in Ratcliff-highway, and left me there, saying she would return in two or three minutes, she never returned. I did not see her again till the 29th, when she was in custody. I got back to my lodgings about nine o'clock, and missed my two trunks, containing the articles stated in the indictment, and many more. The day she was taken I saw my trunks at her husband's lodgings, No. 8, Russell-court.</p>

            . The prosecutrix lodged with me in Vinegar-yard. On the 11th of January she left the house with the prisoner. The prisoner came again about half-past seven o'clock with a coach - I knew they had agreed to lodge together, and therefore let her take the trunks away. When the prosecutrix returned, I told her the prisoner had taken them away. On the 29th the prisoner called upon me and I stopped her. She desired me to say she had bought the things of Mrs. Chawner.</p>

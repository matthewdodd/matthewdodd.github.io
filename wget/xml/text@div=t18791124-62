                  </hi>. I live at 14, Kenning's Buildings, Rotherhithe—the prisoner is my husband—on Saturday night, 18th October, he came home at 9 o'clock very much in liquor; he asked me if I was in—I said "Yes"—I was upstairs; I brought the lamp to the landing to show him the way up—he came into the room and began quarrelling—a short time after he laid on the floor on his hands and face, then getting up he attempted to strike me—in leaning down to save my face I caught a kick at the lower part of me, which caused blood to flow—he accused me of being drunk—after that he pitched down on his hands and face across the foot of the bed on his stomach, and I laid down by the side of the table on the floor</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240139"></xptr>
               <p>—I then went for Mrs. Wand; she was not in—she afterwards came to my assistance, and that disturbed him; he said to her "You go out; what business have you here?"—he had then been asleep over three hours, and was getting towards being sober—what occurred between them I don't know; I was not capable of taking any notice; I still kept bleeding, and I was insensible from loss of blood—when he first began quarrelling, Mrs. Holland came in, and he ordered her out of the room and shut the door, locked it, and placed the key on the washstand—after he had fallen asleep I got to the washstand and got the key and unlocked the door, and asked the little girl Holland to fetch me a cup of water, which she did—I don't remember the prisoner saying anything about that.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Wand, and live at 11, Kenning'8 Buildings, Rotherhithe—on the night of 18th October I was called to Mrs. Rogers's room—she was lying on the floor bleeding, she could scarcely lift her hand to her head—the prisoner was lying on the bed, he was not sober—he got off the—bed and said he would throw me down the stairs, and asked his wife what she was making all those faces about, at the same time lifting his foot to kick her—he did not kick her again; I prevented him—I stayed there till the police came—the prisoner endeavoured to push me out, having a vase in his hand—the blood was flowing from the bottom part of her person—the prisoner was not sober—I should hardly think he knew what he was doing.</p>

I am surgeon to a division of police, and live at Union Road, Rotherhithe—on Sunday morning, 19th October, after midnight, I was called to 14, Kenning's Buildings—I found Mrs. Rogers lying on a bed which was saturated with blood, and her clothing was saturated with blood—she was bleeding from a wound just inside the vagina—there were marks of kicks on the inside of her thighs—she had been kicked all about that region—the whole of the structures of the vagina had been divided by some violence, probably a kick from a boot—the wound reached to the bone, and was still bleeding—very great violence must have been used to produce such a wound—the woman was in danger of her life; it was two days before she was pronounced out of danger at the hospital, and a fortnight before she was able to leave her bed—it was scarcely possible to step along the room without putting your foot into a pool of blood—she was pulseless, and as near dead as possible; the place looked like a shambles—she is getting on since she has been attended by the hospital authorities.</p>

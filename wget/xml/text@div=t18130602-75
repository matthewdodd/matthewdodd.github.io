               <p>Q. Did you on the 9th of April last, receive three five-pound notes of the last witness at the Bank - A. I did, sir; one of the notes I put in this pocketbook on the 15th of April and placed it on the mantle-piece, and left it there by accident, and went out the whole of the day; when I came home at night I did not go into the room not till the next morning. On Saturday morning I examined the book; the five-pound note was gone; upon missing the five-pound note I called my servant, and told her of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner: believe at that time was in the service of Mr. Smith - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is Mr. Smith's house in - A.St. Goorge's, Bloomsbury.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of what you heard that night did you make enquiry after her - A. I did. In two or three days in the next week I found her lodging with a Mrs. Jacques, in Compton-street. I went there, and when she saw me she asked me what I wanted with her. I told her I knew she knew what I had lost, and that I had come to tell her that I believed she had taken it. She positively denied ever having seen it. Mrs. Jacques then came forward, and said that the prisoner had told her she had changed a five-pound note. The prisoner denied ever having told Mrs.

             any such thing, but on Mrs. Jacques persisting in it that the prisoner had so said, she said if I would excuse her she would tell the truth. I said I would make no condition with her, but I would wish to hear the truth. She then said she found it in the dust bin, but refused to tell me what she had done with it. She said, it is not thieving; you cannot hurt me. I told her I should take her before a magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. That evening did she quit your service - A. Yes, she did, sir. I had given her warning on the Friday before, in consequence of improper behaviour.</p>

On Saturday afternoon, 1st Aug., I saw the prisoner in Lothbury, about half, past 2 o'clock, carrying a large parcel on his back—I followed him as far as St. Ann's Lane, at the back of the Post Office—I stopped him, and asked what he had got in the parcel—he said he had a little waste paper, which was given to him by the superintendent of the East India House, and he was going to make a little money of it—I took him to the station, and from there to the East India House—the prisoner directed me to Mr. Atkins, and I saw him—I asked Mr. Atkins, in the prisoner's presence, whether he had authorised the prisoner to take any of this paper away—Mr. Atkins said, "No, not under any circumstances"—I returned to the station with the prisoner, and he told me he had taken paper away before with Mr. Atkins's consent.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stoke Newington, and am assistant registrar at the East India House. It is my duty to receive manuscript letters which</p>

               <p>come from India—they are called collection—they come from the East Indies in large parcels—they are stamped in the secretary's office, that it may be known to what office they belong—I hand these letters daily to persons in the East India House, and by the stamp they are enabled to return them to me—I have the sole superintendence of them—they are kept in presses up stairs, in a building near my office—subsequent to Jan. last, I commenced transferring some of them from there down to some cellars—there were three messengers and six labourers employed to transfer them, of whom the prisoner was one—that was in consequence of directions I had received, that they were to be destroyed from the earliest date to 1846, inclusive—they had usually been burnt, or cut in pieces, but in this case the Court had decided that they should be sold to papermakers under bond that they should not be made public, but should be reduced to pulp—I superintended this transfer into the cellars, and the prisoner was a mes<lb></lb>senger employed under me—it was his orders to take them into the cellar—I received some information with regard to the six labourers, and I called the prisoner and another messenger, and said, "I have found a quantity of paper up stairs in one of the presses, the consequence of it being taken away will involve you all; this will seriously affect your characters"—they answered, "Yes, of course it will, if it is allowed to go on"—this led to a stricter caution with regard to these papers—after this I received a report that the business had been completed, and these papers were transferred from the presses to the cellars—I went up stairs, and examined the presses—I found in one of them a quantity of paper, I suppose a cwt; that was a place where they had never been to my knowledge, not a place of deposit—it was a press in the entrance of the first room up stairs—I called the prisoner, and said to him, "Whatmough, why have you been stowing away papers up stairs when I had forbidden you to do it?"—he said, "I have not done it"—I said, "Who then?"—he said, "Forbes"—(he is one of the messengers)—I went and spoke to Forbes—I then ordered that portion of paper to be carried to the cellar—it was no part of the prisoner's duty to take any part. of this paper from the East India House, certainly not—the weight of the paper found on the prisoner is about 36 lbs.—this paper was never used in the East India House for lighting fires under any circumstances, nor for waste paper—I had given some French papers and old books to the mes<lb></lb>sengers and to the prisoner, but only to be destroyed—part of the messen<lb></lb>ger's duty under me is, to fetch such part of this correspondence as may be required in any part of the house—that is the case daily—an order would come to me for such a collection—I should give the order to the messenger, and he would go and get it—the messengers are perfectly acquainted with the nature of these documents—I keep a register of all the documents in the presses, not of those in the cellars—I was up at the Mansion House on the first occasion—I was bail for the prisoner, and he called on me, and told me he was guilty of taking the paper, and he hoped I would do what I could for him, or something to that effect.</p>

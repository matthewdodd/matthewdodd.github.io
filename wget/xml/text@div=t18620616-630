                  </hi>. I live at 49, Queen-street, Pimlico—the prisoner lodged with me from 17th March till he was taken in custody—while he lodged there, the soldier there came four or five times—he was there all night—I do not recollect the date—they slept in the prisoner's apartments—they had the whole of the top of the house; besides that I saw him there on other occa<lb></lb>sions—the prisoner's dress was a gray wool coat, cut fashionably, and a little Oxford hat—I never saw him in anything else—I am positive there was nothing like an Inverness cape in the house, for being alone I used often to go and sit with them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give her the beer? - No, the boy drew her the beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day? - It was in the afternoon about half after four o'clock. I went after her myself and took her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the pot, in her pocket? - No, in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was she from your house? - About two hundred yards. When I overtook her (Produced) she said somebody had been playing the rogue with her in the room. There was nothing in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200010"></xptr>pot, only some snuff that she had turned out of her snuff box.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you kept the pot from that time to this? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever sold pots since you kept house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine to see if any of your pots were missing? - I found this missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count your pots? - Yes, after I had taken her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the woman in the habit of using your house? - No, I never see her before; the people that kept the house before me knew her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that she might have had beer out of your house? - Yes, the might. I have lost six dozen.</p>
               <p>Court. She had the pot in her hand, was there any beer in the pot? - I cannot say; there might be the least drop in the world; but I see nothing else but snuff in it, which she put in on purpose to clear herself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I asked you for the change of a shilling, and you did not give it me. I had two quarterns of gin. Did I steal your pot? - You called me a b-ch and a w-re.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL BOND sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a servant out of place, I was going along Duke-street; the prisoner had the pot in her hand when I see her.</p>
               <p>Q.Had she any beer in the pot? - A very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she carry it open? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.In her hands, as any other person might carry it? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she going from or to the house? - From the house; the landlord came up to her, and he said, she had stole the pot; and she said, she had not; but that he had played the rogue with her; she said, she would go into the doctor's shop with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any snuff in it? - There was something in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her put the snuff in it? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The pot was taken from her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. This woman lives in the neighbourhood? - Yes, she does.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen her in the house? - No, not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did she ask for the beer? - She called for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she was going to carry out the pot of beer? - No; it is my pot, Wm. Young is on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Last Monday week I went to this man's house. I was told that the landlord of my house was there. I went there, and he was drinking with two more men; and I called for a pint of beer, and they asked me to drink. I called for two pots more, and the last time that I had the beer to drink, they said, O, you b-b, you have put jalap in the pot; and I thought it was jalap that somebody had been playing the rogue with, and so I said, I will take it to the doctor's, to see whether it is jalap or snuff.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did she give you the money for the beer? - No, to the man; she paid the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the two men with her? - I did not take notice; there were two in the room.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they come with her? - No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, about the snuff, who put that in the pot, do you know? - She put it in; I see her do it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I work hard, and never was charged with a robbery in my life.</p>

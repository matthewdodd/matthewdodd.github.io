                  </hi>. I now live at No. 2, Home-cottages, Park-walk, Chelsea, and am the widow of the late Lieutenant Palmer. I am turned seventy years old—in June, 1853, I hired apartments of Mr. Anderson, at No. 14, Devonshire-terrace, Kensington—before I moved in, I packed up all my things in different packages—I packed up some china in a hamper, and among other things were these three china caps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), among other caps—they are china, and have been in the possession of my family for 150 years—I have known them all my life—the valuer said that they were worth five guineas the set—I am quite mire they were in the hamper with the rest of the china, all three of them—it was all china in the hamper—this footman (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine; it was packed in a coal scuttle—I know these shells (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have had them fifty years—I packed them in a little table, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a model of it—you understand that I make boxes of my tables, being a particular woman—I put my table upside down, and put the things in, then I sew carpets round it, and inside the carpets were these shells, some books, my drawing room window curtains, and a great many other things—after I had packed them up I removed them to my new house in Devonshire-terrace—they were placed in the third room, a little room at the end of the passage, which I locked up, and kept the key—this spice box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was also in the coal scuttle with the footman—in about a fortnight after I got into the house the Stepbensons came, and Mr. Anderson left—after they came, Mr. Stephenson sent me a message, and I went and let him into the room—all my things were there at that time—I think he stayed about five minutes, not more; he measured a place by the window—about a fortnight after that, or a day or two more, I heard that there had been a robbery; it was not three weeks—I wanted to go into the room, and could not open the door—I told Mrs. English, and she opened it, but she had a difficulty—there was a chair turned down inside the room, so that the door would not open, but she got it open, and then I went in, and found that my hampers of china were all gone, my table was cut open, and all my things taken out—I missed a great many articles, worth 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I should have been glad to have given 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—from that time to the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness. In Feb. last I visited the house of the Stephensons in Devonshire<lb></lb>terrace, and noticed on the mantelpiece these cups, which I immediately recognised as my mother's property—I did not notice anything else belonging to my mother on that occasion—I communicated with the officer, Goddard, and with him and Clarke made another visit to the Stephensons, having com<lb></lb>municated with my mother in the meantime—on going into the front par<lb></lb>lour I took the cups off the mantelpiece, gave them to Goddard, and said, "Those are my mother's"—I do not think Mrs. Stephenson heard me the first time, but her sister said, "She has taken the cups off the mantelpiece"—she made no remark—on looking round the room I saw this footman, took it in my hand, and said, "This is my mother's"—Mrs. Stephenson was present, and said, "It is not Mrs. Palmer's"—I looked at it and said, "Yes, this is the place where it has been broken and has been mended," and handed it to the policeman, but Mrs. Stephenson said nothing—the curtains were hanging up at the window, and there were some shells—I said, "These are my mother's shells"—Mrs. Stephenson made no remark; she gave no explanation as to how she became possessed of the footman, the shells, and the curtains—there was also a spice box, which I took up in the same manner in the down stairs room, when we had left the parlour, and I said, "This is my mother's;" she made no reply—I saw the curtains hanging at the window, and said, "Those are my mother's curtains"—Mrs. Stephenson was in the room, but I did not hear her say anything—I tured round, looked into the back room, and said, "Here is the third curtain at the back window; that is the curtain that my mother used at her cot<lb></lb>tage, it is more faded than the other two;"I heard no remark from Mrs. Stephenson at that time—when we came up stairs the officer took the cur<lb></lb>tains down, and Mrs. Stephenson said, "If they are Mrs. Palmer's curtains I knew nothing about them; I bought the ticket of a Mrs. Day; they were pawned in Drury-lane"—Goddard said, "Where does Mrs. Day live?"—she said, "I do not know"—he asked her where she lived when she bought the ticket? and she said that she did not know—I have looked at</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk at the Hammersmith police court. I recollect this case being investigated—I think I recollect the solicitor, Mr. Vaughan, saying that if the case was remanded he should have a complete answer—I did not hear a cupboard mentioned; Mr. Vaughan told the Magistrate openly in Court, loud enough to be heard, that as to the cur<lb></lb>tains he should be able to show how they bought them, and as to the rent of the things he supposed they were left—to the best of my belief, he said "supposed"—the first suggestion about their being found, emanated from Mr. Vaughan, to the best of my recollection—the Magistrate did not make any suggestion about it till the last examination, I think—to the best of my belief, it had been suggested by Mr. Vaughan long before the Magistrate made any suggestion of the kind—on the next occasion evidence was called with respect to the curtains, and the result was that they were ordered to be delivered up to Mrs. Stephenson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of Brook-street, Hammersmith. I was <hi rend="italic">promiscuously</hi> at the police court, Hammersmith; I never had any interest in the matter—I do not recollect the whole of the defence that was stated by Mr. Vaughan, but I recollect some part of it—I recollect him saying that he could bring evidence to prove that the curtains never belonged to the old lady, and that the other trumpery paltry things were left behind after she left her lodgings—the curtains were ordered to be given over to Mrs. Stephenson, and the other paltry things to the other parties—it was never denied that they belonged to the old lady.</p>

                  </hi>. I was one of the defendant's bail. I was present at the examination before the Magistrate—before the examination; Mr. Stephenson sent for me in the first instance—I have known the defendant for fourteen or fifteen years and never heard anything against her honesty and good conduct—she said at the examination that she could prove that she came by the curtains honestly, and Mr. Vaughan stated that the spice box and other things were left behind.</p>

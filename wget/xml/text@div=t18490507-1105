                  </hi> I am the prisoner's wife. On 30th of April, I went to the Red Cross public-house, in Barbican, about five minutes to nine o'clock at night; I found the prisoner there and my landlady's daughter and her husband—he and I began to <hi rend="italic">jaw</hi> one another—(we had been <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> for a couple of days off and on)—he had not been long from home—he would not give me any money, and I went there for the purpose of having a <hi rend="italic">jaw</hi> with him—we <hi rend="italic">jawed</hi> together about ten minutes—he then hit me with his left-hand,</p>

               <p>and then struck me on the left side of the head with a knife which he had in his right-hand—we were both standing at the bar—I did not see how he got the knife—I bled—I was taken to a doctor's—I then came home and gave the prisoner in charge—I had not done anything to him before he stabbed me except <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> with him, and he offered me a pot of beer which I spilt—I aggravated him a little—he did not say anything to me at the time he struck me</p>

I was at the Red Cross, on 30th of April, and saw the prisoner and his wife there—a very few words passed between them—he turned round with his left hand partly open and gave her a blow—he then struck her with his right hand which was closed, on the left side of her head just over the fore-head; she immediately drooped her head—I ran up to her and saw blood pouring in streams from the wound—I took her to Mr. Mason, a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, of Red Cross-street. Mrs. Bennett was brought to me—she had a punctured wound on the left temple which was bleeding very profusely—it had penetrated an inch and a half to the bone, and had divided the anterior branch of the temporal artery—a knife was produced before the Magistrate which might have inflicted the wound—It was a dangerous wound—if it had gone through the bone it would have caused death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 9, Crown-street, Finsburv. The prisoner is my apprentice, and has been so about five years—on the 28th of July I saw Mr. Poore—what he has said is correct—I gave him marked money, and on the afternoon of the 29th of July, after he had been to my shop, I asked the prisoner if he bad not delivered three parcels to a man with a white handkerchief on—(he was then in the parlour at the back of the shop—my sister was present)—he said he had delivered some—I had previously been in the shop to look at the drawer where the duplicates are kept—it is usual to pin the two duplicates together when articles are redeemed—I did not find the duplicates of these three articles—I found two out of the three, the one for the shawl for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the handkerchief for half-a-crown—I, then spoke to the prisoner—he said he had delivered some things—I asked How many, and he said he did not know—the drawer with the duplicates was produced in his presence, by my salesman,-and there was a duplicate for 2. missing—I called the prisoner's attention to that—he did not produce the duplicate for some time—when Sergeant Teakle, who was in plain clothes, came in, I asked the prisoner if he knew him—he said he did, and then pro<lb></lb>duced the duplicate from his left trowsers pocket—I asked him for the money, and he said, "D your eyes, do you want that too?"—I said, "Yes, to be sure"—he took two shillings from his pocket, and threw them down—I took them up—one of them is marked, and is one that I gave to Mr. Poore—I gave the two shillings to Mr. Teakle.</p>

                  </hi> I am assistant to a sheriff's officer—on 16th June, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was passing down the London-road, Southwark—a female came up and walked alongside of me for a short distance—she put her hand on my left arm, saying, "My dear, I want you"—I put my arm out, and said, " I do not want you, I have nothing at all to say to you"—she continued to hold my arm, and I was then seized by a woman on the other side—I then found a man's arm round my neck from behind—I saw his coat sleeve—he put his hand under my chin, and the fingers of another hand were put into my mouth, and my tongue was drawn on one side, which brought me to a stand—the prisoner then came in front of me, took my watch out of my waistcoat pocket, and attempted to break the chain, but could not, so be gave it a twist with both hands—he got the watch and ran away, and then the others let go of me—I ran after him a short distance—he turned back in the road, and ran back to the other parties—two or three more people were standing with them at the spot where I lost my watch—there were about five girls of the town, one of whom, as I followed the prisoner through the crowd, tried to get hold of me, and a man who was with them struck me, but neither of them stopped me—the prisoner darted down a narrow street, but I never lost sight of him—a policeman took him—I have not recovered my watch—it was worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I gave him a sixpence to get some beer, and he said it was a bad sixpence; I then gave him half a guinea to change, and he gave me four half crowns and a sixpence; I gave him sixpence to pay for the beer, and he gave me 2s. 6d. for one of, the half crowns; I went into a chandler's shop in the goal, which I understood belonged to the prisoner; when the beer came they handed it to me, and I tasted it; there was a person in the chandler's shop knew me; I did not know him; he enquired if I knew some people in my neighbourhood; I said I did, very well; when the beer was drank, I said I must go home; I had been there about half an hour; I went through a hatch in the inside gate of the prison; when I was at the hatch the prisoner laid hold of my coat with both hands, and said, I could not go yet, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220020"></xptr>pulled me in at the door, and some persons pushed me behind the door; I tried to get into the shop again, but the prisoner ordered the people inside to shut the door, and I laid hold of the spikes at the top of the door; I then felt some people take my money, there might be seven or eight people struck me at once; the prisoner at that time was hauling me in at the door; it is a door that goes up a staircase on the master's-side, between the hatch and the chandler's-shop; I saw the man take my money, but I should not know him again if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give any reason for pulling you violently in at the door? - A. None at all; several of them beat me till I could scarcely see, I was all over blood; I cried murder! the prisoner had left the door while they were beating me; he came up again and laid hold of me as he did before, and said damn you if you don't come out they will murder you; I told them I would not let go the iron-spike till I saw the place clear; the prisoner then ordered the people to leave off; when they did, I let go the bar; he led me to the door; as I was going out I received a blow on my head which rendered me senseless; I was brought into the wine-room; Owen and Pitt were in the wine-room; when I got out into the wine-room, I examined, and my money was all gone; I made a complaint of the manner in which I had been used; I was bleeding very much.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you ever happen to have been in Newgate before? A. Yes; twice before, once to speak to a waterman, who was in for stealing some copper; my father sent me with some money for him to give to counsel to defend him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take a man to Newgate? - A. I took a man once to New Prison, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the person that accosted you in the room? - A. I think I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he one of the persons you had taken up? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do you know it was not the man you apprehended before? - A. No, it was not; the man murdered his wife that I took to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you ever apprehend the man that accosted you in Newgate? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had this money in your pocket? - A. From the time I went from home; I saw it in Newgate, when I paid the money to the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been twice to Newgate before, once to see a waterman; when did you go the second time? - A. In the time of the riots, I went then out of curiosity.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not through Price you got to speak to this Coleman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was leading you to the hatch when you were struck? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you they would murder you if you did not get out? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then he endeavoured to save you from being murdered? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You fixed on the person that robbed you? - A. No, never.</p>

               <p>Q. Some persons were shewn you that you might fix on the person who robbed you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nobody shewn you at all? - A. No, by no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Not the next day? - A. No, nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the Sheriff there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Kirby there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not some persons called out to you for you to name the person that robbed you? - Q. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fix upon any body? - A. No, I did not fix upon any body, only Mr. Price.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you fix upon a person of the name of Bateman, as the person that robbed you? - A. No; I said there was a person I knew was there; I did not say he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say Bateman was the person who robbed you? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did not you fix upon Bateman; and was it not answered that he could not be the man, for he was one of the quietest men in the gaol? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say if he was not the man, he was very much like him? - A. No; I said the person that robbed me was in a blue coat and white waistcoat; I went that night to Newgate again, and asked Owen to bring him out.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you fixed on the prisoner as one of the persons? - A. I went that night, and Owen brought him into the wine-room, and I knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you acknowledge that Price was the person that saved your life against the other prisoners? - A. Certainly; and I say so now.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. I know the prisoner, he was confined under a judgment of misdemeanor, in February 1794.</p>
               <p>Q. And in consequence of good behaviour you appointed him one of your gate-men? - A. He is one of the gate-men; he has conducted himself extremely well, no man better; a very good servant as ever man had, there has never been any complaint of dishonesty during the time he has been in my custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220021"></xptr>Q. Was he a man that conducted himself quietly in your gaol? - A. Wonderfully so; he is a sober man; I saw the prosecutor there the next day; he said, that the prisoner saved his life before Mr. Sheriff Liptrap; I would have shewn him the man that robbed him; he said, no, no, that is the man; he said, it was Price; he would not look at any other man.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Price dressed on that day? - A. He generally wears a blue jacket, I don't know whether he was so dressed that day; and the last sessions I would have shewn him the man; Wybrow was the man, he is since gone pursuant to his sentence; Price is a man that I would trust with any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This man you saw the next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to doubt his account of his being very much hurt, from his appearance the next day? - A. He was very much so, I wonder he was not killed; we never let a constable go among the prisoners. You know an attorney would not go into the King's-Bench among the debtors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say the prisoner was the man who, with his own hand, took the money out of his pocket? - A. He always said he was the man that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say there were a number of people that robbed him? - A. I suppose there were forty men about him; he said six or seven; I say there were nearer forty.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever pretend that this was the man who, with his own hand, took the money out of his pocket? - A. No; I think he said he held him whilst the others robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, or did he not, say to you, the prisoner was the man who held him while the others took away his money? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am one of the turnkeys; I know the prisoner, Price; I let the prosecutor into Newgate, I cannot recollect the day; I heard the bell ring very violently, Price had him at the gate, he was very bloody; and he said, thank God, you have saved my life! my life is your's and not mine; he said, he was robbed of some silver, I cannot say how much; he said, he had been robbed of his money; Mr. Sheriff Liptrap was there at the same time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The man was bleeding, and in a very bad state? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at all attempt to enter into particulars at that time? - A. I don't know what you mean; because he never accused Price at the time; Price brought him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he at all entered into the particulars of the manner in which he had been robbed then? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he came the next day? - A. Yes; I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then charge the prisoner? - A. He did, before Mr. Liptrap.</p>
               <p>Q. And then entered into the particulars of the business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How did he charge the prisoner the next day? - A. I cannot say much about that; he said, Price held him while he was robbed; and Price was the man that protected him, and brought him out. He swore to Bateman, a transport with us, as the man that robbed him, before he swore to Price; Price was present at the same time; he said Bateman was the man that robbed him. I told him, he might as well charge my daughter with robbing him.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Bateman dressed? - A. In a blue jacket, I believe, I am not positive to the dress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did he not say, that Bateman was there at the time the fact took place? - A. That I will not say; he might as well accuse you of it as Bateman, that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not speak of Bateman as being present at the time? - A. It was one Wybrow that did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath you have taken, did he say any thing more of Bateman than saying he was one of the men there? - A. He accused Bateman first, that Bateman was the man that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In those words? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you mean to say, that he said, that Bateman was the man that actually took the money out of his pocket, or with only being one amongst them? - A. Upon my word and credit, I cannot say; I look upon it, that this man is as innocent as I am; but there was so great a confusion at the time; that, upon my soul, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it might be, that he was one amongst them? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>At the time this man was robbed, I and Pitt were together in the room, we had but just left that man, who had the care of the gate; I heard a great noise of ringing the bell, he and I ran in a great hurry to see what was the matter; Price brought Thompson out, his head had been cut by something or other; he turned round to Price, and thanked him for being his preserver; that his life was his, and that he should have been murdered. I knew Thompson; I asked him how he could think of going in there; and he said, he had been in to speak to a man to relieve him; and I asked him, how he came to be served so; he did not mention the robbery at that time; I sent for the doctor to come and dress his wounds: he had a glass of wine; he put his hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220022"></xptr>in his pocket, and said he had been robbed, he had lost half-a-guinea, two or three half-crowns, and a bad sixpence; I asked him if he could describe the man who robbed him; he said, yes; it was a man in blue cloaths; I said, come here to the gate, and see if you can see him; there was Price, and several others, in the yard, the place was all in confusion; he said, that is the man, and pointed out Bateman; I called Bateman to the gate, he said, Bateman was the man that held him while the others robbed him; Pitt made answer to him, for God's sake, says he, don't charge that man with it; you may as well charge my daughter with it, I am sure he is no such man, there is not a quieter man in the place than Bateman. In a little time after he charged Price with it; he asked me his name, and I told him his name was John Price.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How was Price dressed? - A. He had a blue jacket on, to the best of my recollection; and so had Bateman a blue jacket, or coat, I will not be certain which.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you recollect the words he expressed respecting Bateman? - A. I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Whether it is a right thing for a man to trust himself among prisoners in a gaol? - A. If I was a constable, I would not trust myself in a gaol for five hundred pounds. Price has been in the habit of receiving money from me, five and six pounds of a week; and he is a man I can perfectly place confidence in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner was searched? - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You say he described Bateman as being a person there helping those who did rob him? - A. No; he said, that man in blue, pointing to Bateman, was the person that held him while the others robbed him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear what he said of Price? - A. When he was more reconciled, when Pitt expostulated, and said, he might as well charge his daughter, he turned it to Price.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the same day that he was wounded? - A. It was; I don't believe I had left Price a couple of minutes at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear him say, that Price likewise held him while the others robbed him? - A. No; not till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I ask you whether you recollect the prosecutor acknowledging that the prisoner, Price, saved his life? - A. He did; and thanked him.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. I don't recollect any thing of the time, I believe it was early in the month of May, the prosecutor came to my house, and I went with him to Newgate; when we came there, he said, he had been robbed, and very much beaten, he was in a very bad state; I asked him, who robbed him; he said, he could not possibly tell, there were so many; we sent out for six or seven of them, and he fixed upon a man of the name of Bateman; I asked him if he knew who robbed him; he said, certainly not; I asked him if he knew who gave him those violent blows; and he fixed upon Bateman, and being told it was very improbable that Bateman should do it, he then fixed upon Price, after a great deal of hesitation; that Price was holding him while the rest were beating him; he said, Price rescued him out of the gaol, he believed they would have killed him, that he saved his life; I told him, I thought he was under great obligation to him; he said, he should prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the fixing upon Price as having done any thing, was not till after he had fixed upon Bateman, and after an hesitation? - A. Certainly; he thanked Price for saving him, and said he should prosecute.</p>

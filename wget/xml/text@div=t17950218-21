               <p>Q. Who slept in the house at the time the robbery was committed? - Nobody; my family had gone to live in the house opposite, my family had left it about four or five months before this happened; they were both my houses, my family are in and out of this house every day, but we do not sleep there.</p>
               <p>Q. You left off sleeping in the house before this happened four or five months? - I left off sleeping and eating in the house, but I used it for my trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry on business in this here house? - Yes, I do, to this very day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time any intention of any of your family to return and sleep in this house? - Now and then, because we have generally plenty of beds in this house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you constantly beds in that house there? - Generally. My business is such that there may, or there may not be any there, when I bought any I took and put them up there; I am a cabinet maker and upholsterer, I have one house at the corner of Cross-lane, and another in St Giles's parish, directly facing, and then I have another house just by; I have all these three houses, and I live the corner of Cross-lane, and the robbery was committed in the little house facing where I live, in St. Giles's parish.</p>

               <p>Q. You were uncertain of your intention of ever returning with your family? - I had no intention of returning with my family to sleep there; I believe I should put two or three lads to sleep there when it was warm weather.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see any part of your property again? - Yes. When I was informed by my sons that my house was broke open by an iron crow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of your things again? - Yes, I see them about three weeks afterwards, they were in a house in Earl-street, close by the Seven Dials, No. 9.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there? - Two old blankets and some more of the wretched things in the room, which I did not take; they were in the house of a man of the name of Grace, that keeps a broker's shop, or old iron shop, I cannot tell what you may call it; the tables are here, and the tick of the bed.</p>

            ; I took him to the public house, the sign of the Fox, in Ray-street, Clerkenwell, on Sunday the 8th of this month; there were two other people with me, one was Wilson, who had some particular business to do yesterday at Westminster, and he could not attend when the bill was found.</p>

               <p>Q. To Grace. How soon after the officer had taken these things out of Sermon's room did you see Sermon? - I did not see him till he was taken up and before the magistrate at Marlborough-street, and I was desired to appear at Marlborough-street by the constable, and I did.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know the ticken by the mark at the corner, it is bound with red tape, I bought it at a sale for the sake of the feathers; it is a goose feather bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you bought it before this happened? - I fancy about two months before this happened; I know the table, I was brought up a cabinet maker all my life, I bought the wood on the wharf, cut the logs, and my men made them; they have been made two or three months.</p>

            What reason have you for knowing that these articles, the bed and the tables were in your house, in St. Giles's, on the 22d of January? - I can bring my porter to witness that they were there that very evening.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Sermon. If they are the same property that was taken out of my room, how they came there was, a young fellow came to me last Sunday was three weeks, and asked me to let him leave some things, for he expected to be seized upon; I gave him leave to leave them, and on Monday he brought these things, if they are the same that belonged to Mr. Clarke; I made all the enquiry about the person who left them with me, and could not find him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bromley. I know nothing of it, I was out at my mother's at the time he brought them into the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Sermon. I wish you would call my landlord to my character.</p>

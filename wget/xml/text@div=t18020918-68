               <p>THOMAS FLETCHER sworn. - Q. What have you to say against the prisoner? - A. On Sunday the 8th of August, I was coming home from Blackwall to Chancery-lane, about half past twelve o'clock at night; I was knocking at my own door in Chancery-lane, where I have a lodging; the prisoner at the bar came up to me, and said, are you locked out? I said, yes; the prisoner said, I am chamber-maid at an inn, in Holborn, I can help you to a very good bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you waited some time at the door? - A. I had been some time at the door; I told her, I should go, and she went along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had that lodging in London, long? - A. Yes, a good many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been used to London? - A. Yes, a good many years; I went with her to the <placeName id="t18020918-68-crimeloc354">French Horn in Holborn</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did she say what you were to pay for it? - A. Two shillings; She came up again, and said, her mistress thought the seven-shilling piece was a bad one; she gave me back the seven-shilling piece, and I gave her two shillings, and a shilling for her self.</p>
               <p>Q. When she brought back the seven-shilling piece, were you in bed? - A. No, I was sitting by the side of the bed; she took the three shillings, and went down stairs, wishing me a good night.</p>
               <p>Q. Leaving you alone in the room? - A. She left me alone in the room, I then undressed myself, and looked for a fastening to the door, but could not find any thing; I put a chair against the door, and then went to bed; the next morning, about half past five o'clock, I awaked; I had put my clothes on a chair by the bed-side; the first thing I did, was to look at my pocket-book in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last before seen the pocketbook? - A. Before I set off from Blackwall, on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you felt the pocketbook? - A. When I pulled off my clothes, I am sure I had it in my pocket then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss that pocket-book? - A. No, I did not miss it; I looked into it, when I was getting up, and missed nine one-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else? - A. No, I found the door a-jar, and the chair moved a little on one side; I then went down stairs to the mistress of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a woman you supposed to be the mistress of the house? - A. Yes; I called her up; she got up, I told her what had happened, and she sent a black servant that she had, to different lodging-houses, to find out the prisoner, but we did not find her till the Tuesday morning, about nine o'clock; I asked her what she had done with the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with you? - A. Yes, the black servant and another person.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say? - A. She gave no answer at all about it; I staid there while an officer was sent for, and she was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your notes again? - A. Yes, the same morning, a man of the name of Bradley, who keeps a public-house, shewed me one of my notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has that now? - A. The constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober at the time? - A. I cannot say I was very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not to sleep with the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with her as the servant of an inn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And she was only in the room with you for the purpose of shewing you the bed, and bringing the seven-shilling piece back again? - A. For no other purpose at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober enough to remember that you put the chair against the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say you had those notes in your pocket-book, when you went to bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you suppose, it was while you were asleep, that she took it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, before the Magistrate, that you had every reason to believe the prisoner stole and carried away your notes at the time she returned into the room with the seven-shilling piece? - A. Not the second time; I said, I supposed she returned again after that.</p>
               <p>Q. When she took the three shillings, was your coat upon your back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you suppose she could not have taken it at that time? - A. No, it was impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk with her from your lodgings to the French-horn? - A. Yes; it is not above an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk arm-in-arm? - A. No, I think she walked before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this house, the French-horn? - A. I never was in it before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know whose house it is? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was a very old woman that shewed us the bed, and he was very much in liquor.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180037"></xptr>Court. Q. Can you recollect, with certainty, whether it was that woman, or another? - A. I have no doubt of this being the woman; I did not see any other woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not in company with two woman at the corner of Red-lion-street, drinking at the watering-house? - A. No, I did not drink any thing after I left Blackwall, and I had walked all the way from Blackwall; I was with no other woman at all.</p>

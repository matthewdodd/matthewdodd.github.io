I immediately collared him. He had screwed to get it out. I had twisted my fob, he pulled at it, but it resisted - he made a screw to get it out while I held him. He struggled to get away, but I called up some friends who were near me, and they assisted in giving him to the watchman. He struggled to get away. I was struck in my face two or three times and in my body. I think the prisoner struck me, but the others were near enough to do it. I held him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182012060017"></xptr>by the collar till I gave him to the watchman, which was in about five minutes. I did not lose my watch - the chain broke at the bottom ring by the swivel, and the chain and seals were taken, I have not recovered them. I am certain of his person.

            . I live in Castle-street, Borough-market, and am in the ribbon trade. I was with the prosecutor and Mr. Jones, returning from the fire - the crowd being great we walked singly, Mr. Wildey went first. He was surrounded by eight or ten persons; it appeared to be accidental, but they seemed connected. He called me, he was holding the prisoner at the time, and I also collared him. I called out Watch! as hard as I could; one came up and took him to the watch-house. I never lost sight of him, but did not hold him myself all the way - I am sure he is the man. More than one of them struck Mr. Wildey.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Fletcher, a solicitor, of Hyde-street, Bloomsbury. I was with Mr. Wildey on the evening of the robbery, coming from the fire at the end of Wardour-street; we separated. He called to us, and said he was attacked and robbed; I immediately saw him holding the prisoner by the collar with both his hands - I called Watch! and assisted in conveying him along, and in Berner's-street I gave him to the watchman, without losing sight of him.</p>

            . I live in Upper Marylebone-lane, and am a working goldsmith and jeweller. I am not acquainted with the prisoner. I was at the fire, and on returning at the corner of Wardour-street I saw a crowd of fifteen or twenty persons. I came up and looked, and presently after heard Mr. Wildey say,</p>
               <p>"God bless my soul, I have lost my seals!" he seemed much confused stood two minutes or more, and presently after there was quite a rush made by all the mob. He then got from the mob in a small degree - he seemed confused, and in two minutes the mob burst in, and there was a cry of</p>
               <p>"This is the man!" and soon after they made the best of their way to the watch-house. Curiosity led me to the watch-house, and after the gentleman had said what he knew, I put in a word or two, and said I was at the corner of the street, and saw Mr. Wildey much confused, and that I really did not think he could swear to the men, as he appeared much intoxicated. The person at the watch-house looked me hard in the face, and said</p>
               <p>"I think you will be here to-morrow." I said,</p>
               <p>"No Sir, I am a man of too much respectability to be here." The prisoner said</p>
               <p>"Will you come to-morrow for me?" I gave somebody my card, appeared at the office, and said what I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you here this morning. I took a walk here on Saturday from curiosity, saw his name on the list, and thought I would come. I am quite disinterested altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see Mr. Wildey till after he lost his seals - A. No, not till after he had proclaimed his loss. He stood two minutes without taking anybody. I saw no blows given, nor did I see him hold anybody.</p>
               <p>MR. WILDEY re-examined. Q. Were you intoxicated on that evening - A. I was not, my Lord, I was as sober as I am now. I did not mention my loss till after I continued to have hold of the prisoner's collar - I kept him till I got an officer. I did not stand without him for a moment.</p>
               <p>MR. CROSSLEY. I was with Mr. Wildey from about four o'clock; I met him at the Plough, in Museum-street, he drank two glasses of rum and water, and was as sober as he is now. He could not have stood two minutes without seizing the prisoner. The witness came to the watch-house, and gave the account he has now.</p>

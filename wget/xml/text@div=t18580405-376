                  </hi>. I am manager of Mr. George Torr's business at Deptford—he prepares animal charcoal for sugar refiners. On the morning of 12th March, Stratford was sent out with a van containing a load of animal charcoal; he was a waggoner in Mr. Torr's employment—I was not up when he started—I gave him instructions over night to go to Messrs. Goodhart's, at Hooper Square, Whitechapel, with 5 1/2 tons of charcoal on one waggon—hisusual time to start was just about 4 o'clock—there were 110 bags—I saw the load in the waggon prepared for starting—if he started about 4 o'clock, he would arrive at London Bridge about 5—he drove four black horses—we have only one black team—there is no other manufactory in London of animal charcoal but ours and Mr. Parker's—Mr. Parker's is in Old Gravel Lane, Ratcliffe Highway—we supply it for the purpose of purifying sugar, and after it has been used, it is returned to us to be re-burnt.</p>

               <p>12th March, I was in King William Street, London Bridge, about three minutes past 5 o'clock—I saw a van there drawn up on the near side, just after you pass Arthur Street west, close to the kerb—I saw a man on the top, and as I got near, I heard a rattle on the other side—I looked on the other side of the van, and saw that it was one of Messrs. Torr's—I went to the other side and saw a donkey cart driven by the boy, which had some bags in it, partly covered over with a wrapper, or something of that kind—I believe Stratford to be the person on the top of the van—the van went towards Gracechurch Street, and the donkey cart towards King William Street—Grahamis the boy who was in the donkey cart; I heard him say as he was leaving, "My father says he will give you a pint of beer next time he sees you"—I followed the donkey cart in the direction of the Poultry—as I was going on, I met policeman 422, and spoke to him—I believe the boy saw me, for the donkey cart then went at a sharper pace than before—I stopped him at the Mansion House, and informed him that there was something wrong, and found four bags in the cart—the boy was detained by a policeman—on the Friday after that I went to Deptford, to Mr. Torr's manufactory and selected the prisoner from, it may be, twenty men, as the man I believe to be the driver of the van—I still believe him to be the man.</p>

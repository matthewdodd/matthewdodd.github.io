               <p>Q. Were you in liquor? - A. No, only merry; one of the prisoners asked my friend if he would see her safe home, and he said he would; we both went to the bottom of Golden-lane, and there I lost my friend and one of the women; the other told me they would come after us: I then went with Clarke up stairs into a house; she sat down upon the foot of the bed, and pulled me right over her; she then picked my pocket of my watch, a half-crown, and two shillings. I had seen my money and watch in the afternoon; as soon as she had robbed me, she ran down stairs; I followed her, and saw her a few minutes afterwards at the White-Hart, in Golden-lane; she ran through the tap-room, and I saw no more of her till the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. (Counsel for Clarke.) Q. You were coming from work, I suppose? - A. No, I had been visiting a friend.</p>
               <p>Q. You, of course, drank a little with your friend? - A. We had a pint of beer, and a glass of brandy a-piece; that is all.</p>
               <p>Q. After you met with the ladies, you were drinking four or five hours with them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no difficulty in finding the prisoner, Clarke, the next day? - A. No, I could not find her till Mr. Rittson, the publican, found her for me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not tell Rittson that you had not money enough to give the ladies, and you gave her the watch to borrow some upon? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. But you told her the next day you would forgive her if she found you the watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you had not money enough to pay her that compliment she was deserving of the night before, and you would give her five shillings more? - A. No, I told her I did not mind treating her with half-a-crown's-worth, if she would tell where it was.</p>

             sworn. - I was with Riley at the Rodney's Head, drinking gin with these women, and then it was Riley's inclination to go along with them; we were all pretty well intoxicated; I parted with him and the women in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he leave you with the other woman?- A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - A. Yes, I went home; and between ten and eleven o'clock he came to me, and told me he had lost his watch; I live at No. 25, Clerkenwell-close; he stopped there all night, and the next morning I went with him to inquire for it; the landlord went with us to find her; there was a flogging-match in the street, and we lost Riley in the crowd; the landlord found Clarke; I asked her for the watch; she said she did not mean to keep it, but she did not like to deliver it to me before the officer: Riley came in, and told her if she would let him have his watch, he would forgive her, and spend something.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were all pretty drunk that night? - A. I believe we were.</p>
               <p>Q. You left him with both the women? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not foolish enough to go with the other woman? - A. No, I have a wife and children of my own.</p>

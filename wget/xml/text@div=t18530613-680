                  </hi>. I live at Datchet-common; I drive a carrier's cart for my father. On Wednesday, 25th May, I had a parcel in the cart from Messrs. Keen, of Horton Mills—I got to Giltspur-street, and the parcel was then in the cart—I was opposite Mr. Tucker's, the cart was standing there—I saw the prisoner get into the cart, pull the parcel forwards, and place it on the fore ladder—he then shook the sacks up which were in the bottom of the cart—he got down, and I asked him what he was going to do with that parcel—he said another man had sent him from another cart for it—I did not see any other man, and he did not point out any other man—I saw one cart</p>

On Wednesday, 25th March, I saw the prisoner in Morgan's cart—he took a parcel from the hind part of the cart, and placed it on the fore ladder—Morgan ran across Smithfield, towards our yard, and the cart was standing outside our yard—I went to Morgan, and said, "What is the matter, Fred?"—he said, "This man has taken a parcel out of the cart"—I caught hold of the prisoner, and held him till a policeman came—the prisoner said, "Hold, hold! let me go; I will show you the man who sent me for it.

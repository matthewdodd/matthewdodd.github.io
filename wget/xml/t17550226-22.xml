She came in and opened the gowns, and said she was obliged to make up some money, and must part with them, and she chose rather to sell them out and out, rather than to pawn them. She asked me three guineas for them; I bought them of her for two guineas and a half. Mr. Shootes came to me the next day with two women; they wanted to buy some; we shewed them these. Then he went out and fetched a search-warrant, and claimed them. She was taken up, and I knew her again before the justice.</p>

I had some money to make up that day; I went and made money of these things; after which the prosecutor agreed, and made it a debt, and took my things in part of payment.</p>

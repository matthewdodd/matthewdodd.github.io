                  </hi>. I live at Cowley Hall, Uxbridge, and have a lease of the property—the prisoner is a labourer and occupies a cottage in the vicinity of my rabbit warren—I know him perfectly well—he has been in my employ but was not so on 24th May—I had had occasion to Speak to him more than once about losses in the rabbit warren—I did so on. Saturday evening, 23rd May, about 8 o'clock and he said "They have been in your rabbit warren all the while you have been away"—I said "I am now determined to catch you and prosecute you"—on 24th May at a little after 4 a.m., I was in bed and heard shooting on the grounds—I arose and took a loaded gun, a revolver, and a dog, got into my boat and rowed down to the bottom of the long water, which is close to the plantation—the warren is all over the place—I went through some bushes 8 or 9 feet high till I. could see the wall at the bottom of Fox's garden—I then fired off my gun in the air with both triggers—I usually do that in going my rounds—I then saw Fox look over his garden wall at me—his garden is just on the other side of the wall and he was standing in his garden—I saw his face and run to the wall, climbed up the 7 feet wall and Fox's cottage door was open and Fox was there—it is a brick wall and is a continuation of all the cot<lb></lb>tages, there are six cottages and a garden wall at the back of them—the centre of the wall is where the water closets are, and he put his head up—"' the 6 feet wall is between the gardens and the plantation, and in the middle of that wall there is a water closet, at which I saw the man's head looking over—I walked along the side of the wall, put my foot in a hole in the wall and in that way climbed it, rested my hands on it and saw Fox's cottage door and Fox in his every day clothes; these are his Sunday clothes—a man named Weatherley was standing by Fox—he looked at me and I let one: barrel of the revolver off to show that I was not un-armed—I then went.</p>

               <p>along by the side of the garden wall and had just passed the end of the wall when I heard a dog howling—I then went towards another wall run<lb></lb>ning parallel to the cottages and went about 27 feet through the bushes to an open space, and had just stepped into the open when I saw Fox with his gun covering me—he fired instantly and then looked at me, I thought to see whether he had hit me, and I saw his face as plainly as I see it now—I was shot—I have since measured the distance between the spot where I saw Fox, and the spot where I was, and find it is 27 paces, which is about 27 yards—I was shot from the calves of the legs up to this cheek, and this arm and in my stomach and shoulder and in thirty or forty different places—the shot were of different sizes—I should think four sizes—the use of different sized shot would scatter the shot as they were scattered over my body—I felt no pain and did not discover that I was shot till my face was streaming with blood—I then went to my boat, washed my face, ordered my carriage, and went to my doctor, who probed the wounds, and on the Monday morning I told the police—I have not the most distant doubt about the identity of the man who fired the gun.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have a good constitution—I was shot in Bulldog Lane, in the plantation and the prisoner was in Bulldog Lane—there were trees there and a good many shrubs and underwood, which formed the plantation—it is principally ash, 8 feet high—a wall divides Bulldog Lane from my plantation, and also divides the plantation and the prisoner's garden—the person who shot me did not shoot me from that wall; he stood probably 50 yards from that wall—it was about 60 odd yards from his own front door that he shot me—anybody could <hi rend="italic">get</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Cowley into</hi> that road, from the road which leads to Drayton—I have been very kind to the prisoner and his family, and he has often expressed it—his son robbed me, and I gave him a half-sovereign to enlist in the Army—the prisoner has gone fishing for me, and he has poached—I was not very anxious to preserve the rabbits, but I like to see them running about—they never run into the prisoner's garden, because there is a high wall—the prisoner has resided in the parish ever since I have been there—he is not at all a staid man—he has a family—I do not know anyone named Duce—my dog is a large retriever—the system of throwing over dogs is a ruse—after I was shot, my dog worried another dog, and as it was dying, I shot it to make sure—I do not know the owner of the dog—I don't know that Duce is the owner—the police have tried to find out the owner, and cannot.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). On Sunday morning, 24th May, I received information from the prosecutor, and went to the prisoner's house, but did not find him—I took him at 11.45 on Monday night, about 100 yards from his house, and said "I want you to go to the station with me"—he said "On what charge?—I said "You will be charged with shooting Mr. Mosse"—he said "I expected as much"—I went to his house, and found this gun, and shot and powder—it was not loaded—when the prisoner was charged, he said that the gun had been discharged that day in the morning—the shot are of three or four different sizes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't know that mixed shot is commonly sold in grocers' shops—the prisoner did not tell me that he had shot the gun off to frighten small birds; he did not say what he fired it for, and I did not ask him—it is a very old single barrel—the whole house is on the ground floor, and I found the gun in the right-hand room—I asked for it, and the wife brought it, and the shot and shot bag also—I know Weatherly he is</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner upwards of twenty years, and sometimes assist him in cultivating some garden ground he has—on Whit Sunday I was sleeping in the middle room at his cottage, and he and his wife were in the room beyond—I had never slept there before—about 4.30 a.m. the report of a gun in the plantation awoke me, and I hallooed out to the prisoner, "George, are you going to get up?"—he said "No, I ain't particular this morning for an hour, as I have nothing par<lb></lb>ticular to do. Have you heard anything? what is the matter?"—I said "I don't know; the report woke me"—he got up, and came and opened the back door, and did not go a yard from it—he had nothing on but His shirt—I said "I will go up the lane, and see if I can see anyone"—he said "You stop here, you b----fool;" but I went, and when I had got. 20 yards I met Mr. Duce, who spoke to me, and when I went back the prisoner dressed himself to go to work—it was then nearly 5 o'clock, and we went up the towing path, but it rained so hard that we went back home, and put the kettle on and got breakfast—I did not see him use a gun or mount a wall—he bears a good character, and is a kind hearted man; I don't believe he would hurt a worm if he could get out of the way of it—he has been working twenty years with Mr. Piggott, the brickmaker.</p>

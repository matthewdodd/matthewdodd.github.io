               <p>I live in Oxford-road.</p>
               <p>You had a horse stolen from you by M'Kenzie, on the 14th of June? - I had.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070045"></xptr>You found it in Plaistow Marshes on the Friday following? - Yes. I brought him to town to my own stables. I gave the man a note that I would be answerable to him for it. It was booked in the name of Barrington. I enquired the character of Barrington; I heard an exceeding good character of him.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Barrington's? - Yes; and Mr. Barrington told me that Morris bought the horse; and he took me to Morris's; Morris was not at home; we came back and found him in Mr. Barrington's yard; I asked the prisoner Morris if he knew any thing of the person he bought the horse of; he said he did not know him, he wished he did, for he had given 35 l. for him, and if I would go home with him he would shew me the receipt he had from him; he wanted me to go with him; I refused it; I said I had no business with that; I told him he need not be at any trouble to go to the marshes for the horse, for I had found the horse and brought it home with me; he said he thought it very hard, and wanted to know who was to lose it; I said he must unless his friend would return the money; then I left him.</p>
               <p>What time was the horse taken out of your yard? - I believe about seven o'clock on Monday the 14th of June.</p>
               <p>Morris said he did not know the person he bought it of, did he mention his name? No. I then shewed him the letter I received on Thursday. I shewed it to Mr. Barrington; he said it was the same hand that signed the receipt.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you certain you shewed it to Morris? - I am not certain that I shewed it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When you first saw him you did not tell him you had got the horse? - I asked him first about the man; we were not together above two minutes I believe.</p>
               <p>He told you, the first time he was charged, that he had bought the horse, and the price he had given for the horse and offered to take you home to see the receipt? - He did.</p>
               <p>Was Barrington present? - Yes.</p>

            ? - No.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>


               <p>What was the first thing you said to Morris when you saw him? - I asked him whether he knew the person he bought the horse of, he said he never knew any thing about it being my horse till he saw it in the advertisement that morning.</p>
               <p>Was the horse in the same situation when you found him as he was when you lost him as to his ears? - No, his ears were cut off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do not you remember I told you the horse was in Plaistow Marshes before you told me you had got the horse?</p>
               <p>Spencer. I believe not; I am very clear in it you did not. He certainly did not tell me so till I had told him I had got the horse.</p>
               <p>What reason had you to say he need not give himself any trouble to go to the marshes after the horse, if he had not said any thing about it? - He had not said any thing about its being there.</p>
               <p>Court. Something must have passed about the marshes before he said that? - Mr. Barrington had been talking to me about it as we came into the yard.</p>
               <p>How long was it after this before he was apprehended? - I suppose above a week. Sir

               <p>What sort of ears had he? - Very handsome ears, and stood exceeding well before he was cropped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How was his head?</p>
               <p>Spencer. His head was very handsome; he was a very fine horse.</p>

               <p>Did you know him before? - I never saw him but once or twice before.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - I never heard his name till that night; he said his name was Murray.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070046"></xptr>What day was it? - The 14th of June.</p>
               <p>How long after was it before you saw Morris? - In the course of about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen them together before? - I had seen them together but once before.</p>
               <p>What business did they come about? - Buying this horse.</p>
               <p>Who sold it? - Murray; they desired me to write a receipt; I bid my son write it for 35 l. Murray signed it and Morris put his hand into his pocket and pulled out something and said there is a pound, or, a guinea, I do not know which; that is all I have in my pocket.</p>
               <p>How long did the horse remain at your house? - From Monday to Thursday as I was informed.</p>
               <p>Were any directions given by Morris? - None, only to take care of him in his name.</p>
               <p>Did you see the horse when Spencer got him home? - Yes, it was the same horse.</p>
               <p>What sort of a horse was it when you first saw it? - A bay horse, with his ears on, he was a fine horse.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Does he keep horse at your house? - Yes, he did keep horses there.</p>
               <p>This horse staid there till Thursday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Yours are publick stables? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were no orders to conceal it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you understand horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he set his ears well? - I thought it a clever gelding; it was about nine at night, it was almost dark; I went out of town the next morning early; I did not return till Thursday.</p>
               <p>Jury. If it had been your horse would you have had it cropped? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had it not a large head?</p>
               <p>Spencer. It had a larger head than some have.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They crop them when their heads are large, do they not?</p>
               <p>Spencer. They do,</p>
               <p>Jury. If it had been your horse would you have had it cropped? - No; but that depends entirely on fancy.</p>
               <p>This horse has a large head? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is a reason often of cropping horses? - Yes; I have known gentlemen have as fine horses as ever were cropped.</p>

               <p>Do you know what the message was that was delivered to your man; was you present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was it? - To go to Mr. Morris and tell him that Brett wanted him; we asked him whether he knew him by that name; he said, describe me, that I am a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070047"></xptr> tall likely man, and he will know me; he went once or twice, but did not find him; he found him at last; Morris came to them to the lock-up house. Morris asked me what sum was due, and asked what Brett's sum was; I told him I believe it was 8 l. 7 s. he asked me if I would take his word for that; I said, no, I don't know you; he put his hand into his pocket, and gave me seven guineas; I consented then, as that was so near the sum, to let him go; and Morris said, if I bring him back, you will return the money; I said I certainly should do so; Morris said that he was going to look at a horse; and if they agreed, he should find money to discharge both.</p>
               <p>Did they go out of the house at this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At what time did they go out of the house? - At about half after six or near seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>How soon after did you see Morris? - About an hour; I asked him where Brett was; he said he would be there in two or three minutes; in a quarter of an hour or ten minutes after, he said, I believe, we have dealt; but if he should not return, I shall be robbed; but I will pay you the deficiency.</p>
               <p>How soon did he come back? - In ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; he came back on a bay gelding; M'Kenzie was on horseback; Morris went out and spoke to him; Morris said, now I will fetch you your money for the debts and costs. I looked upon it that was the horse Morris had purchased; M'Kenzie said before that (as I told the court yesterday) that he had a horse of his own.</p>
               <p>Did these people seem to be acquainted? - They seemed to know each other; but I cannot take upon me to say as to that particularly; I thought they seemed to know each other.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Then so far from this being a secret, they talked of it before you, before Mr. Clipson, and other persons that were in the lock-up house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And so far from being concealed, the horse was brought to be paraded before the lock-up house; you said, before you saw Morris, this man said he had a horse of his own to dispose of? - Before he came, he said he had a horse to dispose of; that he gave thirteen guineas for him, and he would not take thirty for him.</p>
               <p>Did you offer to buy it yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you see me go out publickly into the open street, and stroke him down the neck? - Yes, and give him a cut with a whip, I believe.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>What were the debt and costs he paid? - The whole debt and costs I received, paid by Morris, amounted to 19 l. 5 s. 8 d. I received them in the presence of Morris; as I locked them up at Clipson's house, I went in just as Clipson and he were present; he saw the money paid.</p>

               <p>What message did he deliver to you? - Go to Mr. Morris, and say, Mr. Brett wants to speak to him; and if he does not know the name, describe my person as near as you can, and he will know my name. He was not at home the first time; the second time he was at home; I did not know Mr. Morris; I said Mr. Brett and Mr. Villiers want to speak with you; he said he did not know them. I described them, and said they were at Mr. Clipson's in Wych-street; he said, tell them I will come to them.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he did come? - No, not when he did come; I was present afterwards, and saw him with them.</p>
               <p>Did they seem to be acquainted? - I thought so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I tell you I knew no such name? - He did hesitate at first, when I said Brett and Villiers; when I described their persons, he said I know them; tell them I will come to them directly; that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070048"></xptr> was by their descriptions only; Mr. Brett said, describe the persons and he will know who it is.</p>

               <p>Had he been sent for up to grass, or was he in the house, because you spoke of sending for some up? - This horse was bought on Holy Thursday; I bought thirteen horses of the same man.</p>
               <p>Holy Thursday was the 13th of May? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was bought at that fair? - Yes, by a country dealer; I bought him from that man.</p>
               <p>He had been in your hands long; was he in order? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he well footed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he in a state to show for sale? - Yes; I have forty horses in my stable, and not one more fresh.</p>
               <p>Would you at that time of the year have turned that horse out to grass? - No.</p>
               <p>He was in a right state then to be continued in the house to go to market for sale? - I never had a horse more fit for sale than he was.</p>
               <p>Then as a horse-dealer you would not have turned that horse out to grass? - Certainly I should not.</p>
               <p>Had he those sort of ears that you think he would show better with his ears on or cropped? - We seldom have a horse that looks better cropped.</p>

               <p>What would you sell him for now? - I should have thought him worth 45 guineas when company was in town to buy horses; but trade is not now so brisk as it was then. We do not reckon it right to turn horses out in fly time with fore places about them.</p>
               <p>Court. Would you turn a horse out to grass immediately with his ears cropped in fly time? - I should think it not reasonable; but in all my business I never had but one horse cropped.</p>

             a receipt; I keep a lock-up house; Mr. Johnson brought Mr. Brett and Mr. Villiers to my house as prisoners. He came out and said, I might let Mr. Brett go; I did. They came back sometime after; Mr. Brett came with a likely bay horse; he seemed to stand well upon his legs; Morris went out in the street, and looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070049"></xptr> at the horse; I observed the horse; I think I should know him again if I was to see him. Mr. Brett and Morris went away together; they were gone two hours, I believe, before they came and discharged the other person, (who was Villiers) then he came and paid me 9 l. 9 s. 4 d. for Villiers; he paid for a bottle of wine, I believe, and four shillings besides; Mr. Johnson came in before they went out of the house; I paid the money in the presence of Mr. Johnson and Villiers, and here is Mr. Johnson's receipt for it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Are you a horse dealer, or a judge of them; now from the observation you made of that horse, was it a horse that it was highly improper to crop his ears to make him handsome? - I thought him rather a Roman nosed horse; I observed that particularly of the horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Was M'Kenzie called Brett is the presence of the prisoner? - I believe he was, to the best of my recollection; when the horse stood at the door, I said it was a likely horse; Villiers said it is the best hunter in the kingdom; I said it is a likely horse; he stands well upon his legs; it is very clean. Villiers said Brett had refused forty guineas for him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Villiers say in the presence of Morris, Mr. Brett has refused forty guineas for him? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Morris in hearing at that time? - No; he was examining the horse in the street; he said he had had him two years, and had refused forty guineas for him when he was hunting with him last season, and he was the best hunter in the season.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Barrington knows my character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barrington. During the time I have known him he has had horses of me, and dealt with me; he is an honest man.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long has he lived in your neighbourhood? - He lives near the Fleet-Prison.</p>

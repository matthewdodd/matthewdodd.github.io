            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 25th of February I was in the bar; I went up stairs about half-past eight o'clock, to put some silver by; I put the key into the bed-room door, and found it unlocked; I opened the door and saw the drawers turned out, and saw the prisoner standing behind the door, he rushed out and ran down stairs; I raised an alarm; he had pulled two drawers half open, and the two looking-glass drawers quite out and left them on the table; several things were lying on the table which he had taken out of the drawers - out street-door was open at the time; I cannot say how he got up stairs; Mr. Storey, the broker, was the last person in the bed-room; the lock had not been opened by violence, but in the regular way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had received the key from Mr. Storey, I believe? A. Yes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290009"></xptr>

            . I am an auctioneer and appraiser; I had taken an inventory of the value of the effects in the prosecutor's bed-room, on the 25th of February; I left the room about eight or a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening; I believe I locked the door - I am sure of it; I returned the key to Mrs. Burn - I left the house afterwards, and know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Recollect yourself: you at first said, you believed you locked the door; why did you say you believed? A. Because, though I might have locked it, still from circumstances it might be left open; I thought I locked it: when I left the room, the key was in the door; I turned the key and took it out; I believe it was locked: I did not tell the Magistrate I could not swear whether it was open or not; I said I believed I locked it, and I say now, to the best of my belief, I locked it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you a distinct recollection of giving the key to Mrs. Burn? A. I have.</p>

            . I am constable of the parish. The prisoner was delivered to me; I took him to the office, and from there to the watch-house, and when I returned, the things had been put back into the drawer: I asked Mrs. Burn for them, she said she would look them out; she gave them to me on Saturday; when the prisoner was given into my charge, I asked who and what he was, he made no reply; I searched him, and in his coat and waistcoat pockets found twelve skeleton keys; I have tried them to the door, and this one will open it; I also found on him some matches and a phosphorus bottle; I found in his hat a dark lantern, a candle, a pair of gloves, a comb, and handkerchief; I took him to the office; he made a resistance to get from me - that is all I know.</p>
               <p>MRS. BURN. These things are all ours, and were in the drawers, but had been moved out - they are worth about 10s. - more things were moved, but I cannot swear to any but these; nothing was carried quite away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you have mixed them with other things? A. No; I put them back into a drawer, but kept them separate; we left the house a few days afterwards and took them with us - I have three children; I have more frocks and articles, but they are made different; I was agitated, but put them all into the drawer, and did not mix them with other things; the servants had access to the room; I had been into the bed-room about half an hour before the broker gave me the key; I have two servants; I am certain nobody had been to the room after me, as I had the key which Mr. Storey had given me; when I went up, I found these things lying on the table.</p>

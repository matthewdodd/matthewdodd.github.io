            .) Is all the property that was lost your's? - A. There is one handkerchief mine; the others were mine while in my care; I had them to wash.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of all the things that you have lost - do you think they are worth forty shillings? - A. Yes, they are worth more than that; I suppose they are not worth less than ten or a dozen pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going up to my aunt in Long-acre; as I was going past this woman's house, I met a woman with a bundle, and she asked me if I would help her to carry it; I said, yes; I found they were wet, and asked her what she was going to do with them; she said she was going to take them to dry and iron; then I was stopped, and asked what I had got; I told them it was no business of theirs; they took hold of each of my arms; the woman walked on, and they brought me back; I heard that gentlewoman say that she had transported one man, and she would hang me if she could; then she took me to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Kerrison. When she brought this property back, she threw it down at my landlady's door, and said, I know you will hang me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

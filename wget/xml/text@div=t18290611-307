               <p>JOHN VOYCE. I lost a dustman's bell, on the 28th of April, from <placeName id="t18290611-307-crimeloc1620">Gun-square, Houndsditch</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18290611-307-crimeloc1620" type="placeName" value="Gun-square, Houndsditch"></interp>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect any conversation between you and I? A. Yes; you came and asked me to have a glass of gin - you did not ask if I had lost my bell - I said I had lost it; you asked me what the value of it was, and I said 6s. or 7s.; you did not state that you lived in that square, not ask when I should be there again - I left you in the wine-vaults; my fellow-servants took the cart away.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CONSTABLE. I took the prisoner and the bell; he told me it was merely a joke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out and saw the bell at the door; when I came in I took it up stairs, merely as a joke - I put it on a stool, and went down to the yard till my landlord and landlady came in: she said you have been at some of your larks - I said "I will wash myself, you look out at the window, and see that the man don't go without the bell;" I said I would put a night-cap on it, and put this paper over it - I then went down and said to the prosecutor, "Have you lost any thing?" he said, "Yes, a bell of my master's, and I must make it good - it will cost 5s. or 6s.;" I said "I live at No. 13, when shall you be here again?" he said in a day or two - I said, "Don't be surprised if you find your bell again before night; will you have a drop of gin?" he said, "Yes, and thank you too;" he said no more about the bell, but went away - I went home and said, "I don't like this bell, it begins to be troublesome to me - I know where he shoots his carts, and I will go with it;" I followed him to White Lion-street, where I saw him with five or six more dustmen; one of them said, "He has got a bell;" I said Yes, and I untied it and gave it him - one of them said, "Why don't you give him in charge?"</p>
               <p>RICHARD PAPWORTH. The prisoner lodges with me in Gun-square; he came in with the bell under his arm, and said he was going to have a bit of fun with it - I wanted him to give it the man; he said, "Stop a bit, I will give it him presently;" he went down to the witness, but did not give it him then - he then took it from my house to give it him, I believe; he asked me to go with him.</p>
               <p>MRS. PAPWORTH. I heard the prisoner say he was going to play a lark - I said, "Where the goodness did you get that bell? go and give it the man;" he said, "I mean to give it him;" he went - the prosecutor and he had' some gin. <rs id="t18290611-307-verdict1621" type="verdictDescription">

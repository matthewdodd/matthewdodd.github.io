            . I saw the prisoner very busy upon the wharf, I thought he belonged to a ship; I saw him take up this truss, and put it on his shoulder, and looked sharp about him, and made a bit of a run at first, and then went softly; I hallooed to him, and I and another man ran after him, and asked him where he was going with it; he said a man ordered him to carry it; I bid him produce the man; he said he did not know where he was; we brought him back, and took him into the compting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether I did not desire you to stop the young man that employed me to carry the bale of goods?</p>

I am a watchman on that wharf; my master sent me on an errand, just as I returned I saw the prisoner with the bale of goods; I asked him how he came by it; he hallooed out for one Tom; I told him there was no Tom there; I saw no body that belonged to him; we brought him back with the goods on his back.</p>

            . Q. Are you an officer. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being applied to by Hurley - A. He came to my house on the 10th of last month, he informed me that he had been robbed by a man of the name of Baldwyn of fourteen guineas, and as many half guineas as amounted to thirty guineas, chiefly of the old coin, and that the half guineas were almost new ones.</p>
               <p>Q. You have the money that you found upon the prisoner. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take you to where the prisoner Baldwyn was. - A. He did, he took me to a public house in Gibraltar row, St Georges fields; he pointed out the prisoner to me. I took the prisoner into a private room, I asked him how he came to rob this man, he denied having any knowledge of him. I told him I was a police officer, I must search him; he behaved in a very violent manner, I was obliged to throw him down. After that he behaved more quiet, and suffered me to search him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not asked him many questions. - A. No, I searched him. In one waistcoat pocket I found a watch, in the other waistcoat pocket I found a leather bag, which contained twelve guineas and fifteen half guineas. Hurley then described the pieces of linen rags which the money was wrapped up in. I searched him again; I found them in the inside pocket of the prisoner's jacket. I produce the fifteen half guineas, the twelve guineas, and the two pieces of rag. I asked the prisoner how he counted for having all this money about him, he said it was his own money what he had worked for.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you searched the prisoner you said the prosecutor described the sort of money, did he say whether it was in a purse or not. - A. He did not tell me before I found it, he told me what the money was before I found it, after I found the money he told me there were two pieces of rag and a piece of black silk, that was before I found the rag, and which he said he should know. These are the two pieces of rag.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) You said that your money was wrapped up in a peice of black silk and two pieces of linen rag, you saw it before, when it was found upon the prisoner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that rag do you know it. - A. Yes, that rag that was outside of the black silk, and this was the outside of all it has a remarkable mark, I told the officer what kind they were before I saw any of them</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mark. - A. It is hem'd just in this part; the outer one had no mark only the length, and it had a rent in the middle. I told the officer the length of this, I am certain of these two piece of linen they are mine, that I can swear to, and that my money was wrapped up in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the money, I take it for granted there is none of them you can speak particularly to, - A. I have been three years working for them; one half guinea is bent like a six-pence, and the other half guinea is bent a little at the edge. If he has not made away with them, I can swear to them. These are the two half guineas (witness showing it).</p>
               <p>Q.(to Lockey.) Before you searched the man, did he describe any particular money having any particular mark. - A. I believe he did, I am not quite positive.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford (to Prosecutor.) You do not mean to swear to the two half guineas. - A. I will not swear to the two half guineas, I will swear to the linen, I am positive to the linen.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner did not come home that night. - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>MRS. CROWLEY Q. This man and the prisoner lodged in your house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is it in. - A. Saint Ann's, Lime-house.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is Saint Ann, Middlesex, commonly called Limehouse.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mrs. Crowley) Were you out on the day this man called you up. - A. No, I was at home all the day till between ten and eleven o'clock; I went out, and while I was gone out the prisoner went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go out so late on that day. - A. I do not know, he never staid so late before, when I went out I left the prisoner at home.</p>

               <p>Q. How came he to know the prisoner was at home. - A Because the child told me that he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. That I cannot hear, you do not know that he was at home when you went out. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had lodged with you how long. - A. About four moths as nigh, as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him have a quantity of money. - A. Never but a very little indeed, I never saw him have any, he always pleaded very poor, I do not know whether he was or no.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, this is the first time that I have had occasion to stand before a bar. What I am charged with here I am totally innocent of. I was born in Hampshire of honest parents, who inculcated into me honest principles. I was brought by my father to Mr. Cook's in St. George's fields, in whose employment I continued for a considerable length of time, and from whom I generally earned two pounds a week. From there I went to Wapping wall, in whose employ I was when this unfortunate circumstance happened; I only mention this circumstance to satisfy you, my lord, and the gentlemen of the jury, that I had a better opportunity of having money of my own than the prosecutor, who is only a hammerman, and can get only eighteen shillings a week. On the morning this happened, I found myself incapable of going to work, so from there I went to St. George's fields to my old shopmates, they persuaded me to stop the night. On the next day, at four o'clock in the afternoon, I was taken in custody. I humbly submit to your consideration, if my prosecutor can swear to money, that is the grand criterion: he in madness of despair, because it was lost, swore that one of the half guineas was crooked. If he had any private mark on the money he would have shewn it. Under the foregoing circumstances, my prosecutor might have sworn to the money of any one in court as well as mine. Therefore I submit my case to you, hoping I shall have an acquittal.</p>

            . On the 12th of August, I came into Mr. Bates's house, the <placeName id="t18160918-123-crimeloc646">Cock and Lion, in Wigmore-street</placeName>

The prisoner at the bar came and sat down along side of me, and the landlord went into the bar. The prisoner said, d-n me if I han't got a one pound note of Bates. I said how did you come by it Thomas; he said, never you mind, you eat your supper, and don't say a word about it. I asked him to give me something to drink; he said, it won't do to night, stop until Sunday, and then I will give you a prime dinner, and plenty to drink. free of expense. The landlord went up stairs, and he followed him up directly. He returned in about eight or ten minutes, and sat himself down along side of me, and said, I have got that in my possession which will fetch us nine or ten pounds, and if you like to go in partnership or be in co, you shall have half. I made answer that I did not understand what he meant. He said never mind, only keep secret and never divulge a word. Then the bell rang up stairs, and the landlady went up stairs. Now, he says, is your time or never, go into the bar he says, and have something out of the bar, the landlord is tipsey and the landlady is gone up stairs, and I shall watch for you; then I left the house.</p>

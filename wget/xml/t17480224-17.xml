            . I missed this tea last Monday out of my compting-house; there were two large canisters there, but whether it was taken out of one or both I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Gifford. The Prisoner came at two o'clock in the morning to wash, my man was to let her in, and I ordered him, when he went to bed again, to lock the shop door, which he neglected to do, as he tells me; I got a search-warrant, and found in the Prisoner's cellar about three pounds weight of that tea: She confessed it was my tea before the constable and the justice, but said that my servant gave it her; and she accused my servant of carrying tea home to his mother, but I could not find any there.</p>
               <p>There were three half pound canisters produced, which were found in her custody, and some in a paper, which Mr. Gifford said he believed to be his tea.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Gifford. She has washed for me ever since I lived in my house. I have not lived t here above half a year. It is a hard thing upon a young beginner .</p>

            . On Monday, the fifteenth of February, I let the Prisoner in to wash about two o'clock in the morning. My master ordered me to lock the shop door, when I went to bed; but being heavy with sleep, I neglected to do it. The Prisoner had an opportunity of going in there till six o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of her taking it?</p>
               <p>How. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you lie near the shop?</p>
               <p>How. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury (to Gifford) How far did these canisters stand off his bed?</p>
               <p>Gifford. They were in another room, about three yards off his bed, but if he was a sleep a person might come in and he not hear it.</p>

I am a headborough, I went and searched the Prisoner's lodging and found some tea, which Mr. Gifford said was his tea: the Prisoner said before the Justice that it was Mr. Gifford's tea, and that How gave it her: at first she said her son that came from India gave her one canister of tea .</p>

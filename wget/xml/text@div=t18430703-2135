                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, in Tottenham-court-road, in partnership with Andrew Kidd and another. On Saturday evening, the 24th of June, about nine o'clock, a lady came and spoke to me—I went into the lobby, and missed a piece of Parisian cloth, which I had seen safe about half an hour before—the lady pointed towards Grafton-street—I went towards the corner, and saw the prisoner running with a bundle under his arm—he turned the corner, saw me following him, and threw it down—I picked it up, and found it was this piece of cloth—I called, "Stop thief," and followed him to Fitzroy-court, where he was stopped by a butcher—he asked me if I saw him take it—I said I saw him run away with it.</p>

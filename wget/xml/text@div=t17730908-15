As soon as I had done this both the women seized hold of it directly, took it, and went away; I did not care to make a noise at the house, so I went away home; the next day when I came to recollect I had lost this money, I was determined to see whether I could enquire after these people; I went away to the same place, where I had been over night talking with the man of the house; they recommended me to one Simmons to take these people; before Simmons went to take them,

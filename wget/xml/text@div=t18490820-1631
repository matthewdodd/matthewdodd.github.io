                  </hi>. The deceased, Joseph Dunmore, was my brother—he was about twenty-two years of age. On Sunday morning, 15th July, I went with him to Plaistow-marshes—there was a fight there between him and Sotcher—Cockling and Boulter seconded my brother, and George and a man named Carty seconded Sotcher—there were twenty-eight rounds—it lasted about half an hour and five minutes—they both shook hands when they went in—they hit each other as hard as they could—they had several falls—at the last round they scuffled and fell, and my brother was under<lb></lb>neath—he was not able to answer when "time" was called—I saw no blow struck at the last round; they only fell—I took my brother home in a cart—Mr. Webb attended him—he died about half-past twelve o'clock—the fight was about half-past six in the morning—he never recovered his senses—I do not know where the agreement to fight had been made, nor the cause of it, my brother came and called me up just before five—he had told me over night that he had had a few words, and expected he was going to fight—when he came in the morning I begged him not to <hi rend="italic">go</hi>, but he said he was determined to go.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Plaistow. I saw this fight—it lasted about half an hour—there were a good many rounds—at the last round they closed and fell—there were some blows struck before that—they were fairly matched as to strength and size—there was no appearance of either having got the better of it—Sotcher had a good many bruises; I could not see whether the deceased had—I could not see anything to show that they ought to have left off before—they were stripped to the waist—they bled at the nose and mouth a little—just before they fell I saw Sotcher strike the deceased just at the back of the head—he did not fall against anything, only on the ground.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon. I was called to the deceased between nine and ten o'clock on the Sunday morning, at his father's house in Poplar—he was in bed, insensible—he died within an hour and a half after—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—on removing the skin behind the ear 1 found an ecchymosis, as if a blow had been struck, and on removing the skull I found a fracture of an inch and a half in length; the <hi rend="italic">lateral sinus</hi> was ruptured, and four ounces of blood pressing on the brain, which caused death—I should attribute death to the effects of a blow.</p>

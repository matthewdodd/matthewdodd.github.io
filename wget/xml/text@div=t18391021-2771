                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Jones, of High-street, Pen<lb></lb>tonville. On the 27th of September the prisoner came into the shop with a child in her arms—she first asked for some night-caps, which I showed her—she did not buy any—she then wished to see some children's socks—the bought some, and a pair of stockings—I observed her put the child several times on the counter, and once she set the child on a pair of black stockings and took them up with the child—I made out a bill of the articles which she bought—when she went we went after her—she was brought back, and this pair of stockings, three pairs of socks, and a night<lb></lb>cap, were found on her in a handkerchief, and the parcel of goods I had sold her was wrapped in a paper—I know them to be my master's—two of them have our mark on them.</p>

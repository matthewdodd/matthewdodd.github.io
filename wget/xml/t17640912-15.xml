            . On Friday the 3d of August, Carey came and asked if I know a person that would buy a hat, and said it was in a public house, the Three Herrings. I went with him there; there was Spencer and another woman; they had the hat; he asked a guinea for it; I saw it dirty; I thought it not honestly come by, and I got them secured.</p>

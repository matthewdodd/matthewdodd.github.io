I was servant to Mr. Lee on the 12th of March last; on that day, between five and six in the evening I had taken in part of those goods, which had hung up at the door, and laid them across the counter. The great coat was mine. I step'd out at the door to speak to a country customer for a little time, and when I came in again the goods were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been gone out?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. Perhaps it might be half an hour. We advertised the goods with two guineas reward. The Saturday morning Mr. Welch the high constable call'd on me and said, I fancy we have got some of your goods; if you will come to Mr. Fielding's about ten o'clock, you may see them. We went there, and there we saw them. I knew them well, being mark'd with my own hand. There were four articles not found, that is, my coat and three other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner taken then?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. No, he was not. Cain turn'd evidence, and declared the whole affair.</p>

I assist my brother, a tobacconist, of 6, Little Smith-street, Westminster—on Thursday, 7th September, the prisoner came and asked for half an ounce of tobacco, which came to three halfpence—he tendered me a half-crown—I gave him the change, and he left—I put it on a table, where there were no other half-crowns—I afterwards tried it in the detector, and it bent—I then put it on one side in a saucer, which I put into a cupboard, and eventually gave it to a policeman—on 19th December, about 3 o'clock, the prisoner came again, and I recognised him—he asked</p>

               <p>for half an ounce of twist tobacco, and gave me a shilling—I asked him if it was good—he said that he hoped it was—I tried it in the detector, and it broke—I gave him the largest piece, and kept the small piece, but have since lost it—he said that his old woman had given it to him, and left the shop—I did not see him again till he was in custody—I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

My brother keeps a tobacconist's shop in Rochester-row—I was serving there in December, between 2 and 3 o'clock, when the prisoner came in for an ounce of thick twist, which came to four pence—he tendered me a half-crown—I saw that it was bad, and bent it in the detector—I then put it in again, and took a piece out of it—he said that he got it at Mr. Morriss's, a tea grocer, in the Broadway—there is a Mr. Morriss there—he told me not to put the tobacco in the drawer, for he would go back and get the money from the man at the hospital-gate, but he never came back—he was in uniform.</p>

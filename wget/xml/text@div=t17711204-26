               <p>Lukeman. About a week or ten days after, a letter came from the general post-office, that they had not received the Isle of Wight hag; that brought it fresh into my memory. I opened the bag, and took the letters out that were for Southampton, and then put the bag in the usual place, which is a sort of a cupboard.</p>

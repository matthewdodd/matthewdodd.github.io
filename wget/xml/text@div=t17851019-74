               <p>I had charge of this sugar two nights, and there was a little cavity in one of the head pieces of the hogsteads, when they gave the charge to me; when Mr. Bradshaw had taken the prisoner, he called to me, and then the sugar was not as it was, the headpiece was broke in, and a great deal of it out, he said he belonged to the lighter.</p>

               <p>The prisoner has been in my service three or four months, he had the care of some lighters; he conducted himself always faithfully and honestly, with the greatest care and propriety; his character is that of an honest well-behaved man; I had much rather have had a loss in trade than this charge against this man; I would trust him with anything I have of my own; from the time a cargo is on board the ship, which is three or four months, casks get rotted, and when there are three or four tiers, the pressure on the ground tier may force out a head, I have seen it frequently; sugar is frequently spilt in the lighter before it is unloaded.</p>

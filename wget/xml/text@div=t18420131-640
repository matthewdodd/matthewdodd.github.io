Michael Jerdein is one of the directors, and there are others—we received a parcel, directed to Mrs. Raymond, on the 5th of January—it came in the regular course, to be sent on—it ought to have reached Putney on the 6th—the prisoner was employed for the Company at Rolls-buildings—he was there, and had access to the place where the parcels laid—he was employed in sorting on the 5th—on the 10th of January, in consequence of something, I called the prisoner into the counting-house, searched him, and found on him one or two perforated cards, an almanack, and a small pocket-book—I found this old almanack on him, and the plaister-case—I told him I considered it was a portion of the parcel that had been missed, of the name of Raymond, because I saw the name in the pocket-book.</p>

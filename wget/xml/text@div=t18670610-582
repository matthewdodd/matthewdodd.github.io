                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Roettger and Blewett, foreign merchants, in Southampton Street, Strand—the prisoner was our town traveller—he came about the 27th January, this year, and left about 28th April, saying that he had other employment—we did not owe him anything when he left—it was his duty to collect orders for us—he gave me this order for paper, in February, for Mr. J. Beardon, of 27, Upper Bemerton Street, Islington, for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is in the prisoner's writing—he represented that Mr. Beardon had given the order through him to me, for the goods—I directed our agents, Messrs. Phillips, Groves, and Phillips, to send these goods to Bemerton Street—on 2nd May, after the prisoner had left, I went to 27, Bemerton Street—I did not find Mr. Beardon there, nor did I find the prisoner there, the first time I called; but I did after<lb></lb>wards—I did not know when this order was given through the prisoner that he lived at Bemerton Street—I have never been able to trace those bales of paper—I believe this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be in the prisoner's writing.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you believe, at the time, that it was a genuine order, and have you found out since that it is not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the goods were ordered by the prisoner for Mr. Beardon, and it turned out that Mr. Beardon never received them—the prisoner was not engaged on wages, but on commission—he has had several advances, but he never earned a penny for the firm—there was nothing due to him as commission—he gave his address at Kilburn when he first came—this was one of his first orders—none of the goods he ordered have been paid for.</p>

             (police-serjeant D 16.) I was in Milton-street, New-road, about two o'clock, on the 3d of March, I saw the two prisoners - Morris was carrying the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100084"></xptr>tea-caddy, and Parker this bundle - they saw me and made a pause at the corner of Quebec-street - I went across the road, and called to Parker, "Jack, I want to speak to you" - they both stopped - I asked what they had got - Parker said he did not know - I asked where he got it - he said he got the bundle at the corner of Lisson-grove, and was engaged to carry it for a woman, who was to give him sixpence - I then asked Morris where. he got the caddy, he would not tell me - I took them to the station-house - the caddy was tied up in a handkerchief, which Morris claimed as his - I gave it him - I then asked Parker whether Morris got the caddy as he got the bundle - he said, "Yes, a woman gave it him to carry."</p>

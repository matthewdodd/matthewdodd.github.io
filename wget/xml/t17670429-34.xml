On the 18th of February the prisoner came to our door, and ordered two pots of beer to Mr. Oats's, a barber, in Bride's-passage, and change for a guinea. I delivered to our boy half a guinea, a quarter guinea. 4 s. and 8 d. to deliver in change. When the boy came back, he said, mistress, the woman is gone away with the change, and Mr. Oats did not want either beer or change. By and by our baker came in; I told him the story. He said, I dare say it is the woman that fetched two quire of paper from such a one, out of a pretence it was for a master carpenter, but she kept it herself. The boy went and watched her that delivered him the paper, and saw her go to the workhouse. My husband went to the workhouse the next morning and found her; it was the prisoner.</p>

            . The prisoner is the woman that came to my master, named Thrush, a stationer in Salisbury-court, for half a quire of the best foolscap paper, on February the 18th; she wanted a quire of whited brown paper for Mr. Case the carpenter; I gave it her; then she came again and wanted more. I let her have this paper (the sheet produced) which the prisoner delivered the lad when she took the change. That day she came about five o'clock, I asked my master if I should follow her; he thought she came on a false pretence, which I did.</p>

            . I am a Police officer. I took the prisoner on this charge - I asked if he would show me his box; he opened it, and I saw in his hand, concealed, some papers: I took them from him, and gave them to the landlord - I went to the box again, and the prisoner snatched the papers from the landlord, and began to chew them; we rushed upon him, and took them from him - they are part of the duplicates of these stockings and breeches.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

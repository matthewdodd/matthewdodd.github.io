               <p>Q. Journeyman or master? - A. I am a little master, I work for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you married or single? - A. I am a married man; On the 8th of this month, last Wednesday was a week, I had been erecting a scaffold at a gentleman's house, and had got a little beer, and I stopped at a public-house; as I was coming home, about eleven o'clock in the evening, I was stopped by two women.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A. I had had some liquor to a certainty, I must speak the truth, but I was not drunk, I was quite sensible; I did not go into the house with these two women, but another woman invited me to the prisoner's in Lewkner's-lane, to smoke my pipe; upon that, the young woman that invited me in, invited me to go from her room to the room of the prisoner at the bar; accordingly I did so, and there we drank three quarterns of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner drink with you? - A. Yes; and another woman; the other woman never stopped, nor sat down in the room; the prisoner persuaded me to go and fetch the fourth quartern of gin myself, accordingly I did, and then there was nobody in the room but her and me; we were upon the bed together; she took the watch out of my pocket, the chain and seal was in my pocket, I felt her hand in my pocket, and asked her what she meant to do with that, are you going to rob me of any thing; her answer was, I won't take any thing of you but what I return back; then she advised me to go home, and call there again in the morning; I was very loath to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch in her hand? - A. No, I did not; I only felt her hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go away without seeing whether she had the watch or not? - A. When I got into the passage, there I stopped, and the door was bolted against me; accordingly I went home that night, without my watch or my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing? - A. Yes; I knew I was short of my watch; as to my money, I never perceived her take that; I had ten shillings and three-pence, and one shilling that had been refused.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you only to put six shillings in the indictment? - A. I was to take off what I spent for gin.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure you had some money and your watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen your watch? - A. The moment I went into the door, going in, I put my chain and seal into my fob; it was a silver watch with two cases, both silver, and a steel chain of very little value; and the seal was a cornelian stone set in gold, with a Turk's head upon it; I returned there the next morning expecting to have it, it was about nine o'clock in the morning; I found the prisoner there, and two men there, and another woman was drinking tea; I asked them for my watch; she forswore ever having it; there was a man in the front room said he would knock my head through the door; then I went over to the public-house, and the landlord advised me to have them taken up; I told him, I did not wish to do that, it would only bring me into trouble; I went again the next day, and the landlord said I was to blame if I did not take them up; and I gave a man sixpence to go to Bow-street for a runner; I went on Thursday and offered them a guinea for the duplicate, and I would put my hand to a ten pound bond, that I would not put them to any trouble for it; I have never found my watch nor money since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you, a bricklayer? - A. A piece of a one.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in London? - A. Twelve years.</p>

               <p>Q. But you did this time? - A. No, I did not; I was going home.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a journeyman bricklayer? - A. No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. You work for yourself? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. A Turk's-head? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. All then that you know is, that you had a seal with a Turk's head upon it, that was a cornelian seal set in gold? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you been drinking before you met with the woman that took you into the house? - A. Share of five posts of beer, between three carpenters and myself, and one of my labourers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you drank? - A. Yes, before I came to the White-hart.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink at the White-hart? - A. Threepennyworth of gin, me and the landlord together.</p>

               <p>Q. How much had you of the gin at that house? - A. About three glasses.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk then? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You found the prisoner there the next morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you consent to let her have the watch till the next morning? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to have the Jury believe, that you as a married man, married for twenty years, having a number of children, as you describe, going with a common woman to a common brothel, and never offer the woman sixpence? - A. She never asked me for any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer her the bad shilling? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any thing? - A. Nor any thing but the liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, notwithstanding this watch was denied to you the second day, you did not like to prosecute, according to the advice of the landlord? - A. I thought to have it again; if I had had my property again, I did not wish to involve myself in it.</p>

               <p>Q. Ten pounds to recover the property of two pounds eight, for that is all the property in the indictment? - A. Yes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Marlow, in Buckinghamshire. On Friday, the 18th of June, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was coming from Hampton to Marlow alone, in a one-horse chaise—about half a mile from the turnpike beyond Staines, in the public highway, I saw the prisoner Hodges, and another man, whom I cannot recognise, on the footpath—when I was within twenty yards of them, as I drew near to them, Hodges drew near the middle of the road, and made a grasp at my horse's bridle—my horse had ran into a smart pace, and some part of it hit against him, so that he could not get the rein, and I drove on—the other man was standing on the path, and did nothing—when I got about twenty yards further, they hallooed out, "Which is the way to Staines?"—they did not run after me—it was not very dark—I never saw the men before—but I saw him well, his clothes, and dress, and every thing—I noticed him, being fearful of him—he was on the left-hand side of the road—I was on the near side of the gig, and he on die off side—I gave an alarm when I got to the turnpike, to two policemen—I did not go with them—I saw Hodges again on the following Wednesday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hodges. Q.</hi> Was there any thing remarkable near where we were walking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not perceive it—there are two roads just beyond the bridge—I met two policemen near the town—I gave my name as Webb of Marlow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty near Staines, on the 18th of June, and saw the prosecutor come up in a gig, about half-past ten o'clock, at a smart pace—he made a complaint of two men; and gave me a description of them—I told Cooper, and gave him the same description.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received from O'Toole a descrip<lb></lb>tion of two people—I was on duty that night at Noel-green, at the bottom of Staines, and met the two prisoners about half a mile from where the gig was stopped, coming on towards Staines, between the turnpike and where the prosecutor described this to have happened—it was about twenty minutes to eleven o'clock—I stood still, and let them pass me—they were talking together—I followed them into Staines, and took them—my sergeant and brother constable came to my assistance—4 took them to the station— the prisoners told different stories there—they were separated—the ser<lb></lb>geant took down what they said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I was present when the prisoners were examined at the station—Whatton was brought in first—I asked him to give an account of himself, and state what he knew of the other man—he said he knew nothing of him whatever—he afterwards said he had met him at Hampton races that morning, and had been with him ever since Epsom races—that they had been to Ascot together, and slept at Chertsey on Tuesday, the day before Hampton races, and had slept together at Windsor the night before that, that they sold cards and songs at the races, that they had been together, and nobody had passed them on the road—Hodges was brought in, and said he knew nothing of Whatton—he then said he had seen him at Epsom races that day, that they had been together there, and at Hampton races the day before, that he slept with him at Leatherhead</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184107050072"></xptr>
               <p>on the night that Whatton said they had slept at Chertsey—they were afterwards both together, and said they had seen a gentleman pass them in a gig at a full gallop, and they asked him the way to Staines—Hodges' jacket appeared to have been recently torn, which might be done by coming in contact with the gig—he said he tore it immediately after the gig passed them, by climbing up a sign-post, on this side of the bridge, to see the way to Staines—Whatton gave the same account of the jacket being torn, saying he lifted him up to the post, and in climbing down he tore his jacket.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hodyes' Defence.</hi> We bad been to Hampton races, and had some re<lb></lb>freshment as we came along towards Staines, at a public-house about four miles from Staines. I afterwards inquired how far it was, and was told it was three miles. We came to where there are two roads and a finger-post: I asked this young man if he would lift me up to the post, to see the direc<lb></lb>tion. I stood on his shoulder; I slipped down, and that is the way my jacket got torn. I lifted him up afterwards on my shoulders, but he could not make out the words on the post: he said, "Here is a person coming on, ask him;" and I asked the gentleman in a gig. He did not seem to hear me, but drove on fast.</p>

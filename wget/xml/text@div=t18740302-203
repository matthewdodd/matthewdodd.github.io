                  </hi>. I carry on business as an India Rubber Manufacturer, at 87, Gracechurch Street, in partnership with Mr. Smith, the prisoner was in our employ as salesman—he had been with us about two years and a half—I knew him before at Mr. Fennell's, an India rubber dealer—last year I had occasion, with my partner, to be absent in the north for several months, attending to a contract which we had; the prisoner and a man named Otway were left in charge, we had a customer named Treenham, of 64, Deacon Street, Walworth Road—he sells pouches—if a person made a purchase and paid at the time, it was the prisoner's duty to enter it in his rough cash book and at night account for it to Mr. Smith, who was the financial partner, and in the absence of Mr. Smith and myself he would hand it to the cashier—on 23rd January, this year, I received a letter, in consequence of which I called in the services of the police; and on 4th February, in consequence of a communication that was made to me I went with my partner and Peck to the Royal Exchange, and Peck was subsequently given into custody—I have seen Mr. Treenham, and he has handed over to me a largo number of invoices bearing Peck's signa<lb></lb>ture—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are three of them—they are receipted by Peck; one is dated 4th October, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., one 11th November, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one 8th December, 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., all for pouches—I have looked at our books and have them here, I find no entry of those three sums—the prisoner has never accounted to me for them—here are eight more receipts signed by him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 64, Deacon Street, Walworth—I keep a tobacconist's shop, which my wife manages—at the beginning of 1873, in consequence of an advertisement in the paper I went to Mr. Meiter's place in Gracechurch Street, and bought some pouches; I paid Otway for them—after that I went there frequently, and purchased goods nearly every day, I could not swear to particular dates—I paid money on the three invoices produced, and the person I paid receipted them—in the early part of this year I received a communication from Mr. Meiter, in consequence of which I handed to him a large number of invoices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> When you received the money you have many times been serving other customers, and I have often looked out things for myself—I always paid at the time or next morning—I never had anything to drink with any of the men—I have sometimes been there just at closing time.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Meiter—we were away in the North last year for some time; but we were back at inter<lb></lb>vals for a day, and then away again—we were both more or less in town during October, November, and December last—when money was paid over the counter to the prisoner it was his duty to account to me at night for it, and pay it to me; occasionally it would go for two days, even if I happened to be there—in my absence he would keep the money as long as three, four, or five days, and at the expiration of that time he would hand it to me—I may, on one or two occasions, have been away seven days, then home for one and back again—this is the daily cash-book, and the totals are made up in my writing nearly every day, and by this I can tell when I was in town—the 4th October was a Saturday, the cash was not made up on that day; the first time it was made up after the 4th was on the 15th, on that day he paid over the balance of those thirteen days, from the 4th to the 15th inclusive—he would probably have handed over to me 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a night, so as to reduce the amount in his box, and on the 15th it was finally balanced—I was probably there between the 4th and 15th—I am sure I received some money in that interval, because the total amount taken in that time would be so large that I should never allow such a sum to accumulate in his box—the total receipts on the 15th, I see, was 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., including the accumulation of overs during that period, which amounted to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the first time after the 11th November that he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187403020020"></xptr>
               <p>accounted to me was on the 22nd, he then paid me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of which 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is booked as the accumulation of overs from the 4th; and the first time after 8th December was the 17th, I think that would be from the 1st—he had a desk and key, with money bowls, and a box to put the gold in; when he effected a sale and received the money he should enter it in this book—it was his duty to enter all the money he received, with the exception of small sums under a shilling, and at the end of the day those small sums would accumulate, which we call "overs"—those overs were a constant source of grief between him and me; I always blamed him for the overs amounting to so large a sum, and told him the sales should be more carefully entered; with regard to such large sums as those in the indict<lb></lb>ment they should have been entered at once; nothing but gross careless<lb></lb>ness, or worse, could have prevented their being entered—these are the dates relating to the other invoices: after the 16th June the accounts were made up on the 17th; after the 15th August, on the 26th; after 29th September, on 1st October; after 17th November, on the 22nd; and after 24th November, on 1st December.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> When you handed me over money I gave you a little ticket for the amount, and you initialled it, and when I balanced with you that was considered a voucher for the cash—you had your money-box to keep those tickets in, and the key was in your own possession—I do not recollect omitting to give you a ticket on any occasion, or making a mistake about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I gave you to pay petty accounts, and deducting it from the "overs," making you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short—I see here is an entry of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on 22nd November, altered to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I cannot say at this distance of time whether that refers to the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you speak of—we had such trust and confidence in you that, before we discovered this, we were discussing the propriety of taking a shop at the West End, and putting you in sole charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The term "overs" relates to the small accounts—every<lb></lb>thing above a shilling would have to be entered each day—the total amount of "overs" allowed at the expiration of the six or ten days would be the amounts he had received and not entered—they should not amount to as much as 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he was in the habit of neglecting to enter sums considerably larger than a shilling.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you keep a cashier? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we had a confidential clerk, Mr. Warren, one could scarcely pall him a cashier—Mr. Meiter is com<lb></lb>parativel ignorant of the financial department—it was not the prisoner's duty to hand over money to Warren, only to me—I do not think he had so much to do in serving customers that he might forget to make entries—he might forget a matter of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there might be a little pressure sometimes for three quarters of an hour or so if several customers come in at once, but then he would have an hour with scarcely anything to do—the total amount of "overs" on 15th October was 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 27th, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 4th November, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 22nd, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 1st December, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 17th, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and on 31st, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; making a total of 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I paid over the money that I received in all cases, and put it in the box. I was busily engaged with other customers while serving Mr. Treenham, that was why the money was not entered. Sometimes I have been engaged serving three or four customers at a time. Next door but one there was another India rubber shop, and if customers were not served immediately they would go there. I placed the money in the till, and when I was at liberty I entered it. I am sorry to say I have sometimes omitted to enter things, and they have sometimes amounted to more than double the amount of the overs. I have in no case taken any money. I have not robbed my masters of any money since I have been in their employ. I was under very great disadvantage in having shopmen about me who were given to drink, and I have been reprimanded by Mr. Meiter for not speaking of their misdeeds, but no complaint was ever made against' me for drinking.</p>

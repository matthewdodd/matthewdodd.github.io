               <p>John Brown. There was a Disturbance in the Tower, occasion'd by the Prisoner's Wife abusing another Woman, for which I had Orders from Captain Hudson, the Officer of the Guards, to turn her out of the Garrison. I went accordingly to the Barrack where she was, about 9 at Night; the Prisoner was then a-bed. I told her she must turn out; upon which she said, Jo, will you see me turn'd out ? No, says he, and starts up an-end. I have no difference with you Jo, says I. No matter for that, says he, you shan't turn her out, and immediately he catch'd up his Piece and presented. I went to take hold of his Piece; but says he, Take care! if you stir a Foot, you're a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173309120025"></xptr> dead Man.

So I step'd back, and went to the Officer of the Guard, and acquainted him that the Prisoner stood with his Piece presented, and did not know what he meant by it.

I was at the Barrack-door, when the Deceas'd with 4 Men behind him came in, and when he was got within 6 or 7 Yards of the Prisoner, the Prisoner said, Take care of your self Bob. He had no sooner spoke than his Piece went off, and the Deceas'd drop'd down, and said, Lord have Mercy upon me! I took him up, but he was dead. Mean time, the other four secur'd the Prisoner - No Body had a Gun there but he. I run directly up to the Officer, and told him what had happen'd, and he order'd me to take the Prisoner to the Black-hole, - when came to fetch him, I found his Ram-tod under his bed.</p>

            . The Prisoner presented his Piece to Brown. I advis'd Brown to come up. I went towards the Prisoner, and he said to me, as he said before to Brown, If you come a step farther, you're a dead Man. Why do you take such wicked thoughts in your Head, says I, against those that never hurt you? And his answer was, I am resolv'd to do Mischief, if I go to Hell the next Minute. Then the Deceas'd came in, and before he spoke a Word to the Prisoner, the Prisoner cry'd, Take care Bob! and his Piece went off slamm! The Deceas'd fell, the Prisoner sat himself down on the Bed, and laid his Piece by him, and I took it up, and saw it was Discharg'd.</p>

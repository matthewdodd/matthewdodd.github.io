                  </hi>. I reside on Ludgate-hill, and am a linen-draper. About five o'clock in the afternoon of the 29th of August, I was in High Holborn—I stopped to look at a picture-shop, and felt something at my coat-pocket—I felt and my handkerchief was gone—I saw the prisoner walk<lb></lb>ing from me, and followed him—he began to run—I ran—he threw the handkerchief down, and I secured him—the handkerchief was brought to me—I did not say a word to him, but he said, "It was not me, I did not do it"—I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at 50, Smith Street, St. George's in-the-East—on Sunday evening, 12th September, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was in Royal Mint Street, going to my employment—I had a silver watch in my left waistcoat pocket attached to my button hole by a chain—I had a tall hat on—some parties came behind me and tried to knock my hat over my eyes—I went into the middle of the road and called for the assistance of the police—they threw me on my back and my head was cut in two places—I called out "Police.'" repeatedly—three or four persons surrounded me in the road, I can't swear to any of them; they tore my coats open and took my watch away—one of them placed his hand over my mouth so that I should not halloo—they then all ran away—I was stunned; some one took me to a surgeon, and I had two scalp wounds where I fell on my head in the road; they had to be sewn up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, 8, Minories—about 9.30 this Sun<lb></lb>day evening I was in Royal Mint Street—I heard a shout of "Police!"and saw three young men running in the road from the direction of the cry; the prisoner was one of them—as they passed one said to the other "If you don't mind what you are doing I will <hi rend="italic">give</hi> you a b——<hi rend="italic">job in</hi> the eye"—they ran close past me—I then went up to the prosecutor and found him lying in the road, he was just beginning to get up—I waited till a constable came, and gave him information—next morning I was fetched to Leman Street police-station—fourteen men were placed before me and I picked out the prisoner, he was wearing the same cap and clothes as he had on the Sunday night.</p>

In consequence of information I re<lb></lb>ceived from Smith, on 12th December, I took him to the Leman Street station, on the 13th—the prisoner was there in custody on another charge with two other men—they were placed with eleven others—Smith then told me the prisoner was one of the men; he had a doubt about the other two—the prisoner was sent to the House of Correction for three months on the other charge, and at the expiration of that time I took him into custody on this charge.</p>

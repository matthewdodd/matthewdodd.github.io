I occupy the two shops and two attics, in which I have two persons put in to take care of the house; it is a corner house - I let the house to different lodgers; I let one kitchen to a Mr. Ewer, the other kitchen I keep for the accommodation of the lodgers - the cellar may be about ten yards from the kitchen-door - I leave my shop every night for my residence at Holloway; I left it on Tuesday evening, the 17th of March, as near half-past nine o'clock as I can recollect - before I left it, I took down my cash-box into my cellar, in which was enclosed three 20l. notes, I can swear, but I believe there were four, upwards of 50 sovereigns, from 5l. to 7l. in silver, and amongst the silver was a bad crown-piece, with a piece cut out of the edge of it nearly the eighth of an inch, and two bills of exchange - I locked my cash-box, put it into an iron chest in the cellar; I locked the chest and the cellar-door - my shop was shutting up at this time; I waited till I saw the shop-doors closed, and then set off for Holloway - the next morning I received some information, a little after nine o'clock, and went down into the cellar with a light; I found the cellar-door broken open, and the iron chest gone, and a chisel was lying on the ledge where the iron-chest had been placed - the chisel is in the possession of the constable; I should know it again- I found my iron-chest the same morning at the house of a chimney-sweeper, named Brown, in Feather's-court, Fox-court - I have no doubt it was my chest; the prisoner Hawkins came to live with me, I think in December, 1826, and left me last September; he must have seen me going down stairs to deposit my cash-box in the cellar, as as it has been my custom for the last six months - the kitchen is at the corner of Charles-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many servants were in the house altogether at that time? A.

No; I suppose bell to be a wicked place - that person told me if I told lies I should go to that wicked place - I believe that now; I have heard about religion before that - I do not know the Commandments -I do not know my duty to God - I have lived in that public-house three years; I have known Hawkins, as living in the service of Mr. Carr - if the other young man had been Hawkins I should have known him; but I am sure it was not; when they crossed the road they went towards Brooke-street.</p>

Ballard told me to call his mother, and said he wanted no light - the noise I heard shook the partition: I asked Ballard who his mother was, and he said Ballard - I opened the back door, called Mrs. Ballard, and then I went into my room; the next morning I opened my door to get some water, and Mrs. Ballard said to me, "Come up stairs, and I will shew you the box that was let down last night" - she said it was let down by her son; I went up stairs, and saw a wooden box with some mouldings in it for cielings, such as plasterers use - I did not go near enough to see whether the mouldings were broken, or not; I cannot say whether it was the box which I had seen the night before - I did not examine it at all.</p>

No, they live in a small house in the yard; I knew Ballards before -I had never seen Hawkins before; Mr.Sandell staid with the light till they were up stairs - that was two or three minutes, or more than that; it might be five minutes he said at his own parlour door in the passage; and there is a passage, and then there is another passage goes down; and his door is in that - Hawkins was at the step of the door at the end of the passage next the street, a good way from the candle.</p>

No.; I had an opportunity of seeing it for about a couple of seconds - I knew it instantly when I saw it the next day; there were some of Ballard's relations in the public-house, playing at bagatelle, and one young man that beat him out of the steaks- I have been here before for my own property; I was tried for a game cock, as they called,it, but I was honourably acquitted - I was not up above a minute and a half, and you were my counsel; there were one or two witnesses examined, but it did not last above a minute and a half - I never heard of any body saying they could swear a spot off a tea-kettle; I never said that unless I got a pound, I would swear a spout off a tea-kettle - I never said, in the presence of Badland and another person, that I knew nothing about this robbery; they offered me 10l., but I did not see why I should not be in it as well as other people; they tried to buy me to keep out of the way - I was never accused of any thing beside the game cock, unless it was fighting now and then; there never was a young woman who lost any clothes, and brought a charge against me - it was in October Session I was tried about the game cuck; I know Badland perfectly well - he is the landlord of that public-house, and I know

On Tuesday, the 17th of March, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, Hawkings and John Ballard came to my house; I have no doubt they are the persons - I knew Hawkins before; he said he had come to pay me what he owed me, as he had been up to the neighbourhood of Clare-market, and had won 25s. at cards; he gave me a crown-piece, which was not a good one, and I told him it would not do - he said to Ballard, "John, you must lend me 5s.;" Ballard put down two half - crowns, and a penny, and I took it up - they then went into the tap-room, and had half a gallon of ale.</p>

            . I keep the George public - house, in Brooke-street. On the 17th of March, about a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, Hawkins, John Ballard, and another person, whose name I have heard is Riley, came into my house; they called for three glasses of wine, and one of them, which I believe was Hawkins, put down a crown-piece, which I refused, as I was convinced it was not a good one, and they gave me a shilling - the crown-piece had rather a deep cut on the edge, rather wider than a piece would be cut, to ascertain whether it was good or bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You will not swear who it was? A. I think it was Hawkins; I have a good deal of bad money offered me - some people do cut the edge of money, to ascertain whether it is good, but that. is not my way; this was very bad - it was white metal; I looked at it for some time because I happened to have one before.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. Q. Did it appear to be cut for ascertaining whether it was good or bad? A. Yes, but more cut than is usual for that purpose.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Mrs. Horne's, 19, Leicester Square, as ser<lb></lb>vant—on the morning of Tuesday, 23rd November, I went down about 7.30—I had not heard the deceased come home during the night—he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186912130046"></xptr>
               <p>not in the kitchen when I went down—he came down into the kitchen about 9.15—he stood there, and began to scratch his head—he had his waistcoat outside his coat, and two socks on one foot—he did not speak to me, nor I to him—I remained in the kitchen about three minutes after he came down, and then I went up stairs—my attention was attracted by a smell of burning—I went down, and saw the deceased sitting in the fender—his legs were across the top of it, and his back towards the fire—the lining of his waistcoat was on fire—I took hold of his hand and tried to raise him up; but he drew his hand away, and would not let me touch him—I went up and called his sister from the shop, and when she came we put out the fire on his waistcoat, and we drew the fender away from the fire—I then went up stairs and fetched his mother—he afterwards walked up stairs to his bed-room, and I saw him get into bed—he did not speak all the time—I saw him again about 11.30 that day—I was scrubbing the next room, and he came out on the landing, with a blanket round him—he opened his eyes, and looked all round, as if he was silly—he went back and slammed the door, and I heard a knocking, as if he was knocking his knuckles against the wall—I was frightened, and locked myself in—I went down about a quarter of an hour after—I did not hear any noise besides knocking—after I had been down to Mrs. Horne, I returned again to the room in about twenty minutes—he was then lying on the floor, on his back, at the side of the bed—I did not hear any fall whilst I was in the adjoining room—I was in the house the whole of the time, till his death—he did not meet with any falls or blows during that time, as far as I know.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were a quarter of an hour down in the kitchen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when I found him in the fender his shoulder was against the oven—there was a fire in the grate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 20, New Street, Spring Gardens—on the afternoon of Tuesday, 23rd November, I was called to 19, Leicester Square—I saw the deceased, Mr. Horne, there—he was up stairs in the top room—he was insensible—I continued to attend him to the time of his death—he died on Thursday morning, at 7 o'clock—he was not sensible the whole time—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the Saturday—there were several extensive bruises on the body, externally; on the head and neck, the front of the chest, and on each side of the trunk, from the arm-pit to the hip; the scrotum was very much enlarged and blackened, especially on the left side; upon taking off the scalp there was a large extravasated patch of effused blood at the left side of the crown of the head; I then took off the skull cap, and corresponding with that patch was a large clot of blood about the size of my fist, extending into the sub<lb></lb>stance of the brain itself; the surface of the brain was in a state of congestion, and upon moving the brain I found a fracture at the base of the skull, at the right hand side; the length of the fracture was about three inches and a half; I found quite sufficient to account for his death and insensibility, and to confirm me in saying the wounds were inflicted with violence; I found a fracture of the fifth and sixth ribs on the left side; there was blood in the pleura, but that was from the injuries received—the actual cause of death was pressure on the brain, caused by the clot of blood—I have heard the evidence as to the blows, and I consider that death was consistent with that evidence—the injuries would result from the blows which I have heard of—I looked on the injury to the head as a counter fracture, that the blow was on the left, and the fracture on the right—the evidence is not incon<lb></lb>sistent</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186912130047"></xptr>
               <p>with that—sometimes the fracture occurs at the same spot where the blow is given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You can't say whether that was caused by a blow, or from the fall; is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that is so—a counter fracture is not an unusual thing—it is more likely to happen from a fall than from a blow with a hard instrument—I have no doubt that this fracture was caused by a fall, but with violence, not by a fall itself—it must have been accompanied by violence—a man falling violently on the back of his head on a hard substance might occasion a fracture at the base of the skull—there is no external mark at that part at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You believe great violence was used to cause the frac<lb></lb>ture? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there must have been something in addition to the fall—a blow from the fist would very likely produce a counter fracture—I should very likely find a mark from the fist.</p>

I received directions to take the prisoner into custody on 25th November—I went to his lodgings, and found he had left there; that was the day the man died—I saw nothing of him until the 1st December, when he came to the station and gave himself up.</p>

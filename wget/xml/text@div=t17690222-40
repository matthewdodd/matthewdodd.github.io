A man came riding up on one side of me below Stamford Hill, near the Seven Sisters, and ordered me to stop: it was quite a moon-light night, and I could see part of his face, but cannot down-right swear to him.

             asked me if I chose to give an account of them pieces; I told him I would not. I have taken all the pains I could to have the man apprehended, and I find since he is in France.</p>
               <p>Q. to Townsend. What size man was the man that stopt the chariot?</p>
               <p>Townsend. He appeared to be a thinish sized man, much the size of the prisoner: I could not distinguish whether he wore a wig or his own hair, but it was a darkish curl.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hancock. How long has the prisoner lodged at your house?</p>
               <p>Hancock. He has lodged at my house between three and four months; he is a bell-hanger or white-smith; he did several jobs for me; he hung three bells for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he use to work?</p>
               <p>Hancock. I do not know that he worked any where; he told me he went out to work; he sometimes had an apron on, and looked like a man that went out to work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I worked journeywork. In the early part of my life I worked for my father, and after that, I did bell-hanging for myself: that business being so beneficial, I did not work but three days in a week, which were sufficient to maintain me very well.</p>

I called to my chairman to let me out. I had drawn my sword out of the scabberd, and directed the point towards the glass, and endeavoured to get out: the prisoner then was for retiring.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>

            . It was very moon-light. I suppose in about a couple of minutes, or not so much, the fore chairman had got hold of him, and he was struggling with him on the ground in the middle of the street; when I got out, I went up to him, and pointed my sword to him, and desired him to surrender, which he soon did: when he was up, I took this pistol from the ground which lay under him. (Producing a pocket pistol.) It was charged with only powder and a bit of cork.</p>
               <p>- Edwards. I was bringing Mr. Wheatham home. We were stopt by the prisoner in New Bond-street. I was behind. He put a pistol through the glass of the chair, and said, Sir, your life or your money. That very minute my master said something, what I cannot tell. My partner laid hold of the prisoner, and by meer strength flung him down in the street. My master called to me to let him out, which I did as soon as I could, and we secured the prisoner. This pistol was found under the prisoner in the struggle.</p>

            . I was the fore chairman; the prisoner bid me stop. I did not stop at first; he said, If you do not stop, I will blow your brains out. Then I set down the chair. I turned round, and he went to my master. I saw my master with his sword drawn in the chair; he called to us to open the chair; instead of opening it, I laid hold of the prisoner as soon as I saw him strike his pistol through the glass, and threw him on his back in the middle of the street, and secured him.</p>

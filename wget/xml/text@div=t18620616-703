                  </hi>. I reside at Woolwich-common—I prepare candidates for the army—I occupy six houses which form Clarence-terrace there—there is a verandah running from the first to the last house opposite the first-floor window, those are sash-windows, they go within six inches of the floor of the room—this photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a correct representation of the terrace—at No. 1 there are Venetian shutters outside the lower windows—the verandah is about fifteen or sixteen feet from the ground, and at the other end, at No. 6, there is a wall which is about seven feet in height from the wall of the house, but slopes down to about four feet next the road—I occupy the drawing-room of No. 6, as my bedroom; myself; Mrs. Taylor, and my daughter occupy that room; Mr. Henry Chery occupies the corres<lb></lb>ponding room in No. 5—about a quarter-past 2 on the morning of the 17th May, I heard a candlestick fall—my dressing-table is across the window, and there is a chest of drawers close to the dressing-table—when I retired to rest, a candlestick had been left either on the dressing-table or looking-glass, or on the chest of drawers—there are two toilet candlesticks—the noise awoke my wife, she said, "What is that?"—I said, "Oh, nothing"—I fell asleep again for a short time and was awoke again by my wife—I rose in consequence of what she said—I heard a rustling noise, and heard a noise as of some one breaking into the house—I heard a stranger's voice, and called out immediately, "Who are you?"—the voice answered, "A friend"—I said, "If you are not off I will dash your brains out," and I rushed out of bed—my wife immediately struck a light, calling out, "Here's a pistol, and here's a poker"—as soon as the match was ignited I saw the prisoner, it was he who had spoken—his head was on a level with the dressing-table, projecting beyond the edge—his head was about half a yard inside the apartment—I said, "I will shoot you"—he said, "Don't shoot," and then withdrew, and I closed the shutters after him—I had found them open—they were put to the night before, but not barred—when I got out of bed, the sash was up, nearly as high as it would go, but when I retired to rest, it was closed—it was the prisoner's face that I saw over the dressing-table—there was something peculiar in his voice—I thought he was a foreigner—I tried to get out by the third window</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186206160098"></xptr>
               <p>—I rushed out as soon as I could open the shutters—the prisoner had made his escape—I searched the premises, and made a more minute search on the following morning—I gave information to the police about half an hour afterwards, and partly described the person of the prisoner, and he was brought to me in better than an hour afterwards, between 4 and 5 o'clock, by the constable to whom I had given the information—I said, "That is the man"—I did not go into Mr. Chery's room when I examined the premises—he communicated with me, and handed me a cap, which I threw over the verandah—the following morning I examined, and found footmarks on the Venetian shutters at No. 1, and a broken pane; also a broken pane in No. 2, and one in No. 5—at Mr. Chery's room the marks were about the breadth of a man's foot on the trellis work that forms the shutters—it is possible to ascend to the verandah by the Venetian shutters, with some amount of risk—I went to the station with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pupil in Mr. Taylor's establishment, and sleep in the first-floor room of No. 5, the next room to Mr. Taylor's, on the same floor—about 10 minutes or a quarter to 2 on Saturday morning, 17th May, I was awoke by hearing a crash of glass—I turned round and sat up in bed, and saw some one come up to my window and try to open it with his hands—he did not succeed in pushing it up—it was fastened—he then passed on towards No. 6—I was hardly awake—after a time I heard Mr. Taylor's voice, and a strange voice speaking—then I heard a noise of shut<lb></lb>ting a window or shutters, or something like that, and then I heard a strange voice say, "Oh, my fingers!"—I eventually got out of bed, went to the window, and spoke to Mr. Taylor—I afterwards examined my windows, and found the pane of glass next to the fastening broken, and I found a man's cap in my room, under the window—the window was open from the top—I cannot remember whether it was open from the bottom or not—the window that was fastened is another window—there are three in my room—it was the farthest from my bed that was broken—my bed is close to the window—I picked the cap up, and gave it to Mr. Taylor, and saw him give it to the policeman.</p>

About 3 o'clock on the morning of 17th May, I was on duty on Woolwich Common, near Mr. Taylor's—I saw Mr. Taylor on the balcony—he gave me information, and handed me the cap produced—I made inquiries, and upon receiving other information from Watts, another constable, I went across to the barracks, which is about half a mile from Mr. Taylor's—I made inquiries of the sentry, and after<lb></lb>wards found the prisoner in a watering-place belonging to the barracks—he had no cap on—he had a cut across his forehead, and was holding his hand<lb></lb>kerchief up to it at the time—his clothes were not unfastened—I took him into custody—on the way to the station I said to him, "Have you lost your cap?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "What colour is your cap?"—he said, "Black"—at the station I took this cap out of my pocket, and asked if he knew it—he said, "Yes, it is my cap"—before taking him to the station, I took him to Mr. Taylor's, and he said, "That is the man"—he was sober, but appeared to have been</p>

Yes; I then saw one hanging outside of his pocket under his coat; I asked him what that meant; he told me he did not know any thing about it; I then said, my good friend, as I have found one pair on you, it is necessary that I should search you farther; I felt in his right hand pocket, and there was another pair; he said they were his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that they are your's? - A. Yes, there is my mark on the inside of them, I had them in my hand not three minutes before; both pair were women's shoes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Tomlin, who lives in Wood<lb></lb>land-street, Dalston. The prisoner came to me on the 23rd of October, and told me my husband had fallen overboard with a basket of bottles, and that he was waiting for a change of clothes, which he had come for—I gave him a great-coat, a pair of trowsers, a pair of stockings, a shirt, and an apron—he said my husband had laughed at him for falling over, and now he had got the laugh at him—I gave him the things, believing this story.</p>

The pri<lb></lb>soner came to me on the 23rd of October, about a quarter to four o'clock, and wanted William Smith, an engineer—I was at the stable—it is about two miles from where my wife lives—I said I did not know William Smith, an engineer; I knew several Smiths, but they were gardeners—he said be wanted to put this Smith in work, and he used the sign of the Feathers, Dock-head—I did not know the prisoner before—I told him where I lived—he said Smith lived two doors from me, and said, "Don't you live at Homerton?"—I said I did, but I had removed from there—I had not fallen overboard that day—I saw him again on the 29th, coming from Lime-street to Fenchurch-street—when he saw me he ran away—I ran after him, and took him on St. Dunstan's-hill—we have not found any of the clothes.</p>

Between 8 and 9 o'clock, one evening, I was going through Fenchurch-street, on my way home—I saw Mr. Taylor there—he appeared the worse for liquor—I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Cullum-street—MR. Taylor was crossing Cullum-street—the prisoner went up to him, and put his face to Mr. Taylor's face, and Mr. Taylor said to him, "Do you know me?"—the prisoner said, "Do you know me?"—the prisoner then took hold of Mr. Taylor's stick, and they wrestled, and the prisoner took hold of his legs and threw him down—they both fell down—it was a very heavy fall that Mr. Taylor had—some gentlemen then came up, and endea<lb></lb>voured to part them—I was not more than the space of a yard from them—they raised Mr. Taylor up—they called on others to assist—they said, "For God's sake, come, or he will kill him"—they separated, and the prisoner ran across the road—I did not see whether he had anything in his hand at that time—three policemen came up, and two of them followed the prisoner, and one remained with Mr. Taylor—they brought the prisoner back, I think, in about five minutes—I remained there, and I saw the policeman overtake him—I had lost sight of him—I saw him afterwards in custody of the policeman—I am sure he is the same man that I saw attack Mr. Taylor—I did not see him do anything when he had Mr. Taylor down—the men came between them and me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Although it was not your habit to do so, it is the custom of the trade? A. That I can say nothing about - I have been in the trade about eight years - I have not been shopman in a retail house - I will not undertake to swear it is not the custom, but I should consider it is not - a note fell from his pocket with the other things, containing an order from a friend of his for these very articles - I believe the policeman has it.(This note was signed " J. Fraser," and requested the prisoner to send him the articles in question.)</p>

             re-examined. They are the property of myself and partners - I had him taken into custody in consequence of something which I disapproved of - he had no time to give me any account of this, if he had taken them to purchase, but they were secreted about his person - our custom is to take goods to the entering clerk, and have them entered before they are taken out of the shop - he had no opportunity to have them entered after I had taken him into custody - he has now given an account of buying them on his own account - he said nothing about them at all till the policeman searched him - the letter was found at the same time - I received a very good character with him - we had not been more busy than usual that day.(Witnesses for the Defence.)</p>

            . I am a shopman to Brown, Sharp, and Co., Linen-drapers, in Bread-street. I have been in the retail trade upwards of ten years as a servant - I have been eighteen months in Brown, Sharp and Co.'s service - I have been in four places of the same kind in London, and one in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the understood term of contract between a master and servant in your business with reference to goods? A. That they are not entered during the time of day when they are busy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are entered? A. Goods that young men require for their own purpose - they are not taken secretly, but the young men get the goods cut, and they are laid aside till they are entered, either in the morning or evening - the man who wants them often cuts them off himself - he gives notice to his employer of it - they are laid aside publicly.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Is it always the case that goods are openly exposed to the master's eye? A. I cannot say that it is - I have been in the employ of people whom I might not see for three or four days - the goods are generally entered in the morning, being the most disengaged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are we to understand that you being in the employ of a person, in his absence for four days together, you have taken his goods, and set them aside without his knowledge or any communication to him? A. No; I get the goods entered for me during his absence, by another servant - but I could not do that while they were busy - there was no secrecy in the transaction - they were laid aside.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A. Upwards of seven years - his character has been the best for honesty and respectability.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, Basinghall-street. I have known the prisoner ten or twelve years - he bore a strictly good character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you the writer of this note? A. Yes- I wrote it to the prisoner with the intention of getting the goods - I thought I should have them cheaper from him than at other shops - I thought I should have them at cost price.</p>
               <p>MR. SIMPSON re-examined. The price is marked on one of the articles - a young man, Adams, was in the depart<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150017"></xptr>ment to sell these goods - the prisoner could know the price from the mark - the mark does not signify the cost price at all - the wholesale and retail price is marked on them - the handkerchiefs are 47s. 6d. a dozen, or 4s. 6d. a single handkerchief - we allow our servants to take articles from the stock at cost price - they employ another to cut or count them, and that person takes them up to the entering clerk to be entered at that very time.</p>

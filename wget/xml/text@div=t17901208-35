               <p>The case opened by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury: Gentlemen, I am of counsel in this case for the prosecutor against the two men at the bar; and it has very often been my fortune to stand in this place, in the situation in which my learned friend stands to-night, called upon to do the best in the compass of my power, to defend real or supposed innocence: Gentlemen, I have not taken leave of the feelings which must necessarily operate on the minds of advocates<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080061"></xptr>placed in so painful a situation, in a place too in which by the wisdom of the law it is denied to the advocate, on the part of his client, to make any address in his defence; all that it is permitted to us who stand as counsel for prisoners, is to endeavour, by such questions as may occur to us, to impress on the minds of the Jury observations tending to excite distrust of the evidence, and to evince that which we are instructed is the truth of the case. On the present occasion, Gentlemen, I feel this to be a very momentous enquiry indeed: on the one hand, the lives of two of our fellow citizens are at stake; the best interests of society, on the other hand, are at stake; and therefore it is material that you, under the direction you shall receive from the Court, should lend your very, very best attention to the minutest circumstance that on the one hand may go to make up the degree of guilt imputed to the prisoners, or that on the other hand may weigh in the scale of innocence. Gentlemen, the prisoners are charged with a highway robbery; and in point of law, if the facts are made out, which it will be necessary for me, on the part of the prosecution, to make out, I must shew to you that the prosecutor of the present indictment has parted with goods to the defendants, on some terror inducing him to dispose of his property not agreeable to his own will: in the ordinary case of highway robbery, you have evidence laid before you, that either a pistol, a cutlass, or some other deadly or offensive weapon, has been produced with circumstances of terror to the man that complains he has lost his property; on the present occasion you will have no such evidence; the prisoners have obtained of the prosecutor his goods, by the apprehension that his character would be ruined unless he parted with his property. Gentlemen, I know of no times in the legal history of the jurisprudence of this country, in which it has been doubted that such a terror applied to any man constituted that force necessary to make a highway robbery; but if at any time it has been doubted, such doubts are quieted and removed by the determination of all the judges of England; they have declared that, if by menaces used by prisoners threatening to charge the prosecutor with an unnatural crime, or with unnatural and unmanly practices, it is as much in the eye of the law a highway robbery as if they should have knocked him down, or produced a blunderbuss or pistol, or any other weapon; therefore, Gentlemen, as you were not the Jury that attended in that place yesterday, of the law then and now laid down there can be no doubt: Gentlemen, I shall now proceed to state to you some of the circumstances in the case, avoiding by choice to be extremely particular about them, by which the guilt of the prisoners is to be imputed to them in evidence; they are, as you may observe by their appearance, soldiers in the Coldstream regiment of guards; one of them, I may state to you without prejudice, I mention it because it is inseparable from the story now to be told you; one of them is already convicted of a similar offence; and he, together with an unfortunate man now under the sentence of the law, is stated to have applied in the streets of this town to the prosecutor, Mr. Sharp, and by threats that they would accuse him of the abominable practice to be stated to you by the witness, obtained from him a sum of money, which was the subject of another prosecution: Gentlemen, I apprehend when once a man has been weak enough to part with the smallest portion of his property, he is the constant marked object of the man that has first made the application; the mind cannot resist the impression, the overbearing and overwhelming impression, that this observation makes upon it, How came you to give money to a man, if you was innocent; if you was innocent of a crime that most disgraces human nature? Therefore, if a man is taken in an unprepared moment, and has the misfortune once to part with any of his property, experience shews us it is extremely difficult to stop the torrent of oppression, and to say, so far it shall proceed, but no further: Gentlemen, the unfortunate victim of the attacks of these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080062"></xptr>men, was prevailed upon to part with a considerable portion of his money, considerable as every thing must be according to the situation of the party; he parted with nine or ten pounds; the men were all soldiers in the Coldstream regiment; sometimes a man came with an old accomplice, then he came with a new one: Gentlemen, at last, worn out, the prosecutor applied to an old friend, a Mr. Simms; Simms directed him to take them to a magistrate, and to make application to the laws; it happened that the attack was repeated; and that which forms the subject of the present enquiry is an application made to him, at his master's house, by the prisoner Roberts; he had seen Platt several times before; Roberts, on the 28th of October, came to him, and knocked at his master's door, and procured some money; but this charge will be the attempt of the 2d of November, between seven and eight, when Roberts came to that house, having on a former day said that he came from a soldier, and that they were draughted to go abroad, and wanted money; he told him, he was come now for the last time, that they were absolutely going off on the morrow morning; that they wanted some money before they went; that, as it was the last time, half-a-guinea would do now: on this man's saying he really had not it, but would go out and borrow it, then he joined company with the prisoner Platt and some other soldiers, and they obtained from him 10 s. 6 d. Gentlemen, on the law there can be no doubt, if the money has been obtained in the manner and under the threats I have stated to you, it is a highway robbery; but there is still, Gentlemen, a most important and very anxious question remaining behind; if that which constitutes a highway robbery has been committed, by whom has it been committed? Gentlemen, beyond all question by the two prisoners at the bar, if you believe the witness, the prosecutor; if you believe him, he will tell you he had frequent opportunities of knowing the persons of them both, which makes it beyond all question that they were the men; he will state to you the conversations he had with them, which will put it out of all doubt: Gentlemen, it is my duty to make these observations to you; and it occurs, in prosecutions of this nature, to ask the question, Has the witness a fair, honest, unimpeached, irreproachable, and untainted character? Is he a man singled out by the villainy of others, for the purpose of having this sort of charge made upon him? because, as I stated yesterday, the best men in society may be the victims of those charges, on the prosecution of the worst men that disgrace human nature; but if a bad man should come forward, Juries will look anxiously into the character of the person making the accusation: Gentlemen, as a lawyer, I hold myself intitled to state to you, that it could make no difference in the case, if you should be persuaded that a man had been guilty of the filthy practice which this extortion states; still, if these men, instead of dragging him to the courts of justice, chuse to gratify their own avarice, it would still be a highway robbery; but God forbid that, whilst we in this country have the benefit of trial by jury, any such law should be stated as governing the decision of the case: Gentlemen, I ask your verdict for the publick on this plain, manly, and intelligible ground; Do you, on the result, believe all the witness tells you? If you believe him, when he states himself to have been an innocent and poor man, to have been under the terror of such accusations, of such threats, borne down by the apprehension of danger, and induced to part with his property; if you believe the story he tells you, publick justice, publick security, demand that the prisoners at the bar should be made victims to that publick justice and to that publick security; but, on the other hand, I feel I should disgrace the situation I hold in society, I feel I should dishonour the gown I have now the honour of wearing, if I did not state this to be my opinion; That if you should find the prosecutor, in the course of his evidence, equivocating with truth, tampering with justice, concealing any part of that which the intelligent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080063"></xptr>eye of a Jury should see, on all occasions; if there be any contamination in his character, and he appears interposing other men between himself and danger, dragging others forward, to be placed in that peril that is due to his own crimes; I for one, say, God forbid, that their blood should be sacrificed on the testimony of such a witness; therefore, I on the part of the prosecutor, invite your serious attention, aye, and I beg leave to crave the superintending attention of the Court too; if on this occasion, my learned friend should be able to call witnesses to you, who should cast a shade on the character and conduct of the prosecutor, and on that evidence which he will now give on his oath, in the name of God, Gentlemen, let the prisoners have the advantage of the doubt; it it is better, it has been often said, that guilty men should escape from the difficulty of proof, and the doubt that hangs over that proof, than that you and the sacred administrators of justice sitting on this bench, should run the risk of dooming to death a fellow creature, on precarious or uncertain evidence. Gentlemen, I have feebly done my duty thus far; I have addressed you, as I am informed you are to expect that a shade will be attempted to be cast on the testimony of that witness; on the one hand you have an important duty upon you, to take care that you do not give too much credit to the evidence of a witness coming forward; and on the other hand, it is your duty to the publick, it is your duty to a private individual, the prosecutor, to attend to his testimony. Gentlemen, you owe it to your oaths, to your consciences, and to your God, to get at the truth by the best lights that the evidence shall afford you, and to give a just and satisfactory credit on the present occasion Gentlemen, I shall conclude my address to you, with hoping, and intreating, that the God of all truth, may lead you to that which is the right and proper mode of investigation, in this important case.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I understand you are the porter at a carpet warehouse under the Piazza, Covent-Garden? - Yes; I am the foreman there; I have lived there 24 years last August: on the 27th of August, I, for the first time, saw the prisoner Platt.</p>
               <p>He was then in company with a man of the name of Templeman? - Yes; Templeman and Platt, and some other soldiers of the Coldstream regiment, procured money from me, from time to time; on the 28th of October, was the first time; I saw Roberts about half past seven in the evening, he came to my master's shop-door, he asked whether a person did not live there, of the name of Sharpe; I heard him; I was called; I was in the back part of our shop, which is long; I saw a soldier which was Roberts; I asked him what he wanted with me, he said he came from some soldier which he named, but I do not recollect it, he said, did I know none of the Coldstreamers; I did not know they went by that name then; I said no; he asked me if I knew him, or not; I told him no, I was clear I had never seen him before in my life, to my knowledge; he said very possible, but if I would step round the corner, there was a young man there, a soldier, which I should know; I answered him, that I should go amongst none of them; he said he only wanted half a crown for the soldiers, that had been with me before, for them to drink, before they marched, which would be the next morning, for they were going abroad; I told him, it was an extraordinary thing, that a man with a rational understanding should come to demand money, whom I had never seen before; I am very clear, this was the prisoner Roberts.</p>
               <p>Upon the next Tuesday, the 2d of November last, did you see the two prisoners? - Yes; it was about half past seven in the evening; I heard a person ask for me by name, which I think was Roberts; I went to the door; the two prisoners were close to the door, but Roberts was nearest; I asked them what they wanted; Roberts said the preceding night that they were going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080064"></xptr>abroad, and would never trouble me more; I told Roberts, you said I was to see them no more; they were both together: Platt says, you gave my friend two bad shillings in the three, the other night; for I gave Roberts three shillings the night before; I said, if I had, it was more than I knew, then they said, they now were absolutely going away the next morning, and would have some more money before they went; I told them it was very extraordinary, how could they think, or how could they come after me, which knew nothing about them; they both said they would go away, provided I would give them half a guinea; I told them I had not half a guinea; I had no more than two brass sixpences about me, which I had had sometime; then they said, damn your eyes, we will not leave you without you go and borrow half a guinea; and Platt swore he would be damned if he did not go into the shop, and blow me up, unless I did it; I was then within a yard or two of the door; I was the outside next the coffee-house; the shop is shut of a night, all but the door. Roberts says to Platt, do not be such a damned fool, he will give us money; for Platt laid hold of the door, as if to open it, and go in; I told them I had no money, and if I had, I would give them none, they had had enough, and too much already; Platt laid hold of the door again, says he, damn your b - y eyes, I will blow you up; he turned again to me, and said will you get this money for us or no? I said I could not; they said they would not leave me till I did, and both of them together said borrow it; with that I went to the King's head in James street, with a pretence to borrow half a guinea, they followed me; I told them I could not borrow half a guinea; but I had two guineas in my fob, and I went in reality to get change for a guinea; they said they had considered of it, and damn their eyes if they would leave me without a guinea, for they were going on board of ship the next day, they would not go, damn their eyes if they would, without money; I being so much terrified, by their abusing, and accusing me in the manner they did; I was afraid of my character, which is my bread.</p>
               <p>What apprehensions had you, when they said they would blow you up? - The apprehension that I had, was, that they would accuse me of some unnatural crime, and that it would deprive me of my character, and my bread; then I agreed to go back to the King's-head, to borrow a guinea, and I took a guinea out of my fob, and came to them, and I said, mind this is the demand you make, this is betwixt you two; Roberts directly puts the guinea into his pocket, and squared his elbows in a boxing posture, now says he, damn my eyes if I part with a penny of this; Platt said he was a villain, why was he not to have half, and then Platt swore, why was he not to have one too, as there is none of this for me; I argued with them, how they could think of going on so, with that, Platt said damn his eyes if he would go without half a guinea; I told him where could I borrow more; but I agreed to go to borrow half a guinea, and I got half a guinea, and half a guinea's worth of silver; the agreement was to give me a receipt for a guinea and a half, I said, I would not give it them without they gave me a receipt or discharge, as others had done, referring to a paper, which had been given me, by Templeman, who was another soldier, who in company with Platt, had obtained other monies, that they had agreed to, this is the discharge from Templeman, to which I alluded, (Read)</p>

They made no enquiry what discharge I meant, upon that I advanced the 10 s. 6 d. and desired them to come to some house to sign the receipt; then they refused to do it, adding that as they were to march tomorrow morning, they had no occasion for it, I should never see them any more; Roberts says, damn your eyes, give me your handkerchief, I want it for my bundle; I did not; then they wished me a good night,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080065"></xptr>Roberts said he hoped I should meet with no worse villains than they had been; I said it was needless; I did not see them till Templeman and Platt were taken on a Thursday with Smith, and on the Friday evening, the prisoner Roberts came to my master's shop in company with another man of the Coldstream regiment; I went to the door, and asked him what he wanted with me; he said he had a receipt on a stamp, for the money that he had three nights before; I told him to give it me, he said he would be damned if he did; I told him he should go with me; I took hold of his arm, and he went pretty quiet a few yards; then, says he, Platt is gone on board of ship; yes, says I, I know he is; I called Mr. Simms to my assistance, he was at his stall, and we took him to Bow-street, there he said he never saw me before; he denied that he had said any thing about a receipt, or had been at my master's shop at all, but was coming promiscuously along the Piazzi, and that I came out and seized him.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you, and attend to the question, and answer it deliberately, did you know any thing at all of Platt, till that 17th of August, when you saw him first in company with Templeman? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Not the least in the world? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of Roberts, till you saw him in the company of Platt, when he came to your master's shop, on the 28th of October? - No.</p>
               <p>Had any thing indecent or improper, ever passed between you and Templeman, or Platt, or Smith, or Roberts? - Never; so help me God, as I stand here on my oath.</p>
               <p>Had there with any person whatever, any of the soldiers of the guards, or any person whatever? - No Sir; there had not.</p>
               <p>With no human being, any thing of the sort had ever passed? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner Roberts's Counsel. You have been servant to this carpet ware-house, 24 years? - Yes; I have been foreman about 16 years.</p>
               <p>Of course, you are greatly in the confidence of your master who employs you? - I do not know in regard to that; I will explain it, the former part of my time, Mr. Barnet was my master, he died and left a family.</p>
               <p>Who is the master of the carpet warehouse now? - Mr. Drury; he commenced last August was 12 months.</p>
               <p>Then during that time, you of course saw him almost every day, I suppose? - No; not every day, because he has another shop.</p>
               <p>Templeman you had seen about two months before last Christmas? - Yes Sir.</p>
               <p>From that time you did not see him, till the May following? - I did not see him; I had been measuring a room in Pall-Mall, the music was playing in the court yard, a person in soldier's cloaths acosted me; I said you have the advantage of me; on the 17th of August, I saw him again, then Platt was with him.</p>
               <p>I believe the account you gave on that occasion was, that being charged in the streets by these two men, you did not know but the people might rise upon you?</p>
               <p>On the 20th of August, on the 23d of August, on the 18th of September, on the 20th of September, you was applied to, on the same sort of business, and on the 21st of October, another application? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before you had seen any thing of Roberts, there were no less than eight applications made to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, upon none of those applications, had you ever taken any steps to bring the persons applying to you, to justice? - I had not, not till after.</p>
               <p>When did you first mention this to Mr. Simms, your friend? - On the 21st of September.</p>
               <p>That was after six applications had been made to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe in consequence of that, you went with your friend Simms to the Northumberland Arms, in Great Russel-street? - Yes; I very seldom use a publick house, but I am perfectly known at the King's Head in James-street.</p>
               <p>Then, even on the 22d of September, when your friend Simms was with you, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080066"></xptr>you had the assistance of every person in the house, no complaint was made to any person? - Not to any third person, it was the tender feelings that I had, because I would not take the life of a fellow creature, if I could help it but I told them if they did not desist, I would put the law in execution, the first was my character, and the next was that.</p>
               <p>Were there any other publick houses, at which you were in company with the persons that made these applications to you? - I desired them repeatedly, to go to a publick house, and call for a pot of beer, and I would pay for it; I waited for Simms coming; and they did go to the publick house; I never was at any publick house with them, only at the Northumberland Arms, and at the White Horse, a small publick house; I was at the door, and called for a pot of beer, and paid for it.</p>
               <p>Then you never was at the Queen's Head, Tavistock Row? - Not till after that; I was after that, at the Queen's Head with Platt.</p>
               <p>There your friend Simms was with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There another application was made to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On that occasion, Simms being-with you and the landlord, and the persons in the publick house, the application being made to you, you made no application to any person? - I did not.</p>
               <p>On the 28th of October, Roberts came to your shop about half past seven? - Yes; as near as I can remember; he knocked at the door; I came out to him; we conversed together about five minutes, as I suppose.</p>
               <p>Have you been often to see the Guard relieved in the Park? - Me! no, not without it was in my business, not once in half a year; I have heard of the Coldstream Regiment, but never took any notice of the name; I know there are three Regiments, first, second, and third; I had not heard of the Coldstream Regiment by name, to my knowledge, to take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Did nothing particular happen, at the time that Roberts came to ask you for some money? - Yes; there were some turnips thrown from behind the Piazzas, and I saw several soldiers heads peeping backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Did not this create some little disturbance? - None at all, the people were not passing thick; there was half a dozen I suppose, not all at once.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that attracted the attention of nobody at that time? - It did not; I do say it upon my oath, it did not.</p>
               <p>Did none of your fellow servants come out at this time? - No; we were just at the side of the door.</p>
               <p>Was it always your practice to stand at the side of the door, when any body called? - Not always.</p>
               <p>Was it so when these soldiers called? - Then I mostly walked from the door; the whole transaction of the 2d of November did not take up above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that at the time of the half play under the Piazzas, that no person whatever interfered, or came up to you? - Nobody interfered with us; an old woman came past and stopped, they bid her go along.</p>
               <p>How many people might pass you? - I cannot tell; a good many.</p>
               <p>Then you made no complaint, nor offered to stop them, nor told any body what was passing? - I did not.</p>
               <p>At the King's Head you was perfectly known? - I was.</p>
               <p>You went twice there without calling for any thing? - Yes; just to the left of the door; I stood at the bar and asked the mistress's sister, she said she had it not, and I directly came out.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Simms? - Six or seven years; I have frequently bought things of him.</p>
               <p>On the Monday, when Roberts called on you, you did not expect him? - No; because there was a warrant out against him at that time.</p>
               <p>You have never walked in the Park of an evening? - Never particularly; I have gone through the Park.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080067"></xptr>Not of an evening, that you swear positively? - I swear positively I have not; I never go out of an evening.</p>
               <p>And you have never made any attack on any body in the Park of an indecent nature? - No, Sir, that I have not.</p>
               <p>You have never received a blow for any such attack? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Whilst you was in the Piazza, you, who was alarmed left a mob should rise upon you, did not proclaim that the men were charging you with an unnatural crime? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Nobody took notice of you but an old woman? - No.</p>
               <p>You mentioned it to your friend Mr. Simms, and took his advice about it? - I did.</p>
               <p>At first you said you was reluctant to take the life of your fellow creatures? - I was worn out with their manner.</p>
               <p>You say positively, on the oath you have taken, that if any soldier in the guards should be hardy enough to say that you have made any attack upon him, of an indecent nature, and that he had knocked you down, he is guilty of perjury? - He is Sir.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Platt. Did not the prosecutor treat me with a pot of beer, once at the Horse Guards, by the Pay Office, and give me the change out of a shilling on my offering it to him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Whether he did not behave in a very indecent manner to me at that time? - I did not see him at all at the place he describes.</p>
               <p>Were you guilty of any indecency to him at the time? - Upon my oath, the sacred oath, as I stand here before you, I was not.</p>
               <p>Did not I knock you down in the Green Park for indecency? - It is as false as God is true. I can say no more.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a green grocer's shop in Covent Garden; I have known Sharpe about fourteen years, he had told me of some applications for money; I saw the paper signed by Templeman and Smith. I took Templeman myself, a warrant was granted against Roberts, and on Friday night, the 5th of November, I was drinking a cup of tea with my wife in my stall, and Sharpe came and said, this is the man that we have been looking for; Roberts was with him, I took hold of him directly, and carried him to Bow-street, he was examined there; he declared to me before, and then at his examination, that he knew nothing of the man at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Whereabouts is your stall? - In Covent Garden, the first stand from James-street as you come down.</p>
               <p>Where were you on the Thursday? - On the Thursday I took Templeman; on the Tuesday I came down James-street, and saw the two prisoners talking together, attempting to make water; I looked in Platt's face, as I had seen him before, they had two caps on I am sure; I was at my stand in Covent Garden on the Tuesday evening, I suppose that is about twenty-five yards from the hatter's shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you quite sure you saw the two prisoners in company together? - I am positive of it, I saw Sharpe talking to them, and his hat off; that was on the 2d of November.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Had not you the curiosity to stop and listen to the conversation? - No, I had not, I was at my stand when I saw them talking.</p>
               <p>Now, had not Sharpe applied to you before, on their application for money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Knowing that, and seeing two soldiers with him, had not you the curiosity to go up and know something about it? - No, Sir, I thought he would alarm me; business, or something took my time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Platt. Had you any connection with a house in Eagle-court? - I know no house in Eagle-court; I know a house in Eagle-street, the Horse and Groom, I lodged there, I travelled with a Mr. Rooksby that lived at the next door, where the wax-work is in Fleet-street; I had a wife there and two children, the man's name is Young, my wife and I were there at the time, and when I came from the fair and different things, I commonly came to her,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080068"></xptr>as usually a man comes to a woman, and Mr. Young used to ask me to draw some beer; I took the authority in the house; if any of these men can come forward; it is about nine years ago.</p>
               <p>Whether he never laid with this Young, the same as a man and his wife? - Never, on my oath; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Never with a soldier in the guards, named Tillotson, who was a drummer, who is now in the New Prison for an assault? - I never was guilty of any thing of that kind in my life, and never with such a man.</p>
               <p>This house was broke, its licence was taken away for the same thing, nobody but those sort of people use the house? - Gentlemen I deny the whole.</p>
               <p>Was not there a drummer quartered in the house of the name of Tillotson? - Never in the world to my knowledge; I was away five months at a time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I called you, that your character might be enquired into; are you married or single? - A married man; this is my third wife.</p>
               <p>Have you any children? - I have none by this, I have two in Dorsetshire, a boy and girl.</p>
               <p>Had you any children by your second wife? - She died in child-bed of twins.</p>
               <p>At the time you lodged at this house in Eagle-street, you lodged there as a married man with your wife? - I did.</p>

               <p>When you came to London, did you cohabit with her as men and their wives usually do? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you, as it has been put to you, by the prisoner, having a wife in the house, sleep with a male bedfellow? - I slept with nobody but my wife.</p>
               <p>Have you, ever before this prosecution, been accused of unnatural and improper propensities? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been guilty of such? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I submit I shall be entitled to call witnesses to the character of Mr. Sharpe; I give my friend warning I have such witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. My Lord, I am told I have a witness that is very material, and I should desert my duty very much if I did not call him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Platt. I have a person here to give me a character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Roberts. The witness I have to call, his name is Williams; he came on his own accord.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you a private? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What regiment? - The second, the Coldstream Regiment of Guards.</p>
               <p>Do you know any person round you? - I know Mr. Sharpe perfectly well, the gentleman here.</p>
               <p>Go to him and touch him? - This is the gentleman (touches him); I was on the centry, in the Green Park, I do not know positively the day, it was some time before the riot happened that we were drafted to go into the Tower, to go abroad on foreign service; it could not be in the summer, Mr. Sharpe came to me in the night, between the hours of ten and weive, when I was on the centry; I had never seen him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did he do or say any thing? - Yes, Sir, he did, he offered some very unnatural crimes.</p>
               <p>Tell us what he did? - He asked me whether I had been done lately; I asked him what he meant; he said he supposed I perfectly understood what he meant; he wanted to know whether any man had any thing to do with me lately; I told him he ought to be kept and taken up, and made an example or; I told him it was a thing I detested, that I was a maried man, and did not give my mind to any thing of that sort; after he found that I would not submit to any of these unnatural crimes, he immediately departed from me, and went away.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any thing more of him after that? - I mounted the Tilt-yard Guard at the Gun; he came to me about half after nine; that was the 5th day at night, after the first attack; I am sure it was the same man, I called him by his name as he came to me; I told him I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080069"></xptr>have him taken up, and he immediately left me.</p>
               <p>How came you to call him by his name? - I was going some time after the first attack to my quarters in Covent Garden, I saw him stand looking in at a window, and I enquired of a person what was the gentleman's name, and they told me his name was Sharpe; I mentioned to them that he offered very unnatural crimes to me, and ought to be taken up.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the person that you told of it? - I do not know who it was: he told me he lived in the neighbourhood; but he did not tell me in what capacity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you ever see him again, after this business of the Tilt-yard? - Never, till this time I saw him in the courtyard.</p>
               <p>From the opportunity you had of seeing him, are you sure he is the man that accosted you in the Green Park, and at the Tilt-yard? - Yes, Sir, I am perfectly convinced he is the same.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure he is the same? - I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When did you see him in the court-yard? - About twelve, when I came here to-day, I saw him on the steps.</p>
               <p>What brought you here? - I was ordered here, subpoena'd.</p>
               <p>So you came here in consequence of your subpoena, about twelve to-day; when did you receive your subpoena? - I saw it about half after eleven to-day.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, this filthy subject, you had not talked of it to any body? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>No; I take it for granted, except to the person whom you saw under the Piazzas, you have not mentioned it to any body? - No, Sir, I have not.</p>
               <p>You can be quite sure, that except to that stranger under the Piazza, you have never mentioned it to any body; recollect, I do not wish to hurry you? - No, not to my knowledge, I never mentioned it to no creature; but since I came to court I saw the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Let me see, if I understand you right, except to the stranger in the Piazza, you never mentioned this indecency to any person till you came here to-day; what did they tell you, you was subpoena'd for on the trial of Roberts? - Sir!</p>
               <p>Do not I speak loud enough, soldier? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Answer me then, and do not say, Sir! concerning this matter? - What matter.</p>
               <p>Who subpoena'd you? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it the stranger that spoke to you under the Piazza? - No, a serjeant that came to me.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, Sir, if you never mentioned it to any body, but to the stranger under the Piazza, till you came here today, how came they to know that you could give any evidence here about Mr. Sharpe, when they subpoena'd you? come, that is a point blank shot you was not prepared for, soldier? - I do not know that ever I mentioned it to any person except my serjeant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Short-hand-writer, take care, and do your duty; I know you do it always; but I wish this man should know you do it.</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes, Sir, I mentioned it to a serjeant that is here now, serjeant Folden.</p>
               <p>When did you mention it to serjeant Folden? - I believe I mentioned it to him after I came off the centry, at the Gun in the Tilt-yard.</p>
               <p>What did you tell him? - I told him that I had such a person come to me.</p>
               <p>Who did you tell him came to you? - I told him Mr. Sharpe came to me.</p>
               <p>Now will you venture to swear you did this; look to the Jury Sir, come, will you venture to swear, that when you left your guard on the Tilt-yard, that you told serjeant Folden, that Mr. Sharp had made this attack on you? - I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you ever in your life, till to-day, mention it to serjeant Folden? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>When did you? - I am not positive when.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - When I came off centry, the time I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080070"></xptr>Come, you must answer? - Yes, Sir, I think I did, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you did; come, come; look to the Jury, I see it has an effect upon you? - I have mentioned it to him, but I do not positively know when.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath have you ever mentioned it before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long before? - I cannot positively tell.</p>
               <p>Where have you mentioned it? - In different places.</p>
               <p>In different places; were there many people present? - I do not recollect any body that was present.</p>
               <p>Why you made no secret of it, did you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you mention it more than once to serjeant Folden? - I cannot say whether I did, I believe it was in the guard-room.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I did mention it in the guard-room, to all the guard that was present.</p>
               <p>To all the guard that was present! when all the guard was present in the guard-room? I mentioned it to serjeant Folden in the guard-room, whilst all the guard was present; but not as the guard heard me.</p>
               <p>What did you mention it in a whisper? - I called him aside, and told of this in the Tilt-yard guard-room; there is no other guard-room.</p>
               <p>Was it when you was relieved after Mr. Sharpe had been there? - Certainly, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was this attack after the rumour of your being drafted for foreign service had blown over? - No, Sir, it was before that.</p>
               <p>How long before Mr. Roberts, your friend, was taken into custody? - Some time.</p>
               <p>A long while? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the serjeant where Mr. Sharpe lived, and what trade he followed? - No, Sir, I did not know.</p>
               <p>How came they to think of bringing you here? - I do not know, I mentioned it to the serjeant.</p>
               <p>Pray, has these sort of things happened to you often? - No, Sir, never before this time nor since.</p>
               <p>Therefore you did not understand what he was saying, when he asked you if you have been done lately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are a married man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have been a soldier three years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have mounted guard with a good many different men, I fancy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you did not guess at the expression? - No; I told him he ought to know better, and he ought to be taken up and made an example of; so he went off.</p>
               <p>It was between ten and twelve; was it nearer ten or twelve? - I cannot be positive whether the clock had gone eleven.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - I am not positive of the night.</p>
               <p>Was it, or was it not, a dark or a light night? - I know when I was last on guard in the Green Park, it was a dark night.</p>
               <p>What part of the Park was you in? - It was the Green Park; there was a lamp at the house next to the box, about ten or twelve yards off.</p>
               <p>The man was nine or ten minutes talking with you; why you had quite a coaze with him, quite an agreeable conversation with him? - It was not very agreeable.</p>
               <p>How long was it afterwards when you saw him looking into the print-shop? - It was a day or two.</p>
               <p>What did you say to the stranger? - He was looking in there; I asked him if he knew him, he said his name was Sharpe; I said, I believed he was a very bad man, and a man that did not like a woman, and a man that ought to be taken care of.</p>
               <p>You did not explain to him why you thought so? - No.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true, if any body had said so, that he made a very unnatural attack on you in the Park? - Why I told him he had offered some very unnatural practices to me in the Park.</p>
               <p>What said the stranger to this? - He did not say any thing, he laughed and went away.</p>
               <p>He did not tell you where he lived? - No, Sir, he did not tell me positively where he lived, he told me Sir, he lived in the neighbourhood, but he could not tell me where.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080071"></xptr>Did you press him to tell you where he lived? - No, I did not; when I asked him where he lived, he said nothing, but went away; he told me before that, that he lived in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>So then, you who had kept this so snug, that you did not mention it to any of your comrades, mentioned it to a stranger in Covent-garden? - I did.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go with the stranger and take him to Bow-street? - If I had done as I ought to have done, I should.</p>
               <p>You are a soldier in the Coldstream regiment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have the honour to have his Royal Highness the Duke of York for your commanding officer? - I have.</p>
               <p>Do not you know instances in your own knowledge of his Royal Highness encouraging soldiers who have detected unnatural practices in the Park? - He has.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Sharpe run away from you? - He went off as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>How near was you to another sentry? - Why, a hundred yards and better.</p>
               <p>How far from another sentry when you was in the Tilt-yard guard? - From one sentry I do not suppose it was above forty yards.</p>
               <p>Then why not call out to the other sentry to take this fellow? - He did not go that way.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I called him by his name, Sir; he came up to me, as I called him by his name: when he began to offer this unnatural crime, I told him he ought to be secured, and I would secure him, if he offered any thing of the kind to me; and he made off as fast as he could; it was dark.</p>
               <p>What did he say then in the Tilt-yard guard; what was the first thing he said? - He came up to me, when I was on sentry, and talked to me; and he asked me whether my breeches were lined.</p>
               <p>What answer did you give him? - I called him by his name, and told him that I knew what he was very well, at least by his behaviour, that he was a very bad man, and to get away, or else I would secure him.</p>
               <p>Was that all that passed? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Recollect. - I called him by his name, and told him he was a very bad man, and a man that ought to be taken care of, and if he did not go away I would secure him.</p>
               <p>When did you tell that to any body? - I mentioned that to Serjeant Folden.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I am not positive.</p>
               <p>When your guard is relieved, do not you report to those who succeed you what has happened on your guard? - No, unless it is something that concerns our duty.</p>
               <p>Then if a man should come to your sentry-box, and should offer any unnatural attempt to your person, that is no part of your duty? - I did not take him, because I could not leave my post.</p>
               <p>How long is this last time ago? - It was some time before we went into the Tower.</p>
               <p>When did you go to any magistrate to make a complaint that Mr. Sharpe, who lived in Covent-garden, was an unnatural man, and had been offering unnatural practices to you? - I did not go.</p>
               <p>Did you knock him down for this? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you never said you did? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Then you never said to any body, that Mr. Sharpe, the prosecutor, had made an unnatural attempt upon you, and that you had knocked him down? - I did not say so to nobody, never in my life, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>That will not do for me; I ask you, and I warn you that I am able to prove the contrary. - I did not say so.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Yes, I do swear positively, that I did not say so, never in my life, to any body.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Sharpe. You have heard all that this man has said; upon the solemn oath that you have taken, and as you will answer it to your God, recollecting that the lives of these two men are at stake, is the account that man has given us true? - As I will answer it at the great and dreadful day of judgment! every word a lie! every word, as I may never stir from this place any more; how villainous it is! I stood patient to hear such villainy!</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080072"></xptr>Is it true, that at any part of your life, you had any conversation with that man in the Green Park? - No, never, Sir.</p>
               <p>Is it true, that in any part of your life, you ever spoke to him on the tilt guard? - Never.</p>
               <p>In one word, is there a syllable of truth in any thing he has said? - Not a syllable, as I hope for salvation; I can say no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If Serjeant Folden is here, I will make him my witness; for in this case, whatever may come of the prosecutor, the whole story shall come out.</p>
               <p>SERJEANT FOLDEN sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know the private of the name of Williams, that you brought here by subpoena? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was the person that caused that subpoena to be served? - He was subpoened, and I was sent with it while he was on duty; I was sent from the regiment, from the orderly room, as a part of my regimental duty.</p>
               <p>Had you any share in the procuring him to be subpoened? - No, Sir, I had no share.</p>
               <p>Had you directed him to be subpoened? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you given any account of what he knew on this subject? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you any knowledge that he was possessed with any circumstance that had any thing to do with this trial? - No, Sir, I was not, indeed.</p>

             the subpoena was brought, had you any reason to suspect that he knew any thing that related to this prosecution? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard from him any account, that he had any knowledge of any transaction that could have the least relation to this subject? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you before this day, any conversation with him relating to this subject? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you before this day ever hear him mention a person of the name of Sharpe? - No, Sir, never before this day.</p>
               <p>Until this day, you never heard from him the name of Sharpe? - No, Sir, I have not.</p>
               <p>Is Williams a private of your guard? - No, Sir, I am not on guard; but I have been on guard with him at St. James's.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his being on the Tilt-yard guard, while you had occasion to be at the Tilt-yard room? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did he ever in the guard-room relate to you any circumstance that had happened to him either on the Tilt-yard guard, or the Green Park? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Had he never told you that a man of the name of Sharpe had asked him some indecent questions? - Not till to day.</p>
               <p>Are you very positive of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you very sure that he never told you that man was a man of unnatural passions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know much of this man, Williams? - Yes, ever since he has been in the regiment; I cannot say rightly; I have known him four or five years.</p>
               <p>Since Roberts particularly has been in custody, have you seen Williams from time to time? - More when he came to his duty.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any private conversation with him apart from the guard-room in your life? - No, Sir, not about any such thing.</p>
               <p>If he had told you that a man had asked him questions of an unnatural tendency; if he had told you so at any particular time, should you remember it? - Yes, I should.</p>
               <p>Are you quite positively sure that he never did? - Yes, I am; he never mentioned any such thing happening to him, to me, never in his life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, my lord, I propose to call witnesses for the prosecutor's character.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you are intitled to do it; but the case does not call for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It certainly does not; but for the sake of this man in future life, I ought to do it.</p>

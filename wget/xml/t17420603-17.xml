            . My Lord, I went and saw the Prisoner's Wife the same Day her Husband had used her in the manner he did, and she said, that the Blows she received from her Husband would be her Death, she had nothing to nourish her, and I believe she would not have liv'd so long as she did if I had not sent her some Provisions, for there was nothing but a Bottle of Water and a Bit of Bread upon the Table.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had not my Wife Fits at your House?</p>
               <p>Smith. She never had Fits at our House but once.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she bleed after these Fits?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner My Lord she has been in Fits, and have not been able to speak in three Hours.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you apprehend her Illness arose from Fits?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, my Lord, she came to my House, and sat down by the Fire Side, and happened to fall in a Fit, and it held her 3 or 4 Hours, but not Speechless, and this was about 3 Weeks before he came out of Newgate. - After his Wife was dead he came to our House and called at the Window, and my Wife called out to him and said, God bless you, get away, or you'll go to Newgate To-morrow, and he went away, and never was seen in the Parish from that Day to this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I ask to lay in your House till the Morning?</p>
               <p>Smith. He did not, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire Mrs. Robertson may be asked that.</p>
               <p>E. Robertson. When his Wife was dead we laid her out, and took the Child Home to the Prisoner's Brother-in-Law.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he ask to lay there?</p>

               <p>Prisoner My Lord, my Brother-in-law took away all my Goods.</p>
               <p>Smith. My Lord, I have a Receipt for all the Goods I have, and he owes me above 7 l. besides.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you any Witnesses to call?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Wife was very much troubled with Fits, and she told me that they would be her Death, and my Lord, I had 3 Children that died in Fits before, and after my Wife was dead I went to my Brother-in-law's, and said, as they had got all my Goods, I hoped they would bury my Wife, and they said, they would take Care to bury her. <rs id="t17420603-17-verdict69" type="verdictDescription">

On the evening of 4th inst., I went to the Elephant public house—I saw the prisoner there—he had a horse with him—I asked whether it was his horse—he said, no, it was his governor's—I asked who his governor was, and he said, Mr. Gibson, greengrocer, High-street, Hackney—I asked him what he wanted to sell it for—he said, because it was getting old, and he would put another in its place—I asked what he wanted for it, and he said 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said it was to be killed—I said I should not like to give 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, it was not worth that, I should not like to give more than 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he agreed to take that—I had only 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, but I said I would give him the other 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I got home—he gave me the papers I now produce—he wrote one piece of paper—I said "That will not do; I am not satisfied with it; you had better write another," "George Gutteridge bought a horse of Thomas Hands"—then he wrote "J.

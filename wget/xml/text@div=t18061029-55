             sworn. On the 30th of September, about half after six, a gentleman came in the shop and informed us that a person passing by took something from a horse at the door; I missed a pelisse from the horse, I pursued the prisoner, and in Rider's court, Cranbourn-street, I saw the prisoner drop the pelisse from her hands.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it is this woman. - A. Yes, I took up the pelisse; it is my master's property.</p>
               <p>(The pelisse produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was going through the court he asked me if I would go back with him, and when I came back he accused me of the pelisse, there were several women going through the court at the same time as I did.</p>
               <p>Court. He charges you with dropping it.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Watson) Was she standing separate from other people. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was standing by the image shop when he catched hold of me, it is a false oath that he has taken.</p>

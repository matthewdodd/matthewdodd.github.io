               <p>I am a lodger at Mr. Woodfall's, the printer, he is my landlord; the prisoner lodged over my head; I am in the one pair, and he in the two; my apartments are not separated from the house: the landlord does not live in the same house; there was only the prisoner and me lodged in the house; there is one street door, and each of us keys; the prisoner asked me and my wife to go over to the publick house, and drink some beer; and he went and left me about half past eight; he left me for a quarter of an hour; I had no suspicion of him; and my wife went home; when I came home, I found him and her together; I knew of no misdemeanor; I left my wife in the house, when I went to the public house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. How long had you lodged in the same house with the prisoner: I had lived there nine years and he seven.</p>
               <p>Till this time you had no suspicion of him? - No, I had been out with my chips; I had been at no public house before, we had two pots of half and half, a pennyworth of beer and a Welch rabbit; we were not in great intimacy, only good night and good morning; I never went up to his room; he had not been in my room for six weeks, then he came for water; I always lock my door when I go out; the street door has not been locked this half year.</p>

                  </hi>. I was Mr. Stokes's errand-boy for two or three months—I first saw the prisoner last Easter Monday—he lodged at Mr. Waldrom's house, close by—on Easter Monday I was going, after I had done work, towards the Green Man in the Kent-road—I saw the prisoner and Waldrom and his son—the prisoner asked me to go with him down the road—I said, "Yes"—we were going down the road, and the prisoner called me in front, and said I could <hi rend="italic">do</hi> some boots there—I asked what he meant—he said I could steal them from my master—I said I would not—he said I could—we walked on—Mr. Waldrom came up, and we said nothing more about it that night—I saw him afterwards at various times, and he pressed me to give him things—he said I should, and at last, at the latter end of the Easter week, I brought him out a pair of boots—I gave them to the prisoner in Waldrom's house—he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I did not hear what he had done with then—I do not think the pair now produced are the same—those I took were open in front—I could not swear I did not take these.</p>

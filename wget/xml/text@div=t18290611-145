            . I was in the street on the 22d of May, at ten o'clock at night; I met Luxton, we went to a public-house, and had something to drink - I then went to the house where she lived, and had some supper; I undressed, and went to bed - I had four sovereigns and 18s. in silver in my trousers pocket, and a watch, chain, seal, and key; I rolled up my trousers in the braces, and put them under my pillow; Luxton saw me do that - I fell asleep before she came to bed; when I awoke in the morning the house was empty - I found my trousers behind the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110061"></xptr>door; the watch and money were gone - I gave information, but have never seen them; I was quite sober, but I fell asleep in about a quarter of an hour - I do not think she came to bed at all.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PRENDERGRASS. I am an officer. I took the two prisoners in the New-cut, at Lambeth on the 26th of May, about half-past four o'clock - I found none of the property.</p>
               <p>LUXTON'S Defence. I did not take his trousers - he pulled them out, and gave me his watch to keep till the morning; he saw me go out of the room.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PRENDERGRASS. They said they had sold the watch to a Jew in Petticoat-lane for 35s., and the money they had laid out in clothes - they had new shawls, new bonnets, and new gowns on; I found nothing belonging to the prosecutor - it was done in a very low house in Glass-house-yard, Rosemary-lane.</p>

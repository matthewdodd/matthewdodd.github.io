She depos'd farther, that the Prisoner pull'd out his Knife, and swore he would be her Butcher if she did not yield, or if ever she told her Mother any thing of it. The Prisoner in his Defence said, He was at his Father's that Evening, from 5 a Clock till 12, about remarkable business and brought several to prove it ; who agreed in their Evidence.

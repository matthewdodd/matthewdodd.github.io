                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live at 1, Old Gravel-lane—I was in Gravel-lane on the Thursday before Good Friday between one and three o'clock—as I was going home I met the prisoner, and went home with her, and was in her company some part of Friday—after that I met her now and then as I came out of the boarding-house, and on Good Friday night I went home with her—we had no drink in the house—I had been drinking through the day—I was sitting there talking—I began joking with another woman—there was a row out in the yard—I went to look out of window, and the first thing I noticed was that I got the sugar-basin right in my eye—the prisoner was standing close to me—I had given her no provocation—we had no quarrel—she was not sober—I was sober enough to know how to behave myself—I can't account for her striking me—I have lost the sight of my eye, my eyelid is disfigured, and my constitution injured—I have never been well since.</p>

I told him I was a dealer, that dealt with one Locklan; he asked me who else I knew in the business? I told him four or five names which satisfied him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he provide you with these yards of whites? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they? what did he give you? - He gave me two and thirty six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110111"></xptr>pences for eight shillings, and half a crown in silver, I put them in my pocket, I did not look at them till I got to the office.</p>

            Then you went on the 30th of September.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I object to going into evidence on different days.</p>
               <p>Court. You may go on what day you please.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullon. Then we will go on the 30th. - On the 30th of September I went with six officers, I think it was rather turned of seven o'clock; I had two half crowns in my pocket then to purchase with; Mr. Armstrong asked me if they were marked; I told him one was, and the took the other and marked it himself; when I came to the house I asked him if he could do any thing for me? he said he could, he went into the parlour and brought me out this money, which I gave him five shillings for, ten shillings for two half crowns.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have kept them ever since? - I have; the officers then were waiting, and I came out to them, and told them he was in the bar without his coat and hat, and had a striped waistcoat on; they went in and took him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What are you? - A bricklayer.</p>
               <p>Q. What else? - An extraordinary officer belonging to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You was sent by the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was to pay you for going there? - I never was given to understand who would pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you expect to be paid? - I did, certainly.</p>

            Until you mentioned to Spencer what you came for, he did not mention a word about this business? - Spencer did not come to me, I went to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you tempred him to put off this bad money, and now you come to give evidence against him? - I am doing my duty.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there was no half crown found or any thing? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Jury. How many do you call a yard? - I understand that it was a shilling a yard, that ten yards was ten shillings worth.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HARPER sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a public officer at Worship-street? - I am. On the 30th of September last, the witness was at our office, and we were ordered by our magistrate (I and the rest of the officers) to go to the prisoner's house, at Field-lane, the Swan, we went, and when we came near Field-lane, we told him to go in and do the business, and we would call at a house in Fleet-market; we stopped there about a quarter of an hour, and the came back, and said, I have bought, now is the time; and we went there and took the prisoner; I was one of the men that took him from the house; and left the other in the house; I searched him, and found nothing but a few halfpence.</p>

            Pray what kind of people did you see about that house? - I did not mind hardly any person in the house, for directly as the prisoner was pointed out, I and another officer took him out of the house immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then this man were sent by you? - No, not by me.</p>
               <p>Q. They were sent there by somebody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to endeavour to make the prisoner put off bad money, and you were watching in order to take him? - We was at the public house, waiting his return.</p>
               <p>Q. So it was a trap laid for him to put off this money? - I know not that.</p>
               <p>Q. He was searched and nothing found on him; there was no bad money found on him? - Nothing but a few halfpence.</p>

               <p>Court. That is not a proper question as against this man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do? - I only know that I took the prisoner along with the other officer.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you are a pretty good judge of this commodity that is sold by these fellows. Look at that, see if that is good or bad money? - I believe that to be all bad.</p>

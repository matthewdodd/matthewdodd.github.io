                  </hi>. I keep a coffee and pie-shop in Ratcliff-highway. On the 5th of Jan. I saw the prisoner at my house, he was a perfect stranger—my wife had seen him one or two days before—in consequence of what she told me, I agreed with the prisoner to board and lodge him for 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and told him we wished for security—he said he would give us security, and pro<lb></lb>duced this bill—he said nothing about the bill—he also produced a letter, which he laid on the table, and said he supposed that would be of no ac<lb></lb>count to me, as it was written in a foreign language—I believed the bill to be genuine—he continued to board and lodge at my house from that day till the 20th of Jan., when it purports to be due—(the bill was dated, "Hambro', 20th Dec, 1842, for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable at W. Scott and Son's, St. James's-place")—on the 20th of January, at breakfast-time, I said to him, "At what time to-day will it be most convenient for me to go with you and cash this bill?"—he said, I should oblige him very much, if I would allow the account to stand over till the following Monday, and he would then draw his own money himself—I said, "Very well;" but in the course of the morning a young woman called on me, and stated something which he did not hear—at dinner-time I repeated ray ap<lb></lb>plication to him, to go and get the bill cashed—he said nothing then—after dinner, the young woman and her mother came to the house, and said, in his presence, that she believed him to be no better than a man who had passed a similar kind of bill on her—I do not know what he said to that—I said I thought she was deceived, I had no doubt he would put on his hat, go with me, and get the bill cashed, and prove his character good—he made no answer to that—I repeated it again, he still made no answer—at last I put my hat on, went to the door, and said, "Now I am ready, will you come with me?"—he then said he wished to speak to me—we went into the parlour, and all at once he said the bill was not a correct one, but be ex<lb></lb>pected to get a situation on the Monday following, and he would pay me, or endeavour to pay me, if I would wait till then—I said that would not do,</p>

               <p>that I felt much hurt at his conduct, and roast give him into custody—I sent for an officer, who took him—I have since seen a letter in Collins's hand, I believe it to be the same the prisoner produced to me—it is dated "Brighton," as the place written from—the post-mark also appears to be meant for Brighton—I do not observe any foreign post-mark on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The bill is a <hi rend="italic">flash</hi> one, not a forgery; Rose is well aware of the person who wrote the bill, and he did not give him into custody; he was at his bouse the next day; it is drawn on a house which does not exist in Lon<lb></lb>don, and from a house which does not exist in Hamburgh; it cannot be called a forged bill; I was compelled to do it from the utmost necessity; I had no home to go to; I had no intention to deceive Mr. Rose. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I was not aware that the writer of the bill was at my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner—I asked him what objection he had to go to get the bill cashed—he said it was no use to go, it was a bad bill—I said was he not aware of that before he produced it—he said he was, and the utmost necessity compelled him to do so, it was given him by a friend—I went to St. James's-place, St. James's-street, and inquired for W. Scott &amp; Son, where it is made payable—I could find no such persons—I do not know any other St. James's-place in London.</p>

               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - Quite sober; between three and four years ago, the prisoner had been a neighbour of mine; she sold fruit then; and she asked me into her room; I went in; and she gave me a shove immediately, and took my watch out of my pocket, and set off immediately; I followed after her, and could not see her; I got an officer to seek after her; she left her lodgings immediately; and we found her last Wednesday was a week, in the narrow part of Holborn, between nine and ten at night; I never found my watch; I had no acquaintance with her since she left our neighbourhood; my business in Star Court was not with her; nothing else passed between us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ask me for a dram? - No.</p>
               <p>When you went in with her, you did not know or suspect that she wanted any thing with you that was improper? - No, upon my oath.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner the 9th of September in the narrow part of Holborn; the prosecutor was with me; he told me the prisoner was the person who robbed him; I took her into custody; I searched her at her lodgings, and found nothing at all upon her, not the least in the world; there were some duplicates, but nothing relating to the watch.</p>

               <p>He came to my room, and asked if I would have a dram; after the dram came he had not money to pay for it; I left him in the court; he was very much in liquor; a neighbour called me and my child up to have a bit of victuals with them; by and by he came back again and said he had lost his watch; I left my lodging because I owed money; I went out with my oysters as usual.</p>

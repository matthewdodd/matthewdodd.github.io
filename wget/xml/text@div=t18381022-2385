                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, and live in Tottenham-court-road. On the 17th of October the prisoner came to my shop about twelve o'clock in the day, and offered to sell part of three silver boxes, broken, and eleven silver tops of bottles—he came in and asked if I bought old silver, and produced the parts of boxes from his hat—I put them into the scale, and asked if he had any more silver, and he brought from his pocket the eleven tops—I then asked him if it was his own property—he said it was—I said I did not purchase silver of anybody unless I knew who they were, and asked his address—he said he lived in Curzon-street, May-fair—I told him I should give the money to my man, who should go with him, and see if his address was correct, and if so he should pay him there—he objected, and said he wanted to go quite another road—I said if he would wait an hour, I would send my apprentice to the place, and if it was correct, I would pay him—he changed countenance, and said he would go provided I let him take the plate, and come back—I said "No, I am afraid you came dis<lb></lb>honestly by it"—he said, "I will tell you the truth, I do not think it is exactly honestly come by, I have had it in a way I think not altogether honest"—I shut the door, sent for an officer, and gave him in charge, with the property—it appears to have come out of a dressing-case.</p>

I am clerk to an upholsterer, who acts as agent for Lady Caroline Greville, in letting her house in Hill-street—the house at this time was let to Mr. Williams—I made an inventory of the things in the house, which I compared when Mr. Williams took possession in March last-among other things, there was a cabinet in the dining-room—after the prisoner was taken into custody, I went to the house, and merely saw the frame of the cabinet—the upper part had been taken away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Williams, No. 1, Hill-street, Berkeley-square. The prisoner was in his service as footman down to the 17th of October—Mr. Williams was abroad then—the prisoner left the house, about eleven o'clock that day, and did not return—after he was apprehended, I examined the cabinet—it appeared to have been broken open, but not with much force—there were places for a number of canisters, which were not there, and there were a number of bottles, without stoppers, which are here—I opened a drawer, of which the prisoner kept the key, about a week after he was apprehended, and found in it two spoons, and some broken silver—the spoons were not Mr. Williams's, but are supposed to belong to Lady Greville—they have no mark—a silver stopper was afterwards found, and corresponded with those produced by the silversmith.</p>

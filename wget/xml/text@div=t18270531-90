            . I keep the Blue Posts public-house, in Holborn, and book for the Kentish-town coach. On the 17th of April the prisoner (who was a stranger to me) came to the office and produced a brown paper parcel with this ticket to it (looking at it); the parcel was to be sent to Kentish-town; the ticket purports to be from the Angel, St. Clements, and charges 1s. 8d. carriage, and 6d. porterage; it was directed to Mr. Sheen, Kentish-town; I understood it had come from the country to the Angel, and was to be forwarded to Kentish-town; he demanded 2s. 2d., which I paid him; the brought another parcel about three o'clock the same afternoon, and had a ticket with that, purporting to come from the Angel, and charging 2s. 2d., which I paid him, believing it to be correct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you know where they came from? A. No; the ticket only denotes that they came from the country; the parcels were found to contain nothing but brown paper.</p>

               <p>Q. What day of the month was it that you went to Decaux's house - A. On the 4th, about half after eight, I went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it that you saw any person come to lady Morton's house - A. At half after twelve, I saw five persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Baker - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the persons of these five men particularly so as to know them - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether Baker was one of these five men - A. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did these five persons do - A. Three of them went to the iron area gate, and two of them went to the street door, they looked at each; the watchman was coming past crying half after twelve; they went away, I saw no more of them that night. On the 5th, about half after six, I went to lady Morton's house before it was dark; in my way to the house, about half after five, I was crossing Chapel street, I observed five men standing at the post at the corner of Chapel street in Park lane, two of them was Starkey and Lasper; I had known them before, they had their faces towards me; I did not know any of the others, their backs were towards me. I went on to lady Morton's house, where Jackson, one of the constables, was waiting; I walked about some little time to get unobserved in the house by the people that were there. After I had been there a little time my brother and Budgell came in; I found Jackson in the house, he had gone earlier in the evening. We four officers then went down into a room that opens out of the house into the area, we remained there some time, I suppose at least an hour, then I heard the area gate unlock, and some persons come down the steps to the area door, I heard them attempting to unlock it, they were as much as twenty minutes changing the keys; I heard them changing the keys; they could not unlock it; and some person, that seemed to me as if he was standing upon the top of the area steps in the street, called out d - n you, send it in; I believe it was the one at the door then said, hand me down the jemmy.</p>
               <p>Q. That means an iron crow - A. Yes. I heard the crow directly put into the door, they began to wrench it at the outside, after wrenching it several times and stopping now and then. There was a bell hung behind the door; when they wrenched the bell rung, they stopped a bit then, at last they wrenched it open; one of them came into the passage immediately and called to the others, come along, it is all right; some of the others said, now get a light; I heard them go along the passage, and it seemed to me to be the feet of four people by the sound, as nigh as I could guess; they went up stairs, I could hear them walk about the back parlour, over my head; I had pulled my boots off before that; I went up after them, my brother,

            , Jackson, and Budgell, followed me; we had no light; I saw there was a light in the back parlour, I went into the parlour immediately, there I saw four men, three in one corner of the room, and one by the fire place, nearer to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them men - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they see you - A. Yes; they put out their lights immediately, they seemed to me to have two lights. I laid hold of the one nearest me by the fire place, it was dark then, I held him for a second, I had only got one hand to lay hold him, I had my cutlass in my other hand; he struck me across the breast and shoved me to the other side of the room, and then I was close to these people, I then heard a striking against the wainscoat near me; I thought it was a crow at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that they were striking at you - A. I thought it then; there was nobody else in the room as I know to assist me at the time; I 
               <persName id="t18090111-7-person102">drew</persName>
             a pistol and fired at the place where the noise came from; I followed them up into a little passage about as big as where I now stand; then there were four of us in this little place; they shoved me back again; as soon as they shoved me into the room I heard a door burst open; I called to the other officers to bring me a light, which they did immediately; as soon as they brought me a light I followed them into the yard, I saw which way they had gone, through a door that leads into the back yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. The door that was open communicated to the back yard - A. To the back yard: when I got out there I saw Starkey had got on the back office.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the situation you found him in - A. I found him getting up from off his knee upon the coping of one of the back offices; there is a side wall adjoins the house; he was getting off that and getting on one of the offices; I ran round and got into Park lane, he had jumped off the wall and broke his leg, he was laying under the wall; I had him taken back to the house and I went back to examine the place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Did you observe what became of either of the other three - A. I did not then; they must all have escaped the same way. One of them went over the wall of the next yard; I did not see him, we found that afterwards. When I returned to see the state of the house, in the parlour I saw a man's hat and some blood, and the ball of the pistol sticking in the door; I found an iron crow, six skeleton keys, and a piece or cotton of a candle, where Starkey had gone over the parapet of the wall; he had dropped them before he got over.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where was it you found them - A. This door out of the parlour opens to a flat which covers a kitchen below; then along the yard there is another place which makes it level with Park lane wall; that was where I found them and that was where I saw Starkey getting up, where I found them. I sent Starkey to the infirmary to be taken care of. I found the door that leads into the yard broken open, with the lock broke; the door they went out of. The door of the area into the house was broken open with an iron crow; it was evident the door had been forced with a crow, and I have no doubt but that is the crow; I compared the crow to the marks, it tallied; I matched the skeleton keys, none of them would unlock the area door; one of them opened the area gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Shortly after this Lasper was taken into custody - A. Lasper was taken immediately after; Cavill was not taken for a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. You did not know Baker till he was taken up - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. This offence was committed in the month of October - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Baker has been recently taken up - A. Yes.</p>

As I was going home from my pay table, King street, Swallow street, about half past eleven or a little more, I saw five men standing at lady Morton's door.

               <p>Mr. Andrews. Are you able to say that Baker, the man you saw on the Sunday, was one of the five men you saw about lady Morton's house - A. That I can not say any thing at all about. I went again to the Bleeding Hart on the Monday, there I saw the prisoner Cavill, Lasper, and Starkey, they were in company then; the prisoner and Cavill went down to Park street to look at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that they went to Park street - A.

Jack the Baker, the prisoner, made answer, I will go with you, Cavill replied with all my heart; they came back again, Lasper said how is it, the prisoner answered, why he is gone to Croydon fair with his girl, we must leave it alone to night; both Baker and Cavill said so. I then came away. I went again on the Tuesday to the Bleeding Hart.

             the Baker and Cavill went to this person again, they did not mention the name; they went again after the tools, they came back and said it was all right.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them said that - A. Cavill said it was all right; Cavill asked what time they should meet, the prisoner said about nine o'clock, Lasper said he thought it as good a time as any; but where they did not mention in my hearing; they were to do the trick at eleven, Cavill said that. I then proceeded to Marlborough street, and gave information to the officers.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time of the day was it you went to the Bleeding Hart - A. About three in the afternoon; it was about seven o'clock when I came away from the Bleeding Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you went to the public office - A. I went to the public house opposite of the office; I acquainted Mr. Foy of it, he spoke to his brother officers; I told them to be at such a place, and I would secure them a place whereby they should be secure from the sight of them, at the house kept by my wife for lady Steward: I lived at that house with my wife, I would be there ready to let them in about nine o'clock; the officers came on Tuesday evening, I put them in the front parlour; we then waited there till about half past twelve o'clock; at that time there were five men came up to lady Morton's door; I was then in the front room along with the officers; five men went up the steps of the street door, three of them came down to the area gate, and the others might be upon the steps for about a minute or two; the watchman came and called half an hour after twelve o'clock; they then dispersed, I saw no more of them that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you distinguish who they were - A. The prisoner was one, I am sure of that; it was a bright moon light night at the time, and I had taken particular notice of the persons before, I knew them all by sight, and the names by which they called one other I took down on paper, and the description; I went the next day to the Bleeding Hart, about ten in the morning, and saw Cavill, Lasper, Starkey, and Jack the Baker, they were all in company together; I heard them talking about meeting

             came in, and then I went out; that was about a quarter to six o'clock; exactly I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What direction did you take - A. I turned to the right towards South street; I saw the five men, Lasper, Starkey, Jem Britten, Cavill, and the prisoner; I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110008"></xptr>sure the prisoner was one of them. I then followed them up South street into South Audley street, round to Chapel street, down to Park street again.</p>
               <p>Q. Making a little circuit and then returning to lady Morton's house again - A. Yes; still keeping in company together; after they came into Park street, they went into Park lane; my wife and the young woman of the house were coming out then; Cavill and the prisoner followed the two girls in Grovesnor square; I followed them at a distance; they came back after seeing them into the square; they returned to their partners; Cavill said it was all right; they went round to South street, to my lady Morton's house; I was still keeping my eye upon them, I was in South street, I stood by the public house. They went up to the gate of lady Morton's house, all five; Starkey and Jem Britten remained at the gate, the other three passed on a little way.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time in the evening was this - A. That I cannot say, it might be about seven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Was it dark - A. It was duskish; they opened the area gate and went away; by persons passing they were disturbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how they opened the area gate - A. They opened it with something they had in their hands, I cannot exactly say what it was; as soon as they opened it Starkey said it was all right.</p>
               <p>COURT. How near were you to them when he said that - A. I was about three doors off, standing at the public house the corner of South street; as soon as the people had passed they returned again, three of them then went down the area steps, Starkey, Britten, and Lasper; they were trying at the door some considerable time; I heard a bell ring, I supposed it was the bell of the door, and I heard the door crack; I was then opposite, at my own door; I supposed the door was then opened; just before that one of them, (Lasper,) came up the steps and halloed out bring the jemmy this way.</p>
               <p>Q. He came up the steps - A. Yes, just to the top; the prisoner and Cavill were standing at the corner of South street about three house off.</p>
               <p>Q. Fix exactly, if you can, the hour, what time in the evening it was when you heard the bell ring - A. It might be seven o'clock, past seven, it might be a quarter after, as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the light at that time - A. It was dark at that time, it was duskish; I was about four or five houses off; it was not very dark and it was not very light.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any remains of the light of the day - A. No, very little indeed; it was so dark that I could distinguish a person about three houses off by the lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in your judgment any remains of day then - A. No, not any; it was not real dark nor real light.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Could you have discovered their faces without the assistance of the lamps - A. I could the distance I was off them at that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. It was duskish but not dark - A. Not so dark as it was afterwards; it was darker afterwards, before the moon got up; at that time there was no moon to be seen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. After the three men what became of the other men - A. Cavill went down immediately after the jemmy had been called for, and left the prisoner at the bar at the corner of South street; I kept my station opposite watching; the prisoner then went to the back of the house into Park lane as soon as Cavill had left him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what the men at the area gate did after this - A. No, I could not; I remained at the front of the house, and after hearing the report of a pistol about a quarter of an hour afterwards; in a few minutes after the report of the pistol, I saw the prisoner come running from Park lane into South street and down Park street to the front of the house; he came as if from the back of lady Morton's house to the front of it; when he came into Park street

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. Then if I understand you right, you say thought it was a little duskish, there was still remaining light enough to distinguish a man's face about three or four houses off - A. Yes, by the light of the lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my lord and the jury that you knew Cavill - A. I knew his face; I had worked with him a week.</p>
               <p>Q. You did know him - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course he knew you - A. He might not be so exact as to look at me.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew his house of call - you knew that he resorted to the Bleeding Hart, he told you that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you knew that Cavill was to be found at the Bleeding Hart - A. I did not know it till I went.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go there - A. I went in there for curiosity, the same as before mentioned, because I thought there was no good going on; he had given me an invitation to go there, but I did not go there then; that day I took the liberty to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no invitation on that day from him nor had you given any invitation - A. No; I expected to meet him, and there I did see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why Cavill must know you - could Cavill forget you - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other people in the house, were there not; other people might see him as well as you - how far did you sit from him - A. About as far as I am to you.</p>
               <p>COURT. You did not make yourself known to Cavill at that time - A. No, nor to any body else; I did not speak to him; I only called for my beer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. There were other people in the house besides you and these men you have been describing - A. There were only these thieves and bad women.</p>
               <p>Q. And yourself - no honest person would use the house would they - A. Oh, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there were other people there - A. Of course there were other people there at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not they pay attention to what passed - A. I do not know they did.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to this house Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were always fortunate enough to go at the time that some of these people were there - A. Yes, and I always found them there.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there expecting to find them there, and you found them there - never by accident that you was too late, you always found some of them there - A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110009"></xptr>Q. I take it for granted that during the number of times you were there, other people besides these men and yourself were in the tap room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of these men here - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. These men were constantly talking of this robbery - A. Yes, at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Speaking of it in the manner you have told the jury and my lord - mentioning time, place and name, loud enough for every body to hear - A. So loud that I could hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think it very extraordinary that these men should be so rash as to talk before you - A. Being a common house for thieves, I naturally thought they were not very particular in speaking; they might think the people were thieves like themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. You had known him two years before - when did you first know it was the house of call for thieves - A. When I first went.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you know it was a house where their guests were reputed thieves - A. Only as I had heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Honest people go sometimes there, because you went there - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed these men constantly in the street on the night of the robbery - were they not likely to see you dodging of them - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my lord and the jury that you were some distance from them, yet they spoke so loud of this robbery that you heard them - A. I am only speaking of what passed in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. About the iron crow being handed down you heard in the street - A. I heard that about three houses off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. How many yards was that off - A. It might be twenty yards off; I did not measure it; I suppose it might be between twelve and twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have the jury believe they talked so loud that between twelve and twenty yards you heard what they said - A. I do not understand your question.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said you were between twelve and twenty yards off, yet you heard what they said - A. I heard them call out for the jemmy; I was nearly opposite then.</p>
               <p>COURT. At what distance were you when they talked about the jemmy - A. When Lasper came up to the top of the steps I was opposite of lady Morton's door; it might be ten yards across the street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Did you not say just now that you heard some conversation in the street between the prisoner and Cavill - A. When they followed the girls they came back and said all was right; then I might be about twenty yards off; I was at Chapel court at that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You know as a carpenter that is sixty feet - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were so cautious, that you might know their names you took down their names on a piece of paper - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had nothing to do in planning of this, previous before you gave information - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Decaux, how much reward do you expect - A. That I do not know nothing about the reward, I did not till last sessions; my lord informed me as last sessions. I know it now.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know that the greater the number that are convicted the greater would be the reward - A. Of course I knew it after I was told it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not expect the reward - A. Of course I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that if this young man is convicted there will be a reward too - A. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he is indicted of a similar offence - you know there is a reward now - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect part of the reward if that young man is convicted - A. Of course I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Did you know any thing about this reward about the conviction of these persons till you were here last sessions - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You happened to be employed once with Cavill, you then learned from Cavill that he used the Bleeding Hart - A. No, I only received information from him to go to that house; I never went.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your reason for going to the Bleeding Hart to find out Cavill there - A. Yes, and to learn the intentions of these suspicious men.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no share in counselling or advising this robbery - A. Upon my oath I had not.</p>
               <p>COURT. How long before this month of October was it that you had received this invitation from Cavill - A. I believe very near two years; I never had any communication with Cavill after that period; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. When you followed him had you disguised yourself in your dress - A. No; I had not the same clothes on, I had an apron on.</p>

I heard the clock strike; it was after I heard the clock strike that the knock was made at the door; in a few minutes after that knock I heard the key go into the area gate; that gate was unlocked, and then they walked away for a few minutes; it was after the second knock that I heard them open the area gate; then I heard them come down into the area, and after trying the door with different keys for about twenty minutes, one of them halloaed out hand down the jemmy; then they made a violent crash at the door with the crow; the bell that was fixed within side of the door rang very loud; they then stopped for a while; one of them said behind the door, thrust it in, or burst it in, with the crow; then the door flew open and the bell rang loud some time; some of them came in and said it was all right; it was near eight o'clock when the door was bursted open.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You keep a dog, don't you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It happens now and then that the dog gets hold of a bit of meat? - A. Never, but when it is given him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you it was a bit of meat that the dog had gnawed, and was not sit to expose for sale to a customer? - A. He did; but this was a dog that we kept in the shop to protect the meat from cats and dogs, because she would not meddle with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you allow the man in the shop to use these sort of cloths? - A. For nothing else but to lay the meat on.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you give him the use and possession of it? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there ever any little jealousies between you and him about a girl that was a customer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not that that induced you to prosecute him for stealing this mutton? - A. It was not.</p>

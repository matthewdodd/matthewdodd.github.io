I lost a shawl on the 5th of July, the prisoner came to the shop - I took her duplicate up stairs to get the articles she wanted, and at the same time I looked for a shawl in the name of Dixon; I came down, and found my apprentice looking for a shawl which he had lost from the counter - I asked who he had served, and he said Mrs. Hatch - I went after her, and found a wrapper which had been round the shawl, but the shawl is lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A. Five years, as a customer - I have always had a very good opinion of her; my apprentice is not here - he served her while I was up stairs; I had gone for another shawl - she took away four or five parcels; I was not there when she went out, and do not know that she took them in her bag; I had sent to her house before - I sent there to ask if she had not by mistake got something that did not belong to her; I thought it was a mistake; the person I sent met her, and saw her before I did - it is generally the case, that when a person receives anything they wrap it in a wrapper.</p>

            . I went to the shop for a shawl - it was held up by the boy; the prisoner was in the box before me, and she said "Stop till I have got my things, and you shall have my place;" I went up, and my shawl was not to be found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw the shawl held up? A. Yes - the prisoner had a bag, and took five parcels - I went to her house with the witness, after the man had been sent with the message - she had time to have put anything away; I asked if she had not taken a shawl in mistake - she brought down her pledges, and shewed them to me, and there was the wrapper of my shawl.</p>

On the 24th of March, I saw the prisoner turn from the garden-gate, about four o'clock in the afternoon. I saw him with a caddy under his arm. I went into the front room to see if our caddy was gone. I then went after him, and am quite sure he is the man I saw at the gate. I got sight of him about a quarter of a mile from the house, and he dropped the caddy. I saw it in the parlour at two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The front-door is in Warren-street - A. Yes; the garden-door is not bolted in the day time - the door was open at the time he was brought back.</p>

            . I was standing in Fitzroy-place, and saw the prisoner run through the court with a caddy under his arm. The servant came up and asked me if I had seen a man go by with a caddy? I said, Yes. I ran on before her and got sight of him - the dog had then hold of him. He had not got the caddy under his arm then - he dropped it, and I picked it up and gave it to her. He was about ten yards from me when I saw the dog lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was going towards the fields - A. Yes; running - and when he returned he was walking. I never knew him before. I saw his face as he was running through the court - they called after him, and he turned round. I am sure he is the man that dropped the caddy. He was absent about a minute - he ran behind some houses and returned walking.</p>

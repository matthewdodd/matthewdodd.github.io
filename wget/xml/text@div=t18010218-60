On Monday evening, the 19th of January, I asked him what money he had taken, and he gave me a guinea, two half-guineas, and some silver, among which was the half-guinea but not the seven shilling-piece; I asked him where he got the guinea and a half; he said he took the guinea and a half of one person; I said no more to him then, but went to Mr. Buxton's again; the next morning I called the prisoner into the parlour, and desired him to sit down; I told him I had suspected a long while that he had been guilty of embezzling my money; he at first denied it.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you make use of the word convinced? - A. I said I was certain he had done it; I asked him if he had received a seven shilling-piece on the Monday; he at first denied that he had; I told him the circumstance of its having been marked; upon which, after some hesitation, he said that he had taken a seven shilling-piece; I asked him what he had done with it; he said he had it up stairs; I said no more to him then, but went for an officer; when he saw me going out, he desired I might be called back, he wanted to speak to me; I came back, and he said he would be glad to speak with me by myself; I then took him into a room by ourselves; he asked me if I would make it up;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180038"></xptr>I told him I did not know what he meant by making it up, if he he had any thing to say to me to say it; after some hesitation, he told me that he had taken five pounds of my money, at which I laughed, and walked away; he then desired that I might be called again; I came back, and then he acknowledged that he had taken ten pounds; every time that I returned he wanted to make up the matter; after that, he acknowledged that he had taken twenty pounds; I went away again, and he called me back; he then acknowledged to twenty-five pounds, and expressed the same wish to make it up every time I went away; and when I returned again the next time; he said he had taken sorry pounds; I returned again the last time, and he said he had taken fory-five pounds; when I was going away again; he said he would give this money up to me; I asked him where he had not the money; he said it was at his aunt's; upon which I asked him how I was to get it; he said he would give me a note to his aunt; I immediately went to Worship-street office, and got a search-warrant to search his aunt's house in Wheeler-street, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he give you directions where to find any money? - A. Yes; particularly forty guineas, his aunt had it in her pocket; I was to ask for it; he said they were most of them new guineas, and were in a shagreen box in her pocket; which we found according to his description.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of those guineas marked? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot say that they were your's? - A. No; the officer took the aunt to the office; I then went back to my house with the officer, and took him up stairs to search the prisoner's box, where we found the seven shilling-piece that had been marked by Mr. Buxton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Have you repeated every thing that he said? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You went to this poor old woman's house and found forty guineas in her pocket? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. She did not charge you with robbing her of it? - A.No.</p>

            , on Monday the 19th of January, to puchase potatoes at Mr. Gregory's, and she brought back five shillings and nine-pence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley Q.Will you venture to swear that it was a good seven shilling-piece? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>HANNAH MORRIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. On Monday the 19th of January, Mr. Buxton sent me to get some potatoes at Mr. Gregory's which I received from the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley Q.He gave you five shillings and nine-pence in change? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Where did he gave you the change from? - A.Out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Gregory). Q.Have you no till in your shop? - A. No; there is an accompting-house, and I left silver on the desk for him to give change with if he wanted it; I left two pound's worth of silver, which he had not touched when I came back; he gave me in all about five or six pounds.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Alley, on the part of the prisoner, took three objections, which were argued on the part of the prosecution by Mr. Knapp.)</p>
               <p>Court. Three objections have been taken, first, That the delivery must be by a third person, and that, therfore, this being by the medium of the master cannot come within this Act of Parliament; I am perfectly satisfied there is nothing in that, if he receives it on account of his master that is sufficient, and all that the Act of Parliament requires; if a master, suspecting his clerk, chuses to send, by another person, even his own money, that is directly within the words of the Act, and therfore there is nothing in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180039"></xptr>The next objection is to the competency of the witness. I am perfectly satisfied that he is a competent witness. Your objection does not go so much to his competency as to his credit; all persons coming here, as witnesses, come with a hope of reward, by the return of their goods, that is always a question for the Jury to decide; and therefore; though Mr. Gregory comes here with the hopes of having his money replaced, yet it cannot affect his competency. But, I think, the last objection, that of the seven shilling-piece, is really a very serious objection, because the Act of Parliament says, any person who shall receive money, goods, bonds, bills, banker's notes, or other valuable security, on account of his master, or shall fraudulently embezzle, or make away with the same, and so on, why then it must be the thing that he makes away with. Mr. Knapp says, suppose a man was indicted for stealing seven shillings, and you only prove a part of it, would not that support the indictment? - Why, yes, because the indictment is for stealing seven shillings in monies numbered; but does Mr. Knapp think, that if a man is indcted for stealing seven shillings, and a seven shilling-piece is produced, that that indictment is good? - Certainly not; if you charge seven shillings in monies numbered, and you prove but one it is sufficient. How is it here? - This man receives a seven shilling-piece; if he had taken the change out of his master's till and given it to the customer, I should have held that that was embezzling seven shillings of his master's property; but here the fact does not warrant that;

             says, he gave her five shillings and nine-pence; then, why might not this indictment have stated, that this man received seven shillings, and embezzled one shilling and three-pence, part of the said seven shillings? - You charge that he embezzled and secreted the sum of seven shillings; no, he has not; he has secreted and embezzled only one shilling and three-pence of it, the rest he paid out of his own pocket. The second count certainly is not proved; I shall state to the Jury the evidence upon the first count, offering such observations upon it as I shall think right to submit to them.</p>

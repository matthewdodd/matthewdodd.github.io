I had then thirteen Guineas in my Pocket; she stopt me, whipt her Hand into my Breeches, and when she took it out again, I mist six Guineas: I called the Watch, who took her to the Watch-house. - She at first deny'd she had it, and no body searched her; but afterwards confess'd it.</p>
               <p>The Constable thus deposed: My Watchman brought the Prosecutor, with the Prisoner and another Woman, before me. The Prosecutor said they had both pickt his Pocket; but fix'd the Charge upon the Prisoner. - (She has been brought to our Watch house for a Street-Walker before now.) - She deny'd the Matter; and I talk'd of searching her; but the Prosecutor said it would signify nothing, for he did not question but that she had convey'd it away. That Morning we carry'd her before my Lord Mayor; after which, we went into the Vine in Bell-Court in Foster-Lane, and there she confess'd that she had the Guineas in her Mouth all the time that she was in the Watch house.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made her Defence: As I was going up Flower-de-Luce Court, I saw a Man and a Woman a jostling together against the Wall, and presently the Man said, You Bitch, you have pickt my Pocket; and seeing me, he ran after me, and said I was a Confederate, and so let the other Woman go. <rs id="t17250827-11-verdict45" type="verdictDescription">

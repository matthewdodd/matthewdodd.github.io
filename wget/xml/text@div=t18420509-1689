                  </hi>. In consequence of circumstances I marked this decanter on Wednesday, the 13th of April, about the time I knew Mary would bring John's tea—I placed myself on the floor above them, and looked through an opening in the floor—I saw Mary com and walk up to him—he said, "I thought it was your footstep"—he then stooped down and reached out from a dark corner the decanter where it was placed, and put it into her lap—she had her apron thrown over her arm, and drew her shawl over it—I then came down—she remained talking with her bro<lb></lb>ther for some time, and at last went away—I followed her out, brought her back, and asked what she had that did not belong to her—she said, "No<lb></lb>thing"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184205090220"></xptr>
               <p>—I put my hand into her apron, took out the decanter, and said to her, "What do you call this? where did you get it from?"—she said, "My brother gave it to me"—I asked, "For what purpose?"—she said she did not know—I said, "At all events it was to take away"—she said, "Yes"—the constable then came, and I gave her and John into custody—I desired him to come in to his sister, and said, "John, your sister tells me you gave her this decanter, is it so?"—he said, "Yes, it is"—I told the officer to take him.</p>

I am a gardener, of 27, New Street, Dorset Square—on Saturday evening, 4th August, I saw the prosecutor, the prisoner, and two others, just by the "Globe" tavern, about half-past eight o'clock—I saw the soldiers take him away between the two lamp<lb></lb>posts, and saw the prisoner's hand come away from his waistcoat—he then struck him, and I saw the prosecutor's watch in the soldier's hand—I followed the prisoner down Gloucester Place, across Baker Street, into Paddington Street, Little Marylebone Street, and Smith Street—he never let the watch out of his right hand—I could have caught him before, but he was a strong lusty fellow, and I waited for help—I was present when he was taken—he threw the watch from his right hand—I picked it up and gave it to the constable.</p>

The first Witness was a Servant in the House where the Deceas'd lodg'd, who swore, That seeing the Prisoner come down Stairs in some haste, and having heard a Noise above, she ask'd him what was the Matter, and he said there was fighting, which she did not believe, Mr. Brown being (as she thought) at work by himself: That a while afterwards the Deceas'd came down with both Hands at his Throat, bleeding; whereupon she cry'd out, and several People came in, and he was laid upon a Bench in the Yard. Another depos'd, that hearing of the Matter, he went in while the Deceas'd lay to, and that he gave him some Keys and Money out of his Pocket, but could not speak; and that a Surgeon being sent for, came and dress'd him, and laid him on a Bed, where the Surgeon by farther Application, brought him to his Speech, and then he describ'd the Prisoner, but knew not his Name; only said 'twas he that came over from Ostend with Mr. Reignard (which it, was prov'd the Prisoner did) and that he came behind him, pull'd back his Head, and cut him twice on the Throat. The Prisoner's Sword and Gloves were found on the Bed in the Room where the Deceas'd was murder'd, and he was taken the next Day. He had nothing to say in his Defence, but that he had bespoke a Wig of the Deceas'd, who ask'd him 7 l. for it, and afterwards came to 6 l. and that he bidding him 4 l. for it, he, in a Passion, took up a Razor that lay by him, and said he would cut his Throat first, which he did accordingly, and that he ran away, because it is the Custom in France (in which Country he said he was born, and from which he fled for killing a Man) that whoever is in the Place where a Man is kill'd, shall answer for his Blood: But this being look'd on as a very weak Defence, he was found <rs id="t17140908-39-verdict210" type="verdictDescription">

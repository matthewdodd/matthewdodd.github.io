                  </hi>. I am the wife of Woolf Jacobs, who keeps a tobac<lb></lb>conist's shop in Featherstone-street. On the afternoon of the 9th of Janu<lb></lb>ary I was sitting in the back room—I lifted up my head, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in the shop—he took his arm from over the rail, and walked out—I went after him, and in passing I saw the place of these cigars vacant in the window—I never lost sight of him—I said to him, "You have robbed me"—he said, "I have not"—I said, "If you have not, you will not hesitate to come back"—I seized him—he said, "If you will let me go, I will return"—I would not, and after a struggle he came back—he struck me several blows, and then he took off his hat, took out the cigars, and said, "Here is what I have got; now let me go"—I would not—he struck me, and threw the cigars behind the counter—he then struck me again several times, and got away—I overtook him again near the same place—he struggled, but some persons came up, and he was taken.</p>

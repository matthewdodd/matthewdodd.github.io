                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and life in King-street, Hammersmith. On the evening of the 15th of Oct. I suspected the prisoner of stealing boots and shoes, and I gave him in charge on suspicion—I asked him for the key of his box—he gave the key, and his box was opened—I told him if he did not allow me to search his box, I should give him into custody—he gave up the key, and his box was searched—after I searched it I gave him into custody—I then searched his room, and found a quan<lb></lb>tity of leather concealed under his bed—the officer was with me all the time—I identified the leather as belonging to me—I had not authorized the pri<lb></lb>soner soner to take any leather, and he had no right to take any there for the pur<lb></lb>pose bf business—it was stolen out of my shop.</p>

               <p>in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The room where we found the leather—he occupied it himself—I think for a fortnight or three weeks, no person had occupied it but him—the other workmen went into his room to go to their other shop—the door opened into his room, and then the door of the work-shop was in the other corner—they had no occasion to go to any other part of his room—the other workmen were not in the habit of carrying leather there, only what I gave them to work—I do not believe it was possible for any leather to have been brought into that room without the prisoner knowing it—there was a consider<lb></lb>able quantity of leather—here are the two largest pieces—I know the piece by cutting a bit off one end of it myself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 127.) On the evening of the 15th of Oct. I was called to Mr. Cook's, at Hammersmith—he communi<lb></lb>cated with me and I took the prisoner into custody—I searched the prisoner's box and found some duplicates, and after he was given into custody I found a quantity of leather under the head of the bed in his room, covered with an old piece of rotten leather—when the prisoner was given in charge he said he knew nothing of it.</p>

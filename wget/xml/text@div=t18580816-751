                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Callaghan, who keeps the Duke of Sussex at Haggerstone Bridge. On 20th July, Johnson came about 9 o'clock in the evening—I served him with a pint of porter—I saw him take it to the door—he paid me with a shilling—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and put the shilling in the till—there was some small money there, but no other shilling at the time. Johnson left, and in about 2 minutes my master went to the till—no one had been to the till in the meantime—he drew my attention to the only shilling in the till; I looked, and found it was bad—while he was talking to me about it, the two prisoners came in at another door, at the other end of the bar—I went to serve them, and Piers asked for half a quartern of gin—the price was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling, I looked at it, tried it with my teeth, and found it was bad. I called out to my master, "Here is another bad shilling." Mr. Callaghan came to me—I put the shilling in his hand, and told him there was another bad shilling—I pointed to Piers, and said, "That is the person who gave it me." Mr. Callagan asked the prisoners if they knew it was bad, and</p>

               <p>they both turned round and ran out of the place, and left the shilling behind them—they had not drank the gin; it was poured out in a glass, but not drank—they were given in custody shortly afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Johnson.</hi> I did not give a shilling, I gave a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece.

                  </hi>. I keep the Duke of Sussex. On 20th July, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I was getting my supper. I want to the bar where the last witness was serving—I went to the till and found a bad shilling in it, and no other shilling in the till—I spoke to the last witness about it, and that shilling I took care of. Just after that the two prisoners came in, and the last witness called me, and said, "Here is another bad shilling." The two prisoners were there, and he said in their presence that he took it of Piers—both the prisoners turned round and ran out of the house. I took that shilling up, and put the two shillings together in my waistcoat pocket—I ran after the prisoners—I afterwards gave them to the policeman. I had no other coin in that pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Kingsland. On 20th July, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I was by the Duke of Sussex. I saw both the prisoners against the public house; they were talking together and looking in at the door of the public house—Johnson then went into the house, and Piers remained at the door—in a short time, Johnson came to the door with a pot and some beer in it; Piers drank with him—Johnson returned to the public house, and in a short time he came out and joined Piers—they talked a few minutes, and they both went into the house at another door. In about a minute, I saw them about ten yards from the house, running away—I followed them, and assisted the constable in taking them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Johnson. Q.</hi> Did you see me and Piers run together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, down Haggerstone toward Stoneham Common. When the constable took Piers you were following—I saw you, and pointed you out to the constables.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Johnson.</hi> It is quite false, I crossed the road, and they said a man had given a bad shilling—I came back and saw Piers in the hands of the police, and Piers said, "That is the man that was with me." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I followed Piers, and caught him—the policeman came and I gave him to him. I was returning and met Johnson—I said, "This is the other one"—Johnson made use of very bad language and resisted.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 100). On the evening of 20th July, I was in Haggerstone Lane about half-past 8 o'clock. I saw the two prisoners in company together about 150 yards from the Duke of Sussex—Charlotte Cooper, the last prisoner who was tried, was with them. After that, about 9 o'clock, I was near Haggeretone Bridge, and Mr. Callaghan came to me and pointed out the two prisoners, who were running down Haggerstone Lane, towards the church—I followed them—I took Piers in Kingsland Road. In coming back, accompanied by Smith, I found Johnson—I took them both hack to the Duke of Sussex. I received these two shillings from Mr. Callaghan. Johnson said he had never been in the house before—Piers said he was running away because his mate had passed a bad shilling, and he was not going to be locked up for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Johnson's Defence.</hi> I paid Piers that night a shilling that I owed him. It is false that I was in his company at half-past 8.

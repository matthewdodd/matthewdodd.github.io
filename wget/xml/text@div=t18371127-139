               <p>Coke Company. Their office is in John-street, Bedford-row—the prisoner was in their service during 1836 down to 1837, as inspector, at 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—it was his duty to take instructions from persons wanting new ser<lb></lb>vices laid on—he was to see it done and receive the money for the ex<lb></lb>penses—every week when he came to the office he was to make a return in writing, and pay over the amount to me—he had printed forms of re<lb></lb>ceipts given to him, a certain number at the time, for which he had to account—he was told not to issue any other receipt than that form—I have examineds his return for November 1836—the reis nothing about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. re<lb></lb>ceived from Mr. Prior—nor is it in any subsequent return—the returns are in the prisoner's hand-writing—in January, 1837, there is no return Wilson, 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor in May, of 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Cochrane—these three sums have never been accounted for to the Company, to my knowledge—the signature and filling up of these three receipts are the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> These are all three proper printed receipts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are—I am the only cashier in the establishment—the prisoner usually paid in 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in a week—they are sums paid by tradesmen for certain sized burners—he had been a year and a half in the Company's service—he had to go out after the gas was lighted to see that customers burnt no more than their proper quantity, and to see that they were not burning after a certain hour, according to the time the parties agreed to burn—he had nothing to do with collecting for consumption of gas, but for the service pipe only—I am not aware that he has gone into the service of the London Gas Company since he has left us—I have heard it—I believe we had the exclusive supply of the south-western district of Pancras while he was with us—since he has left we have had competition in that district by the London Gas Company—I cannot say whether we have diminished our charges in consequence—I cannot say whether smaller payments are made for the same supply in that district—I do not know—I will not say it is not so—the prisoner left about the 24th of May.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Between that and the day he was taken into custody, the 25th of November, did you call upon him to explain the non-entry of these three receipts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I have not seen him—I believe there was a paper returned by him soon after he left, with sums of money on it, in re<lb></lb>spect of certain tradesmen—the prisoner had provided a bond to make good any deficiency in his accounts.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Those sums are for new services? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, or addi<lb></lb>tional burners—we charged the parties for consumption of gas, from the date he gave of laying on the service—if he gave no return we should have no means of charging customers—we should not know that they had gas.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief inspector to the Imperial Gas Company. The prisoner's duty was to fill up contracts, get the parties to sign them, and return them to me to be entered in a book, and put in charge in the ledger—he did not return me any contract in the three in<lb></lb>stances in question, Prior, Wilson, or Cochran—he would have to hand me the contract, and to give the cashier the money, one being a cheque on the other—his duty would call him out late at night sometimes, and some<lb></lb>times</p>

               <p>early in the morning—it would be his duty to be out as much as possible—I do not know that he went into the service of the London Gas Company after he left us—we still charge the same rates for con<lb></lb>sumption of gas in the south-western 'district of Pancras—he left us on the 27th of May—we afterwards discovered that some sums received by him had been entered, but not accounted for, and he was called on to settle the account—he did so—this paper is his writing, and has his signature—it was handed to me about three weeks or a month after he left—I said, "I hope there is nothing further than this; I hope this will settle all"—he said, "I do not recollect any thing further"—it does not contain either of the amounts in question—part of this account is for gas, and the remain<lb></lb>der for burners—he received the money where we made the parties pay prompt—the prisoner had workmen under him to lay on the service pipes, but the fittings-up are done by the tradesmen.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

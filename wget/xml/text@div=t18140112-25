            . I am an officer. About six o'clock on the 17th of December, I was at the watch-house, a man came to me, and said there was a man at the Blue Boar public-house Rosemary-lane, with a pot in his pocket that belonged to the Green Dragon Bishopsgate-street. I went to the prisoner; I asked him how he came by the pot; he said he knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120013"></xptr>nothing about it. I got him as far as the watch-house; he was very much in liquor. I left him in charge of another while I went and informed Mrs. Redfearn. I only found one pot, that was in his hat.</p>

            . The prisoner was left in the watchhouse with me; he said, he had something to communicate to me; he said if you will be my friend look behind the chair; you will find something; I pulled the chair out, and the pot fell down. Mrs. Redfearn came to the watchhouse; I told her the circumstance. The first pot was found in his hat, the second behind the chair in the watchhouse, when only he and I were together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much intoxicated; I went into the Blue Boar to have something to drink. I do not know how I came by the pots; I did not know that I had any thing about me.</p>

                  </hi> I am a dredgerman, and live in Windmill-court, High-street, Lambeth. On Thursday night, 27 the Jan., about half-past seven o'clock I was at the Cross-keys, Fore-street, Lambeth—I saw Oakley, May, and Deacon there—about twenty minutes to nine, I saw all the prisoners against Mash's barges, at Millbank—they had three boats, and were in a barge getting coals, and putting them into their boats—I was in a boat alongside, getting two or three coals—I had no right to them—the Thames-police boat came up—the prisoners made heir escape up a plank, on to the timber, alongside the coal<lb></lb>wharf, and out into the road—there was no mud between the barges and where they had to land—I had known them all before—they had baskets to get the coals out with—I was left there—Edward White had been in the boat with me—he escaped, I was taken—as soon as I got to the police-ship I made a statement to the inspector—I did not tell him about White—White was using one of May's baskets—it was a white one, and had a blue mark on it—the boats they had were May's, Vernon's, and Beadle's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, in Stingo-lane, New-road. On the evening of 2nd Aug., about half past 10 or a quarter to 11 o'clock, I was in my cart at my door—I was just going to drive three or four doors off, when a party of three or four men came along, and began swearing at me in a very dreadful manner—one of them stopped the pony, and he rather reared up and went on the pavement and obstructed the pathway—I jumped off the cart, and said, if they insulted me I should lock them up—thereupon one of them took hold of my whip and threatened to break it, however I got it from him, and got on the cart again—I then said, "You Irish vagabonds, you ought to be locked up"—Haley on that got oft the cart, collared me, and pulled me off—I woidd not positively swear to Haley being the one that pulled me off the cart, but it is my firm conviction it was him—I was a great deal agitated at the time, I could not swear to the man who held the horse by the head—when I was pulled off the cart, Haley took the whip and broke it in three or four pieces—I then collared him, and retained him in my grasp—there was a crowd of persons round at the time—I found my watch out of my pocket, hanging by the chain, about five minutes afterwards—the witness Palmer cased out to me, "Mr. James, I think you have lost your watch, then is man running away"—I then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185608180098"></xptr>
               <p>found that my watch was gone, and the guard was broken—Haley grasped me by the handkerchief, and twisted it round as hard as he could twist it, and put his knuckles in my throat—my skin was broken in five or six places, and I lost a very small quantity of blood—I gave Haley into custody—I have not got my watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 12, Stingo-lane, New-road. I saw Mr. James in his cart, near his own door—I heard Haley insult him—I saw him make a snatch at his Albert chain; the watch fell out of Mr. James's pocket, and hung down—I ran to him, lifted it up, and gave it into his hand, and said, "Take care, Mr. James, or you will lose your watch"—there was a man at the horse's head preventing it from going on—I cannot say who that man was—I saw another man jump on the cart, catch hold of Mr. James, and pull him out—I do not know who that man was—previous to his being pulled out of the cart, Haley caught hold of the end of his whip, pulled it out of his hand, and broke it in three or four places—Mr. James then caught hold of Haley, and Haley caught hold of him by the throat, and his companions also—he twisted his cravat in order to tighten it about his throat—I saw a man run away, he appeared to be an associate of the others; he appeared to have something in his hand, and I called out, "Mr. James, I think that man has got your watch"—I afterwards saw Haley taken into custody.</p>

Q.</hi> You say you heard Mr. James insulted, what was the insult? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say, there was such a volley of abuse; it would not be fit to state it in Court—I cannot remember it—I heard Mr. James call them Irish vagabonds—it was immediately after that that they pulled him out of the cart—he also said he would lock them up for breaking his whip—at the time of the scuffle, Mr. James had hold of Haley, and Haley was holding him, and the other men also trying to got Haley away—there were five men round Mr. James at that time—I was standing by my window, pro<lb></lb>tecting</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside in the neighbourhood of the Yorkshire Stingo. On the night of 2nd August, I saw the prosecutor in his cart near his own door—I wan close to it—I could not get into the baker's shop on account of the horse being pushed on the pavement by one of these men—it was Gorman, he had hold of the horse by the head—Haley was at the side of the cart—he pulled Mr. James by the side of the collar, and the watch guard was in his hand, and he pulled him nearly out of the cart—Mr. James recovered himself a little, and Haley took his whip out of his hand and broke it—two or three of them then got Mr. James out of the cart—I was afraid they would strangle him—I went and got a policeman—I saw one of the men take something from Mr. James's pocket, I cannot say what it was; and one of them, I believe Haley, said, "<hi rend="italic">Cut</hi> it!"—and the man ran away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There were a great number of people there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A great number—the men that had hold of Mr. James looked working men—it was a man dressed like Gorman who had hold of the horse—I would not positively swear to him—I had never seen him before—I should be very sorry to swear positively to either of them; but I know that one of them handed something to another of them, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Cut</hi> it, <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> it!"—there were four or five of them round Mr. James, and I was afraid they would strangle him—he was then struggling with Haley, they were struggling vio<lb></lb>lently—he was very excited; he had hold of two of them by the collar.</p>

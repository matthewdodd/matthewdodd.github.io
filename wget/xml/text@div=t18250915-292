I had a time-keeper on the mantle piece - it was safe when I went out at six o'clock, in the evening of the 5th of September - I returned soon after one, and it was gone - a pane of glass was broken in the upper sash, fronting the fastening of the window - I know it was fastened when we went out, as my wife went to fasten it. I went on Hawkins' bed along with him, because there were two women in the house, who could not go to bed - I was sober - when we had been on the bed about three quarters of an hour, we heard a knock; he got up and went down - I do not know any thing else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go to amuse yourself at Bartholomew-fair? A. Yes; my wife is not here - the prisoner lived in the house with me, and he was at the fair, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HAWKINS. I keep the house - Sheen lodged with me, and the prisoner also. On the evening of the 5th of September, about six o'clock, I went with my wife and Sheen to the fair - I saw the time-keeper on the mantelshelf in the front parlour - I saw Mrs. Sheen fasten the sash down with a thing that goes across, and keeps it down - the back door was fastened - we went out and fastened the street door - we returned about one o'clock, and found a pane of glass had been cut on the outside, and some person had put their hand in and opened the window, which was left open - Mrs. Sheen had left the tinder box on the table - we found it was there, but the steel had been thrown down - I went to my room and got a light - I heard a knock at the door about two o'clock in the morning - I went down and saw the prisoner, and said, "Philpot, you have been home before, and taken the time-piece from the mantel-shelf" - he said, "I have not, I can bring witnesses to prove I have been at the fair all day;" he then went away but in consequence of what Mr. Hollis, my neighbour, said, I followed, and overtook him about two hundred yards from my house - I took hold of him, and he said, "Hawkins, I will tell you all about it;" I said, "It is no matter what you tell me, here is the watchman, and I will give charge of you;" he put his hand into his pocket and took out the time-piece, which he gave to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not go away from the house? A. Yes, because I refused to let him in - I did not agree with him to come again the next day, but he said, he should call - he was sober, and so was I - I had had something to drink, he did not tell me he had been home tipsy, and had taken the time-piece in mistake, and was going to put it back again.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 6th of September, I saw Hawkins and the prisoner - I took the time piece - the prisoner appeared pretty sober; he gave no account of how he got it - Hawkins asked how he came to take it - he said, he had taken it and was very sorry - he hoped he would forgive him, and he would give him a week's wages to make it up.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

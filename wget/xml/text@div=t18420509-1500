                  </hi>. I live in Chancit-place, High-street, Shadwell. On Saturday night, about-six o'clock, I went into the Paviors' Arms public-house with two mates—I called for a pint of beer—the prisoner was there—I had three half-crowns and a few halfpence in my pocket—I put them in my waistcoat-pocket—the prisoner saw where I put them—she came up to me and asked for a drop of beer—I gave her some—she sat down and asked if I had any halfpence to buy tobacco—I said I had, but not for her—she <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her hand into my waistcoat-pocket, took out the three half-crowns, and put them into her mouth—I am sure of that—I turned round, and made a plunge after her—she went towards the door—I caught her, and said I would have my money or I would give her in charge—she said she had not the money, and she had got the money in her mouth at the time—my mate went, and in about ten minutes brought in a policeman—the prisoner sat on the opposite side with a woman, a companion of hers—she had the opportunity of giving the money to her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you ask me to sit down by your side? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not know whether you were in liquor—there were two young men standing by the side of me—there was no girl in my company.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in this public-house—I pulled the prisoner's hand out of the prosecutor's pocket—I cannot say whether she had any money in her hand at the time—one side of her cheek was very much swollen, and by her speech I perceived there was something in her mouth—she gave me a blow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> As we were drinking in the Golden Eagle, the prosecutor came in with another man, and asked me to have something to drink; he paid for a quartern of gin, and two or three pots of beer, I saw no more of him till between seven and eight o'clock; I sat down in front of the bar, they asked me to drink, and I did; he said, "Jane, I will go home with you;" I said I did not mind; as he was going he said he had lost three half-crowns, he would give me in charge, he sent Yetten for a policeman; the prosecutor staid with me while he was gone, and the other man ran away; I saw no more of him, I was searched and nothing found.</p>

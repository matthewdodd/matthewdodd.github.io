I have been in the force seven years—I was on duty at the Crystal Palace, on Saturday, 9th June, in plain clothes—I had three constables under me; they were also in plain clothes—there was a fancy-fair there that day, for the Warehousemen's and Clerks' Schools—there was a great number of people there—the fair was held in the centre transept, in the large open part, in the centre of the place, right opposite the great orchestra—I know Lady Emily Peel's stall—it was on the right as your back was towards the grand orchestra—the fair was before you—there were two openings to the fair, one to the right and the other to the left—Lady Peel's stall was at the further end of the right-hand entrance—I saw the prisoner that day—I first saw her about ten minutes or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186007090104"></xptr>
               <p>a quarter after 4—I saw her in front of Lady Peel's stall—from the manner in which I saw her moving about, ✗ her, and watched her—I saw her go up to the stall, and, after looking at several articles, she took hold of this D'oyley, which was pinned to the stall—she drew the pin out, and on a lady coming round in front of the stall to replace some articles, she hap<lb></lb>pened to come close up to the left hand side of the prisoner, and the prisoner replaced the pin again in the D'oyley, and attached it to the stall, and as soon as the lady had turned her back to go round the counter again the pri<lb></lb>soner took the pin out, and took the article, crumpled it up in both her hands, placed it somewhere in front of her dress, and, turning round, she walked about ten or a dozen yards, and on returning again to near the centre of the stall, there were two or three pairs of gloves or mittens—the prisoner then took this pair and placed them in her dress in the same manner as the D'oyley, and I believe in the same place—she then turned round and walked towards the orchestra—when she arrived at the outside of the fair, she took a piece of paper from her reticule, and in the piece of paper she rolled these articles up, and put them in her reticule—she then turned towards the north end, and I spoke to Stephen Baldwin, whom I found just outside the fair—he had been with me before, but we had left each other about a quarter of an hour before—he was not watching with me—I spoke to him, and directed him to follow me, and we went up to the prisoner—I stopped her, tapping her on the shoulder—this is the article I spoke of; this is not the piece of paper; this is the reticule—I had seen her take a piece of paper from her reticule, roll the articles in it, and place the paper in the reticule after she had rolled up the articles—when I went up to her, I asked her what she had got in the reticule—she said, "What I have got there is my own property"—she had not taken them out of the reticule then—I said, "Where did you get them from"—she said, "I bought them"—I asked her where, and she said, "In the bazaar"—I told her I was a sergeant of police, and she must consider herself in my custody—I said, "You could not have bought them, I saw you take them off a stall; come back, and show me the stall where you did buy them"—she said, "For God's sake don't take me back; I will tell you the truth about them"—I said, "What is that? you have told me one story"—she said, "I picked them up there" pointing to a spot within about twelve feet from where she was standing—I said, "You could not have picked them up there, for I saw you myself take this from off the stall of Lady Emily Peel"—she then said, "O, my God, what shall I do? I will give you any amount of money if you don't take me—I will leave you my gold watch and chain for the worth of the articles"—I said I could not take anything; I must do my duty, and take her to the station, which I did—Baldwin heard the conversation, every word—he went to the station with me—when I saw the prisoner unpin this article it was on the left-hand corner of the stall—the prisoner was between 40 or 50 yards from that stall when I stopped her—I had never lost sight of her during that time—she did not pick up anything while I was following her—she never stooped from the time she left the stall, until the time I took hold of her—I am quite sure that there was no one at that part of Lady Emily Peel's stall who could have shown her the things—I took the prisoner to the station, and then to the Norwood station—I took the reticule from her and opened it in the palace—I found these articles rolled up in paper in the reticule—when she was taken to the station there was a gold watch and chain found—the chain was on her neck and the watch was in her pocket—I saw a purse with two shil<lb></lb>lings, a sixpence, and two railway tickets in the porte-monnaie—that was all the money I saw—she gave her name and address correctly.</p>

               <p>about 9; I have not seen him again—I saw the prisoner so close that I could not make a mistake—I don't believe I have made one or two mistakes as to the mode in which she took the property—I had said on the first examination that the article was pinned, and I was asked by Mr. Elliott, the Magistrate, to describe exactly what I saw—I have no recollection of saying that I wanted to amend my evidence—I believe I did not say I wanted to add to my evidence or to amend it—I will not swear I did not ask to be permitted to amend my evidence—on the first occasion I said I saw her take it, and Mr. Perry, the Magistrate's clerk, said, "How did she take it"—I said by unpinniug it—the statement I wanted to correct was that I saw her take it—I said that without mentioning the pinning or unpinning at the moment—I did not say I saw her snatch it—it was about half way through the case that I asked to be permitted to correct my statement—Lady Emily Peel was not examined on the first occasion—I was asked on the first occasion why I did not mention the unpinning before—I have no recollection of asking on the second examination to be allowed to correct my evidence—I won't swear I did not—I did not pull her purse out of the reticule before I got to the station—I did not take the purse out at any place; she gave it me out—I said, "Have you not got anything else in your pocket"—it was in her reticule at the orchestra, and she took it out of the reticule and put it into her pocket—I know it was in her reticule because I saw her take it out—she afterwards gave it me out of her pocket at the Crystal Palace station—I said the reticule contained a greasy piece of paper and a purse—I meant that it was taken out at the Crystal Palace—when she took the purse out I did not say, "I know who that purse belongs to; it belongs to some one else"—I did not say I knew who it belonged to—I did not know that it was not her own property—I did not say I knew to whom it belonged—it was at the Norwood station that the gentleman came in who told me about the purse—the gentleman was not confronted with the prisoner—Sergeant Marsh heard the gentleman make that statement, I believe—I believe Baldwin heard it; he was near enough—I did not say to the inspector "Here she is; we have got her at last"—we went into a private room at the palace—I examined her handkerchief; I did not make any charge about that because her name was on it—she was handed to the female searcher at the Norwood station—I did not say to the female searcher, "I know she has several purses about her; for I have seen her pick several pockets"—I did not say I knew she had several purses upon her—I did tell her in Sergeant Marsh's presence to be careful, as from the manner I had seen her moving about the crowd I suspected she had got some other things about her—I never mentioned watches neither in presence of the female searcher nor Marsh—in alluding to her own watch I might have mentioned something about a watch, but not of her stealing a watch—I said to Marsh "She offered me her watch and her chain and her earrings"—and she offered them to Marsh also—I swear I heard her offer them to Marsh—I might have said "She may have other purses about her"—to the best of my recollection I did not—I don't believe that I said she had several other purses—Marsh was of the same opinion as myself; he told the female searcher to be very careful—I never mentioned a word about the purse till the gentleman told me about his niece—I don't believe I said in presence of the female searcher and Marsh that she had other purses about her—I don't believe I did or that I did not—I can't say one way or the other.</p>

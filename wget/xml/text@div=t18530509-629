                  </hi>. I am assistant to William Williams and Thomas Clap-ham, jewellers, of No. 13 and 14, Strand. On Friday, 22nd April, the male prisoner came to buy a plain gold ring—he asked also to look at some ruby rings, and three trays of gem rings were shown to him on one large tray, containing about 300 rings—he did not purchase any, but wished some to be sent next morning to an hotel in Leicester-square for his wife to see—the rings were sent next morning, and while they were away both the prisoners came in, and wished to see some rings—they purchased a guard ring—I showed them some gem rings, among which were some diamond rings—they examined the trays on the side of the counter for about ten minutes—this ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) has been the property of my employers; it is worth about 102. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am able to say I have not sold it--Mr. Clapham and Mr. Williams are the only other persons who have the power to sell; they are not</p>

On Saturday, 23rd April, about 1 o'clock in the day, I was in Bishopsgate-street, and saw the female prisoner—she went to the shop of Mr. Baker, a pawnbroker, in Houndsditch, and offered this ring in pledge—from a communication I had with the person there it was refused—she came out, and shortly joined the male prisoner, who was by the shop; they walked on together for a short distance, and then separated; the man went in the direction of Aldgate, and the woman crossed to the opposite side—the male prisoner went to Mr. Baker's other shop, in Aldgate—I went in after him, and saw him offer this ring there—I told the shopman my suspicions, and he gave the ring over to me—I took the male prisoner into custody, and asked him how he accounted for the ring—he said it was his wife's, and he bought it at a shop on the right hand side of the Strand, and that he would take me to the place—this was in Aldgate—Messrs. Williams and Clapham's shop is on the left hand side of the Strand, going from there—I was not satisfied, and took him to the station—I searched him, and found on him a gold watch, which has been identified.</p>

On Saturday, 23rd April, I was with Balchin, and saw the two prisoners in Aldgate—the male prisoner went into Mr. Baker's shop; Balchin went in after him, and came out with him, and with the ring in his hand—I took the female prisoner, and told her she was charged on suspicion of stealing a ring—she said it was her ring, and she had had it about six months—I took her to the station house, and asked her for what she had got—she gave me a bunch of keys, and a ring from her finger—she gave her address No. 32, Pimlico-pier, but there is no such place—she said it was in a new street, and I found it was No. 32, Pulford-street, Pimlico-pier—I went there, searched the room, and found a quantity of wearing apparel and duplicates, but nothing relating to this charge—I opened the box with the keys the female prisoner gave me—when at the station house the male prisoner threw his coat away and got away—he was recaptured in about three minutes, but his coat has not been found since; it was picked up by somebody.</p>

I was not a minute after her; I brought the candle down stairs and found she was gone. I asked the people of the house whether she was there, they said no, she was just gone out of the house. I went towards Whitechapel to see if I could find her, I went about a hundred yards farther, I found my money was all gone, it was in a canvas bag, to the amount of eight guineas in gold and silver of different coins, and amongst it was a crown piece that I had taken for a cask of beer of Mrs. Buzzard. I went back to the people of the house and told them that I had been robbed of my money; they said they were very sorry, but they did not know the person. I took the candle and went up to see if it was on the bed; it was not. I went there in about half an hour afterwards, and asked if the person that I had been with was there, they said no; I went about the streets two hours to see if I could see her any where, but could not see her. I went to Lambeth street office the next morning, I met with Mr. Griffiths, I told him I had been robbed of my money in George yard; he went with me to the house and asked the people if they knew the person I was with last night, they said they did not know; we met with her in Crown court, Wentworth street. In searching her we found to the amount of eight pounds three shillings; and amongst it was the crown piece that I had taken that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner, is she the woman. A. I am sure she is the woman; I had never seen her before, but I am certain she is the person.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth street office. I went to this house in George yard on on the 26th of February, and from there I went to No. 5, Crown court, Wentworth street; there I found the prisoner and another young woman in the room; I asked the prosecutor which was the woman that he complained had robbed him; he pointed out the prisoner. I asked her if she knew any thing about this man's money, she said no; I searched her, found in her pocket two guineas, three half guineas, seven seven shilling pieces, one dollar, called a crown piece, thirty four shillings and three sixpences. I told her I expected that to be the man's money that she had robbed him of; she said no, it was her own money I searched her room I found some duplicates, eight or nine, and one of the duplicates is on the day the robbery was committed; that day she had pledged a gown for twelve shillings; I told her it was very odd she should pledge a gown for twelve shillings when she had got eight pound odd about her; she made an excuse that she did not like the pattern; I desired the prosecutor to look at the money; he did; he pointed out this dollar to be one he had taken on that day; he told me he could take me to the lady that paid it him in Jewry street; I went with him to the lady and shewed her the dollar; the lady said she had paid him the dollar; he described to me that he had lost two guineas, he could not account for the half guineas or the seven shilling pieces; he said in different gold and silver, but he did not account what the pieces were that were taken on that day; there is in the whole eight pounds three shillings; the prosecutor said he had lost in the whole eight guineas.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you, my lord - this gentleman I met with, about seven o'clock in the evening; we went to a house and I went on a bed with him; I knew nor saw any more of his money than three shillings he gave me; he came down with me and shook hands with me, and bid me good night; I had not the least idea that he had any money to lose. The next morning this gentleman came to my apartment, and finding money in my pocket, which I had made a reserve for my children, which I have had by different men; I am an unfortunate woman in the street, I am sorry to say it; the money was taken from me.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner twenty-five years; I bought those steps of him one day in the beginning of May; I asked if they were his own, he said they belonged to a poor man in distress, who employed him to sell them, and he said he lived in Shoe Lane. I put them out at my door for sale, and in about a week the prosecutor claimed them. I refused to give them up without an officer, who came and took them. I told him I bought them of the prisoner.</p>

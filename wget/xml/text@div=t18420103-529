                  </hi>. I am a corn-dealer, and live in Red Lion-street, Whitechapel. I knew a person named John Taylor—he was horsekeeper to Mr. Levy, whose stable adjoins mine—about the 2nd of October I saw Taylor and Mr. Levy—I was present at Taylor's trial in this Court—I know the prisoner well—he occupied a stable in Black Horse-yard, George-yard, Whitechapel—I found a sack of oats which I had lost, in the prisoner's stable—they were my own oats and my own sack, and they were stolen from me that very morning, which was, I think, about the 2nd of October—it was Dexter's stable, and the prisoner rented them of</p>

               <p>Dexter—Levy was the other prosecutor—I went with Levy to the stable, I saw no one there—the door was locked—I pushed it open, and saw my own sack standing there full—I went into the stable, and saw the prisoner standing before me—I said, "You are a pretty sort of man, how came you by this sack of oats?"—he said, "I bought them," or some such slight answer—I was in the act of taking a knife from my pocket to cut the string, and while so doing, the prisoner, who had a pair of slippers on and no stockings, took the slippers off and ran away—I never saw him again till he was taken—Levy followed him, but he got off—I found another tactful up stairs in the loft—I examined it, and found it was my own tack, if not the oats that were in it—the two sacks were found in Dex<lb></lb>ter's stable—I am quite sure the sacks were mine, and am pretty sure the oats were mine, and they were got away through the connexion my man bad with other persons—I lost one sack that morning, but there wert many sacks lost before that.</p>

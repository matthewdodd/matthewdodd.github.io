On the 3d of January, between seven and eight in the morning. I received information, Clark and me stopped the prisoner in the watchhouse in the docks; I told him I wanted to search him, I had some reason he had some property about him; I found some wool concealed in his hat, some in this pockets, some in his boots, and some in his breeches. He said he was very sorry, and hoped we should take no further notice of it. I produce the wool; I have had it ever since; it is worth two shillings. In taking him to the police office he told me he had taken it out of different bales.</p>

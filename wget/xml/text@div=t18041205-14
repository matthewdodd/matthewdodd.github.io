               <p>Q. Had you in your house missed a ten-pound Feversham note? - A. We had, on Wednesday the 28th, it was missed from a drawer in a box, after having been posted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. With respect to its being missed, did you miss it, or one of your clerks? - A. I know nothing of the taking of the note; in consequence of its being missed, on Thursday morning I went from Finchley to the office, (I was informed by a junior partner) to the prisoner; I told him that I had reason to believe that he had taken that note, and that every one in the house knew of a Feversham note being missing; he at first denied it; my partner, Mr. Burgess, was in the room with me, I turned and said to him, will you go and fetch the man who says he gave it to him; while he was gone, he confessed to me that he had taken it; I still told him the man was coming who would prove it to his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had taken it? - A. He said he found it on the ground, very near the place where this box stands; I then charged him with having the ten one-pound notes that had been given for it; I said, most likely you have got this ten pounds in your pocket now; he said, no, I have not, sir, I have them in my desk; he looked into his desk, and delivered them to me, the ten one-pound notes, which I have now; he begged that we would forgive him, that he had got a wife and three children.</p>
               <p>JOHN M'DONALD sworn. - Examined by Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050016"></xptr>Knapp. I am a clerk in Messrs. Williams and Co.'s house.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of this ten-pound Feversham note? - A. It was missing on the 28th of November, from a box where they are put after passing the cash-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay a Feversham ten-pound note? - A. I did pay one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a ten-pound Feversham bank-bill in that box? - A. Yes; I took them out of that box to count them, on Wednesday morning, there were twenty-two, and in the evening there were twenty-two.</p>
               <p>Q. And on Wednesday, the same day, you found one missing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On finding one missing, did you acquaint your master? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, after that, see that note again in your house? - A. I cannot say that was the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a note that was produced by a person of the name of Rust? - A. I saw it at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At what time on Wednesday morning did you count the notes? - A. About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you find? - A. Twenty-two, and the second time we found only 22; there were 23 in the cash-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your cash-book here? - A. It is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. You yourself never counted 23 in that box? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at every examination you found no more than 22; do you, sir, mean to state from your own knowledge of any Feversham bank note being missing? - A. Not from my own knowledge.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a waiter at the Cock and Woolpack eating-house, Finch-lane, Cornhill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, he came to our house upon this day week; he gave me a note to go to the house of Messrs. Williams', in Birchin-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there? - A. The clerk who gave me the notes in change.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Medley.) Is that the person you paid the notes to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Rust.) What did you do with the notes that you received from that gentleman? - A. I counted them up, they were all ones, to the amount of 10 l. I took them home, I kept them till Mr. Greaves was in the parlour, and then I gave him the notes; he gave me 6 d. to get a pint of beer and told me to keep the change.</p>
               <p>- MEDLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are a clerk to Messrs. Williams's, do you know this drawer where the Feversham Bank-notes are kept? - A. I do; I believe it will be necessary to explain this business a little. After the notes are paid, they are put on a file, and then a clerk takes them off that file; they are then taken to a person who writes them off into the cash-book, and this clerk, M'Donald, takes them off and posts them in the ledger; the next is, they are posted and marked off in the cash-book; they are marked off the day after, to see whether the number paid is the number posted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Mr. Williams.) Q. Do you know any thing of this being one of the notes? - A. It has been, I believe, in that box; the whole that is known of that note is, that Medley paid it to Rust.</p>
               <p>Medley. It was presented to me for payment on the 29th of November, I believe Rust is the person that presented it; I asked him how he would have it; he said, in small notes; I paid him in small notes; I asked him who he received it from; he said, he received it from Denton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you seen this drawer to see whether there were any Feversham Bank-notes in it? - A. I do not think that I had, I was not in the Office; this was originally paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any knowledge of its ever having been in this drawer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you ever see it before Mr. Rust gave it you? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Rust.) Q. Can you speak to that note, whether that is the note you received from the prisoner? - A. I cannot really say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Medley.) Q. No other note was tended to you but by Rust? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you pay more than one to Rust? - A. I believe not to Rust.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Rust.) Q. How came you to say when you received the ten one-pound notes for the Feversham note, you had it from Mr. Denton? - A. I generally say from my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from your master or from the prisoner? - A. The prisoner told me to go to that house and get small notes.</p>
               <p>Q (To Medley.) What is your department at this Office? - A. I generally pay at the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. You have nothing at all to do with the writing off in the cash-book or posting in the ledger-whether, in the course of your duty, it came in the scope of your duty, to write it off in the cash-book or post it off in the ledger? - A. I cannot swear positively yes or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you on Wednesday or Tuesday counted the Feversham Bank-notes in the drawer? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether you saw this Feversham Bank-note before Rust brought it you? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then there is an end to the case.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Medley.) Q. This note, prior to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050017"></xptr>being tendered at your house, it was due and unsatisfied? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Perhaps it never was in your house as you know - if it comes in your house you pay it? - A. To be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in your house before it came from Rust? - A. I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no Feversham Bank-notes before they come to be paid? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. It could not have come into your house, unless it comes to be paid? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever re-issue these notes yourself? - A. Never, I suppose they re-issue them.</p>
               <p>Q. What becomes of them when they come to you? - A. We send them to the country bankers as vouchers for what we have paid; but if we do pay any, and cannot produce them, we cannot charge them with the note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I shall prove to your Lordship, that this note never was in the possession of that house till Rust brought it there; and, in the first place, there is no evidence that it is the note belonging to Messrs. Williams and Co.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Mr. Williams.) Q. Are you partly sure, that, in the conversation you had with the prisoner, he confessed having this ten-pound Feversham note? - A. I am perfectly-sure, in the confession of the prisoner to me, there was a Feversham ten-pound note mentioned by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. The prisoner had lived with you for as many as fourteen years, whether he had not borne an exceeding good character? - A. Certainly, he was taken in by my partners.</p>

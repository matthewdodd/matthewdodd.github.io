                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, at 52, Fenchurch-street, in the parish of All-Hallows Staining. On 3rd Aug. my wife and I went to bed last, about a quarter to eleven or eleven o'clock—my house and property were quite safe—I was called up at a quarter to six, and found the sitting-room in a very disordered state—it adjoins a landing, where the window was broken open—the street-door was also open—I missed the property stated from that room—four locks were broken there—this bowl of a meersaaum pipe is mine—I had been smoking it in the sitting-room the evening before—Bascoville is my wife's nephew—it is twelve months or two years since I saw him—he knew my premises well—he used to visit there—I have no doubt that he knew that I kept my cash-box in that sitting-room.</p>

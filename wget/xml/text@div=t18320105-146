            . I am a labourer, at Mr. Bews, Highgate. On the morning of the 3rd of December I saw the coach going to town; the prisoner looks like a man whom I saw hanging at the hind part of it - I saw the prosecutrix sitting at the back; the prisoner jumped from the back of the coach into the road - he then jumped into the path and ran, I suppose, one hundred and fifty yards; I went the nearest way after him, through some fields, and found the prisoner in custody of a gardener - I am sure it was the same person that I saw get down.</p>

               <p>Q. On the night of the 26th did Jones apply to any of you for some meat for supper - A. Yes, between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Jones sober at that time - A. No, a little tipsy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the meat given to Jones - A. Yes, and he began eating it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he cut it - A. He had the meat in his left hand and a knife in his right to cut his meat, he asked for some salt; Langstrom was at that time laying in his hammock with his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased say any thing to the prisoner upon his asking for salt - A. He begged he would make no noise, said he was tired and wanted to go to sleep. The prisoner then took him by the hair of his head and shook him in his hammock.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time had the prisoner his meat and his knife in his hands - A. He had the meat; I did not see the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen him lay it down, I suppose - A. No, upon the prisoner seizing him by the hair of his head, the deceased jumped out of his hammock and struck Jones by the side of his face; the prisoner made a blow at his body at the same time; I did not see the knife, that was directly after the deceased struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the deceased say - A. That moment the blow was given him, he said, Lord have mercy upon me, I am a dead man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the blood flow from the wound directly - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say why he had done it or how he came to do it - A. The prisoner said he had done it in a passion.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a knife was it - A. I do not know what became of the knife, it was a sailor's knife, a clasp knife. The deceased was taken to the hospital, he lived about two days afterwards, I belive.</p>
               <p>MR. BUTLER. Q. You are the house pupil of the London Hospital - A. I am, this man was brought to the Hospital from on board the ship, the wound was in his belly, with the bowels protruding through the wound in the side of the belly; he lived forty-eight hours after he had received the wound; he died of that wound.</p>

He said he was in his hammock with his wife endeavouring to go to sleep, the prisoner was making a noise near his bed, he begged him to be quiet, he jumped out of his hammoc and struck the prisoner, he said there had not been a word before that time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called six witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Edwards, of 12, Ampton<lb></lb>place, Gray's Inn-road—the prisoner was in my service on 6th November—on that day, about half-past two o'clock, I was in the kitchen—she was on her knees scrubbing the kitchen floor—I heard a cry like the cry of an infant—I asked her if she heard that noise—she said, "No"—I asked her a time or two and she said, "No" each time—then I asked her if it was her stomach—she said, "Yes"—I heard the noise two or three times—in consequence of that and other matters I noticed, I asked her, in the course of the afternoon, if she had not had a miscarriage—she said, "Yes"—from five o'clock to half-past I sent a message to Mr. Watkins the doctor—he arrived at a quarter to seven—next day she said that when I heard the noise in the kitchen the child was born, and that she put it into the pail-nothing further—when she was scrubbing the floor she had a pail with water in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 21, Euston Road—on 6th November I was called in to see the prisoner—I examined her—she had been recently delivered—I inquired of her what had become of the child—I found that she required medical attention at once, which I paid to her—after that, in reply to repeated inquiries, she said she had placed the child in the ash pit—I went there at once and found it there—it was exceedingly cold, perfectly black from the cinder dust, but alive—it was lying on its side; the head turned round towards the knees; the knees turned upwards, and the cinders lying in a heap over it, the feet being four inches below; the head being near the centre of the heap, was about ten or eight' inches below—the dust completely covered the head—the whole body was completely concealed from sight—I took it out—it was still alive, and lived till about 6 o'clock the next morning but one—I found, on poet mortem examination, a clot of blood on the brain, and to that I attribute the death—that clot of blood might be from various causes—I think the death had not arisen from being put under the cinders—I had no reason to suppose so—it received injury by the exposure to cold, and from having no food, rather than from inhaling any dust—I carefully passed my finger along the throat, and there was not the least dust.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the Rev. Mr. Butterfield, of Great Brastead, Essex—before my marriage to that gentleman I had been named to a Mr. Richardson, and had by the first marriage a daughter lamed Harriett, if now alive she would be thirty-six years of age—on the 5th of April last, I saw her lying dead at 34, Forbes Road, Penge—in 875, my daughter Harriett was staying with my nephew Mr. Thomas Hincksman, at 55, Heygate Street, Walworth Road—his wife was a Mrs. Rhodes—she had been married before I believe, and by her first marriage as the mother of the two female prisoners—I believe the two male prisoners re brothers—in 1875, I learnt that Louis Staunton, was paying his addresses to my daughter—at that time she was possessed of about 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—did not think she was in a fit state to marry, and tried to procure her a ward in Chancery, and herself declared unfit to manage her own affairs, but was unsuccessful and my daughter was married to the prisoner Louis Staunton, on the 16th June, 1875, at Clapham—I was not present at the marriage—about three weeks after, I paid her a visit at 8, Loughborough "mark; my daughter opened the door and asked me in—I asked if her husband was at home—she said "Yes," and called "Louis, mamma is here" he came and we went into the dining-room—I did not see my daughter one, her husband was present—I asked my daughter if she was happy—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170004"></xptr>
               <p>she said "Pretty well, mamma middling"—I asked her husband why he did not keep a servant, and be told me he had advertised for one—I afterwards went upstairs with my daughter at his suggestion to see the house; when I came down I made some remark about the rooms not being all furnished, and then said "I must be going"—he told his wife to put on her hat and sea me off to the station, he came with us—I do not think I was in the house more than ten minutes—when I got to the station the train was coming up—I shook hands with both and wished them good-bye, when the train moved off Mr. Staunton took his hat off and I kissed my hand to my daughter; I never saw her alive again—there had been no quarrel or words of any kind—the next day or the day after I received a letter from Louis Staunton, enclosing one from my daughter—I have not been able to find those letters, though I have looked everywhere—I think I must have destroyed them—as near as I can remember she told me in that letter that her husband objected to my calling upon her, and she thought I had better not come as it would cause a disturbance between them—the letter from him was to tell me not to come again—it was a very rude insulting letter, telling me he would not have me go to the house again—I did not visit again, in consequence of those letters—I heard sometime in the following year that my daughter had had a boy—sometime in the following year I heard a statement about Alice Rhodes, and in consequence of that began to make inquiries about my daughter—in February of this year I saw Alice Rhodes, at the London Bridge Railway Station—I asked her where my daughter Harriet was—she said she did not know—I said "You must know where she is, you do know where she is," or something to that effect—she then said "Upon my word I do not know"—she afterwards said she was at Brighton with her husband and child—I asked her to give me her address; I noticed she had on a favourite brooch that had been given to my daughter twenty years ago—it was not of much value, but my daughter was fond of it—I said "You have got my daughter's brooch Alice"—she said "Yes, you can take it if you like, but she gave it me"—I said "I will not take it if she gave it you, but I really do not understand her giving it to you as it was her favourite brooch"—I asked her if my daughter was well—she said no, my daughter had been very ill, but was better now—I said "Will you give me the address of her medical man"—she said "Oh, I do not remember, but if you will give me your address I will send it to you," and I gave her my daughter's address where I was stopping then; I never heard from her—I continued to make inquiries after my daughter, and in consequence of some information given me by a charwoman in the Walworth Road, I went to Cudham, near Knockholt, a station on the South Eastern line—on my way there I met Mr. Patrick Staunton, near the ticket place at the South Eastern Railway Station—I saw him come from the train and told him I was going down to Cudham—I asked him where my daughter was, he said he did not know anything about her, and what was I going to Cudham for—I told him I should go and see the clergyman—he said "If you come to my house I will blow your brains out"—he also said "Damn your daughter, I know nothing about her," and went away—when I got to Halstead Station I inquired and found that Louis Staunton was living in the neighbourhood—I took a cab and drove to his house—Little Gray's Farm was the name of it—I got there about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, on the 5th March, 1877—I think it was five miles from the station—when I knocked at the door Mrs. Patrick Staunton answered it—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170005"></xptr>
               <p>asked to see Mrs. Staunton, my daughter—then Mr. Louis Staunton came along—he was in a great passion, and swore at me, and said I should not see her; he would not allow me to see her—I said "If you will only let me hear her voice or see her hand on the bannisters, I shall then go away content that she is in her proper place, with her husband"—he was going to strike me with a knife, and Mrs. Patrick Staunton said "No, don't hit her"—that was in a little room on the right hand side, going in from the door, where they appeared to have been dining—he called me a dirty old bitch, and other names—then I begged of Mrs. Staunton to let me see my daughter, and told her "Some day you will want to see your children and you will be denied"—she said "Your daughter is well cared for"—I am not quite sure whether it was Mrs. Staunton who opened the front door, but they bustled me out as soon as they could; pushed me out—Louis and Mrs. P. Staunton were the only persons present; the cabman was standing outside the door—when I got into the fly he pointed out to me a Dr. Creasy who was coming by—I made some enquiry of Dr. Creasy, and then came home—shortly afterwards I made an application to the Magistrate at Marlborough Street police-court—I afterwards went down to Sevenoaks, and on 9th April I went to Bromley, before the Magistrates in Court there, but I was unable to get any information about my daughter—on Sunday, the 15th, I received this telegram from a Mrs. Urridge, in consequence of which I went at once to 34, Forbes Road, Penge—(I had been several times to Mrs. Urridge, she was the landlady of Little Gray's Farm)—I there saw my daughter lying dead—when I last saw my daughter at the end of June, 1875, she was in very good health; she was always in good health; she had very good general health—she was always well dressed, very fond of dress, and knew how to dress—she was a very clean girl indeed; very particular in her person—she was a temperate person, not at all given to drink—I won't say she did not take a glass of ale at her dinner, she was. not in the habit of drinking to excess—this photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which was taken of her about nine months before her marriage, fairly represents her at that time—when I saw her on the Sunday she was in her coffin—I noticed a great change in her, apart from the change from life to death—we always treated her more like a child, because she was so simple—there was no change whatever in her habits as to cleanliness up to time I last saw her; she was looking old, very much older than she really was, and looking very dirty and very miserable; greatly changed; in fact I scarcely knew her—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my daughter's handwriting; this is her ordinary mode of spelling—she had the opportunity of being educated, but she was not able to avail herself of it—these three other letters were received; this one is from Mr. Staunton, I think—I remember these three letters being received; this one is from Mrs. Patrick Staunton—this is my laughter's letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Friday. My own darling,—I write these few lines hoping this will find you well. Will you be down on Sunday? if not, shall be disappointed. Hope to see you on Monday; if not, will you let me know which day you will be down, by Percy. It has been raining all ay. Will you bring me down peace ribon and frilling for my colour and selves? I hope to return to town with you soon. Percy is coming back to-morrow night, so I believe—Tommy is quite well; so good night, my dear, and God bless you. Will you let me know? I have not had clean flanel for a month. I have been here a month on Saturday; it is time I should be at home; my boots has wore out. From your affectionate wife, Harriett")</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. I was very much averse to the marriage from the first—the proceedings in lunacy with regard to my late daughter, were taken I believe at the end of 1874—I thought it was my petition but I understand it was my sou's, I was not aware of it at the time—I have since ascertained that it was my son's petition in his name for me; I remember that I made an abstract of the proceedings—I did not know that my daughter Harriett had made a voluntary settlement on my son of her money, till Mr. Straight read it in Court—I knew nothing of it before and 1 have not heard of it since—Mr. Straight read it and spoke to me about it. Mr. Straight <hi rend="italic">here stated that he did not read it.</hi>) I never heard from my daughter before her marriage that she wished to register that settlement, she never spoke to me on the subject of any settlement at all—she had been living with me prior to her marriage, but the last six months prior to her marriage she was living first in Heygate Street with her aunt Ellis, with whom she stayed till her aunt Ellis died, and then she went to live with Mrs. Hincksman—the house belonged to my sister Mrs. Ellis—Mrs. Hincksman is not my sister; she stayed with Mrs. Ellis four or five months—she ceased to live with me seven or eight months before her marriage, I am speaking to the best of my recollection, I do not think it could have been more—I remember that I made an affidavit in the lunacy petition—I do not remember what it stated; I do not remember stating that my daughter had occasional fits of violence—I have never stated to my knowledge that my daughter Harriett had always been of weak intellect and had a running of saliva from her mouth—I objected to that when the lawyer put it to me when the affidavit was read—I never remember her having saliva running from her month—I was net aware until you told me that I had sworn it, or I would not. have done so if I had known it—she was quick tempered, but quiet and harmless—I said in the affidavit" Believing her to be of unsound mind and unable to enter into any contract, I advised her not to marry; but when I endeavoured to reason with her on the subject she became very violent, and has always been excited when I have spoken to her on the subject, and has even threatened to kill me"—that is true; she did once threaten me—I verily believe she was of unsound mine and—incapable of managing her property—I know that my son Archibald has also made an affidavit, but I have never seen it—he is in Australia, at least he was some months ago—I don't know where he is at the present moment—she showed signs of violent temper to me when I spoke to her of marriage—I persuaded her not to marry; Drs. Tuke and Williams saw her, they reported her to be of sound mind—I say that she was hysterical—I did not say that on one occasion of an altercation I had with her she took out' a knife to me, I said a chair—that was a mistake of somebody's—if I said a knife before the Magistrate I must have confused it, I meant a chair—she took it up in a threatening way—the last communication I had with her after her marriage, after I last saw her, was the letter that has been produced—I only saw her on that one occasion after her marriage—the interview lasted about ten minutes; I had come from Essex—the meeting was quiet a pleasant and harmonious one—when I saw her previously was before her marriage—I saw her once afterwards, about three weeks—it must have been twelve mouths since 1 saw her previously—Mr. Staunton was present all the time of my last visit—my daughter answered the door—it was Mr. Staunton who spoke to me about a servant—we went into the dining" room, but Mr. Staunton was in a little conservatory close by—I con<lb></lb>sidered</p>

               <p>it was not right to have no servant—I did not speak angrily—I was only doing my duty as a mother—she had scalded her hand—when he told me he had advertised for a servant, I said no more—I then went upstairs—I said the bed-room wanted a bedstead, as there did not appear to be a room for the servant to sleep in—I said so to both; my daughter accompanied me over the house—it is a small house; I do not know that Alice Rbodes was with my daughter at her confinement—the brooch referred to is of very little value, but my daughter prized it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I made Mrs. Patrick Staunton's acquaintance before she was married, some years ago; before I knew of the' attachment of Louis Staunton to my daughter—I do not know how many children Mrs. Patrick had—I knew at the time she had been lodging at Loughborough Road she had children—I do not know how many—I do not say I had not seen my daughter for nearly twelve months prior to her marriage—I saw her in Chancery Lane in 1874—the marriage was on 16th June, 1875; before that she went to Mrs. Ellis' and remained till her death, and then she went to Mrs. Hincksman—the period of those visits extended over six months, perhaps more—she never wrote to me while staying with her aunt Ellis and Mrs. Hincksman; she could not write—she seldom or ever wrote—she was not a good hand at letter writing; she was a bad speller—she was always violent to me if I spoke of marriage—I did not want her to be married, she was not fit—I know nothing of her threatening my son Archibald, or of the pecuniary relationship between him and her it the time I took the proceedings in lunacy—she had not communicated with me about his being possessed of her money; I do not believe he knew my thing about it; he was not trustee—I do not know that he had the administration of her 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time of her marriage—I have never heard about it till I was cross-examined before—I never wrote a letter to my daughter after I paid the visit to her in the Loughborough. Road—I received a letter from her requesting me not to call, also one from Louis Staunton complaining of my conduct—I took active steps to discover her whereabouts after I heard of her confinement—that would be in March, 1876—Little Gray's Farm lies back from the road—there is only a small lawn in front, and then the roadway—I noticed part of a shoulder of mutton the table; it appeared as if some persons had partaken of a meal—it was small house—I do not remember saying, when in the house, that I believed my daughter was in a lunatic asylum—I do not remember Mrs. Patrick Staunton saying that that was a wicked thing of me to say, and at she had had dinner with my daughter that day (5th March), and that e was quite well—I will swear that I did not say to Mrs. Patrick Staunton "That is a lie," or "You are a liar"—I was in considerable anxiety and distress about my daughter—I cannot remember saying before the Magis<lb></lb>trate at Bromley that I begged Mrs. Patrick Staunton to let me see my daughter, or that I said anything about "One day you may want to see one of your children"—I recollect it was said, but not before the Magistrate—ten Patrick Staunton exhibited some anger towards me Mrs. Patrick said don't strike her."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at the Bromley Railway Station—I was there on the night of Thursday, 12th April—I remember seeing all the prisoners there that night—it was just as the train from Bickley was coming in due at 8.26—it might have been two minutes late, but I cannot say—one of the male prisoners spoke to me; I cannot say which—he asked me to ask the guard to keep the train, as he had got an invalid lady to go by the train—I was in the booking-office—I told him I could not do that—I then went outside the station—I saw the two male prisoners lifting a female out of a wagonette—I saw the female prisoners come through the booking-office—the lady was got into the booking-office by one man getting hold of each side of her and they lifted her down, when one of her slippers came off and I picked it up and gave it to one of the male prisoners—I do not know what he did with it—the lady was carried on to the platform—I took hold of one side of the lady while one man got into the carriage, a first-class one; when in the carriage he took her arm from me, the other male prisoner had hold of the other arm in lifting her into the carriage—during that time I believe the slipper was dropped again—I did not see it—all the prisoners got into the same carriage—I heard one of the female prisoners ask for five first-class tickets to Penge—I saw the lady; she looked very bad and seemed to roll her eyes about very much—I never heard her speak—she did not seem as if she was able to stand on her legs—before the train started one of the prisoners asked me to put the trap up for him—I asked him where, and he said "Over at Beaumont's"—that is a livery stable over the Two Brewers opposite the station—I said yes, and they said they would see me when they came back—the train started towards Penge and London—no one else was in the carriage except the four prisoners and the lady—I believe Cudham is about 7 or 8 miles from Bromley—the journey by train from Bromley to Penge would be about a quarter of an hour—I saw the two male prisoners again the same night at Bromley station—they arrived either by the 10.56 or 11.56 train; I cannot say which—one of them spoke to me about the trap before leaving the station—I did not see them in the carriage; I saw them leave the carriage—I did not see a slipper at the station next</p>

I was station-master at Penge on the 12th April this year—on the evening of that day I saw the' prisoners moving from the direction of a first-class carriage of the train arriving at 8.36—I afterwards saw a lady supported by two gentlemen on the platform, and ordered the ticket collector, who has just been a witness, to bring a chair, and the lady was placed in the chair—I should say she was not able to support herself; she was shaking violently—I did not notice her face or hear her speak or make any sound at all—one of the gentlemen said they wanted a cab, and I sent for one—the cab was about ten minutes before it arrived; we had to send up into the villiage for one—there are generally cabs at the station, but there were none then—when the cab arrived I advised them to carry her on the chair, as I was sure she was not in a. fit state to walk—they were lifting her by each arm—they acted upon my</p>

I am the wife of David Chalklin—I had apartments to let at 34, Forbes Road, on the 12th April last, on which day, about noon, Mrs. Patrick and Mr. Louis Staunton came and said they wanted lodgings for an invalid lady; there was some difference about terms, but ultimately they agreed to give 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week—they said they wanted them for three weeks or a month, or probably more—Mr. Louis Staunton wrote down "Mrs. Staunton, Frith Cottage, Cudham"—I believe that document is lost—he said they had a doctor at Cudham who did not understand her case—Mrs. Patrick Staunton was present when he said that—Mrs. Patrick Staunton said they wished to get her near to London to get the advice of a doctor—he said "I have been given to understand that you have very good doctors in Penge," and asked whether I could recommend one, and I recommended Dr. Longrigg, who had attended my little girl—he said that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170011"></xptr>
               <p>the lady was inclined to be paralysed, and that her feet had begun to swell and I think they considered that her head would become affected—they said that it would be better to bring her at night that the doctor might see her in the morning—they said she was in good bodily health and that she could eat but she would not—Mrs. Staunton said they tried her with some bread and butter, egg and tea, that morning, and with a great deal of persuasion, they got her to eat a little—it was stated that they were to come at 9.30 in the evening—I was directed to have afire in the bed-room, but they would not require one in the sitting-room, because it would be so late when they came—the sitting-room and bed room were on the first floor—I told them where to go to Dr. Longrigg's—I did not write it down—they said they would call on him—when they left they went in that direction—in the evening the two female prisoners came; I did not let them in, I saw them in afterwards—my little girl let them in—I saw them directly after they came in, they were in the sitting-room—they said the invalid lady had come, and that she was very ill indeed during the journey they thought she would have died, and they could not account at all for her being so ill—I found the invalid lady in bed; she had been brought in without my seeing her—I did not see much of her, she was covered up entirely to her face—she did not speak in my presence—she made a kind of gurgling noise and moaned a great deal—I remarked to the prisoners that I was surprised to see her in bed, I had no idea they had brought her—I said "How shocking it is to see anyone lying here so ill"—neither of them spoke to me on the subject, there was no remark made—I said I expected to see an elderly person, and Mrs. Patrick Staunton said her age was thirty-six, and she was the wife of a gentleman who was there in the morning, and that she had no children—she said that Miss Rhodes was married, but her husband was away, and that she had come to nurse the invalid lady—Miss Rhodes had on a wedding ring and keeper—Mrs. Patrick Stannton said that the two male prisoners had gone to the doctor—I inquired if they wanted anything, and they said they had brought all provisions with them except some bread, and they asked whether I could lend them some—I then went downstairs—some time afterwards I was called up by Mr. Louis Staunton—I did not let him in, I think they did—he said that he had been to the doctor's, but he was not at home—he said the servant told him Mr. Longrigg was out and would not be at home till late, and that he asked her what she called late, and she said 1 o'clock in the morning—he said there seemed to be nobody that would take a message—I recommended him another doctor, Dr. Turner, but he said "There is no necessity for it; I do not like to behave like that to Mr. Longrigg without speaking to him"—I did not go into the bed room again' that night; at the time I left all the four prisoners were in the sitting-room—shortly after that Alice Rhodes came to the top of the stairs and asked me to boil some eggs, jiving me two eggs—she said that Mrs. Staunton had woke up and wanted some supper, and she said "I am sure she must require some supper after her long journey"—I boiled the eggs and took them up into the sitting-room—I found Alice Rhodes there alone—I brought up some plates and knives—shortly afterwards Mrs. Patrick Staunton called me up and asked one to boil another egg—Alice Rhodes was alone in the sitting-room putting he tablecloth on for supper—Mrs. Patrick Staunton gave me the other egg herself to boil, which I did, and brought it up myself—they only brought a high basket with them—I took up some bread when I took up the plates—</p>

               <p>I did not see Patrick that night—she said Mr. Staunton and her husband had gone to the doctor—they brought their own table and bed linen—I supplied the plates and knives and forks—the next morning about 8.15 the bell was rung and I went into the sitting-room where Mrs. Pk. Staunton and Alice Rhodes were sitting by the window—they said they had been waiting for the doctor—I received an egg to boil—I did not know who it was for at the time—after breakfast Mrs. Pk. Staunton asked me to have a fire alight before the doctor came; I lit the fire—they had the folding doors open and were watching me all the time—I looked at the invalid lady and thought she was asleep—she was lying perfectly still—I cleared some remains of the egg from the dressing-table—there was some egg spread on bread and butter and a cup three parts full of tea—the remainder of the egg was in the sitting-room—when Mrs. Pk. Staunton asked me to send for the doctor I asked her when, and she said "Presently will do"—Alice Rhodes afterwards called out "Cannot you let the little girl go for the doctor at once," and I said "Yes, the little girl shall go"—I made a remark would not it be better for one of them to go themselves—it was at breakfast time that they said the lady was very ill indeed—Alice Rhodes went to get her jacket, and came in with it in her hand, while I was there about 9 o'clock—she appeared very anxious—she went for the doctor at once in the direction of Dr. Longrigg's—I went down the steps to show her—while she was gone Mrs. Pk. Staunton said the invalid lady came to her house on Saturday to see her, and they dined together and had steak and potatoes; that she appeared apparently in good health and said what a nice steak it was, and she stayed the remainder of the day till the evening, and Mr. Pk. Staunton went home with her and they had supper at the invalid lady's house, and she was taken poorly after supper, and that she did not see her on the Sunday, because she, Mrs. Pk. Staunton, went out to spend the day on Sunday, and did not see her—that would be the Sunday before, but on the Monday morning she went to see her she said, and she noticed how ill she was, and she said "How ill you look my dear," and she said "Yes I am," but she seemed better on the Tuesday, and on Wednesday and Thursday she was very poorly—she. said the invalid lady lived close to her—I heard the doctor come in at about 10.30, and he stayed about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—directly Mrs. Pk. Staunton let the doctor out I went up to ask her what he had said, and she said the doctor said that it was an epileptic fit she had had—Alice Rhodes had gone to the chemist's to get the prescription made up—Mrs. Patrick said what a nice man the doctor was and very clever, and he seemed to understand the case, and that she would probably be ill three weeks, and she was to be kept very quiet and have plenty of nourishment—she did not say whether the doctor said she would be likely to get well—she said she asked the doctor to send a nurse as she wished to go home to her own children and she could not stay herself, and it would be too much for one—she said the doctor was coming back in half an hour—Alice Rhodes and the nurse then came, the little girl let them in—I asked Mrs. Pk. Staunton when she thought she had had the fit and she said "Goodness gracious knows, I don't know"—I asked her whether it was on the Sunday when she was so ill, and that was the remark she made to me—I took a jug of hot water up about 1 o'clock; she rang the bell for it and I had to heat it and she called for it in a great hurry—the doctor had been a second time, between 12 and 1 o'clock—from 2.30 to 2.45 I was talking to the baker at the door—</p>

               <p>while I was doing so Mr. Lee, the undertaker, came to the door—it was nearer 2.45 than 2.30—I did not know that Mrs. Staunton was dead and sent him away, thinking it might be No. 24 instead of 34—ten minutes afterwards I saw Mrs. Pk. Staunton at the sitting-room door and spoke to her about the lady—I asked her how she was and the remark she madewas "She is gone"—I went upstairs shortly afterwards and asked her if I should go for the undertaker and she said "There is no occasion, thank you, he is here"—about 4.45 I heard a rap at the front door and it was Mrs. Pk. Staunton—I was surprised, because I thought they were all at home—when I opened the door she said would I be kind enough to ask her husband when he came home to come to Bromley and he would understand what I meant—I asked her whether Louis Staunton was in time to see his wife and she said he was in the bed-room with her when she died, and that she and her sister were at the station at the time of the death, and she did not know where the nurse was at all—I had not seen Alice Rhodes; the little girl let her in with the nurse—Mrs. Pk. Staunton said. I could please myself about telling her husband of the death—I asked her if I was alone in the house and she said "Yes, my sister has gone some time and the nurse will come in the evening, and I will see you again"—she then went away—Patrick Staunton came at 5.45 and I told him of the death and gave him the message—he said he knew she was very ill when he was there in the morn<lb></lb>ing—he stood talking a few minutes and then went away—when I came in after talking to him I found the sitting-room and bed-room door locked—the curse came with the undertaker on Saturday night; she unlocked the door—I saw none of the prisoners on the Saturday—I recollect Mrs. Butterfield coming on the Sunday when the door of the room was locked and. Mrs. Gooding had the key, which I did not know till the middle of Saturday—My husband went for the nurse and she opened the door and allowed Mrs. Butterfield to see her daughter—on the Sunday night the police came with the doctor—I had not seen Mr. Patrick since Friday night.</p>

Staunton—they seemed surprised at her being taken so ill—when Mrs. Pk. Staunton told me that the invalid lady was the wife of Louis Staunton she volunteered that information to me, as also that Alice Rhodes was Mrs. Pk.

In the morning, about 9 o'clock, when Mrs. Staunton asked me to send for the doctor, Alice Rhodes was present—afterwards, Alice Rhodes asked me the same question—they were in the sitting-room the first time they asked; I went downstairs, and when I came up again they were in the bed-room and then Alice Rhodes asked me if I could send for the doctor directly—it was a few minutes before Mrs. Staunton asked me that Alice asked me—they had just had time to go into the bed-room—when Alice Rhodes asked me she said "Can she go at once"—she came into the sitting-room with her jacket in her hand, put it on, and Mrs. Patrick Staunton said "You go, my dear; you can go quickest"—and Alice Rhodes went immediately—I went down to the gate with her, and I made the remark to her "I would not return without the doctor," and she said "No, that I won't"—I shewed her the quickest, the straightest way—she appeared to go off in a great hurry for him—I assumed that Louis Staunton and Mrs. Patrick Staunton had engaged the rooms of me, and I thought the patient was living with them—Mrs. Patrick Staunton, I thought, had charge of the woman Harriett Staunton—she did not say so, but I thought so—I was" not asked the question before the Magistrate whether Mrs. Patrick Staunton had the charge of her that I can remember—I thought Mr. Louis Staunton and Mrs. Patrick Staunton were man and wife—I con<lb></lb>sidered Mrs. Patrick Staunton had charge of the woman who was ill, when they were in the house on the Thursday morning—I did not see anything in the conduct of Alice Rhodes inconsistent with anxiety for the invalid—she seemed very anxious.</p>

I was engaged as nurse to attend upon the deceased lady by Dr. Longrigg, about 11 o'clock, on the morning of Friday, the 13th, and went at once—Alice Rhodes showed me into the bed-room where the patient was and gave me a blister—I went downstairs to make beef tea, then went direct into the room—the patient laid as though she was in a fit and never moved at all till she died—I tried to ascertain if she was conscious by speaking to her—then I went to the door and asked Mr. Louis Staunton if ho would come to the door and sec if she would speak to him—he came in</p>

               <p>with Mr. Pk. Staunton; they both stood some minutes in the room—I spoke to her and tried to point them out, but she took no notice—about 12 o'clock I said "Will you send for the doctor, please, for I think your lady is very much worse," that was in the front room—Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Staunton and Mr. Louis Stauuton were present; the latter went directly for the doctor—I tried to give the patient some beef tea, also medicine, but she could not swallow anything—about 1.30 she appeared to be dying—I went to the door which opened into the sitting-room and asked Mr. Louis Staunton if he would like to see the last of the lady, as I did not think she would be here long—Mrs. Patrick Staunton said "Do not ask him, nurse, you worry him so"—the lady died a few minutes after—neither of them went into the room before she died—I told them that the lady was dead and I should want some sheets to lay her out in, should I ask the landlady for some—Mrs. Pk. Staunton said I had better not ask the landlady for she did not think she had any, as the room was poorly furnished—there was no blind to the window—I asked her what I was to do, if I should borrow sheets, and she said she would be very much obliged to me if I would—I went to where I had been nursing, borrowed the sheets, and took them back—when I went to wash the body I found it in such a filthy state I could not wash it—I had never seen anything so dirty before—the head was alive with lice, and the dirt on the body was something like the bark of a tree, as though it had been on for a long time and not washed at all—she had on a white gown and chemise—I tore them off and put her a clean night dress on—before she died Dr. Longrigg came into the bed-room and said to me she was dying—he then went into the front room to the Stauntons—I did not hear what passed then—after I had laid her out, as I was going to borrow the sheets, Mr. Staunton named to me about the undertaker—I mentioned Mr. Lee—Mr. Staunton told me 1 was to give an order for a black coffin, a hearse, and a coach, and that the funeral was to take place on Monday—when I went to borrow the sheets I left word at the Park Tavern for the undertaker to come—about an hour and a half after I had finished laying out the body Mr. Louis and Mrs. Pk. Staunton said to me they were going away as they lived so far off—Mrs. Staunton asked me to keep the key of the room, they expected friends to see her, and it would be handier for them to come to me for the key—I asked Dr. Longrigg if I should come to him for the certificate on Saturday morning and he said "Yes"—in consequence of my conversation with Dr. Longrigg I registered the death on Saturday morning—on Saturday night I had just come out of the house for Mr. Lee when the police and Dr. Longrigg came up with another gentleman and called for the body—the body had been left alone during the Friday, and down to Saturday night no one went in; the room was locked up and I had the key at the Park Tavern.</p>

Staunton, Little Gray's Farm, Cudham," in case I should want to write to him to let him know the time the funeral would take place—he said he wanted the funeral respectable, but not too expensive—I was not told what relation the lady was—I understood that the followers would be him and his mother, or the lady's mother, I am not quite certain—I afterwards left and the coffin was taken in on Saturday, for which purpose the nurse opened the room for me; she unlocked the room and I took in the coffin; I did not fasten it down—I have been undertaker in the neighbourhood of Penge about fourteen years—Penge is in two counties, Kent and Surrey—part of Forbes Road is in one county and part in the other; No. 34 is in the county of Kent, in the parish of Beckenham, and the place of registration would be Bromley—the place of registration for the other part of Forbes Road would be Croydon—the funeral did not take place on Monday, there was an inquiry, and it was postponed for some time—Mr. Staunton, the same gentleman I had seen, paid me 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6.</p>

I am a general practitioner at Penge—I am not a physician—about 11 o'clock on the morning of 12th April Mr. Louis and Mrs. Patrick Staunton called at my house—they said they had got an valid lady living down in the country and they wished to bring her up and put her under my charge; I think it was Mrs. Patrick who said that—I asked the nature of her case and they said the lady was of weak intellect—the statements to me were generally made by Mrs. Patrick, she was chief spokeswoman, but Louis was present and assented, and sometimes made statements of his own; each spoke in the presence and hearing of the other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170018"></xptr>
               <p>—I cannot recollect minutely what Mrs. Patrick said or what Mr. Louis said, hut I can give the substance of the conversation—I asked if the patient was paralysed and they said "Yes," she had lost the use of the loft side—I asked if she was cleanly in her habits—they said she was—I asked that because in cases of paralysis the patient is often very dirty—they said she was extremely thin, but hearty—after I learnt that she was paralysed I asked if she had had a fit and they said "Not to my knowledge"—I asked who had been attending her—they told me they would bring her up that day from Cudham—he said that a medical man bad been in attendance who lived 7 or 8 miles from the place and could not give the deceased the attention that be would like her to have—I asked the medical man's name—they were very reluctant to answer me, but at last said Dr. Creasy, of Brastead—I asked if it was Dr. Creasy, of Gravesend, as I knew him—they said "No," it was Dr. Creasy, of Brastead—I asked no further questions—I knew that the invalid lady lived at Cudham, but did not know what part of Kent it was in; I thought, perhaps, it might be near Gravesend—the had been ill for some time, I don't know how long—I entered the name "Staunton" in a visiting list and arranged to pay the invalid a visit the following morning—on the Thursday evening I went out to visit some friends and did not get home till 3 o'clock the next morning when I found a note from my assistant from which I understood that I was desired to go that evening to see the lady who had been brought up from Cudham and was much worse—I did not go then, for I thought as they had been twice she must be very bad, and that they certainly would have sent for some other medical man by that time—the time stated in the note was 10.30—the following morning (Friday) Alice Rhodes came to me, about 9 o'clock, before 1 was up—I got up, dressed, and accompanied her to Forbes Road—she told me they had been expecting me all night; the lady was worse—when I got there Mrs. Pk. Staunton let me in at the door—I went first into the parlour, then into the bed-room where the invalid was—that was a little before 10 o'clock—Mrs. Patrick and Alice Rhodes were in the room with me; no one else—I examined the patient—her pulse was very quick and weak, about 110—her arms were rigid; she was perfectly insensible—the pupil of the right eye was slightly dilated, that of the left contracted to a pin's point—the breathing was stertorous and laboured—the features indicated distress—the balls of the eyes were very much shrunken, their colour was a slight bronze—I noticed the lady was very much emaciated and in a dirty condition—I observed pediculi or lice in her hair—her hands were dirty, particularly her finger-nails—I tried to rouse her, but she did not move, or take the slightest notice—I came to the conclusion that it was an apoplectic seizure, and told her friends Mrs. Pk. Staunton and Alice Rhodes, that she was extremely ill and would not get over it; would not recover—they made no remark—Mrs. Patrick said that she had been like that all night with the stertorous breathing, and asked me to recommend a nurse; I sent one in—I wrote out a prescription for the patient to be made up at my own surgery, and said that I would call again—I did not say that she had had an epileptic fit—I might have said she was in an apoplectic fit—I believe I did say so—I may have said there was no accounting for how such things happened—I never in any way conveyed to them that she might be better in three weeks—I knew in my own mind that she was dying and told them so the second visit; I said she should be kept quiet, and prescribed beef tea and milk for her—I had been given to understand that Mrs. Pk. Staunton was</p>

               <p>the sister-in-law of Louis Staunton—about 12 o'clock on that day Mr. Louis Staunton came for me, to say his wife was much worse—I said I would follow him shortly—it was about 12.30 when I got there—the nurse was in the bed-room with the patient, who was dying rapidly—Mrs. Pk. Staunton and Louis Staunton were in the sitting-room; I told them she was dying; they made no remark—I told them I would call again—later on I did call and found that the lady was dead—I saw Mrs. Pk. Staunton and Louis Staunton on this occasion and sympathised with them—on the following day I gave a certificate stating her age, thirty-six, and the cause of death" cerebral disease and apoplexy," that I saw her last on the 13th of April, 1877. the day she died—I had been told she was of weak intellect, and that she had had a fit—I concluded if she had had another fit it would be an apopletic seizure—I did not examine her to ascertain whether she was paralysed, she was so near death the case was so hopeless; I did not go into it at all—I gave the certificate to the nurse and heard nothing more about the matter till the next day when Mr. Cassabianca called upon me—I knew the deceased was Louis Staunton's wife, he told me so when he called, the day before her death—in consequence of a communication that was made to me on the Saturday, I withdrew the certificate and communicated with the coroner—I wrote to him on the 16th April, and he sent me a warrant to make a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, which was made on the 19th of April, at Forbes Road—there were present myself and my partner Mr. Pigott, and Dr. Bright, who came on behalf of the relations of the deceased lady, Dr. Wilkinson, a surgeon to the police, Mr. Lister, a friend of mine who came to me to do some dissection, during the progress of the examination—Mr. Harman, a medical man at Brixton, came on behalf of the prisoners—I made a minute examination of the body—it appeared to be that of a woman forty or fifty years of age nearer fifty, I should say—I made some notes of ray examination—the body was fearfully emaciatad and filthily dirty all over, particularly the feet—the skin of the feet was caked with dirt—the skin was quite hard, horny, the feet were slightly swollen—the horny condition of the feet would be produced by walking without shoes for sometime—there were lice all over the body, principally in the hair of the pelvis, about the vagina and the armpits, and on the head, wherever there was hair on the body—I noticed the bites of these lice on the body, particularly on the abdomen—they are called poverty lice, they breed faster where there is filth and where the body is in a weak, low condition than upon a healthy subject—the hands and nails were very dirty—the interior part of the things were smeared with foeces—there were no signs of marks of violence on the body—the black marks in the posterior part of the back had not existed during life, but were purely <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—the weight of the body was 5 stone 4 lbs.; the height 5 feet 5 1/4 inches, I think—the ordinary weight of that size would be from 9 to 10 stone—the tongue was furred, creamy, like little pieces of egg which had not been swallowed—we found about 4 or 5 ounces of food in the stomach, milk and tea com<lb></lb>bined with some small pieces of solid food, bacon, undigested—the eyes were shrunken and closed—the white of the eye was perfectly normal, quite clear—we found on the head both real hair and false, not much real—it was very much matted—we were obliged to pull the hair pins out with the forceps and cut or pull the hair off, both real and false, in order to get to the scalp—I should say her hair had not been attended to for a con<lb></lb>siderable time—the breasts were very small, hardly anything but just the</p>

               <p>nipples—she did not appear to have suckled her child—we removed a portion of the skull and examined the brain—there were old adhesions between the external and internal lining membranes of the brain, and there was a slight deposit there of tubercular matter—the brain itself was remarkably healthy and firm—there was every sign that the woman had been in good health—there was no disease of the brain, but there was this slight tubercular deposit—what I considered the abnormal condition of the brain was the old adhesion and the tubercular deposit—I have often seen old adhesions in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> room—as to its cause there might have been a tendency to it in childhood—the tubercular deposit, in my opinion, may have arisen from want of nourishment—I did not find any serum in the ventricles—the substance of the brain itself was perfectly healthy, but the external and internal blood vessels of the brain were both in an apoplectic state, gorged—I can give a theory as to what caused that gorging of the blood vessels; supposing the patient had been without food some time and a meal were suddenly given to her, that would produce it; it would produce apoplexy—we opened the stomach and the chest, and in the chest we found a tubercular deposit on the apex of the left lung, a deposit of about two inches square—that indicated the commencement of consumption, but that deposit on the lungs had nothing to do with the death—I examined the heart, it was very small, but very healthy—the sac which contains the heart did not adhere to the heart at all—the liver was remarkably small, but very healthy indeed—if this body had been kept without a proper supply of food, and became emaciated in consequence, the heart, liver, and other organs would diminish in size—the heart weighed 7 3/4 ounces, and the average weight of the heart of a female of the height of the deceased would, I should say, be about 9 ounces—the liver was very small, but heathy, and weighed a little over 30 ounces—I cannot give the exact weight, the decimals, but I think the liver weighed 2 pounds 2 1/4 ounces—from 50 to 60 ounces would be about the average weight of the liver of a woman such as the deceased—the gall bladder was full and heathly—the spleen weighed 4 3/4 ounces; about 7 ounces would be the average weight of the spleen in a woman such as deceased—the spleen was very healthy—the kidneys were healthy but very small, the right weighed 3 1/4 ounces, and the left 4 ounces—the average weight would be 9 ounces the two kidneys—the uterus was normal in measurement, but a little congested—there was a greenish, yellowish discharge from the vagina, and the left labia was excoriated—the 0 lower inches of the rectum were highly congested—that might have been occasioned by inflammation—there was not a particle of fat in the body—the congestion gave me the idea that poison might have been administered or taken into the body, irritant or narcotic poison—the condition of the eyes led me to believe that some narcotic poison might hare been taken—the contents of the stomach were analysed by Professor Rodgers, and from him I afterwards learnt that he had not discovered any poison—having learnt that fact, I gave it as my opinion that the cause of death was starvation—I so stated before the Coroner's jury, and before the analysis was completed; that opinion has not been altered by anything I have since heard, and that is my opinion now—the body was in a state of extreme emaciation—in my opinion it would take a considerable time to reduce it to such a state, perhaps three months, and for a considerable time it must have been apparent to those about her that the deceased was wasting away, there could be no mistake about that—there were no signs</p>

               <p>that the deceased had been of intemperate habits, on the contrary, that she was a woman of strictly temperate habits—there was such a want of muscular development that I should say she could not have walked about for come time before her death—in a case of death from want, there are appearances of congestion at all the outlets, there is general inflamma<lb></lb>tion of the outlets, and a high state of congestion—that might be produced by congestion or other causes, but it is one of the symptoms—in my opinion the deceased was not in a fit state to be removed from Cudham to Penge on 12th April; that she ought to have been kept quiet and not removed at all—I consider that the removal accelerated her death—the contents of the stomach and intestines were placed in a jar and given to Sergeant Bateman to take to Professor Rodgers.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. In the condition in which the deceased was, death would certainly be accelerated by her removal, and the rough mode in which she was moved would hasten death—in the condition in which She was when I first saw her she might have died if she had been left at Cudham and not removed; the removal of her from one room to another I do not think would materially have affected her, provided she was moved gently; it is a question of degree—my dispenser, Mr. Cox, was in charge when I went out in the evening of the 12th April—I had a conversation with Mrs. Patrick Staunton that day—I asked if the deceased was paralysed, she said she had lost the use of one side—I flexed the arm; it was rigid—you do not get rigidity in paralysis—Mrs. Patrick Staunton told me the deceased had not menstruated for six or seven months—that is a very difficult thing to tell—I considered the statement important at that time—I did not know that deceased had had a child—it did not strike me as of more importance when I had ascertained that fact—I knew it at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I do not consider the fact of the deceaced not having menstruated for six months important—we were unable to decide by examination whether she had had a child or suckled one—our inability to decide was not attributable to the delay; the body was in a beautiful state of preservation at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—the external appearances were not altered, nor was the internal appearance of the brain affected—I asked if they had a medical man and they said "Yes"—I asked if they had one living near them and they said "No"—I cannot give the exact words—I did not ask how long he had been attending her, nor as to the treatment—she might have had medical treatment, I did not ask, not at that time—the distance from my house to where deceased was lodging is about 500 yards—I found a note when I reached home that night, saying the lady was worse, and requesting me to go as soon as I came home—I did not believe her to be suffering from apoplexy—I looked upon the prisoners as respectable persons and believed their statement—I believed her to be suffering from what I certified—I never gave it a thought as to what she was suffering from that night: I said in my own mind "This woman is worse and they have sent for another doctor"—Alice Rhodes came for me in the morning before I was dressed, and sent up two messages—I may have said to Mrs. Patrick Staunton at my first visit that the lady was in an apopleptic condition—I prescribed beef tea—I don't think I said that the only chance was to give her nourishing things; she had not a chance, so I could not have said so—I don't think I mentioned nourishing things—I prescribed beef tea and very likely I might have said she must be kept quiet; it is so long ago I cannot wear to it—I saw her twice, but I made no communication to the ladies</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170022"></xptr>
               <p>there with regard to the state of her hair, her face, or her hands—I had no reason to believe that there were any lice except in her hair during life—I saw them on the head; they breed and spread over the body very rapidly—I do not think they spread over the body after death—I have been in practice ten years; five in my own name and five as a qualified assistant—I have seen and made many <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations, and have taken the ordinary hospital notes—I have not my notes here—I took the headings of the different viscera, and when I got home made out my notes in a small pocket-book, which contains private matters besides, I have searched for that book but cannot find it—the last time I saw it was in my consulting-room; it is a small book—I put down the weights and measurements of the different organs—the notes of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination did not occupy very much of the book; perhaps two pages and a half—I do not think I have said before that they occupied much more than that—when 1 say "I cannot tell how many pages of notes there were, perhaps twelve pages," I understood that to refer to the whole of the book, and two and a half pages of them were my notes made at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination; they were the only notes I made—the book is lost and cannot be found—I have some notes with me—I made the first set of notes, which I have still in my possession, half an hour or an hour after the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I had not seen Dr. Bright's notes; I have my notes here; my dispenser has them in the bag—they are not an exact copy of the notes in the book that I lost; there is a great addition to them—the set of notes I made half an hour after the examination, are on the blue paper—they were made before I had seen Dr. Bright at all; the other set of notes, Dr. Bright's, were made on the Sunday—the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was on the Thursday, I think—I read Dr. Bright's notes all over; be gave them to me—the notes endorsed "Dr. Longrigg's notes of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination," were sent to Professor Rodgers—the second set of notes I made contain a narrative of the conversation that took place; I put it down, and then an account of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances in cases of death from, starvation; they are for my own observation; it was not written when the notes were written, it was a day afterwards—the two sets of notes are the only papers or notes I have of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the chief part of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> ex<lb></lb>amination, the dirty part of it, was done by my partner, Mr. Piggott—I dissected all the viscera and the brain—I think the height of the woman was 5 feet 5 inches; you will see it in the notes—when I speak of the average weight as between 9 and 10 stone, I compare it to a woman of that height; the lightest weight I have known for a woman of that height in average health, is about 9 stone or 9 stone 41bs.; it depends upon the build—I was not informed by Harriett Staunton's mother that her daughter's weight at her healthiest did not exceed 8 stone; Dr. Bright told me that—the weight depends upon the build; it depends upon the framework; if the framework is slight it might not be 9 stone—it is within my experience that a person of the height of 5 feet 4 1/2 inches might be considerably less than 9 stone in weight, and yet a healthy person—the weights of the particular organs were calculated in reference to the weight of the whole body—the heart would be one two hundred and fortieth part of the weight of the whole body calculated in that way—taking the actual weight of the body; the weight of the different organs of the body corres<lb></lb>ponded with the natural proportions, whatever the weight of the body might be, the heart would be one two hundred and fortieth part of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. In this case the heart, for instance, corresponded with the actual weight of the body as' I found it; if the body had been 9 stone the heart would have been so much larger—taking the weight of the body, the organs were considerably under the size I expected to find them—9 or 10 stone should he the average weight of a woman 5 feet 5 1/2 inches; if the weight had been from 9 to 10 stone then the internal organs, the liver, and so on, would have been much larger than the organs as I found them in the body that was before me; the organs of the body as I found them were of the same size as I should expect to find them in a body that was only 5 feet 5 inches; the internal organs were proportionate to the weight.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. The spleen weighed 4 1/2 ounces and should have weighed 7 ounces—I gave a lower weight than 7 ounces before the Magistrate as a natural weight; I said 5 1/2 ounces to 7 ounces; 5 1/2 ounces would represent a healty state, but it is a mistake that it averages 5 1/2 to 7 ounces—what I said before the Magistrate was "Weighing 4 1/2 ounces against 5 1/2 ounces to 7;" 5 1/2 ounces is correct—the proportionate weight of the liver to the whole body in ordinary cases would be about one thirty-fifth—I did not weigh the brain—my observations during life showed me nothing inconsistent with the account given by the prisoners—I believed what was told me—when I gave my certificate, I had no reason to suspect anything; I gave it in good faith, and so far as I was able, the cause of death stated in my certificate was the cause—I had no idea at the time that there was any starvation—her symptoms did not indicate either poison or starvation—the chief of the head symptoms before death was the dilitation of the pupils and stertorous breathing; the pupils were unequally dilated, and that is evidence of brain mischief, an unmistakeable sign—if I had felt any doubt on the matter as to the cause of death I should have asked who the doctor was that had been attending her, and probably have put myself in communication with him before I gave my certificate; there was a special hurry about the certificate; there is not in an ordinary case, but there was in this—I did not think it necessary to communicate with Mr. Cassabianca, I saw him the following day; he called on me, he was a perfect stranger to me—Mrs. Cassabianca did not come with him—it was the day after the death that Mr. Cassabianca came, the same day that the certificate was given—I did not know anything about the Stauntons having gone back to Cudham when I gave my certificate—I tad not heard that either of them was going back—I had seen the nurse I recommended in attendance myself—I wrote this letter to the Coroner after seeing Mr. Cassabianca, on the strength of what he said. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was here read as follows</hi>:—"16th April, 1877. Penge, S. E. My dear sir,—On Friday last I was called to a case of a somewhat peculiar character, and, from information afforded me, considered the symptoms sufficient to justify my giving a certificate of death; but from what I have since been told me I am of opinion that the circumstances necessitate an inquisition into the cause. The sergeant who delivers this to you will be able to give you all needful information. With kind regards, yours faithfully. Dean Lougrigg. P. S.—the name of the deceased is Mrs. Staunton, a niece of Lord——.") Mr. Cassabianca gave me the information contained in the postscript—he gave me a history of the lady and the family—he said there had been foul play—in consequence of that I put myself in communication with the police and he Coroner—then the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination took place—I was suspicious of poisoning at one time of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination; I did not come to hat conclusion; there were symptoms resembling poison; the idea was not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170024"></xptr>
               <p>suggested to me, it was my own observation—we had a conversation about if.—we came to the conclusion that death was from starvation—it was after we had finished the examination that I and the other medical gentlemen came to the opinion there had been poisoning, and determined to send the intestines to Dr. Rodgers—we could not find enough disease to account for death—the congested state of the upper part of the stomach was the first symptom that gave me the idea of poisoning, that was discovered in the early part of <hi rend="italic">the post-mortem</hi> examination—the brain was opened first and the chest afterwards—I will undertake to say the word starvation was mentioned during the examination; I daresay 1 mentioned it; I mentioned it as one of the causes of death; we all mentioned starvation—I have seen several cases of persona who died in a state of great emaciation—I have seen <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations of cases called starvation and have seen similar appearances; cases not exactly from disease, but from want of food, exposure to the cold, and want of proper nourishment—I have attended such persons before their death; there is no difficulty in inducing them to take food, it depends upon the state of their sensibility—I did not find anything in this case that looked like a refusal to take food—the egg remained on the tongue from insensi<lb></lb>bility and from inability to swallow it—indications of intemperate habits would easily be discovered; there would always be a trace of those habits if they had ceased some months before death, though not of a very serious kind; I am of that opinion; I do not think there would be any difficulty in discovering it—in the case of a woman who had contracted a habit of intemperance which has been indulged in for, say twelve months, and who was. deprived of the opportunity, and who died six months afterwards, traces of that would be discovered; you would find an enlargement of the liver and of the heart and a dilated condition of the blood vessels of the brain—that would always be present if the person had been a drunkard, or a person of strong intemperate habits—in the case of a woman who, living at her own house, takes too much wine or too much spirit, you would have symptoms of it then, but not so well marked as in a strictly intemperate person—I think hat would necessarily be visible if a person is given to indulging, although it had been abandoned six or seven months—the heart and the liver were not enlarged, but the blood vessels of the brain were distended—I attribute that to other causes—congestion of the coats of the stomach led me early in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination to a suspicion of poison—the principal matters discovered in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination which led me to the conclusion of poison, were the congestion of the stomach, congestion about the rectum, the congestion of the vagina and uterus, and the congested condition of the brain externally and internally; I did not form so strong an opinion that poison had been administered as I did of starvation, I do not recollect whether I said before the Magistrate that the symptoms conveyed to my mind were that it was a suspicious case of poisoning, or that I agreed that there were strong signs of poisoning—we thought that it was poison or starvation, and I thought that Professor Rodgers' analysis would find it out—my memory will not carry me so far back as to recollect positively what I said—it is three or four months since I was examined, and you cannot expect me to recollect—if I said I thought Professor Rodgers' analysis would find that there had been sufficient poison to cause death, it is true of course—what I said before the Magistrate was taken down, but I do not recollect using the expression—the symptoms I have mentioned to you as indicating the presence of poison would also be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170025"></xptr>
               <p>referable to starvation—all the symptoms I did observe were fairly traceable to starvation—I do not think I said the inflammation of the peritoneum was, for instance; but the peritoneum was slightly inflamed—I have never heard of a case where the simple absence of nourishment has produced inflammation of the peritoneum, not what I call peritonitis, that is a symptom of starvation—I know it from what I have heard other medical men say, and from what I have read; I cannot say that I have ever seen it—I cut the stomach open and examined it carefully; I have given you all that I observed as far as I am aware—the stomach was not of its ordinary size substance and thickness; it was rather thiner than in nature—the mucous membrane of the stomach was thin; I had my notes with me before the Magistrate; but they were taken from me—I have had them back since from the Treasury; I have been examined two or three times—I have never mentioned the thinning of the coats of the stomach until you put the question—before the Magistrate I might have said that all the organs were healthy except the left lung, and that was diseased; I was confused slightly before the Magistrate; I am not confused now, but you are trying to make me so—I do not remember all that I said before the Magistrate—I do not think I said anything in the notes made at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> about the coats of the stomach being thin—I have not been examined from my notes—the thinning of the coats of the stomach would be a strong indication of starvation; one of the most natural and obvious signs; that is a matter which I have considered as important—the condition of the brain was firm, that is a condition indicative of the healthy condition of the brain that it should be firm several days after death—it was a very healthy conditioned brain—the brain was not wasted and pale—in a case of starvation the brain, I will not say would be wasted, but it would be pale—I should expect to find it pale; the brain was healthy—I will not be positive, but I believe in cases of starvation the brain is very little affected, or the nervous system at a 1; I should expect to find it pale, but not wasted—there was a very general congestion of the external and internal blood vessels—I do not consider the inequality of the pupils of the eyes a condition of starvation—it is a marked system of brain disease—phthisis will produce emaciation—there was a small patch of it in the present case, but not enough of it to account for death—the taking of certain poisons, I believe would cause emaciation and a bronzing of the skin—diabetes produces emaciation and a dark or bronzed condition of the skin—there is a dark appearance in the skin caused by diabetes, but I never saw a case where the skin was so bronzed as in this case—I have not had much experience of Addison's disease; it is an obscure disease and I am not sufficiently acquainted with it to give an explanation of it—there are frequent head symptoms in diabetes and in Addison's disease, and in the former you have coma sometimes and stertorous breathing—and they would be similar to the symptoms observed in this case—in diabetes there is sugar in the urine; I did not test the urine in this case—there were 3 ounces of urine in the body—Addison's disease would leave its trace in the super-renal capsules—I examined the kidneys, but not separately—in diabetes as death approached you would find occasionally coma and stertorous breathing and dilitation of the eyes—that appearance is not at all uncommon—I have read that tubercles on the lungs are often found in connection with Addison's disease; I did not examine the tubercles on the brain with a microscope; I did not attach importance to it; as they were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170026"></xptr>
               <p>so plain to be seen, I did not consider it necessary to go further—the finding of tubercles in the brain was important, but not more so than the finding of tubercles in the lungs, but I did not follow up that discovery by any microscopic examination; I know a disease called granular or milliary tubercle, it takes its name from grains like millet seeds in the brain, and is the same sort of thing that 1 found in this case—the presence of tubercles in the meshes of the brain constitutes tubercular meningitis—it is a fatal disease; I have never seen a case recover—I had five cases in one house after fever—it was in children, the eldest was eighteen—it did not produce great emaciation in those cases; they got much thinner, but I could not call it true emaciation—its effects are very rapid, it is seven or ten days, and sometimes only forty-eight hours before death ensues—local disease may exist without tubercular disease, but if in combination with tubercle in other parts of the body, it would create a serious complication—it would produces the disease called acute general tuberculolis—of that disease I have had considerable experience, it produces great emaciation, and there are head symptoms in some cases—tubercular meningitis or acute general tuberculis would not account for the symptoms in this case in this case an acute tubercular disease was not sufficiently established to produce the symptoms I saw; there was not enough of it—if there had been a stronger condition of the disease itself it would have produced all the the symptoms which appeared in this case, except the rigidity of the muscles of the upper extremities—I have not seen any rigidity in death from tuberculolis—I will not say positively that it might not exist, but I have never seen it, and that is the only symptom I can point out that might not have been caused by those diseases—in this case the disease was not sufficiently advanced; I express that opinion positively—the amount of tubercles was very slight, both in the lungs and the brain—I did not examine the brain with a microscope—the microscope is a great advantage to diagnosis, but it would not have told me more than I knew, namely that there was tubercle—you could see with the naked eye the amount of tubercle that was there—I cannot speak so positively as if I had resorted to the use of the microscope—I speak positively that what I saw was tubercle—I did not see what the microscope would show me—I have no hesitation in my mind, I still adhere to the opinion which I have expressed all through—we all found the appearance of cerebral disease in the shape of that tubercles which have been Spoken of—my original certificate does not fairly represent my views—I consider it correct to a certain extent, with modifications—I arrived at the conclusion that there was poison, and was surprised to find Professor Rodgers did not discover any—I thought he might have done so—I formed my opinion before the analysist's report—I said I believed Professor Bodgers might find poison.</p>

               <p>deprives the limb of all muscular power—when a limb is paralysed it becomes atrophied—the bites were produced during life; I have no doubt of that—the bite of a louse is like being pricked suddenly with a pin—bites after death would not produce those appearances—I thought poison might have been administered because of the congested state of the organs I have described—congestion is an effect of an irritant poison, but might be produced by starvation or by eating after going without food for a long period—the appearances I saw in the eyes might be symptoms of narcotics as well as the congestion—there was a general thinning, not only of the stomach, but of all sorts, which might be produced by emaciation—any exhaustive disease that causes emaciation might cause a thinning of the stomach, but it is invariable in cases of starvation—a patient suffering from diabetes would complain of all food, whether liquid or solid, turning to urine, and of the immense quantity of urine that would pass—this causes a gradual wasting of the body, but it is a long time before it terminates fatally, and that time varies very much—I have seen several cases of diabetes—the patient would also complain of great thirst—extraordinary thirst is a frequent accompaniment of diabetes, but not an invariable one—if Mrs. Harriett Staunton had been suffering from diabetes for a considerable time, I am sure those about her would have known it—the passing of an extreme quantity of urine is an invariable symptom of diabetes—the kidneys are also enlarged and spongy—on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination in this case we found that the kidneys were enlarged, on the contrary they were smaller than usual—I have had no experience in Addison's disease—I believe it is a very rare disease—in ordinary language tubercular meningitis is an iuflammation of the brain—there is a tubercular deposit—tubercular meningitis will produce emaciation, but must exist some time to do that—if Mrs. Harriett Staunton had been suffering from that disease it must have existed for a considerable time, and she would have been in an enfeebled state for some time before her death, and the disease would have been more developed than it was—if she had suffered from acute tuberculolis the brain would be soft; my opinion is that her death was not caused by diabetes or tubercular meningitis, but by starvation—the doctors present at the <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination discussed the matter amongst ourselves, and we all agreed—Dr. Harman was there on behalf of the prisoners—if the patient suffered from starvation it might bring on a fit.</p>

I noticed bites on the abdomen, and the insects themselves in the hair—in answering the question as to Mrs. Harriett Staunton's power to move before her death, I assumed she died from starvation—perhaps the correct answer would be that whatever was the cause of her death—I am judging simply of her condition, the appearances before and after death—I only saw the deceased at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and my opinion is formed upon what I saw, and upon what Dr. Long<lb></lb>rigg did—I formed my opinion then from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and from a history of the symptoms during life—I did not form any opinion as to the power of motion at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I have no doubt the word "starvation" was mentioned; I do not recollect it, but I have been told so—there was but little conversation in the room, most of the conversation took place downstairs—I told Mr. Lewis I did not hear the word "starvation" mentioned, and I referred to the time the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was going on—I never said death was caused by starvation alone; what I said was that the general appearances of the body were characteristic of starvation, but there were special appearances which led us to believe that an analysis was necessary—I did not suggest it was starvation and poison, in those words—I do not like the word "suggest"—we all agreed on one point—I could not give an opinion as to the immediate cause of death—I expressed an opinion that she died of starvation—I could not form any opinion unless I had an analysis—I took notes at the time, and gave them to Mr. Longrigg two or three days after<lb></lb>wards—Mr. Longrigg, Dr. Wilkinson, and I had a meeting afterwards—my notes were read over at that meeting—they were discussed between us—I have them with me—I had a description of the symptoms before death from Mr. Longrigg—those symptoms led me to the suspicion that the deceased had been poisoned by opium—they pointed in that direction as I thought—I then proceeded with the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and on the stomach being opened there was a redness on the stomach, the small intestines and the lower part of the bowels—that led me to the suspicion of an irritant poison—the matter was submitted to Dr. Rodgers—I have not seen any case of starvation—I don't think my information scanty on the subject—I have tried to read everything upon it—after this matter I referred to Dr. Taylor's book on medical jurisprudence; it was a book which I borrowed—that is not the only work I have referred to with regard to starvation—I think that was the only work I had seen before I was examined before the Magistrate—what I said before the Magistrate as to the cause of death was accurate—I had only read Taylor's book up to that time—I said the information was very scanty in the book—I don't remember the exact words; if it is in my deposition it is quite true.</p>

               <p>that the symptoms pointed in one direction: that the general appearance of the body was most characteristic of starvation, but we all wished for an analysis of the contents of the stomach—starvation would produce the emaciation that I saw in the body of this woman—the other symptoms that I saw would have been produced precisely as if she had been kept for some time without food, and the emaciation caused in that way, and then poison had been administered to her—I had a difficulty in coming to the conclusion as to the immediate cause of death—I thought narcotic poison would produce the appearances I saw in the eyes, and which were described to me by Mr. Longrigg—I think in a convulsion the distinction between opium poisoning and apoplexy is exceedingly difficult to discover—I was present and heard Mr. Longrigg examined—in my opinion this lady's death was not caused by diabetes—I cannot reconcile it with the view of tubercular meningitis, or Addison's disease.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. There was urine discovered at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—undoubtedly with regard to diabetes the examination of the urine is the simplest and most perfect way of testing the presence of that disease—that is generally considered the test symptom—the examination of the super-renal capsules can only take place after death—with regard to Addison's disease there are certain symptoms during life which are unmistakeable—in examining for that disease after death I should feel it necessary to examine the super-renal capsules—I think in this case suck an examination was overlooked—I noticed tubercles in the brain myself—I made no microscopic examination—I remember they were put aside for examination with some of the matter of the tubercular deposit—I have no knowledge if they were ever examined—the presence of tubercles in the meshes of the brain and the existence of tubercular matter in the lungs was a very important coincidence taken together—I have had the treat<lb></lb>ment of tubercular meningitis—it is a local disease to the brain and very speedy in its effect—it is most frequent in children—as far as I can re<lb></lb>member all the cases I have seen have run too rapid a course for emaciation, the usual course has been from two to three weeks; that is almost the limit—it is not long since I bad a case under my control—I have not been struck with great emaciation, though it may come on as the result of other conditions—another disease may have produced emaciation, and then tubercular meningitis follow, "which is very rapid in its effects—I can point out three things here which were inconsistent" with death from tubercular meningitis, the very fact of there being some small tubercular deposit in the membranes of the brain led us to examine the brain very carefully, and there was a complete absence of three marked symptoms: first, the flattening and the bulging of the sides of the brain; secondly, and much more important, a complete absence any effusion in the ventricles, in the chambers of the brain; and, thirdly, the absence of any tubercles whatever at the base of the brain—the characteristic <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances of tubercular meningitis is the presence of tubercular deposit in the meshes of the brain, at the base of the brain—we examined the brain more carefully because we thought we found some small deposit of tubercles on the convex surface, that led us to examine more carefully—I made no examination with the microscope—I made a special note of there being a total absence of lymph, but I do not think I did so of the flattening and bulging of the brain—the presence of lymph is one of the most marked symptoms of inflammation—it becomes very serious indeed when there is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170030"></xptr>
               <p>lymph or pus—the first stage of inflammation is a congested condition—we found that present—I must distinguish between the word congestion and inflammation, because the appearances of the brain were characteristic of intense congestion and 1 could not use the word inflammation—the presence of lymph is the third stage in inflammation, and congestion is the first—congestion was present in the brain—all the blood vessels in the brain itself were remarkably congested—a very small quantity of fluid was found in the skull—I doubt if there was more than a drachm; I don't think it was actually measured—it will be found mentioned specially in my notes that there was an absence of effusion, but not, I believe, as to the quantity—I think that was remarkable from the absence of it—I do not remember making; a written note, but I remember it perfectly—I recollect the appearance of the brain perfectly; we expected to find evidence of tubercular disease more marked and we did not find it—I won't say that military tubercles never occur without lymph or effusion.</p>

I said that I could not come to any decided opinion with regard to the immediate cause of death; I think there was enough upon the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination to enable me to come to a conclusion, and I think the right answer would be that the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances of the body were not inconsistent with starvation—there were reasons why I thought there might be in the first instance a narcotic, and afterwards an irritant poison—the difficulty we had was to account for the immediate cause of death—I ought to say the special appearances are not limited either to poison or to starvation; there are certain appearances common to many diseases, in the stomach and so on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. I agree with the doctors who have already spoken with regard to meningitis—I agree with their opinion with regard to the diseases; but not quite so as to their statements—I did not hear them all, but I agree with their opinions—I heard Mr. Longrigg give a description of the symptoms before death sometime after the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—at the time I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> I came with a perfectly clear mind and without any knowledge at all of what had taken place—I refused to hear from Mr. Cassabianca what he had to say about the matter—he came with a policeman, and asked me to attend the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>, but I refused to hear him say anything about it; I told him I would rather go unbiassed—at the examination the symptoms were put down to poison, but we thought we Would have an exhaustive analysis and sent the stomach to Mr. Rodgers—I was very dubious as to the symptoms; there was an inflamed stomach, and that was one symptom of poisoning—I concurred in the view of the other</p>

               <p>medical men in their wish to send them, and in the reasons for which they sent those things to Dr. Rodgers for examination—I have had about thirty years experience in the treatment of brain diseases—I have not practically had special cases with regard to brain diseases—I have had general scrofula as you may call it, which is another name for general tuberculosis—I have also had cases of meningitis—those diseases generally do not last sufficiently long to produce emaciation—tuberculosis in the form of phthysis does so—tuberculosis has various forms; some lead to greater emaciation than others—the presence of tubercles in the brain, and tubercles in the lungs in that congested state of the vessels of the brain was too small in quantity to produce any bad result of tuberculosis I think—there are three membranes of the brain—the duramater, the pia mater and the arachnoid—this deposit was on the arachnoid membrane, the size of about a fourpenny or a sixpenny piece—it was very recent, quite transparent, and had not produced any inflammation—there was no inflammation present—I did not even see any congestion; it was a perfectly recent deposit—there was no congestion in the organs of the brain; I mean not connected with this tubercular deposit, there was some general congestion of the brain not dependent upon this tubercular deposit—I have had persons under my care who were suffering from brain disease—those persons for a long period differ in temperament and manner and in behaviour—persons who are afflicted with disease of the brain are very often affected in their temper which makes them sulky—I have not had experience of persons who are under the control of warders in asylums, nor have I visited persons who have been confined in asylums, neither my friends nor patients—vomitting is one of the things that may cause starvation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. I mentioned before the Magistrate that vomitting might produce starvation—I never had a case of starvation under my care—I have had a case of starvation where a patent refused to take food—it was a grown-up person of weak intellect—it was a case of imbecility—the patient refused for sometime to take food; it had to be forced down by the stomach pump—I saved the patients in that way, for I had two or three, a medical man is necessarily required to deal with a case of that kind—in this case I saw some food on the back of the tongue of the deceased woman—she had already some in the stomach; some that had been recently given her seemed of the same kind—it might have remained there from her inability to swallow, in the state in which she was—there are several writers on the subject of death from starvation—there is Kirk's "Hand-book," Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence," and Kasper's work, and one or two more I think, and there is a long account published of the Welsh fasting girl's case—Kirk does not treat it very lightly; he gives the weight of the organs and the way in which they lose weight—I did not notice anything about the brain that might have been caused in early life—I noticed no old injury to the brain, but there was slight adhesion between the dura mater and the skull-cap—I did not think much of that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE SOLOCITOR-GENERAL</hi>. Kirk's "Hand-book" gives inflammation in the stomach as one of the symptoms of poisoning—inflam<lb></lb>mation of the stomach sometimes produced by starvation is given in Taylor's Medical Jurispurdence," and Kirk's "Hand-book," as one of the symptons" of starvation—I desired the contents of the stomach to be analysed in order</p>

               <p>to ascertain by exhaustive examination, what was the cause in this particular case—when poison is excluded as the cause of the inflammation, we hare advanced one step towards ascertaining what it is not—starvation is one of the things that produce it—the several diseases that have been mentioned are characteristic of those diseases, in Addison's disease you get the bronze skin, but 1 do not think the skin of this poor woman was anything at all of that colour; it was a more parchmeuty state of skin, and with regard to diabetes there is an enormous flow of urine which cannot be concealed, and an intense thirst; life may be prolonged by medical treatment, proper diet, and so forth—there is an effect produced upon the kidneys themselves by diabetes—there was no symptom of that in this lady at all—the kidneys were healthy—the tubercles were not in the substances of the brain but on the middle membrane, the arachnoid membrane, one of the envelopes of the brain—that did not fulfil the description of the symptoms which indicates cereberal meningitis—they appear in the substance of the brain, they go through the membranes—they do not assume the form of tubercles; it is an isolated spot of tubercles on the surface of the arachnoid membrane, on the middle membrane, outside the brain.</p>

               <p>time before her death—undoubtedly those about her must have seen the condition in which she was—I have heard the suggestion of several diseases—the patient some time before her death would be able to walk very feebly and latterly unable to walk; I should say from my experience of sickness ten days at least—I was called in to one case of starvation, but then that was after the death—I have seen many cases of starvation where there has been diseases such as cancer, incessant vomiting, fever, and certain other diseases, Bright's disease of the kidneys, and so on, bat always a very long time—I have had these cases under my care—in those cases where—starvation has been caused by disease the disease has prevented the food being assimilated—the emaciation has been caused by the want of proper food—in those cases the shortest time to produce emaciation that I can call to mind was three months, of great emaciation not death; of emaciation such as I have heard described in the evidence—some diseases do produce very great emaciation—it takes a very Jong time—it must have been most certainly obvious to everybody that for some time before the death of this lady she required medical attendance—the appearance of the stomach, the duo denum, the rectum and the vagina, no matter from what cause, not poison, certainly, must have created suffer<lb></lb>ing which required medical assistance and great care—after a person has abstained from taking food for a considerable time, the effect of taking food in any quantity would be affection of the brain, congestion of the brain—it is a very dangerous thing to be—in my examination I saw nothing to indicate that the patient had been given to habits of intemperance; the liver had not the slightest appearance or indisation of habits of intoxication—if this lady had at one time indulged in liquor to excess and then had been prevented getting access to it, I should have expected in such a case as that to find some appearance, and certainly not the absence of fat in the liver—I should have expected in that case there would have been fat in the liver, and there was not a trace—during the cross-examination of the other medical witnesses I have heard suggestions made as to diabetes—I do not think the condition of this woman could have been caused by diabetes—my reason is that in diabetes there is so much suffering that medical aid would bare been required, and therefore, as no medical aid was ever sought, I believe starvation was the cause and not diabetes—there is an excessive quantity of wine in diabetes, and always excessive thirst—I have seen a great number of cases of diabetes over a lapse of something like forty years, and I have never known thirst absent—the food turns to urine, which contains a deal of sugar—diabetes is a disease of non-assimilation, and the food taken into the stomach has not much influence; the tissues of the body are con<lb></lb>verted into sugar rapidly—I found no sugar in the liver—in diabetes there is generally enlargement of the kidneys, but these kidneys were smaller than natural; the deceased's kidneys were perfectly healthy—in diabetes patients suffer pain in their limbs, particularly in the bend of the legs, and general weakness and great prostration, and they lose flesh to a very great extent—the symptoms in meningitis would have been far more urgent in requiring medical attendance, and, therefore, as I have not heard of any medical attendance, I keep to the starvation—I have not had any experi<lb></lb>ence in Addison's disease; that disease is very rare.</p>

               <p>the total absence of fat in the body is regarded by the best authorities as perfectly diagnostic of starvation—tuberculosis does produce emaciation, but in this case there was nothing in the lungs to produce emaciation what ever—there was nothing in the lungs that would account for such a state of emaciation—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—in giving my opinion that the condition of the lungs would not account for that state of emaciation here, I am not acting upon the notes that were sent me by Mr. Longrigg, but only upon the evidence I have heard to-day—Mr. Longrigg did send notes to me—if there had been excess to warrant an opinion of intemperance, even for a limited time, it would necessarily leave its marks in the organs of the body—if there was intemperance to a very slight extent in this lady, intemperance that ceased six or nine months before her death, I think I should find signs of that; there would be a little nutmeg appearance about the liver, and there would be some fattening, in this case there was a total absence of it—I am not prepared to say that where a person has discontinued the habit, and then not taken any food, and then there has been a sort of system of starvation going on, I am not prepared to say that the indication would not be removed in such case; I think the indication might be removed—in an ordinary case of a person who had contracted habits of intemperance I should, upon a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, expect to find a fatty liver; the fat in the liver might dis<lb></lb>appear supposing the intemperate person who had died had been starved—after a long process of starvation fat in the liver, the result of intemperance, might be got rid of—I cannot say exactly whether it would if the starve<lb></lb>tion, that is to say, the abstinence or privation of food, was caused by disease or not—I think three months would be the time during which the process of emaciation would be going on—I am speaking of starvation caused by disease—in consumption you frequently have a space of two or three years constantly losing flesh—my experience has not been in any case of enforced privation of food—the disease which, in my experience, in three months has led to emaciation of this kind is enteric fever—I have a very large experience in the examining and analysing substances—this case gave me a great deal of difficulty from this cause: the appearances warranted the suspicion of poison, therefore, I took a great deal of trouble, in not only analysing by two processes but by verifying the results, and I most decidedly proved the absence of any metallic poison and equally any vegetable—there was no irritant poison and there was no alkaloid poison—the case puzzled me up to the very day of the Inquest, because I could not account for the redness satisfactorily in my own mind, I thought there must still be poison, and therefore I took the trouble in the way of being puzzled to be certain that I was right in the negative results—the redness of the stomach, the duodenum, and the rectum taken together made me think there must be poison, but I disproved its existence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fellow of the College of Surgeons and a M. B. of the University of London, and practice as a surgeon—I am also a lecturer on medical jurisprudence at Westminster Hospital, and have been for some time—I have listened attentively to the evidence given in this case by the medical men, and, having heard described all the appearances which pre<lb></lb>sented themselves upon the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the deceased, my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170035"></xptr>
               <p>opinion is that the cause of death was starvation—I have had a case of abso<lb></lb>lute starvation under my care, where a woman swallowed vitriol and she got stricture of the gullet; she was unable to take any food after a time, and she died of starvation; the only food she got was food injected through the rectum, and ultimately she died from starvation; my patient died between three and four months from the time of swallowing the vitriol, through in<lb></lb>ability to swallow food—I have seen cases of persons suffering from want of food and exposure and have made <hi rend="italic">post-mortems</hi> of such cases—my patient lasted between three and four months, I am speaking from recollection; I know it was about that lime; the only nourishment she had was from inject<lb></lb>tions through the rectum; that was at the last; the gullet was entirely obliterated for about a month before she died—after swallowing the vitriol she took very little food and when she could not swallow any we injected such food as we could; in that case there was emaciation—I observed the condition of the outlets—there was a good deal of diarrhoea and inflammation about the rectum long before she died—there was a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>, which I made myself—the appearances in that case corresponded with the appear<lb></lb>ances I have heard described in this case, excepting that there was a disease in the gullet, and I do not remember that there was any congestion of the stomach; there was congestion of the brain—in a case where there has been abstention from food of a sufficient quantity for a considerable time, in fact, starvation, and then food is, suddenly administered, it would be likely to produce congestion of the stomach—in this case congestion of the rectum is spoken of; I should expect it; it is usually a symptom of starvation that that there should be congestion of the outlets—I see no reason whatever to suppose that this woman was suffering from diabetes or that she died from diabetes; my grounds for saying that are that she had no kidney disease, I have heard no history of the thirst and I have heard no history of a large quantity of urine being constantly passed—there were no motions, no hard white motions in the intestines which is generally the case in diabetes; there were no hard white foeces in the intestines which are usually found; I can-not say invariably, but usually—if there had been diabetes I should expect the kidneys to be enlarged, and probably degenerated—here, on the con<lb></lb>trary, they were smaller than usual, and they were healthy—those are my reasons for dismissing diabetes—I have never had a case of Addison's disease under my care; I have seen two or three in hospitals; it is a disease of rare occurrence—I have no reason to think from the evidence I have heard that this lady was suffering from Addison's disease—the pathology of the disease is very obscure and the symptoms are pretty well known; they are great bronzing of the skin, most marked in the cases I have seen, almost like an Indian skin, in fact I may say quite like an Indian skin; there is emacia<lb></lb>tion and very great lassitude, and it is a very long slow disease—if it had been Addison's disease the patient must have suffered for a very considerable came before her death—nobody about her could have doubted that she was extremely ill if she had suffered from Addison's disease; every one must lave seen that she was extremely ill—I do not think there is sufficient evi<lb></lb>dence to show that she suffered from the disease called tubercular meningitis, or tubercular deposit on the coating of the brain, and I do not think she died from that disease; my reasons for thinking so are that in death from tubercular meningitis there is usually a good deal of fluid effused into the ventricles of the brain; there is also usually lymph effused at the base of the brain, and there is usually more evidence of tubercles than that described</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170036"></xptr>
               <p>in the present case—there is a disease the chronic condition of which will cause emaciation an I will take a considerable time, several months, before it is fatal; during that time the patient would be very much enfeebled; there is also acute tuberculosis—I do not think in this case death was caused by acute tuberculosis—I should expect to find the brain soft, and there was no emaciation—there is also another reason, I do not know of any disease which would account for the total absence of fat in the internal organs—from the evidence I have heard I should not think that Mrs. Harriett Staunton would be able to move about easily for some time before her death—it is my opinion that for two or three weeks she would not be able to move about much or to move at all—I have heard about the removal on the 12th and am certainly of opinion that it accelerated her death; in my opionion it would be an injudicious step to take.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination nor concerned in the case in any way—I have not seen Mr. Longrigg's notes, I have seen his deposition, and have been listening to his evidence to-day, it is upon that that I form the opinion which I have just expressed, in common with Mr. Longrigg, and the other doctors—I cannot undertake to say that Addison's disease was not present—it is true that it is very often the case that when a patient is in a chronic state of wasting disease, another disease will supervene—with respect to the signs that would be visible upon a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the existence of Addison's disease they are two, the bronzed skin and the condition of the super-renal capsules—J cannot say that I noticed in Mr. Longrigg's evidence that the skin of this lady was bronzed—I think he said it was dark—I have heard that the super-renal capsules were overlooked in the course of the examina<lb></lb>tion—sugar in the urine is an unmistakable sign of diabetes; I do not say that because sugar is found in the urine it is an unmistakable sign of death from diabetes, but it is an unmistakable sign of the appearance of that disease.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. If you find sugar in the urine it is an unmistakable sign that there is diabetes, and if there is diabetes there is certain to be sugar in the urine—sugar in the urine would lead me necessarily to the conclusion that there was diabetes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. It is, after death, the one unmistakable sign—I have looked at the depositions but have looked at no notes of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—judging from the depositions I do not find the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination so completely and satisfactorily recorded as I should have done it myself; I should have recorded the weight of the brain, and the quantity of fluid in the skull if I had found a large quantity, but as there was very little there I should have taken no notice of it except that there was very little; if I had found a thinning of the coat of the stomach I should have recorded that, if is an important symptom of starvation—if I found such a bronzing of the skin as would lead my mind to the disease, I should then have examined particularly the super-renal capsules; I have never seen any thing like the bronzing in Addison's disease—the bronzing in diabetes is to a very small extent compared with the other—a slight bronzing might have directed my mind to starvation or to diabetes—I apply the word "starvation" to mean a process caused by any disease which would prevent the nutrition of the body—I cannot call to mind any specific disease, Addison's or diabetes, to which the bronzing of the face would have directed my attention—my patient, I have given an account of</p>

               <p>I fed myself, by injection, first through the gullet and afterwards through the rectum—feeding by injection would cause some congestion of those parts.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. Supposing emaciation had been caused by starvation going on for a considerable time, it would very likely lead to the deposit of tubercles—when a body becames in an enfeebled condition it is much more likely that some other disease will supervene.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. If starvation had been going on for some time, that might lead to it—I am not prepared to say it would have led to sufficient tubercles to lead to tubercular meningitis, but it might lead to a deposit of tubercles, either on the brain, lungs, or other tissues—if deposited in sufficient quantities they might produce the disease of tubercular meningitis—in a case of death by starvation I should expect a darkening of the skin, caused by the loss of vitality and the dryness of the skin.</p>

               <p>first lived there she used to take her meals with the rest of the family—that did not always continue to be so—there was an alteration just before Christimas—she was then sent upstairs more, and kept upstairs—her food was sent upstairs to her to prevent her coming down—she generally had the same food as the rest downstairs, but sometimes pudding or some<lb></lb>thing was sent up to her instead of the meat that the rest had; she complained of not having enough to eat, and on several occasions complained of not having anything sent up to her—I have heard Mr. Patrick speak very angrily to her when she has complained, and on one occasion I saw him strike her; the blow left a bruise on her arm—I afterwards saw her with a black eye; I was upstairs when he struck her—Mrs. Harriett shut the door in Mrs. Patrick's face, and then Mr. Patrick struck her, that was in the back bed-room; he struck her and pushed her down—there was a bedstead and a chair-bedstead and two boxes in Mrs. Harriett's room, but there was no basin or jug or mode of cleaning herself—I was there when the police<lb></lb>man afterwards examined that room—other things had been put into it after she was taken away—the child used to sleep beside her in a basinette—there was only a shawl to cover it—the child used to be kept upstairs with Mrs. Staunton in the back bed-room—just before Christmas I saw Mr. Patrick Staunton strike her; Mrs. Patrick has been present when he struck her, and I heard her ask Mr. Staunton to leave Mrs. Harriett alone—she had but one pair of boots the whole time she was there, and those she wore—when she was removed she had no boots on, she had a pair of Mrs. Patrick's slippers on—I think it was about three weeks before that she had boots on—the room she used to occupy was rather dirty; I sometimes cleaned it; I think 1 last cleaned it about three weeks or a month before she died or before she was taken away—I have heard Mr. and Mrs. Patrick say "Don't you come out of the room," and "Don't you come downstairs; "I cannot use the exact language Mr. Patrick used, it was such foul language, and I do not recollect all of it—I have heard him say "You must not come down-stairs you damned cat, or I will break your back; "I have heard that more than once—I have heard Mrs. Patrick say "Don't come downstairs, Harriett, we don't want you down here"—I do not recollect her coming down after that—I have known her to be without food for a day; I have asked Mrs. Patrick if I might not take it up to her, and she has said "No, let her wait"—she had no fit or sudden illness, she appeared to be gradually getting very weak—I remember the child being taken to the hospital; she was then very weak; she had never been asked about whether the child was to go—on the Sunday before she was taken away, she was very weak and bad—on the Monday a fowl was boiled for her—I remember the news being brought that the child was dead—I do not think she took much notice of it, I am not sure—the fowl was boiled for her on the Monday; she eat but very little of it, at that time she did not appear to understand anybody; she was unable to help herself on the Monday—I remember Mr. Patrick Staunton getting some steak and cutting it up very small so as to enable her to eat it; I tried to feed her with it but she was unable to swallow; that was on the Tuesday I believe—they tried to feed her with some bread and butter and milk the night she went away, but she was unable to eat it—she was put into the trap about 6 o'clock in the evening—something was said by Mr. Patriakand Mr. Louis Staunton about keeping her later—they said "We should like to keep her later for fear of the people seeing her at the Port<lb></lb>lands"—that is a house nearly opposite—Mrs. Patrick said "You had better</p>

               <p>take her at once or else she won't last the journey"—at the time that con<lb></lb>versation was going on she was in the kitchen in a chair—Mr. Patrick Stauuton carried her down in the morning, she was propped up with pillows and seemed very drowsy—Mr. Patrick Staunton tried to rouse her several times—Mrs. Patrick said "You had better let her sleep," and Mr. Patrick Staunton said "If she goes to sleep she won't wake up again in my opinion"—at the latter part of 1876, Louis Staunton was living at Little <hi rend="italic">Gray's</hi>, that is about 2 miles from the house, and from time to time he came to the Woodlands, but not always, to see his wife—I don't think I heard him speak of her, nor do I remember to have heard him say he wished to see her—I have heard him speak to her—Mr. Louis Staunton and Alice Rhodes were living at Little Gray's Farm, but Mrs. Harriett Staunton did not know where her husband was living, or that Alice Rhodes was living with him—I remember picking up a letter which I after<lb></lb>wards burnt—it was in Mr. Louis Staunton's handwriting, and addressed to Miss Alice Rhodes—I found it in Mr. Patrick Staunton's bed-room at Cudham—Alice Rhodes had been at the house, but she was not staying there then—I don't recollect all that was in the letter, only the first few lines at the beginning—it began "My own darling, I was very sorry to see you crying so much when I left you. It seems as though it would not be but there will be a time when Harriett is out of the way, when we shall be happy together," and then it said "Dear Alice, you must know how much I love you by this time; we have been together two years now"—Alice Rhodes enquired after the letter when she came back to Cudham about a week after—she asked me if I had seen a letter addressed to her, and I told her no—I had already burnt the letter—I was examined at the inquest—I cannot tell the date or the month when I found the letter—I found it at Cudham in the beginning of last year, as near as I can recollect—I believe it was the first time Alice came to stay there—she had been down from Saturday to Monday several times—I went up to the confinement in March, 1876—I believe it was after that I went to Cudham, after I had been to London to the confinement; some time in March, 1876—I remained a month, that would bring it to April; I cannot fix it nearer than that—that was the first time I think that Alice came to stay for a month or some days—I know her handwriting, but would not swear to it—the letter produced I believe to be in her handwriting, but I would not swear to it—to the best of my belief it is—I have seen her handwriting once or twice; once at Cudham when she was making out a list of something. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "August 19, 1876. Woodlands, Satur<lb></lb>day morning. My dearest Louis. I was extremely thankful to have a letter from you yesterday, as you must know it is extremely dull for me here, and baby is very fretful. I have searched all over the house for the lost letter and cannot find it, and I am sure Harriett has not got it, so where it can be I cannot tell at all. Come down to me as soon as you can, if only for a few hours, for you cannot think how happy it will make me to see your dear old face again. With affectionate love, and trusting to see you soon.

I cannot think, after your disgraceful conduct towards my mother, Mrs. Hincksman, and my husband, some months since. You also told Alice you were coining to be faced with a revolver, my husband having said something about using fire-arms.

Staunton's in August, 1876, and remained there up to her death, 12th April this year 1877—I was the only servant at Patrick Staunton's house and was in the habit of going out frequently during the whole of the time, going errands and going to the shops in the neighbourhood, and seeing different people—since I made my statement before the Coroner I made another on 29th May, I believe, and another one to Sergeant Bateman on 8th June; then one on 20th June, was a written one; I cannot say whether I made one on the 23rd or 27th June; I do not know the dates at all when I made them—I was not called as a witness before the Magistrates at Bromley—I do not recollect anything I said before the Coroner; yes, I remember being asked "Was she able to eat and drink?" and answering "She always ate heartily," and I believe I was asked a question as to whether they always had meals together, and I replied "Yes that was not true—I remember saying that Mrs. Harriett Staunton was frequently out of doors on the farm morning, noon, and night; that was not true—I am not sure whether I said before the Coroner that Patrick Staunton struck her—I remember saying that I saw the deceased's clothes; I won't swear that I did not say they were very nice, I do not recollect saying so; I do not know whether I said that they were such clothes as a lady would wear, but I remember being asked—I said her flesh was very clean from what I saw—I made her bed; I will not under<lb></lb>take</p>

               <p>to say that I said her bed was clean—I said that the night when she left the Woodlands she had on a cloth jacket, an Ulster, a blue shawl, and a rug—before she started I heard her husband say to her "Will you go?"—I cannot answer whether I said that she appeared all right, but she put her foot on the step, got hold of the brass railing, and got into the wagonette; she sat in between Mr. Staunton and Miss Rhodes—I do not think I said one word before the Coroner about Patrick Staunton saying to her "You must not come downstairs, you d——cat, or I will break your back"—I might have made the statement before 23rd June—I will not swear before she went away in the wagonette that I said she was going to a doctor—I remember being asked if I considered that she was ill and replying "No, not very ill until the Thursday afternoon"—I think I said it was between 3 and 4 o'clock and that she had sat drowsy over the fire—I should not like to say that I heard my master ask her how she was on the day that she went away and that she replied "Pretty well"—I cannot tell whether she answered or not; I might have said that she did—Mr. Patrick asked her in the morning bat I forget whether she answered him—I heard my mistress say that the child was going up to the hospital—I bslieve I said that "Mrs. Harriett Staunton hoped Mrs. Patrick would be fortunate enough to get it in as she hoped it would do it good;" that was not true, Mrs. Harriett had not said so—it was not true when I said that I heard its mother ask that it should be taken to the hospital—Mrs. Patrick Staunton did not tell Mrs. Harriett that she would take the child to the hospital—Mrs. Harriett Staunton did not know with whom her husband was living—I think I have said that Mrs. Louis Staunton knew that her husband was living with Alice Rhodes a little way off and that she was passing as Mrs. Staunton; that was false, she was not aware of it—the prisoners told me to say so before the Coroner, I swear that—I do not believe I said one word about finding the letter begin<lb></lb>ning "My own Darling, I am sorry to see you cry so" until the last time I gave a statement to the Treasury; I do not remember what the latter part of the letter was, but it-was something about the death of his father—it was six or eight months before the death of Harriett Staunton that I saw the letter I knew what it meant, and I understood what was meant by the sentence "There will be a time when Harriett is out of the way that we shall be happy together; it referred to the death of Mrs. Harriett Staunton; I destroyed the letter; I do not think I ever said one word about it until I came to give my evidence to the Treasury—Mrs. Harriett Staunton used to go out when she first came to Cudham—I have not said that she came home the worse for liquor—I might have said "I have seen her the worse for liquor;" I will not swear that I have not—I believe I saw her the worse for liquor at Brixton once, I am not sure; I went more by what I heard than what I saw; she seemed intoxicated to me—I have said that while at Cud<lb></lb>ham she went out on one occasion to a public-house in the village and told me that she had been there—I believe that was before she went down to stay at Cudham on the first or second visit—Mr. Patrick Staunton was frequently out from Christmas up to April for hours together—Mrs. Patrick Staunton used to get out sometimes, not very often; she seldom or ever went out shopping; she went out and about the Woodlands, the house and grounds, and she used to go to Little Gray's—at that time Patrick Staunton was out too, and I and Mrs. Harriett Staunton would be left at home—I was attending to my work at home—I have had some conversations with Sergeant Bateman since the inquest, I don't know how many conversations, a few, I</p>

               <p>should say, I cannot give you an idea how many; a good deal more than three or four, it may have been half a dozen; it was not much more than conversation; it was about this matter—I don't remember making a statement to him on 8th June—I remember the end of the Coroner's inquest—I don't recollect making a statement to him about a fortnight after the inquest terminated—I think I did make a state<lb></lb>ment about six or eight weeks afterwards—ho asked me questions and I answered them—I remember his saying to me that I might get myself into trouble, I don't remember his doing so more than once, I think it was only on one occasion; that was some time before I made the statement to him—I don't remember when it was that he said that to me—I don't think he said anything to me about penal servitude; I won't swear he did not—he did not say "You had better take care, or you may get penal servitude yourself; I will swear he did not say that; I don't recollect that he said anything about penal servitude—ho said that if I went on in the state as I was then I might get into trouble, because he said he knew it was not the truth—I think he used the words "Go to prison"—I think fiat was some time before I made the statement to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Inspecting Constable in the Kent County Constabulary—I have known the Woodlands for some time, nearly four years—I know that Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Staunton lived there, also Clara Brown and two children—I am not aware of anybody else—I remember in the Spring of this year some enquiry being made by Mrs. Butterfield—it was on the 5th March—I heard her say she was searching for her daughter—I had received some directions from my superintendent I did not see Mrs. Butterfield—I heard of it and received directions from Superintendent O'Kill, at Sevenoaks—in consequence of those directions I watched at the Woodlands—I watched about twenty times in all—I was in plain clothes only once—I was in the road and in the wood when watching—the wood is at the side of the Woodlands—on those twenty occasions I was watching at different times of the day; sometimes in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon—besides those times I have been in the habit of passing along the road—I never saw Mrs. Harriett Staunton or her child—I saw two children belonging to Mr. Patrick Staunton—I was not at all aware that Mrs. Harriett Staunton and her child were living at this house at that time—I was not aware at the time I was watching that she was living there—I went with the last witness inside the Woodlands on the 10th May—I went into the back bed-room—I found the floor in a very dirty condition. (<hi rend="italic">The Judge's notes of Quested's evidence were read over to the witness, which he said were correct.</hi>) I went again with Sergeant Bateman on the 20th of May into the same bed-room and found it then properly furnished—the floor bad been scrubbed clean and carpeted—there were the usual appliances of the bed-room, including a dressing table and one chair—the bedding consisted of a flock bed, two blankets, two sheets, and a white counterpane, also some clean chintz hangings round the bed—the front bed-room was the same as before, quite clean.</p>

I am a gamekeeper and live about three quarters of a mile from the Woodlands, adjoining Bombas Farm—I used to work in. the wood—the other Woodlands, that belong to Mr. Copestake—I recognise that photograph as the lady at the Woodlands—I have seen her nearly every week round the house and in the woods adjoining the Woodlands, from August, 1876, up to the end of October or the beginning of November—I remember leaving a wagonnette—I believe it was about the 19th of October—Patrick Staunton was with me, no one else—the wagonette was Mr. Louis Staunton's—the lady went away in the wagonette, I tucked her dress in at the side of the wheel—shortly after that I saw her again at Patrick Staunton's stable, the stable connected with the Woodlands—I was in the stable looking at Mr. Patrick's pony he was there too—I saw the lady come to the stable door without her bonnet—Mr. Patrick said to the lady "I have a policeman in here, if you ain't off I'll run you in"—she turned and went away towards the house—that was the last time I saw her—after that I continued to be about the wood as usual and passed by the road every day—I remember hearing about some enquiries that were made by Mrs. Butterfield—I did not know then what the lady's name was—inconsequence of what I heard I went intentionally round the Woodlands two or three times a day to see if I could see the lady—I continued to do so to almost the time that she was taken away, but never saw her—I knew the other inmates of the house, Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Staunton their two children and Clara Brown—I never knew the third child—when I last saw the lady she appeared to be in good health and properly dressed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am known at Guy's Hospital as "Sister Mary"—I was there on Sunday afternoon the 8th of April last—I remember a child being brought in; it was brought by Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Staunton between 5 and 6 o'clock—Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Stauuton were quite strangers to me—they came with the child to the ward—I asked Mrs. Patrick Staunton if she were the mother of the child, and she said no; she said the mother was unable to take care of it, and she had brought it from kindness—I told her the child would require certain articles of clothing, and they said they would bring it seme the next day—I don't remember anything more being said about the mother of the child—I asked what the child's father was, and she said a carpenter—I asked the name and address, and she gave me "Henry Stormton" as the name of the father, of Frith Cottage, Cudham—I am quite sure that the name given was "Henry Stormton"—I spelt it over and the address; I also wrote down at the time—the name has to be entered in the books of the hospital—the books are here and it is entered as "Henry Storraton"—I understood the name to be "Stormton" and I so wrote it and spelt it over—I spelt the name "Stormton" over aloud to them—nothing more was said than that I told them the child was rapidly sinking—I asked her if she would stay, but I do not remember any reply being made; they went away directly—I asked the age of the child, and Mrs. Staunton told me twelve months—it was not dressed as a child of that age should be; it was dressed as a child a month old would be—the clothes were to be sent the next day, on the Monday—they then left and the nurse took the child—I superintended it, it was under my care—I saw the child was very ill; it died at 9 o'clock the same night—it was in my ward under my care and received every attention—the doctors saw it; it gradually sank, it was not able to take any food, and it did not make any noise—it was a male child—I don't remember any tiling being said about how long the child had been ill—I remember what she said about the mother, she said the mother was unable to look after it, and that was why she had brought it; that was all that was said on that occasion—the child had been seen by Dr. Coley previously to being brought to me—I knew</p>

               <p>that from the fact of his coming to inquire if I had a bed—I don't re<lb></lb>member whether they said they had seen Dr. Coley when they brought the child into the ward—in the ordinary course they would see Dr. Coley first; they would see him at the same time—he would see whether it was a proper case for admission and sign a paper; inquiry would then be made about a vacant bed, and the persons bringing the child would come to me in the ward—I noticed the face of the child, it had a bruise on the left side on the cheek—when the conversation referred to took place, Mr. Patrick Staunton was in the ward where the child was going to be put—Mrs. Patrick carried the child to where I was to be found—Patrick Staunton was Dot near enough to hear what passed between me and his wife—I had a conversation with him the next day—they did not give any name—on Monday Patrick came to the hospital about 5 o'clock, and I saw him—he was brought to me by the nurse—he had a parcel with him which I supposed contained clothes for the child—I told him the child had died the night before, and I directed him to go to the superintendent's office to arrange about the removal of the body—he said he had done it from kind<lb></lb>ness, that the mother was a worthy woman; he did not say who the child was; he said it was nothing to do with him; that was all that passed—he took the bundle of what I supposed to be clothes away, and I left him to make arrangements about the removal of the body—I saw the child naked.</p>

I am an undertaker, of 30, St. George's Road, Southwark—on 10th April last, Louis Staunton came to me to make an arrangement for the burial of a child named Henry Staunton, lying dead at Guy's Hospital—he gave the name of John Harris—he said the child was to be buried inexpensively, as the father of the child was away in the country there would be no one to follow the child—he then asked if it could be removed from the hospital as soon as possible, as they wanted it removed—he said the father of the child was employed by the firm he (John Harris) represented—he did not give me the name of the firm—he then asked what the expense would be—I told him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he gave me, and I gave him a receipt for the amount in the name of Harris—the receipt produced is in my handwriting, and is the one I gave him.

(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "The Woodlands, Cudham, Tuesday. My dear Louis,—I was very sorry to see it rain so soon after you left here yesterday morning. I am afraid you got very wet. It rained here incessantly until about 5 o'clock, and then I went as far as Roberts' to try and get some jam pots, but I could not get them anywhere. I had a good walk with Florie this morn<lb></lb>ing to get Tommy's milk. You cannot tell how I missed my dear old sweety, and I hope he was not in mischief last night. Not that I think you would do it intentionally, but feeling dull might call on——, and take strawberries and cream. I think myself it might be tempting. Come down as soon as you can, and then I shall have a great deal to tell you. Come down without Harriett if you can, when you take me home. The men have just come to take the hay here. Hoping I shall see my own darling soon, I remain his truly affectionate wife, Alice. I am not bad yet.) This is the draft letter found in the house at Mrs. Goodinge's. (" Mrs. Butterfield,—I really am astonished at your audacity and impertinence after your shameful and unnatural behaviour such as no mother in the whole world would have acted towards her own child. Rest assured I would cast myself into a lion's den to be devoured at once rather than come within arm's length of you, having come to the fullest determination to have nothing to do with you or your family. I have been again to my solicitor to-day, and we have given instructions for you to be taken into custody at once should you Continue to molest me. With regard to the ill-treatment you allude to its quite the reverse, having received the greatest kindness from Tom and fancy since I have been in their house, and I must protest against such assertions.") On Thursday. 24th May, I went to the Woodlands again, and found this letter, signed "Harriett"—it was in the large bed-room—it dropped from behind the wash-stand or dressing-table with some other papers when I moved it—I found some castor oil and other drugs—I afterwards went to Mr. Bradford's and got the box that has been referred to—he key referred to fitted the box—I made a list of the contents—I also lade a list of the clothing that I found at the Woodlands.</p>

I now say that the food was put before her, but whether she ate it or not I cannot say—what I have said, both to the Treasury and before the Coroner, I was told to say by the prisoners them selves"—I do not remember when that statement was made—I cannot tell you whether I told her of her liability to imprisonment, before or after she made that statement to me—I have no recollection of the date—I told her on two occasions of her liability to imprisonment if she' kept on in the way she was going, and stated what was natrue—the last occasion I told her so was 24th May; no, I cannot say whether that was the first or the last, but one occasion was on the 24th May, when she went to Cudham with me—I do not know the date when I took her to live at Penge, it was fourteen or fifteen weeks ago—I did not then have a conversation with her on the subject, but I expect I had a conversation with her in respect to this charge—I did not tell her on that occasion that she might get herself into trouble—I took her to Penge because it was arranged that she should go there to live—she came from her aunt's at Heygate Street—she had no relations at Penge—a number of witnesses come from Penge—the Treasury paid her expenses, and I took her where I pleased—I live at Penge, and I took her there to be under my eye—she has been there ever since, and she came from there to-day.</p>

I asked her how long she had been at her place and she said 'Some months'"—I did say "I asked her how long she had been at Her place, she said 'Some months'"—I said that she had known her some time and she said "It is some months"—I asked Mrs. Patrick Staunton whether Mrs. Harriett had ever slept away from the house and she replied "No, not once"—that was referring to Mrs. Patrick's house—in addition to the answer she gave to my question whether she had sufficient to eat and drink, she said that she was very fond of a drop of spirits—that was in my original notes—I asked Mrs. Patrick whether it was possible for her to get to a chemist's shop, and she said that it was not—when I asked her about the state of health of the deceased lady the reply she made was "She has not been ill, but rather poorly for a few days, the last day or two before her removal she did not care to eat without being forced to do so"—I did not tell that in my examination in chief because I</p>

From May to November, last year, I lived at No. 6, Corby Terrace, Upper Norwood. I was there an auctioneer. I married the deceased, Harriett Richardson, in June, 187"), at Clapham Church. There was no marriage</p>

               <p>settlement. One boy was born on the 23rd March, 1876. He died 8th April, 1877, from convulsions.' He died in Guy's Hospital. My wife was quite well up to Monday, 10th April last; she then complained of her feet swelling. I reside at the farm alone with Alice Rhodes. I have no servant. I have been separated from my wife since November last, by private arrangement. She lived at my brother Patrick's, at Frith Cottage, Cudham, about a mile and a half from my farm. I supported her, and allowed my brother one pound a week. I saw my wife two or three times a week there. I was on very good terms with her. She was addicted to excessive drinking almost daily; she drank spirits. I saw her on Saturday, 8th April; I had tea there; she was quite well On Tuesday, 10th April, she was not so well, but she ate well; in fact, she was always craving for food. She was not allowed any spirits. Her face was swollen with a cold. I stopped there to tea and supper. On Wednesday I sent round some new laid eggs by Alice Rhodes, who brought word she was not so well. I immediately; went there; she was sitting over the fire, and appeared very drowsy. I asked her how she was; the only remark she made was 'Pretty well' I asked her what she was going to have for dinner, if she could not eat a steak. She said 'No, your brother has killed a fowl for me.' I then left. I went again in the evening and consulted as to what had better be done, as she did not appear to be getting any better. I suggested I should go up on Thursday morning and look for a place nearer London where we might get advice for her. On Thursday morning Mr. Patrick Staunton came with me to Penge. We drove to Bromley, and came on by train. I knew Penge very well to be a place where they let a good many apartments, and also where there are a great many medical men. I saw apartments to let in the window of a house in Forbes Road from the train. I went there and took the apartments at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and extras. I told the landlady it was for an invalid lady, and I thought it was a sort of paralysis. I said I would bring her about half-past 9 that night. I paid a deposit of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I did not say who she was. On Wednesday her memory appeared to fail her. My brother's household consists of himself and wife, two children (girls), 3 years and 15 months old, and the servant Clara Brown, and my wife, and nobody else. I am told by my brother that Clara Brown is related to his wife. Up to Monday, April 9th, my wife was in a perfect state of good health. Mr. Richard James Bradford visited at my brother's. The mother and sister of deceased did not visit her. My wife declined to see her relations, because, before the marriage, they tried to make her out insane, and put her into a lunatic asyium, and it gave such a hatred of them that she would never have anything to do with them since we were married; in fact, she had always quarrelled with her mother. I have seen Mrs. Butter<lb></lb>field at Brixton when she saw her daughter. She has not seen her since—I saw Mrs. Butterfield myself about two months ago at Cudham. Mrs. Patrick Staunton was there. I did not tell her where my wife was. My wife was not at my farm. Mrs. Butterfield asked to see her. I told her on no consideration would her daughter see her, nor would I allow her to do so. I heard that inquiries were being made indirectly as to where she was. She wrote twice to her mother, once when living at Brixton, requesting her never to call upon her again after her shameful conduct. My wife asked mo to write a letter and date it from 'Brighton,' and to post it there to make her mother believe she was down there. I wrote the letter, and I went to Brighton and posted it. In the same envelope there was a letter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170070"></xptr>
               <p>from my wife to her. It was about 3 o'clock on Thursday, April 12th, that we returned from Penge. My wife said she would get herself ready as soon as possible. I said I would be round about half-past 6 with my trap, a small wagonette with one horse. Alice Rhodes went to Frith Cottage in the afternoon. When I got there they were not quite ready. Deceased was in the parlour, they had dressed her once, but she had to be re-dressed again. She had the run of the house there. She had a private bed-room to herself. When ready I assisted her on one side, and my brother on the other, to the trap. She was able to walk with support. She assisted herself up into the trap, put up one of her legs, and her hand out to catch hold of the rail. She sat on the front seat between me and Alice Rhodes. My brother and his wife went with us. it was dark. We drove to Bromley Station. It was my intention to drive right up, but I thought it would save trouble taking the train from Bromley. We had a first class compartment to ourselves. The train was just coming in. I asked them to stop the train as I had an invalid lady. The deceased was taken out of the trap and put into the train. We came to Penge. During the journey in the train she appeared very exhausted, was not able to speak. She got worse during the journey from Cudham to Bromley. At Penge a chair was got for her. Alice Rhodes and Mrs. Patrick Staunton went on to the lodgings to see that everything was ready. A cab was sent for and she was put into it by myself and brother. We could not get close to the house owing to the state of the road. The cabman assisted. She was not carried. The cabman did carry her from the gate up the steps into the house into the bed-room. The front door was open. Mrs. Patrick Staunton and Alice Rhodes came up for the pur<lb></lb>pose of stopping with her while she was ill, at least Alice Pthodes was to have stopped. My wife was on friendly terms with Alice Rhodes; very friendly. She had been with us since six months after our marriage. Whilst they were undressing her I went to Mr. Longngg's, he was not at home. I saw his assistant, and left word for Mr. Longrigg to come round at once, as my wife appeared so exhausted. I was told he would be in shortly. I then went back to the house. I did not seek any other medical man. I went again to Mr. Longrigg's and his assistant said he would leave a note for him to come in immediately be returned. I said 'I will sit up for him all night.' About half-past 11 o'clock I went to the train and returned to Cudham. After she was in bed she appeared rather better, and said 'I am tired,' that is all I heard her say. I took no advice as to removing her from Cudham, nor was she attended by any medical man there. Mr. Longrigg was a perfect stranger to me, I never said to Mrs. Chalklin or to any one that she had been attended by a medical man—I suggested on Wednesday to Mrs. Patrick Stauntou that she should see Dr. Creasy. She said 'He is no good, I have no faith in him, far better take her to London." I thought if any physician was wanted that I should sooner get him at Penge than I could at Cudham. Dr. Creasy lives at Brasted. I saw Mr. Longrigg the morning we took the apartments. I told him I wished him to attend her, and I did not exactly know what was the matter with her, her feet were swollen, and he seemed to understand the case, I did not tell him anything at all about the medical man having attended her, or that Dr. Creasy had seen her. I did not say that Dr. Creasy and other medical men had been attending her. I said the only doctor in the neighbourhood was Dr. Creasy, but he was so far off it would be better to bring her up—I told him I believed it was a sort of paralysis, that she had lost her memory and shook</p>

               <p>a good deal. I returned on Friday, at 11 o'clock. My wife was then insensible. My brother came with me. I found the nurse there. I remained until she died. I was not present in the room at her death. Alice Rhodes had left, Mrs. Patrick Staunton was with me. Her death was announced to me by the nurse. It was the drink that caused the separation between us. The marriage was not with the full sanction of her family, I had some property with her. I had derived benefit to the amount of between two and three thousand pounds. She was entitled to some reversion, which I have sold. The deceased herself wished to be brought up near to London. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. The child was brought up to Guy's Hospital, and died the same day. The child's name was Thomas Henry Staunton, aged one year. I paid the undertaker 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to bury it at Plaistow, in Essex. The child died on the 8th April last, and was buried on the 16th April. I did not attend the funeral My wife was told of his death. I did not inform my wife's family. I never went to Guy's Hospital myself. I am 26 years of age. My wife was 35 years. Alice Rhodes is 20 years of age. My wife was not of weak intellect; I never noticed it. I did not hear the police were in search of her, or that her mother had been to the Bromley Magistrates for their aid to find her. I know of no one who ever saw her outside my brother's house. I cannot name any one whoever saw her the worse for liquor. I never noticed her emaciation until the Wednesday, 11th April. She was not neglected. She was always clean in her person and dress, but she has always since her marriage had lice in, her hair, her false hair. There was nothing the matter with her but a cold. No box of clothes was brought with her, a hamper with some food. She dropped one of her slippers when carried from the trap to the railway carriage at Bromley Station. She did not speak of supper. She was not conscious when I left Penge. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GYE</hi>. She would drink if she could get it. I have seen her outside my brother's house. She was a great eater. She was well clothed and had plenty of clothes. She never complained of not being comfortable. She wrote to her mother twice. Until the Monday she was not ill. In the trap a blanket was round her feet. She had her Ulster on, and a shawl, and a rug. Alice Rhodes passed as Mrs. Staunton all the time we have lived at Cudham, and as my wife. I am not aware that my wife knew it We left Norwood the last week in October. Deceased was at Cudham last summer for a short time. Alice Rhodes did not pass as Mrs. Staunton before we came to Cudham. I don't know whether Alice Rhodes is expecting to be confined. The deceased passed as 'a relative' at my brother's.""</p>
               <p>Alice Rhodes, of Little Gray's Farm, Cudham, single woman, says:—I left Little Gray's Farm, about three weeks ago, and I went to No. 3, Park Villas, Lower Norwood, at Mr. Bradford's an auctioneer, where I am now staying. I have known him two years. I knew the deceased six years. I went to reside—at Loughborough Park with Mr. and Mrs. Louis Staunton about six months after they were married. Deceased. said she wished me to remain with her until she went to Norwood. About November she went to Cudham to Mr. Patrick Staunton's, and I went to Little Gray's Farm to keep house for Mr. Louis Staunton. I passed as Mrs. Louis Staunton there, but never before. I often saw the deceased. I did not know she was ill until Wednesday, the 11th April, and she was not very M then. Mr. Staunton sent me to see how she was. I accompanied her to Penge on Thursday. Mrs. Staunton asked me to go with her; she sat between us in an open conveyance. The cabinan carried her into the house,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170072"></xptr>
               <p>but she was able to walk. She undressed herself and took out her own earrings, and was put to bed immediately. She took a little egg that night; In the morning she was a great deal worse. I did not remain until she died; I left about 1 o'clock. I do not know whether she knew about the death of her child. At Cudham she was not attended by any medical man; there was no occasion for it. She was in good health; her illness came on suddenly, I cannot account for it. She was not of weak intellect; she was a little nervous. I never heard of her friends seeking to find her. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. I saw Mrs. Butterfield at London Bridge Station. She asked me how her daughter war, and where. I told her she was at Brighton with her child and husband, but I did not know her address. I did not tell her what name had been given to the child. I did not tell her I had not seen Mr. Louis Staunton for months. I knew the deceased was not at Brighton, but at Cudham; I said it for a <hi rend="italic">blind</hi>; deceased asked me to tell her mother so. She said she had written to her mother to say she was at Brighton and advised me to say the same. I never saw the deceased at any shops at Cudham. She never cared to go out. Latterly she walked down Cudham, once or twice, not very long ago. I do not know of any visitors coming to Mrs. Patrick Staunton's house. I have seen her outside the meadow several times and generally alone. She did not want to see the tradespeople. I should not say she was of weak intellect, but she was particularly nervous. She disliked being alone. I went to her house, not to manage it for her, but to help her to manage it, to assist her. She was not under the influence of other persons, nor was she easily frightened when harshly spoken to. She appeared to be very fond of her child and nursed it herself. I do not know whether she grieved at its death. She was very weak the evening she left Cudham, but I daresay she could have walked alone had she tried. She was too ill to tell me why she was coming to Penge. She got worse on the journey. She was not able to converse with me freely; she was too ill She helped herself to bed and unfastened her things as quickly as she was able. I did not see that she was in a filthy state; I did not know that she was covered with lice; I did not notice the dirty state she was in. I have seen her the worse for drink, both at Loughborough Park and at Norwood, and 1 think once at Cudham. I never spoke to her of the death of her child, nor did she ever allude to it; I thought that strange. Mr. Louis Staunton took the child to the hospital. Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Staunton were in the trap also. They came back to the farm and said they had left the child at the hospital. They stopped all night and went home on the Monday morning. I heard on the Monday night it was dead. The deceased was quite able to take the journey when we started from Cudham. We sat up all night, expecting the doctor. I intended while we stayed at that house to sleep with the invalid in the same bed."</p>
               <p>"Elizabeth Ann Staunton, wife of Patrick Llewellyn Staunton, an artist of Woodlands, Cndham, sworn, says:—The deceased came to us in November last in a perfect state of health. She had a wish to stay with me. She has been in good health ever since until Monday, 9th April last On Sunday, 8th April, I took the child to Guy's Hospital. I gave there the name of 'Henry Staunton.' I believe the child had another name, bat I do not know it. The child was ill. My husband went with me. Louis Staunton waited at the hospital gate for us. We left the child about 4.30. On Monday night, 9th April, I heard of its death; my husband told me. He had been to take it sonic clothes, and found it was dead. It died on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170073"></xptr>
               <p>the Sunday night soon after we left it in the hospital. I went with the deceased to Penge. She was sitting by the kitchen fire before we started. I helped her to dress. She put her own earrings in. Her hair was always done every morning before breakfast. She always appeared very nice and always had clean clothes. The cabman helped to carry her in. She sat up and began to undo her dress. She thanked me and appeared sensible then. I laid on the bed by the side of her after 3 o'clock a.m. We were expecting the doctor. I left the house about 5 o'clock p.m. I had previously told the landlady she was dead. The deceased requested me to come with her to Penge. Mr. Louis Staunton told the landlady and also the medical man that he was her husband. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. It was first arranged that the deceased should go to Penge on the Thursday. She had never complained. She was always a thin person. She always had her meals at the same table with ourselves. She was constantly out. The doors were always open. I have seen her out six times at least. I saw her write one letter to her mother. Dr. Creasy once attended my little girl about September last. We took a wicker basket to Penge with us containing clothes for the deceased, and a small parcel containing eggs and butter. I saw Mrs. Butterfield at Little Gray's Farm making inquiries about her daughter. I did not hear her say If I could Only hear my daughter's voice I would be satisfied.' I do not know whether the child was ever christened. The deceased was not at all a woman of weak intellect. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GYE</hi>. She always had meals at our table; plenty of food. She came down to breakfast daily and washed and dressed herself regularly. She did as she liked and wore what she pleased. She had plenty of clothes, was always well dressed, and clean and fit to be seen. She had several dresses and jewellery. She could go in and out as she liked. My husband was not satisfied with Dr. Creasy when he attended our little girl. We had to hurry away on Thursday. We had no visitors at Cudham. I told Mrs. Butterfield I had dined with the deceased not twenty minutes ago. She said it was a lie. I had directions from Mr. Louis Staunton not to give deceased any spirits. I have not paid Dr. Creasy's bill; I suppose my husband has. Mr. Louis Staunton did not mention Dr. Creasy's name to Mr. Longrigg when we called on him."</p>
               <p>"Patrick Llewellyn Staunton, of Woodlands, Cudharn, artist, eworn, says:—I am brother to Mr. Louis Staunton. In November last I agreed to board and lodge the deceased and her child at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week. She came in perfect health. She partook of our meals at our table as a relation. My brother desired me to prohibit the deceased the use of spirits, as she had taken them too freely. I had twice seen her the worse for liquor at Brixton, soon after she was married, and many times since, indeed, constantly. I did not see any change in her health until Monday, the 9th April, and then only knew it from what she told me of her feet being swollen; her feet were put into hot water and she was then put to bed by my wife and my servant. My servant waited upon her constantly and regularly. I saw her as she was going up to bed and afterwards when she was in bed; the servant told me she was awake, and I went in to ask her how she was. She answered that she felt all right and the next morning she got up in the usual way. I went the next day to see my mother, at Brixton, and I told her the deceased was not well. I went to Guy's Hospital on Monday, the 9th April. I started at 10 o'clock, got back about 4. I drove to Bromley, then took the train. At Guy's I went into the office and saw</p>

               <p>clerk I was told the child was dead. I called at my brother's and told him of the death. I stayed there about half an hour. I then went home. I told the deceased and she said 'I thought as much,' and she walked out of the room. I swear this positively. She asked no questions, but walked out of the room. Her husband came to see her in the afternoon. I was not present. On Wednesday morning her husband advised and I recommended her removal. She was consulted and consented to go to Penge. He and my wife went to take apartments, and on their return I assisted her in and out of the trap. She did not speak. I don't know that she was insensible. I don't know that she was carried into the train, as my brother was on one side of her and I on the other side, and she put her foot on the ground. She was carried on a chair from the train and put into a cab, and the cabman assisted me to carry her into the house and into the room. She seemed to be then more sensible. She did not speak. I remained until half-past 10, when I accompanied my brother to the doctor's. I left at about 11, and returned to Cudham. The next day I came up with my brother about 11, and was told she had had an epileptic seizure, but no information was given me that she was dying. I left about 2 o'clock and went to my mother's to tell her she was very ill. On my return I found every one had left, and a message for me, and I went to Bromley. There I met my brother at the station. Me had been to tell my mother. The child was born at Brixton; 8, Loughborough Park. I believe it was registered. Dr. Russell, of Coldharbour Lane, attended at the confinement, and recommended a nurse, who remained the usual time, the month. The child was named Thomas Henry. The child was brought to my house, at Cudham, some months before the deceased came in November. It slept in a cot in our room, and my wife attended to it assisted by the servant, Clara Brown. On Saturday, the 7th April, it had convulsions; it was always a thin child, almost all skin and bone. The deceased suggested that it should be carried to Guy's Hospital No medical advice was had. On Sunday it was worse, and I and my wife and my brother went up with it to Guy's. My brother waited outside the hospital and I and my wife went in and left the child with the doctor. I did not attend the funeral. I knew that Alice Rhodes was passing as my brother's wife, as Mrs. Staunton, but I did not know there was any criminal connection whatever. I cannot say whether she so passed for a deception or not. I took the Woodlands two years ago, leaving Brixton to go there on account of my profession. I was not assisted in taking the house in any way with money got from the marriage of my brother with the deceased. The child who died was the child of the deceased.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. Clara Brown was at Brixton, in March 1876, at the time of the confinement. In August, 1876, the deceased visited us at Cudham, and stayed a week with the child. She visited us four or five times; she was then living at Norwood. When with us she had perfect health; she was not a person of weak intellect and was perfectly capable of managing her household and her own affairs. We had no visitors, but Mr. Bradford. The deceased used to go out for—walks. We have seven acres of ground, she used to go in the wood and on the public road. I have seen my brother drive her out in a wagonette. I knew that Alice Rhodes passed as his wife; the deceased passed as a relation. My brother and Alice Rhodes came constantly to our house, three or four times a week, and deceased sat down at the same table with them and us, and partook of our</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170075"></xptr>
               <p>meals and made no objection and showed no jealously. Deceased was in perfect health till the Monday, 9th April, washed and dressed her child herself. Deceased knew Dr. Creasy had attended my child, when it had been ill, knew that he had called five or six times, but she did not suggest he should be sent for to attend on her own child. She suggested it should be sent to Guy's; she said when told of its death 'I thought as much. She never asked where it was buried, nor the name of the doctor, nor what ward it was in, nor express any wish to see the body of the child, nor as to wbrt members of her family should attend the funeral. Deceased was in perfect health. I saw no change in her till the Monday. I did not send for Dr. Creasy, as I have no faith in him. It would take twenty minutes to go to my brother's. He had a wagonette which could have fetched a medical man in half an hour, but no medical advice was sought.—Deceased had a slight impediment in her speech on the Tuesday, a slight stutter. Although I knew that the child died immediately subsequent, to removal it did not occur to me to take medical advice previous to removing the mother. I suggested taking her to Penge, so that a physician might be obtained, should the doctor there think it necessary, but I did not consider her so seriously ill as to require a physician. I did not call on Mrs. Hincksmau, on the Wednesday. The distance from my house to the station is about 8 miles, then there was the railway journey making it about 10 miles altogether. I do not know how long it took us to drive. It takes me about an hour to drive it. I met Mrs. Butterfield, at London Bridge, one day, and she enquired about the deceased. She abused me and got a great crowd round us. I had arrived from Cudham, by the train. I told her that her daughter was quite well. She said "No, she was not, she was confined in a asylum. I told her she was not in an asylum, and she swore at me and I walked away then. I did not say 'Damn your daughter.' I never used such a word. She said 'I am going to Cudham.' I never said 'If you do I'll blow your brains out, as I keep a loaded gun.' I did not use that expression, nor any similar expression. I said I did not see what she could gain by going to Cudham. I said she would not see her daughter, because I knew she would not be allowed to Bee her. I was at London Bridge Station the railway porters were there, and a crowd she collected round us. I did not knew that she had applied on the 9th April last, to the Magistrates at Bromley. I never heard of it. The removals of the deceased and the child were not in order to evade registering the deaths in the district, or to avoid inquiries. I made no inquiry as to what district Penge was in, nor did I know in what district it was. While in the trap the deceased made some remark about a dog, and she also spoke to her husband. She said nothing about the slipper that was dropped. I was not aware that she had lice upon her, and I was much surprised to hear it. When I first knew her she was a very cleanly person, and she dressed as a lady should. I was at Penge on Sunday, 15th April I then saw Mr. Lougrigg. I went to see him to ask why the funeral did not take place after his giving his certificate; we thought there must be some mistake. I id not go to the undertaker's. The undertaker and Sergeant Bateman came to Cudham to my brother's, and by chance I was there. I undertake to say that I saw the deceased the worse for drink at least three times while she was in my house; I do not know how she got the drink. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GYE</hi>. The deceased looked after her child herself, washed and dressed it, looked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170078"></xptr>
               <p>after it in every way until its illness and removal. The child had plenty of clothes; clothes were brought to my house for the child several times by my brother. The deceased bad plenty of clothes of very good description. She looked after her own clothes and the child's. My wife did not interfere, She was allowed to do just as she liked; she went out and about of her own free will; there was no sort of restraint put upon her, none whatever. The child had pretty good health, but was always thin, it had never had a lie attack before. I was much dissatisfied with Dr. Creasy and did not, there fore call him in. Deceased understood the child was ill and understood the purpose of its going to London. She was quite well up to the Monday. It was on the Wednesday she stammered, not on the Tuesday. She appreciated the suggestion that she should go to Penge, and was willing to go. I noticed nothing wrong with her, except the swelling of the feet, and she said her throat seemed a little sore, she said she thought she had a cold. She put one hand on my shoulder and the other on the rail of the trap and put her foot on the step to get into the vehicle. She had list slippers, because her feet were swollen, and she had a blanket to keep them warm. Clothes were taken with her in a lady's travelling basket, a wicker basket, lined inside. I did not pack it, but as far as I know, that basket was full of clothes. There were no appearances in the deceased which, in my judgment, rendered it unwise to take the journey, none whatever. It took us about an hour and a quarter to drive. I had not the slightest idea that her death was so near, or that her stace was in any way dangerous. She had no influence exercised over her to induce her to go. During the time she was in my house she was, in my opinion, capable of taking care of herself. I said Mrs. Butterfield would not be allowed to see her, not that she could not see her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Alice Bhodes saw Mrs. Butterfield on a different occasion. There was no particular reason for having the door of the lodgings at Penge ready opened; the landlady could have opened it if we had rung the bell I contradict the statement of the lady that she did not know until an hour and a half after we arrived that we were in the house, she knew it under the hour. I do not know whether the child had any godfather or godmother. It is about a mile to my brother's farm from my house, in twenty minutesl can walk it, at an ordinary pace. The deceased was not kept secreted. I did not telegraph to my brother to warn him that Mrs. Butterfield was coming down. There were no precautions and no pains taken to keep her private. I never knew the inspector and sergeant on duty at Sevenoaks were about my place. I swear positively that 1 neither directly or indirectly bad information of any application to the Bromley Bench of Magistrates. I presume Penge is in the County of Surrey; I did not think about what district it was in. We talked of driving all the way, but we did not know the road, and I think that was the reason we took the train. When I took the deceased there I did not think anything at all about what county it was in. I did not tell the deceased on the Sunday night about the child. I stayed at mj brother's, as it was a pouring wet night. I told her nothing about it until I told her on the Monday night that it was dead. She was not restrained in any way, only with regard to the drink. I have not paid Dr. Creas's account, unless my wife has."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a batchelor of medicine at the University of Oxford, a member of the Royal College of Physicians, assistant lecturer on pathology at St. Thomas' Hospital, examiner in pathology at the University of Edinburgh, and editor of Jones and Sieveking's "Manual of Pathological Anatomy"—I have had a large experience of <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations, and have been engaged in the study of subjects relating thereto for several years—a summary of the depositions of the medical witnesses taken before the Magistrates, and copies of the notes of be <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination were submitted to me by letter by Messrs. Lewis and Lewis—I forget the precise date, about the end of July this year—it was before the last Sessions of this Court—I was anxious not to be called as a witness upon general grounds, but not with reference to this particular case—I have been in attendance during the trial except the first day—I was here on Thursday and heard all the medical evidence on that day; I heard Dr. Longrigg say that the symptoms he discovered were inconsistent with tubercular meningitis, and inconsistent with rigidity of the arm—if 1 understood rightly Mr. Longrigg was asked whether the symptoms observed by him would be consistent with a disease known as tubercular meningitis, and he answered that if the disease were sufficiently established the symptoms would correspond with one exception, that exception being rigidity of the arms—in my experience, rigidity of the limbs one or more, is very common—the rigidity of one or more limbs is a very common symptom of tubercular meningitis, the present case at all events—I believe that symptom is mentioned in most, if not all the books on the subject—the appearance in cases of tubercular meningitis of a flattening and bulging of the sides of the lobes of the brain depends on the amount of fluid contained in the brain, and if the amount of fluid is small that appearance is not produced—in my opinion the absence of it is consistent with the fact of death being caused by tubercular meningitis—with respect to the position of the tubercles found in the brain, they are found in different parts of the brain, in different situations—undoubtedly they vary very much in number and appearance as well as position—the symptoms spoken of, namely, the flattening and bulging of the lobes of the brain, and the effusion into the</p>

               <p>ventricles vary very much—they are much more marked when the tubercles are found at the base of the brain—I think the fact of death from tubercular meningitis is consistent with the fact of no tubercles being found at the base of the brain—I should add to that, no tubercles visible to the naked eve—in the event of tubercles being found in the upper part of the brain, it is very likely, by microscopic examination, you would find that there were appearances which were not visible to the naked eye—it is probable that if you found tubercles in one part of the membrane of the brain, there exists the probability that on a microscopic examination you would find others in other parts which were not visible to the naked eye—if you found some tubercles which were visible to the naked eye, it is possible by microscopic examination you would find more in other parts of the surface of the brain—I heard the statement made by Dr. Longrigg in regard to the average weight of different portions of the body—of some of them I took a note, but I am not sure that I did of all—I heard Dr. Longrigg say that the average weight of a woman of 5 feet 5 1/4 inches high would be from 9 to 10 stone—I think a much lower—weight than 9 stone would be consistent with health—the weights of different organs of persons in health vary very considerably.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. I think the weight of the heart as stated in this case to have been 7 3/4 ozs. is very much below the normal weight for a person in a healthy condition—I do not say below the average weight—I say below the weight consistent with ordinary health, bat only a little below it—I understood the liver to weigh 2 lbs. 2 oz.—whether that is correct I do not know—in my experience the average weight of the liver of a woman like the deceased as stated, viz. from 50 to 60 ozs. is somewhat too high—I should say probably 48 or 50 ozs. giving a rough estimate; about 3lbs.—it is very" difficult to say what the lowest weight would be, compatible with health—I think the weight of the liver was much below the average—with regard to the spleen which is said to have weighed 4 3/4 ozs., that is an organ—the weight of which is very variable, so that no very great importance can be attached to it—with regard to the kidneys the weights I took down were 3 3/4 and 4 ozs. respectively—those weights seem to me to be scarcely below the normal weights, a little below the normal but very little—I heard the statement that inflamation of the peritoneum was discovered on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I do not think that is a symptom which would arise from deprivation of food, taken alone—with regard to the congestion of the brain and stomach, and of the outlets of the body, I do not think deprivation of food, taken alone, would produce congestion of the brain or congestion of the stomach—with respect to the condition of the outlets that is mentioned in several books as occurring in people who are deprived of food—I understand by that that the orifices of the body which are exposed to the air and to irritation, such as the lips, the nose, the anus and so on become inflamed—I have never seen it, but I have heard it described, or rather read the description—the congestion of the brain I should attribute to the tubercular disease which is described as having been present there; the inflamation of the peritoneum I cannot explain, unless there were possibly tubercles present there also—in other words I regard the tubercles and the congestion, as a part of the same disease—this kind of tubercular disease in the brain, namely the small</p>

               <p>milliary tubercles, accompanied by great congestion in most cases indicate) a general infection of the whole body which we call acute general tuber<lb></lb>culosis—my judgment as to that was greatly confirmed by the presence of tubercles in the lungs—with regard to the inflamation of the peritoneum, that in my judgement might be produced by tubercles invisible to the naked eye—bronzing of the skin is nearly always present in Addison's disease, and there is some approach to it in diabetes—I do not know of any other certain indication of diabetes than sugar in the urine after death—in Addison's disease 1 know of no other invariable sympton except the condition of the super-renal capsules—I think the traces of intemperate habits are discoverable after death, if the intemperate habits have lasted a long time—if they have only lasted for a few months and had been discontinued I think the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances would be fallacious—we often have people in the hospitals who have formerly been intemperate—I have no doubt 1 have had <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations under such circumstances, but 1 cannot recollect any particular one at the moment; after a few month's discontinuance there might be no trace—tubercular meningitis or tubercolis does not so much produce emaciation, as it is a fact accompanied by it, and sometimes produced by it; it would produce it if it lasted long—it is not so much a consequence as an accompaniment and sometimes a precursor; it is not so much produced by it as proceeded by it—he loss of flesh is sometimes the only premonitory symptom of tubercular meningitis—it is often the only premonitory symptom, which comes before the outbreak of other symptoms—when it does manifest itself it is a rapidly fatal disease—by rapidly, I mean from two days to a month perhaps—it is quite possible that up to the time the disease actually manifests itself, progressive emaciation is the only symptom—in my judgment I think if the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances are correctly described, of course I am not responsible for the description, but if they are correctly described I think they are consistent with death from tubercular disease—with regard to the symptoms during life which have been described, as coma, unequal dilitation of the pupils, rigidity of the arms, and stertorous breathing, I think they are quite consistent with death from this decease—I think starvation alone does not explain either all the symptoms before death or all the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances—in the course of my experience I have seen death result from that disease in a considerable number of children and a considerable number of adults—not from starvation, from this disease—I may say that I have had considerable experience of this disease at the hospital for children where I was formerly assistant physician—I have seen it chiefly in children, and also in adults, the disease being far less common in adults than in children—in the course of my practice I have seen emaciation to a very great extent; I could not however say to the same extent as in this case without having seen the thing myself—I am not prepared to express an opinion as to the degree without having seen it—I can quote a particular case from memory—it was the case of a child an out-patient at the hospital for children—I attended the child there and afterwards at it's own home—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination and found that it died of tubercular meningitis combined with some tubercles in the lungs, and it was so emaciated that I remember particularly a remark made by the mother who was ex<lb></lb>tremely affectionate—she asked me to explain the death of the child, because she said the neighbours accused her of starving it—I was told that the condition of the child gave rise to the suspicion of starvation in the minds of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170083"></xptr>
               <p>the neighbours—I have never seen a case in which, tubercles were present in the pia mater without producing some symptoms; more especially I should I say indicating disease in the head; head, symptoms—I have seen cases of tubercular meningitis in which there was not softening of the brain—they are not frequent or common—after that disease it is stated that in some cases the brain is found to be firm and not softened—the fact of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> being delayed until after the patient had been dead six days would Dot affect the possibility of drawing accurate and safe conclusions on most points—there are no points which have occurred to my mind in which the delay in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> would throw doubt on the accuracy of the conclusions; not on the material points which I have heard mentioned.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. Taking the notes of the <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination and the depositions as I have read them, I come to the opinion that death in this case was caused by tubercular meningitis—that opinion has been confirmed by the medical evidence that I have heard—when I speak of tubercular meningitis I mean the acute form of the disease—I am not prepared to say what is the average weight of a woman of 5 feet 5 1/4 inches, but, generally, I should say, about 9 stone—if this woman was 9 stone on the 23rd October, and on the 12th or 13th April she was 5 stone 4 pounds, I should, undoubtedly, call it a case of extreme wasting and emaciation—it was a case, from what I have heard, of extreme emaciation—I do not think the <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination disclosed how long this acute tubercular meningitis had been going on—the acute stage could cot, from the evidence, have been more than a few days—the disease is more likely to make its appearance in an enfeebled condition of the body than in a person of good health—tuberculosis sometimes supervenes on emaciation caused by any wasting disease—it would be more likely than in a perfectly healthy patient, undoubtedly—it is a rare complaint—in treating the disease I should prescribe nourishment, tonic medicine, and so forth—warmth, of course, is necessary in all cases of illness—it would be bad treatment to keep such a patient in a room without a fire in winter—it would be exceedingly dangerous treatment—the necessity for such a patient having exercise in the fresh air would depend on circumstances which I do not know; it would depend on the state to be relieved—judging from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances I should say the disease could not have been present more than a month at the outside—I cannot tell what caused the emaciation, without consideration of the history—we call the three coverings of the brain collectively, the meningitis, and in this disease the condition would be chiefly the deposit of tubercules, with more' or less inflammation—probably the deposit of tubercles would cause inflammation, but that is a question of opinion—the condition of the brain generally in this disease is in the majority of cases soft, and a deposit of tubercles is found at the base of the brain—I known Dr. Bristowe—he is physician at St. Thomas' Hospital, and I am assistant-physician; I know his work—in one passage he say "Meningitis, due to the presence of tubercles, nearly always commences at the base of the brain,—is often limited to the base and is generally most intense there"—I agree with nearly all of that—I do not know that starvation ever causes congestion of the brain—it is said in the last stages to be accompanied by convulsions—if a patient had congestion I should not necessarily expect convulsions to follow—I should not be surprised to find that condition if he had convulsions—if after death from convulsions I found congestion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170084"></xptr>
               <p>of the brain I should rather presume that the congestion caused the convulsions, than that it was caused by the convulsions—I am not' pre<lb></lb>pared to say that congestion causes convulsions, it would be likely—you might find congestion after death, because the convulsions and the congestion might have arisen from the same cause—maniacal delirium, I think, would be rather caused by congestion, than be the cause of congestion—in the case of a ship-wrecked man in an open boat becoming delirious, the delirium would be caused by starvation and thirst, the man becomes mad; that is described here—I have no doubt that it is the result of deprivation from food and drink—I should not expect congestion of the stomach, from starvation—in the case of a person enfeebled from want of food and having a pretty substantial meal suddenly administered I should expect to find the stomach then as it is during digestion, that is, full of blood, or, as you say, congested—if the vessels are gorged they are congested—I do not know what to expect in such a case as you put—I never saw such a case—I should feed such a person gradually—I am not prepared to say what the precise harm of doing otherwise is, but it is a matter of experience that harm is done—I understood Mr. Longrigg to say that stiffness of the arms was inconsistent with meningitis; I did not understand him to say that it was not consistent with paralysis—paralysis does not produce stiffness of the limbs—it may produce stiffness of the limbs if it has lasted a long time, when the patient has not motive power, but has rested in the same position for a long time—I do not find from the evidence in what part of the peritoneum, that is the bag containing the stomach and intestines, the inflammation was found—it might be in the coating of the stomach or it might be in the walls of the abdomen; I have no information—I do not think the giving of food in a considerable quantity to a starved person would be likely to cause inflammation of the stomach, or of the coating of the stomach—I am not prepared to say whether the internal coating would be likely to be inflammed, I have had no experience—I have never seen a case of wilful starvation—I have seen a case of virtual starvation, where the patient could not take food for a considerable time—emaciation comes on in those cases steadily, not always rapidly, because you combat it, you administer as much food as you can, and if you cannot administer it by the throat you inject it—I have listened to the evidence and have heard the condition of the lady before she was removed from the" Woodlands, and the evidence of Clara Brown, and I think the removal from Cudham would be likely to accelerate her death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Doctor of Medicine and Fellow of the College of Physicians—I have not been consulted in any way in this matter before to-day—I sent you (Mr. Clarke) a private note in this matter—I am senior physician at St. Thomas's Hospital, and examiner in medicine at the College of Surgeons—I have heard the evidence that Dr. Payne has given, and I agree with it entirely—in cases of death from tubercular meningitis it is a frequent thing to find rigidity of the limbs—that disease is very various in its symptoms, it is not infrequent that the acute manifestation of the disease is preceded by a period of progressive gradual emaciation—it may be a long period of emaciation—emaciation is one of the recognised symptoms of tuberculosis—in its acute form emaciation is often the only sign of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170085"></xptr>
               <p>the disease—the tubercles are often so minute as almost to defy detection; they sometimes require the microscope for their detection—I have never seen a case where there were tubercles in the pia-mater where there were no head symptoms during life—I have not looked up my experience for this examination as to there being capes of tubercular meningitis where there is do tubercle at the base of the brain, but I believe it does occur; I have seen cases where the tubercles have been limited to the upper part of the brain, but it is rare—there would in such a case be an absence of the flattening and bulging of the lobes of the brain and absence of effusion—I have necessarily a large experience of vermin on the body, at a hospital—it is a fact that where there are vermin at all on the hair they constantly spread immediately after death—they would spread over the body in a few hours; as the body cools the vermin spread over the whole body, over the trunk—in the case of a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>, examination where the body had not been washed after death, the presence of vermin all over the body six days after death would not necessarily indicate any great amount of filth before death; it would depend on the condition of the patient before death—if the patient had been bed ridden or comatose before death, or had lain for several days or weeks before death, it is common to find even in a well ordered hospital, that the head is infested with vermin—I should expect then to find them in great numbers—in any case where there had been vermin in the head during life, and the body was left unwashed and intended during six days, the might vermin spread over the body, and I should expect to find them spreading.</p>

I do not think vermin as a rule bite the skin, not ordinary lice; they rather live on the scurf of the hair, they are rather scavengers—I do not think that body lice bite, I am not prepared to say—I agree generally with Dr. Payne, in every essential particular—I have not talked this over with Dr. Payne; I only returned to London on Saturday, and have not had an opportunity—I enterain no doubt of this being a case of acute tuberculosis—as to the emaciation I have not gone into the early history of the case—I should say that 9 stone for a woman of 5 ft. 5 inches would be rather above the average; I do not speak positively, these are matters which require one to look into figures—I have read the evidence in the papers, that is all the knowledge I have of it—no doubt it was a case of considerable emaciation—I do not know that I can attribute that to anything without knowing more of the case—it is consistent with starvation, and with emaciation produced by tubercular disease—a patient may emaciate as rapidly as the deceased in less than a month, and to the same degree—I know nothing about the emaciation in this woman, and can give no opinion on the point—I do not suppose it took place in a month—I have undoubtedly known a case of acute tuberculosis which produced emaciation such as this—I cannot give you the particulars of any one case, but I have seen a good many cases, where it has been proved at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination that tubercles have been in progress for more than a month; but where the symptoms have not been apparent more than a month, and emaciation has preceded the acute symptoms, it is likely to happen in the case of a person who was very much emaciated, but who is not suffering from tuberculosis that you would have tuberculosis supervening—it would come on in the course of it, but not be produced by it—I do not know that it would be accelerated by it—I should not call tubercolosis the cause of the emacia<lb></lb>tion,</p>

               <p>but the result of it—the emaciation has gone on and might have been caused by a variety of things, and then tuberculosis sets in—I should not, in that case, say that emaciation was necessarily caused by the tuberculosis; or, on the other hand, that the tuberculosis caused the emaciation—tuberculosis takes place not only with the enfeebled, but in the stout and comparatively well—tuberculosis might come on in a body in an impoverished state, but not as the result of previous emaciation or ill-health—where that has been the case we have found evidence that there has been tubercle beforehand, before the acute symptoms manifested themselves—I mean to say there is no necessary connection between tuberculosis and emaciation—tuberculosis may come on in a person who has been exhausted by disease, or it may come on in a healthy person, or it may not have manifested itself by acute symptoms in the way that Dr. Payne has described—it is impossible to say if tuberculosis had not assumed the acute form, how long it would take to produce such emaciation as 1 have heard of in this particular case—I have no means of saying whether emaciation, when caused in this way, may have been produced in a month, six weeks, or a year—I believe I have seen an entire absence of fat round the omentum, in the acute disease; lam not quite sure—I should not expect to find it after death from acute tuberculosis only—I still entertain the view contained in the passage from my work which you read to Dr. Payne—I should generally expect to find effusion about the seat of the tubercles—I do not know that there was none in this case—I only know what I have heard in Court.</p>

In the emaciation that precedes the acute development of tubercular disease, there may be no other sign of disease than the gradual emaciation; in the other case there would be symptoms of hysteria—the causes of tuberculosis are not at all understood—I should be very slow to say that tuberculosis was caused by starvation.</p>

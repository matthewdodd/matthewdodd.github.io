               <p>John Hoply. Last December was a twelve Month, the Prisoner came to my House in <placeName id="t17330112-40-crimeloc173">Rosemary-Lane</placeName>

I took him in, and he lodged there till October following. He pretended to belong to the India House, and that he had great Effects and Interest there, and could help me to a Place of 12 s. a Week: At last he said he had done my Business, for he had secured the Place, and if I would go with him I might have it directly. So we went to the Ship-Tavern against the India-House; he went over to the India House, and coming back again told me it was all done, and only wanted signing. My Watch and Cane lay upon the Table; he took them, and said he'd take those with him because he should make the better Appearance, and so he went out again, but never returned. The Night before this I lost a silver Cup, and I have Witness to prove that he took it.</p>

            . The Prisoner has many other Names besides Williamson. He said he was Boatswain of the Grantham which was cast away, and that he should stay at the Prosecutor's House till she was sitted up, that he had 30 s. a Week, and was to receive 50 l. at Woolwich. He ordered me to make him as many Cloaths as came to 20 l. I was drinking with him over Night at the Prosecutor's, when he took up a silver Cup and looked on it. I did not see him, lay it down again. The Cup was mist, the Landlady enquired for it; says I to him, What can become of this Cup that you was looking on, don't let us have it missing when here's none but ourselves in the Room? Damn the Bitch, said he, I have the Cup, I only took it to frighten her, I'll give it her again, but I'll get a Pint of Brandy out of her first. So he called for a hot Pot, and then went to Bed. In the Morning I asked the Landlady if she had found the Cup, she said. No. I went up to the Prisoner (who was a-bed) and asked him why he kept the Cup so long ? Damn the Bitch, says he, I'll give it her as soon as I get up. He had given me 9 s. 9 d. in Earnest for the Cloaths he bespoke, and which I made for him; but being a little dubious of him, I would not deliver the Cloaths without my Money, nor return the Earnest, because I was likely to have the Cloaths left upon my Hands. When he found that, Damn the Fellow, says he, I'll have a Warrant for him to make him either deliver the Cloaths, or return the Earnest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where was the Cup when I look'd on it?</p>
               <p>Glin. It lay by a silver Tankard in the Corner of a little Cupboard that was open; you moved your Chair towards the Cupboard, and took the Cup in your Hand, and then turned your back to me, but you did not put it in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173301120022"></xptr> its Place again ; I heard you promise in Newgate that you would return the Cup, and Watch and Cane, if they would not prosecute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor lent me the Watch and Cane to grace me, that I might get him Preferment at the India-House.</p>

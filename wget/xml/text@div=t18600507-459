I am butler to Mr. Benjamin Norton, of 30, York-place, Portman-square—On the evening of 17th March, I closed the house between 5 and 6 o'clock, and bolted it up—next morning between 2 and 3 o'clock I heard a noise; I went up stairs, struck a match, lighted a candle, and took this sword (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw two doors open which I had bolted and locked in the evening—I went to the dining-room, round a corner, and saw a man with a parcel containing a clock and a table-cover—he said, "I shall kill you"—I got the sword, and he blew out the candle and gave me a blow; he then caught me by my coat, chucked me on the ground; I shouted out</p>

               <p>"Murder!" and "Police! thieves in the house"—my wife came up stairs and went to the master—the man pulled me right over by my collar—I then left him and ran after the other one—he got on to the leads, threw this parcel over, and some one called out, "All right"—I said, "No, all wrong;" he went by the leads and the sky-light; I pulled him by his legs, but he got away from me and went over the walls by the empty houses—I jumped back again after him; he got the parcel up, went over the leads, and then I <hi rend="italic">cotched</hi> him—we had a fight of eight or ten minutes, and I was screaming so that you could hear in the street, and then I saw a police<lb></lb>man—the man got away from me, and jumped a wall of eight or nine feet—a piece of gold then fell, a presentation plate, and I jumped down and picked it up—the man jumped off the wall by another house—I saw a policeman looking over the wall, and I called, "There he goes, Sir"—I am an Englishman brought up in Holland—the struggle lasted about ten minutes—I saw his face perfectly well and recognised him at the police-court among others—I could have pointed him out from above a hundred—I hit him in the face with the sword in the struggle, and it was broken—this vase (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my master's property; it is silver gilt—I saw it safe when I locked up the place—I was hit in four places; I was stabbed on my shoulder, or cut—I do not know whether the prisoner had any weapon.</p>

               <p>I went through the house to the back premises—I was getting up a wall from 30 to 33, and saw the butler and the prisoner tustling together seven or eight yards off me—I was getting over the wall when I saw the prisoner throw the bundle down on to the leads of the adjoining house—before I could get at them, the butler sang out, "He is gone," and he went down over the wall—I saw him twice, and was about five yards from him at one time; he was in my view about five minutes, and I had the opportunity of seeing his face and appearance, and am certain it was the prisoner—I saw him again on the morning of the 22d in custody at Clerkenwell, and picked him out from five more without hesitation—he then had a cut on his face which appeared to have been done three or four days—I saw that the butler was injured by cuts which appeared to be done with a knife—the house is in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone—I picked up the bundle afterwards; it contained these articles.</p>

Skanes—I do not know the other Mr. Skanes—I did not go before the Magistrate about this matter—I did not hear of it—I did not hear that the prisoner was taken in custody till the week before last—Elizabeth Shanes, the youngest one, spoke to me.</p>

                  </hi>. On 17th March, in the evening, I was at the Alpha Arms—it was Saturday, and I had taken home some work that morning to my employer—the prisoner said something to me, and tore my coat very much—I was very unwell at the time, and had had a pint of ale, and I hit him on the side of the left eye; it cut him, and I assisted to stop it up afterwards with some sticking-plaister which was brought by a young female.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did it make the eye black? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; just a little cut—there was some blood—I have only known him about two months, while he has been lodging there; I know nothing at all of him—I generally go there of a night—I used to lodge two doors past there; and during those two months I have seen him nearly every night; I do not know to a day or two—I have seen Charles Skanes there three or four times, and sometimes not at all—I do not go there every night—I believe he has got into a little trouble—I was in a little trouble at Clerkenwell—they said I had been convicted there—I went to see the prisoner at Clerkenwell a fortnight or three weeks after he was taken in custody—I was refused admittance, because they said that I had been convicted, which was false—I heard of his being taken in custody two or three days afterwards—I did not go before the Magistrate—I did not know I should be wanted for such a purpose—I heard of it from Mr. Skanes one evening when I went there after leaving work—when I struck the blow a young man, who I do not know, was in the room, and Mr. Shanes's daughter, and Mrs. Skanes; they were sitting on a chair looking at a dress, or something; I did not take particular notice—there were three women, and a man was sittting down there, but I do not know him—I think there were four or five in the room, but did not look round at them—Mr. Shanes was not there—I left between 11 and half-past.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Alpha beer-bouse, Caledonian-road—I remember the prisoner being in the house on Saturday, 17th March—he received an injury in the inside room—I did not see it inflicted, but I saw it after it was done—I came home and saw the prisoner laying with his head on the tap, bleeding from the eye, and my daughter told me that a chap named Griffiths had struck him in the eye with his fist—his head had been dressed before I came home—he laid with his bead on the table some time, and I took him up stairs, and saw him to his bed-room—he was very tipsy—he had been lodging in my house—I closed the house about 12, or as near as could be, locked the door, and took the key up stairs into my own room, and put it on the table—I saw the prisoner come from up stairs next morning, about half-past 10 or a quarter to 11.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you kept this beer-shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it is over eight yean—if I have been unlucky enough to have any charge made against me, I believe you defended me for it—I was not charged with receiving stolen goods, but I dare say you know better than I do—there was a parcel of four or five handkerchiefs, and I was charged with receiving them, knowing them to have been stolen—two men were charged in the same indictment with committing a burglary and stealing them—they were lodging at my house—a great portion of the stolen property was not found in their rooms, that I am aware of—they were convicted—one of them was my nephew, Charles, who was charged twice with another offence—he has not since that time continued to occupy a room in my house—he has come in and out, he might come every evening, and then stop away for a week or a fortnight—I have never seen the prisoner come with him, that I know of, before this took place—I never saw them together—they have both been in the house at the same time, but not in company—the prisoner occupied the front room, at the top of the house, three weeks; I will not be certain to a day or two—that is not the same room occupied by the men who were unlucky enough to be convicted, that was on the other side of the landing—I do not know who occupied the other at the time they were lodging in the house—somebody was living there during that fortnight or three weeks—a charge was made against me, some time ago, of obstructing the police when they were trying to apprehend a thief in my house—there was not a thief in my house who they were trying to apprehend—a party was taken out of the house afterwards—he was not rescued; I did not rescue him—you were my counsel on that occasion, and you asked me to plead guilty, when I was not guilty—I did not see them trying to apprehend a thief who was rescued by other people in my house, but the police said so—on another occasion when you was not my counsel I was fined for harbouring thieves in my house—that is three or four years ago; I will swear it is more than six months ago, I will say it is very nearly two years ago—I have never been fined for assaulting the police; I have been imprisoned—I do not know whether there are any other troubles I have been engaged in—thieves have not been repeatedly taken from my house by the police, that I am aware of—a policeman might come</p>

               <p>in without my knowledge—they may have, very likely, repeatedly taken thieves from that beer-shop—the people who were convicted when I was acquitted were, I believe, charged with a burglary of a very heavy description.</p>

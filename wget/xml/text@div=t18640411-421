I am a boot-closer—on 15th March I went to the St. Paul's public-house, about 1 o'clock, and remained till between 5 and 6 in the evening—there might be twenty persons in front of the bar—the prisoner was there, and a man named Morgan, whom I did not know was putting a pot of ale round to the company, but he denied the prisoner's drinking, and the prisoner struck him—Morgan then put the pot out of his hand, and stood up to light—they had one round, and Rogers struck Morgan in the right eye with his left fist, cut his eye across, and staggered him—he then closed with him, bent his knee, and pressed it into the lower part of Morgan's bowels—I mean that he knelt down upon him, when Morgan was on the ground on his back—two other shoemakers who were with us then lifted Rogers off and helped Morgan on his feet—he asked to be taken home, and when he went out at the door he complained of being very much hurt.</p>

                  </hi>. M. R. C. S. I am house-surgeon of St. Bartholo<lb></lb>mew's hospital—I admitted Morgan on the morning of the 16th March—he was in a state of great pain and very ill—he complained of intense pain in his belly—he remained in the hospital three days, and died on the morning of the 19th—I made a post-mortem examination, and found the lower part of his belly very much bruised—the inside and the bowels were very much inflamed, and the cavity was full of urine and blood, which had come from a rupture of his bladder—he was otherwise a healthy man—I attribute his death to the rupture of the bladder, which was caused by considerable exter<lb></lb>nal violence—I told him I thought be would die, and an Alderman attended at the hospital to take his deposition—the prisoner was not present then, but next day he was brought face to face with the deceased, and the deposi<lb></lb>tion was read over to him, but not in my presence—I was not there the first moment—I told the deceased, when the evidence was taken, that he could not get over it, and he said that he thought he was dying.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had much urine escaped? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot judge of the quantity, because it had been there some days—I do not think the bladder could be ruptured unless it was full—it has been done by a mere fall—a person who had been drinking would be more likely to have the bladder fuller, but I do not know that he would be likely to have it ruptured sooner; I know no reason for that—death was produced by the rupture, and the escape of the urine, which would inflame the surrounding parts.</p>

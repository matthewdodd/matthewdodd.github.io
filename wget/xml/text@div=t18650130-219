                  </hi>. I am a draper of 2, Pimlico-walk, Hoxton—on 5th September last, the prisoner came to me—he said he believed I was a buyer of shawls, and he had been recommended to me by Mr. Wilson of Barbican, and could I buy them—I asked how many he had—he said he had 200—I asked him what price he wanted for them—he said he would take 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece for them—I said they would not do for me at that price, and I offered him is at first—I afterwards agreed to give him is 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was to bring them in the next day—he did so, and when counted there were 196—I bought them at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-piece; they came to 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him for a receipt—he asked me for a bit of paper, he said he had not a bill-head with him—I gave him a bit of note-paper, and he made out this receipt—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Bought of Mr. F. Palmer, 196 shawls at is. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., signed, Frede<lb></lb>rick Palmer.")—I sold some of them afterwards to Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you keep a shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have kept it six years, continuously—I had never seen the prisoner before 5th September—I know Mr. Wilson of Barbican—he is a draper and milliner—I travel round town and serve him with goods—the prisoner brought samples on 5th Sep<lb></lb>tember—I can't swear how many—I know he said there was one of each sort, and there were different coloured borders—I can't say exactly how many different sorts there were—the interview on 5th September lasted about a quarter of an hour; it took place in my shop—I agreed as to the price that day—I keep a young man to look after my pony and go out with me—I keep none to serve in the shop; my wife serves in the shop—I did not want the shawls to sell in my own shop—when the prisoner brought the shawls there was another person with him—I dare say the interview that day lasted three-quarters of an hour—I gave that man a penny to go and buy the receipt stamp—I had never seen that man before—I never went to the New Cut about this—I never went out of my shop till I first saw the goods—I never went with Wilson over the water about these shawls—I never saw Wilson at all about these shawls, not till three days after I had bought them; I then told him I was much obliged to him for sending the party to me with the shawls, and I had bought them—they laid on my counter for two days—I have a friend a traveller, who travels round town, and he took them to all the City houses to try to sell them for me—I sold them "to a person in Shoreditch for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—I have got a larger profit for things than that—I did not decidedly understand the goods; I am not a shawl</p>

               <p>buyer—I buy anything—I have been in my shop six years, and out of that six years sixteen months as a draper—I had no knowledge of the drapery trade before I went into that shop—I never had any trouble about any transaction of this sort before—I was never a witness before—I know Robert Anderson—I buy anything in my line—I generally buy them in the City, or else I go about looking after job lots—sometimes I have them brought to my place, but I thoroughly know who I buy them of it was Anderson who came with the prisoner when he brought the goods; that was the man I gave the penny to for the receipt-stamp—I had never seen Anderson before—I afterwards bought a quantity more shawls of Anderson; that was on 15th September—I bought ninety-three of him then—I gave 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for them—I have not got the receipt he gave me; I had a trouble to find this one—when the police came to my place my receipts and invoices were all turned over and hauled about—I have never seen Anderson since 15th September—I have been about to find him and made all the inquiries I could—they were both present when I paid the 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I won't swear who took the money; I put the money down and saw the receipt signed—it was signed by the prisoner and given to me—he wrote it all out—not all at the same time; there was an interval of about seven minutes between the writing out of the invoice and the putting of the stamp on—the stamp was put on wet and was signed wet—there was only one inkstand on the counter—I believe it was written with the same pen; there were two pens—I won't swear that he wrote it with the same pen, because the pen was dropped—I went to the prisoner's house in Oxford-terrace, Clapham-road with the officers and another person, who I be<lb></lb>lieve calls himself the lawyer's clerk; I never saw him before—I did not go over to the New Cut, nor did I see any of those shawls there—the shawls were brought in a cart—there was a boy besides Anderson—Anderson and the boy brought the things into my shop; the prisoner stood inside—to the best of my belief the prisoner took the money—he was acting as the master and the other seemed to be acting as man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am buyer in the shawl-department of Messrs, M'Morland and Co., of St. Paul's-churchyard—I have examined the shawls that are produced; they are the property of M'Morland and Co.—I ordered them myself—I saw them safe on the date of the burglary—the bulk of them were made to my order—24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the cost price of a great portion of these shawls—some of them are Llama trimmed with silk borders, some all silk, and some silk and wool, with work on them.</p>

               <p>were purchased about a year previously, the greater portion—they were not all bought of the same manufacturer—I saw them on 21st June, because we were taking stock of them—they were all prepared for stock-taking, all put into boxes and marked, and the following morning they were all gone, and in disorder—M'Morland's is not a very large concern—I have the super<lb></lb>vision of the stock—I also make sales to retail houses—I was personally en<lb></lb>gaged on that day in taking stock—the greater bulk of the shawls were pur<lb></lb>chased a year previously—the other part were purchased during the spring season—I don't require the invoices to tell the prices, my memory is sufficient without that—I carry in my head the price of everything I look at; there are some tickets on these shawls now which were placed on them the day I took stock of them, and I can swear to them as in the writing of one of the young men, named French—I have a corresponding mark in my pocket—all of them were not marked.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 313). I was on duty in St. Paul's—churchyard on the morning of 22d June—at ten minutes after 6 I saw Messrs. M'Morland's door on the jar; the bar and padlock had been broken off, and the inside of the door cut—I pushed the door open and went in—I found no one on the premises—on searching I found these two small crow-bars, and this knife and string, which is used for the purpose of inserting this string between the sash of the window; the string gets hold of the fas<lb></lb>tening, and the catch is pulled back, and then the window can be opened.</p>

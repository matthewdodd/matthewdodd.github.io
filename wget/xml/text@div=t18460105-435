                  </hi>. I live in Banner-street, St. Luke's, and am a clock-maker; the prisoner was in my service. On the 29th of Sept., be<lb></lb>tween nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I sent him with a sovereign to Mr. Shick, in Rahere-street, for some clock chains—he knew within 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. what they would come to—I told him he was to pay for them—he did not pay for them—I had sent him to Mr. Shick's the day before with some fusees, to have the chains made to them—the sovereign was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more than he would have to pay for them—he never returned—I never saw him again till he was in custody, fourteen weeks afterwards—I went to Mr. Shick's for my work, and paid for it.</p>

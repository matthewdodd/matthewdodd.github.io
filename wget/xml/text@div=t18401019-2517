There are more partners than one—I received advice from Smith and Holder, of Hastings—I have the letter in my hand—it is dated 8th August—I do not know when we got it—in consequence of this letter, the cheque now produced was made out as it is now, except the signature and the intials "C. H.," authorising me to pay it—they are the initials of Mr. Hogg, a clerk in the country office—these initials were on it when it was presented to me at the counter—it was made out by Mr. Moore, a clerk in the country office—it was signed and in the same condition when presented to me as it is now—it was presented on the 11th of August, I do not know whether by the prisoner or not—I paid the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an iron-founder, in Swan-street, Dover-road. The prisoner was my clerk, and had been so about eleven months when I dismissed him—he had one counting-house in the yard, and a seat also at my desk up stairs, in my private counting-house—it was his duty to receive letters which came by post—I did not receive a letter from Mr. Thompson from the 8th to the 11th August—Sir Howard Elphinstone is a customer of mine—I had an account of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with him at the time, which he owed me—in consequence of something which transpired, I dismissed the prisoner on the 5th of September, and paid him his wages—I wrote to Mr. Thompson after the prisoner was gone, and received an answer, which took me to Mastermans' for a cheque, which I supposed was there for me, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not find it there—I afterwards saw this cheque at Masterman's—I never received the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have examined this cheque, and believe the signature to be the prisoner's hand-writing—I never authorized him to sign my name to any cheque, nor to any document, except a receipt, by proxy—I knew nothing of this till I saw it at Masterman's.</p>

The prisoner came to my house on the 8th of November for a pint and a half of porter, I served her in a pewter quart cyder pot; she told me she lived at Mr. Caton's on the other side of the way. I had never seen her before, I had suspicion of her; I watched her; she went nearly to the bottom of St. Andrew-street, then I laid hold of her and took her into the Swan public-house, I left her with the landlord. I went to Mr. Caton's to enquire whether she lived there, she never had lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the beer - A. The beer was in the pot at the time. She then told me that she was going to take it to No. 18, Litchfield-street to warm it; I went there and they informed me that she had stole a pair of sheets; Mr. Caton told me that she had robbed them of a shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find out where this girl lived - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The man credited me the pint and half of beer. I told him I lived with Mr. Caton. I had lived there. I told him I should pay him for the beer the next day. When he laid hold of me I told him I was going to have some supper with a friend at Hooper's-court, Litchfield-street. I never said 18.</p>

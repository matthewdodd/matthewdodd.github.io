From information I received, on 8th October, I went to an unoccupied house in Bark Street, Poplar, about 7.30—I saw the prisoner coming over the back wall of that house—the prosecutor's house is about 400 yards off—I asked him what he had got—he said, "Some old rags"—I said I should take him to the station, and on taking him there, I found these two coats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these boots I received at the station.</p>

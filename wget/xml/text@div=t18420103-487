                  </hi>. I am partner with my brother Thomas; we are cabinet-makers, and live in Gray's Inn-road. On Wednesday evening, the 15th of December, I was going to my stable—as I opened the door the prisoner was at work behind it—I said, "What are you doing?"—he said, "There is an escape of gas, I work for the gas company"—I said, "Take care, do it properly"—I went away, and when I returned the po<lb></lb>liceman had him in charge for stealing the pipe—he said, "Do you know this man?"—I said, "I only know him by his saying he worked for the company"—this is the pipe that was fixed to my building, and the brass cock attached to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> As I was going by, one of his men said, "Are you a gas<lb></lb>man?" I said, "Yes." He said, "We have an escape of gas." This gentleman said, "Take the pipe up, it is worn out." I said, "Yes, it is." I expected he would give me that for my trouble. I said I worked for the company, which I do, but I do not belong to them. <hi rend="italic">Witness,</hi> I said, "That pipe is not going up again, it had better be taken away."</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Somer's-town. About half-past two o'clock on the 15th of December, I met the prisoner with this pipe on his shoulder, and having lost so many pipes out of Southampton-street I stopped him—I offered him half-a-crown if he would go with me before my commissioners, who were then sitting, to pay him for his trouble, if he was innocent—he went very quietly, and when he came near the place he showed me where he took this pipe down—he said a gentleman told him to do so—I said "What gentleman?"—he pointed towards Mr. Seddons, but I saw no one.</p>

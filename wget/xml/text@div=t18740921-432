                  </hi>. I live at 132, High Holborn; it is a grocers, carried on in the name of Joseph Chapman &amp; Co.—on 8th July, 1873, there were two boxes of biscuits, each weighing 38 lbs., outside the shop door—I saw them safe in the morning and missed them the same night when we</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Norris, of 94, Great Guildford Street, Southwark—two women, named Emily Lucy and Elezabeth Hill, came to my place the first Monday in July, 1873, and looked at two rooms on the first floor, and next Monday John Lucy and Charles Warner came there—they occupied the rooms until the police came and made a search—I saw two biscuit tins taken away—I had not seen them brought there—I never saw the prisoner before the evening he came with a man named Rabout.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Detective P</hi>). On 10th July I was keeping observation in the neighbourhood of Horsemonger Lane Gaol—two men named Warner and Parsons were there in custody on another robbery—I saw a man named Lucy, and took him in custody on another charge—I afterwards went to 94, Great Guildford Street, about 7 o'clock in the evening with Nevill-We watched there some time and saw the prisoner and Rabout enter the house—they knocked at the street door, got admission, and walked upstairs to the back room first floor—we followed them and asked them for the key or the front room, or whether it was locked—Robout said he did not know—I said to the prisoner "Who are you?"—he said "I came here with him"—presently two females came up and went into the front room—I asked Mrs. Hill if that was her room—she said "Yes," and she occupied it, and she knew Rabout—I said we had come to search the-place, we had got Lucy, Warner, and Parsons in custody—we searched the room and found two boxes of biscuits—I showed them to Mr. Townsend—I found one box in the back room where the prisoner was—he was standing there—he had his hat on—I asked the women how they accounted for the things being there—they said they did not know anything about them, some strange man must have brought them there—I then asked the prisoner and Rabout, and they never spoke—we found a lot of property, some in the back room and some in the front, and a number of pawn tickets.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Puddick when we found the property—the prisoner was committed for trial in July last year and ought to have surrendered here in September, but he did not—I saw nothing of him till he was taken into custody the other day, coming out of Clerkenwell prison.</p>

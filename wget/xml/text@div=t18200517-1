On the 31st of March, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I missed a sheep - it was safe at six o'clock at night, with others, in Mr. Corbett's marsh, about a mile from my house. I found the skin and head in a ditch in the marsh, and can swear it is mine. I have the skin now. I made enquiry, and offered a reward of 10 l., but heard nothing for six weeks after. Day then gave me information (he is a labourer and worked for me, but not at that time), he lived about a mile and a half off; the prisoners were in custody on another charge, when he accused them - they have all three worked for me, and knew my premises.

             gave a saucy answer - nothing further passed then. I kept behind, watched to see where they went, and kept at a distance from them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you going the same way as them - A. Yes, my Lord. They went into Corbett's marsh, drove the sheep up in one corner next to the large river, near the ditch. They caught one and all knelt down, and stabbed it; then took the skin off and threw it into the ditch - all three put the carcase into a sack, and took it away.

             carried it part of the way, and then Harvey carried it. They came up the back way into the street where Harvey lived, and carried it into his house, and I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you from them when they slaughtered the sheep - A. About one hundred yards. I do not think they saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a reward was offered - Yes. I was afraid to tell Mr. Boards, because Harvey threatened to murder me if I mentioned any thing of the kind - that was about a fortnight afterwards. And they all threatened me when they were in the cage for stealing potatoes. They said they would murder me if they got free from this. I was behind a tree when I saw them kill the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of their getting any thing else - A. I lodged in the house before this happened; they were always being brought in, and so I left.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any quarrel with them - A. No; but my wife is separated from me, and lives in the house with Harvey.</p>

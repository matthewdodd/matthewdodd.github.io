               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who brought her home? A.Byrne; they led her home - I was before the Grand Jury - I do not know that they have thrown out the bill; I never heard so till now; I came here, thinking it was found - I was told to attend to-day, and was told it was a true bill by the neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how many persons in your house were ill at the time your daughter was taken ill? A. There were two females, and my daughter had been nursing them - Mr. Waller attended them; one who was ill for a week died, the other left the house - they had been ill three days before my daughter was taken ill; Mr. Waller attended my daughter - she did not vomit after she took medicine - I did not hear the Grand Jury had not returned a true bill; Drs. Babington, Messrs. Kiernan, and Hockley saw my daughter after death; my daughter drank nothing but tea before she went out - she had neither porter nor spirits.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHAPMAN. I am an orange and nut-dealer, and live in King-street, Cloth-fair. On the 9th of May, about nine o'clock in the evening, I saw Elizabeth Sarah Chalk just by a private door, at the corner of Cloth-fair; the prisoners and her were standing together; when I first went up to them the deceased caught hold of my arm, and asked me to protect her, as they had been knocking her about, and ill-using her most shamefully - I said I had nothing to do with it, they must settle it was they could; Taylor then called her a nasty stinking - and then pushed her up and down the court; she kept saying,"What have I done to deserve this;" I only saw one push, and that was from Taylor - Chalk then caught hold of another young man's arm, and asked him to protect her; Taylor then went up, and looked her in the face, and said, "We will do for you before the night is out, though you have got a friend to protect you; you first began it, and you shall have it" - I then went in, leaving them standing opposite.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the Grand Jury had thrown out the bill? A. Not till this afternoon, not before I came into Court; I heard something about it, but did not believe it - I did not tell Mrs. Starkey of it.</p>
               <p>ELLEN REEVES. I live in Middle-street, Cloth-fair. On the 9th of April, before in struck eight o'clock in the evening, I saw Chalk in Gray's-passage, just by Chapman's - only Taylor was with her then; I saw her set Mrs. Chalk with her back against Gray's-passage, against the wall of the Red Cow; she said, "I have got you now, I will serve you out;" she hit her on the head and neck, first on one side of the head and then the other - I saw nothing else done; I went away - I did not see Chalk do any thing; she never made the least resistance - she seemed quite sober; she was a diminntive little thing, quite small.</p>

            . I live in Bartholomew-close, but am now under-waiter at the Chapter coffee-house. On the 9th of April I was coming by Chapman's, in Cloth-fair, and saw Chalk, and both the prisoners pushing her very much up and down the court; they were all three quarrelling together - they first pushed her on the iron spikes of the railing; her back was on the iron railing - she would have fallen had it not been for the watch-box; they then pushed her again - they pushed her down, and pushed her head against the corner of the Red Cow public-house; she fell with very great violence - this was not two yards from the watch-box; she did not make the least resistance, nor use any ill-language.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her rise? A. I was called away - she was in a very weak state indeed - she could hardly stand by the watch-box; I heard both the prisoners swearing at her, and she certainly answered them; they called one another b - rs and w - s.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the Grand Jury had thrown out the bill? A. Yes, I knew it about half-past two o'clock - the officer came to tell my master so.</p>

               <p>MR. PREXDERGAST declined examining this witness.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you a medical man? A. Yes; I am not related to the prisoners or deceased; I happened to be attending two persons in the house (in which the deceased was,) of the disorder called the cholera, and was present when the medical gentlemen examined the deceased's body; I examined the whole body very carefully, except the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks of violence? A. There was something very slight on the right side; the medical men could not agree whether it was a bruise or not; I think it arose from the external application which I had used - I think that the deceased came by her death from natural disease; I stated so before the Coroner and before the Grand Jury; I have been in practice eleven years, and live in Bartholomew-close; this has been a matter of a good deal of contest in the parish.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170077"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. In consequence of the discussion in the parish, I believe you had a number of highly respectable gentleman to view the body? A. Yes, Dr. Babington, Jun., Messrs. Griffiths, Burrows, Tweedy, and others - we all signed a document; they all agreed with me in the main, with the exception of this trifling bruise.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were there no other marks of violence? A. None; what satisfied me this was not a bruise was, she had complained of pain on that side, and was relieved by violent external friction, which convinces me it was a violent spasm; I never had the slightest idea that her death was caused by external violence.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Had you been told of the circumstances which are said to have occurred before you examined the body? A. Yes, but I had no idea she was hurt; she herself said nothing about it, only her mother - there were no bruises on her back or breast; I did not know the bill was thrown out till I came into Court.</p>
               <p>JOHN WHEATLEY. I am nine years old, and live in New-street, Cloth-fair. On the 9th of April I saw Mrs. Chalk by Mr. Chapman's, and saw both the prisoners with her; I saw Taylor striking her, and knocking her about - Mrs. Chalk appeared to be well; she did nothing - I heard Taylor calling her all the names she could lay her tongue to; Chalk was standing up - I saw Taylor knocking her about, and she knocked her down by striking her in the breast with her fist doubled; I left her on the ground - we were at play, and were going to tell Mrs. Starkey to come.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Chalk never called her bad names? A. No, I am sure of that; they were not both quarrelling, it was only Taylor - I did not see Byrne there; I only heard Taylor call her bad names - she was knocked down by Chapman's, and fell to the ground, I am sure of that; I do not know where the Red Cow is; there is a public-house at the corner of the posts - I do not know the sign; it is one door from Chapman's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She did not call them any names? A. No - neither of them said she had began it herself; the Red Cow is about two yards from Chapman's.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Chiswell-street; I have been in practice about two years, and four or five years in the profession. On the evening of the 9th of April, I saw Mrs. Chalk at her mother's, in the presence of Mr. Waller - I agree with him, and consider she died of the prevailing epidemic cholern morbus.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that disease would by more likely to attack a person from violence having pre-disposed the body? A. I think it possible to pre-dispose her to disease, but that pre-disposition would not cause death; I saw a slight bruise on her right side, a very superficial one - I thought it decidedly a bruise; it did not go beyond the integuments - there was no bruise on the back - I was present when the body was opened; there was a little redness on the right lobe of the liver, which I understand from gentlemen who have seen many cases of cholera, is a common symptom - my opinion is the same as that of the other gentlemen; it was a slight blush on the liver, and not opposite the external bruise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you decidedly of opinion that her death was the result of cholera? A. There is no doubt of it; I stated so to the Coroner and Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If cholera had made its appearance on the subject, do you suppose external violence would cause it to have assumed a more serious character? A. The cases I have seen have terminated so suddenly I do not think any thing would affect it; it is impossible to say whether external violence would cause that to end fatally which otherwise would not have done so.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Would drinking spirits cause it to become violent? A. That is a pre-disposing cause; I am decidedly of opinion her death was the result of an attack of cholera; ten surgeons agreed in that opinion; there was no bruise on the back - the mother showed me some liquid, which she said had just come from her stomach - it was very thin liquid; I saw no blows nor marks of violence on the breast - turpentine had been rubbed on the breast, which would be more likely to make them appear; she did not complain of any violence; she was perfectly sensible - the symptoms she called out attention to were cramps in the calves of her legs; she was able to speak very well - alarm and weakness is a symptom of cholera.</p>

               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Would fright pre-dispose to the disease? A. I think it might.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, of Leonard-street, Finsbury. I saw the body after death, and observed a superficial bruise on the right side; it appeared extremely slight - it was a matter of dispute whether it was a blow, and I am rather doubtful of it; I saw the appearance on the liver, that did not correspond with the neck - I believe myself it was not caused by external violence; my judgment is, that she died of cholera.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing her to have been attacked with cholera at nine o'clock, and at eight to have been treated with violence, would that pre-dispose to the disease? A. It is very early, but her having nursed two other patients it might be.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If she had attended two cholera patients for two or three days, do you suppose the external violence would give her the disease, or the infection? A. It think it most likely that it was imbibed before.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Would personal violence aggravate the disease? A. It would aggravate any disease, and hasten the death of any body, certainly - it has always been my opinion, that the attack of cholera caused her death.</p>

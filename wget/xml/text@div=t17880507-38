               <p>I am a watchman; coming up Little St. Martin's-lane, the corner of Long-acre, about half an hour after twelve in the morning, I met the prisoner with a bag on his back; I suspected him; I stopped him, and took him and the bag to the watch-house to be examined; the constable examined him, and sent the prisoner about his business to see if he could find any body to answer for his character, but the constable imprisoned the bundle; I would have had him kept the prisoner too; but he would do as he pleased; the next day he came for the property, and said it was his own; the Justice told him it was not very likely.</p>
               <p>When he came for it what passed? - He said it was Mr. Hanley's property; the Magistrate said, he should send for his master, for he suspected they were stolen; after that I went round to see if I could find any owner with some patterns which the Justice gave me; when I came back the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you know the prisoner before? - No.</p>
               <p>So you could not have told where to find him, if he had not come to claim the goods? - No.</p>
               <p>SYLVANNUS HANLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a linen-draper, in Whitecross-street; I have known the prisoner fourteen years or upwards; he sent for me on the 10th of this month, to a public house, and told me, he was very forty he had got into trouble, that he had made use of my name, and said, they were my property; he said, he was afraid the watchman wanted to keep them, as he had no licence to hawk goods about; and that, unless I went to him and claimed them, he should lose them; I said, did you come honestly by them? he said, yes; I said, then there is no doubt of your getting them back again; that I could not demand goods, that did not belong to me; he said, he did not know what he should do; he had said, they were mine; he came to my house on Friday morning, to know if I had heard any thing about it; I had just then received a hand-bill; I then taxed him closer, if he came honestly by them; he said, he had; on Saturday evening, between five and six, I met him in May-fair; on the Sunday morning I went with him to New Prison, along with

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Simpson was with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Simpson told him he had better state all he knew, that it would be better for him? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that nothing was said to induce him to confess? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he say? - He said, he was sorry he had made use of my name; Simpson said, you know my situation as a servant in this house, I would thank you to tell me how you got the things out of the house; he said, when he took these goods out, he put others in, and did it in that manner; he asked him, what he had done with the goods he had taken from Thomas Hill; he said, they were at Barnet's, in May-fair, and offered to give a note for the man to deliver them up; Chambers said, there was no occasion for it, and we went without the note; when we came to Barnet's, we told him what we were come for; he told his wife to give them to us, which she did, and we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070039"></xptr>went to a public-house and took an inventory of the goods, and Barnet signed it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have known the prisoner some time? - Yes, he has bought things of me, but I never bought any thing of him.</p>
               <p>What way of life are you in? - A retail linen-draper.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say upon your oath, this man has never sold smuggled or other goods for you? - Never.</p>
               <p>What character has he born? - I never knew but he bore a very good one till this time.</p>
               <p>- SIMPSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with the last witness to the prison on Sunday morning, the 13th of April; the prisoner said, he was happy to see me, but was sorry he was in that situation; I told him, I was sorry too; he directed us to Barnet's, where we found the goods; he described the manner of his taking them as Mr. Hanley has represented it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean to say, that neither you nor Mr. Hanley gave the prisoner any reason to believe that it would be better for him to confess? - He was neither promised nor threatened.</p>
               <p>How long had the man been in the house? - Seven or eight months; he had borne a good character, and I looked upon him to be an honest man.</p>
               <p>(The things were produced in Court, and deposed to by Simpson.)</p>

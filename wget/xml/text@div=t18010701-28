            , wine-merchant, in Miles's lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the 26th of June did you know any thing of the prosecutor? - A.Nothing; I don't know that I ever saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Or of the prisoner? - A. Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any alarm of stop thief, was your attention directed to any thing, and what? - A. On the 26th of June, while I was standing at the door with Allden -</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A.It was after five, I think it was not six, I heard the cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner followed by two or three persons, not more.</p>
               <p>Q.Amongst those two or three did you observe Bean? - A. I did observe a man who is to be a witness here, I don't know his name; the prisoner was a little way before them, running up the lane; me and the other witness, Allden, immediately followed after the other two or three; and before I got up to the prisoner, within about six or seven yards, I saw the prisoner take from his pocket a pocket-book, and throw it down in or near a baker's shop, not more than fifteen yards from where I had originally stood.</p>
               <p>Q.During the time of your pursuit did you or any body else cry out stop thief? - A.Almost immediately that I pursued from the door the thief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010026"></xptr>was caught, and therefore it was unnecessary; stop thief had been cried before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make such observation of the pocket-book, as to be able to tell the colour of it? - A. It was a red pocket-book, with a strap.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt it was the prisoner at the bar who threw down that pocket-book? - A. I have no doubt of his person, though he is not dressed the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you lose sight of him at all before he was taken? - A. Not more than a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of the man after he had thrown away the pocket-pocket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And are you sure that that man is the prisoner? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe who picked up the pocketbook? - A. No; there became a crowd immediately, and I could not discern who picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the pocket-book since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. At half past five you heard a cry of stop thief? - A. I think so, as near as I can tell, between five and six.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell whether you had had your dinner? I suppose you had been taking your wine after dinner? - A.That is as it happens.</p>
               <p>Q. If the prosecutor has spoke to a transaction between two and three o'clock, it cannot be the same transaction? - A. I cannot say, I think it was about that time.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, will you swear that you saw the prisoner that day? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q.When were you first brought into this business as a witness? - A. It was after his commitment.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not offer to be a witness before the Lord. Mayor? - A. I was not asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Who asked you to attend here to-day? - A. I received a subpoena.</p>
               <p>Q. With whom had you any conversation, before you had your subpoena? - A. The constable; his name is Lewis.</p>
               <p>Q.How came he to find you out? - A. He lived in the lane; he gave me the subpoena before any any conversation took place; he knew that I had seen the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a man they called a waterman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see him pick up a pocketbook? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said, you never lost sight of the prisoner from the time you first saw him, till he was taken, and yet you cannot tell who picked up the pocket-book? - A. I cannot tell, but from hearsay.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you never lost sight of him? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps it was only hearsay, that he threw it away? - A. No; that is a fact I have sworn to.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, if you will venture to swear that the waterman did nor throw away that book? - A. I do swear that the waterman did not throw it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you could distinguish the hand that threw it away? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you tell the prosecutor that you had seen it? - A. It was an unpleasant business, and there were other persons saw it as well as myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You dine between two and three, and then drink your wine after? - A.Occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, were you drunk or sober, because we have had that insinuated? - A. I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I only meant it to shew the difference as to time, between the prosecutor's account and his.</p>

             sworn - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live at No. 7, Miles's-lane: On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010027"></xptr>26th of June, I was standing at the door with my two children, at needle-work; my little boy had pinched his finger, and Mrs. Massey came to the door with some brandy; I was rubbing my little boy's fingers, when I felt something thrown in my face, and it fell on my left side; I looked down and saw that it was a red pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the day was it? - A.Half past six in the evening, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see from whence it came? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.It was half past six? - A.As near as I can guess; I have no watch or clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see him there? - A. Yes; after the pocket-book was thrown away, he was going to run into our house; I saw him on the threshold of the door; the waterman immediately laid hold of the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your door from Mr. Webb's door? - A.About ten or a dozen doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner who was attempting to get into your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. So this was between six and seven o'clock? - A. I cannot be certain; it was before seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.You were not before the Lord Mayor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen him since he was taken till now? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the prisoner in the lane before; and the book was thrown away? - A. Yes, I picked up the book, and the waterman snatched it up before I could cleverly get it up, and then the captain came up.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you been acquainted with the waterman? - A. No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q.The waterman was close to you, ready to pick up the book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the waterman was the nearest man to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be glad to know who it was told you that the prisoner at the bar was the man that you were to come to swear that I picked up the pocket-book; he said the man that they had taken was in prison.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you speak to the prisoner from a knowledge of his person, or from what the constable has told you? - A. I speak from having seen him; I pitted him very much at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Bean give the pocket-book to the prosecutor? - A. I did not; I was too much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the pocket-book that you picked up, the same in appearance, with the one you afterwards saw in the prosecutor's hand? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a waterman and lighterman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor, Captain Thompson? - A. Yes, I saw him on Friday last, in Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mrs. Kallard? - A.Not by name.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that lady? - A. I saw her along with the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember taking any pockot-book out of her hand? - A. I stooped down and picked up a pocket book; a woman and I stooped at the same time; but I do not know whether this is the woman or not; I took up the pocket-book and gave it to Captain Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour? - A. To the best of my knowledge, I believe it was red.</p>
               <p>Q.However, the same pocket-book you picked up, you gave to Captain Thompson? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I know him since I have been in the habit of appearing against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on that Friday? - A. Yes, in Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in Miles's-lane? - A. Yes, he ran, and I ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the cry of stop thief? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run at the cry of stop thief? - A. Yes, he was running at the time when I ran after him to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you by at the time he was taken? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And assisted in taking him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are sure the pocket-book you picked up at the time the woman was stooping down, was the same you gave to Captain Thompson? - A. To be sure; I did not change it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. I will not ask you whether you stole it; because that is not a fair question; but if any body has said you took it out of a woman's hand, that is not true? - A. No, we both stooped together; I made a snatch at it from her hand; the woman might have hold of one end of it, for any thing I know; it is very probable she might.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010028"></xptr>Q.Had not you the pocket-book in your hand, before the woman ever saw it at all; I am not now asking whether you stole it? - A.Upon my oath I cannot say; I believe the woman might have hold of it before me.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again; had not you it in your hand, before the woman ever saw it? - A. I really positively cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the gentleman that the Lord Mayor threatened to commit? - A. I never was so flusterated in my life; he thought I was concerned, or said something similar to it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable, (produces the pocket-book) I took the prisoner into custody, last Friday, in Miles's-lane, Crooked-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave him you in charge? - A.The Captain, Moore and Allden helped to secure him; I took him to the Compter, and going along, he said he picked up the book; that he was a fool for doing it; that it had brought him into this trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the charge upon which you took him? - A.For stealing the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Thompson. This is my pocket-book, the inside is green; it contained the ship's register; but the Lord Mayor desired me to take the register out, which I did; there is a 5l. note, and a 1l. Bank note in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am not guilty of the crime, with which I am charged; upon hearing a cry of stop thief; I ran as another person might, and they seized me, and said I was the prisoner; I know nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010701-28-verdict164" type="verdictDescription">

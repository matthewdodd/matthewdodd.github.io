On Wednesday, the 3rd of August, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I was going towards my cottage—I met two men—I should not know them again—they knocked me down—I felt them take something from me, but I soon lost my senses—when I came to my senses I missed my watch, knife, handkerchief, tobacco-box, and threepence-halfpenny in copper—I had been at a public-house—I was sober—I saw my watch again on the 4th of August, a person belonging to the 73rd regiment showed it me—I saw the handkerchief again that day week—I had been drinking for three hours at the public-house—I had last seen my watch at past twelve o'clock—that public-house was about half a mile from my house—this happened in the parish of Plumstead.</p>

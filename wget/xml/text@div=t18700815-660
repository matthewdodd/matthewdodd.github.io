                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 9, Duncan Street—on 23rd July, about midnight, I was going down Petticoat Lane—the prisoner came up and caught hold of my coat sleeve, and asked me for some money for beer, I said "I won't give you any"—he knocked me down on the pavement, and kicked me with his boot till blood ran from my mouth—I got up and walked away—he followed me down Whitechapel, knocked me down again, and caught hold of my watch and chain—I called out "Police!"—a crowd came round, and he ran away—I got up and went to the station—I walked about till 2 o'clock in the morning, but could not see him—I was looking for him with a policeman on Sunday, and I saw him sitting in a public-house—he came behind me, and gave me a blow on the ear—I was frightened and went out the back way—I got a policeman, and gave him in custody—in the course of the struggle on Saturday my watch was broken; the chain was broken in three pieces.</p>

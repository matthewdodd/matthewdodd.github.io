                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the night of the 31st of July, between ten and eleven o'clock, I saw the two prisoners and another boy in King-street, St. George's, opposite the prosecutor's shop—Bryant went into the shop, and brought the bacon out—Lay waited outside, close to the door—Bryant ran down the court with the bacon in his hand, and I after him—he ran into another court, and into a privy, about a hundred yards from the shop—I found him there, and never lost sight of him—the other two boys separated from him—I asked Bryant what he had done with the bacon—he said he never had it—I told him I had seen him come out with it—I went to Mr. Hay's and acquainted him of it—I got the bacon after<lb></lb>wards out of the privy into which I had pursued Bryant—he had thrown it down—I took it to Mr. Hay's—Lay was taken by a brother-constable—I am sure he is one of the boys who were with Bryant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger, in King-street. This is my piece of bacon—I did not miss it till the officer brought Bryant to the shop—it had been lying between the counter and the door, on a machine—there were three pieces—when I came back there was but two—I do not know any thing of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bryant's Defence</hi>. As I came down the court I met this boy coming with a bundle of clothes on his arm, from his ship; the policeman took me to the station, then went and fetched two more boys up, and the bacon in his band; he let one boy go, and locked me up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lay's Defence</hi>. I came from my ship with dirty clothes; going across the road, I saw the policeman running the opposite way; I ran after him, to see what was the matter; I saw him coming along with this, boy; I followed him to Mr. Hay's house, and heard him making a complaint about the bacon—I stopped, speaking to Mr. Hayes, and he came back and took me.</p>
               <p>(The prisoners received good characters.)</p>

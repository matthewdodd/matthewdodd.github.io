                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Procter; we are cheesemongers.

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Todd, at No. 78, St. Paul's Churchyard. The prisoner has been twelve years in our employ, as porter—I had some suspicion about him, and on Wednesday morning, 13th July, I asked him if Mr. Madgwick's cook had paid him certain bills, and told him that the cook had been to pay the last weekly bill, and said she had paid the others; he said he had not received them—I pressed him more closely, and he said, I have received it, and not accounted for it"—(<hi rend="italic">the books were here sent for</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many customers have you in the course of the day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps fifty—it was the prisoner's duty to account for money received, the moment he came into the shop—he has never, to my knowledge, paid me money which he has had more than a day—I never knew him to keep money till I was disengaged—he may have come in and waited ten minutes or a quarter of an hour till I was disengaged, after which he would give me the money—I should not have objected to his accounting to me next morning if he got home late; it might happen, but I do not recollect it—we always deemed him a good servant—on 13th July I asked him to produce his book; he said he had lost it—when he accounted to me, he used to hold the book in his hand and read from it—I have frequently asked him for it, but he has never produced it since—to the best of my memory, I used to see it every day.</p>

                  </hi>. In July I was cook to Mr. Cuthbert, of No. 62, Cheapside, who dealt with Messrs. Todd. I was in the habit of paying the prisoner once a fortnight—on Wednesday, 6th July, I paid him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not take a receipt, I have not taken any these three years—I kept the account of what I had had in my mind—the account was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but he charged 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and rather than have any dispute I gave it to him.</p>

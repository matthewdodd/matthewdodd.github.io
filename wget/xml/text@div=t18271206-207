On the 29th of October I was in the back room, and heard a noise in the shop; I went out, and Parker said the prisoner had stolen a pair of gloves; she said they were her own, that she had bought them before; Parker said several times, he was certain she had stolen them, and I went for an officer - the prisoner stood there till the officer came; the gloves were found before.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Reid. I was in the shop; the prisoner came in between two and three o'clock, and bought a pair of gloves; she came again about five, and asked for a pair of gloves out of the window, marked 7 1/2d.; she said, "I want another pair of gloves like what I had before;" they were the same sort as she had bought before. I got a packet of gloves out of the window - she was looking at them; I turned my head to the window, and in a moment, I saw her draw a pair from the pack, and put them under her shawl, quite tight under her arm. I said nothing to her till she had bought a pair and paid for them; I then charged her with it; she said they were what she had bought before - I took them from her; Mr. Reid heard the noise, and came into the shop - I do not know how many pair were missing from the pack; she did not deny having them, but said they were her's, before she produced them.</p>
               <p>MR. REID. She could not have left the shop, as there was another young man there; the gloves were tacked together.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the hand writing of the clerk to be his filling up? - I did. I thought it was very extraordinary; he says certainly you must sign it; I said, I did not sign it; he said if it was not my signing it could not be his hand writing; says I, don't you know your own hand writing? how can you tell me so? After that he said, I don't know whether it is my hand writing or not, says he, I cannot swear to it; I takes my check out of my book, says I, this is the same hand writing which you have filled up in these; he said he did not know it was his hand writing. That passed from that time till the latter end of the week, and then he owned he had done it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you said that it would be better for him to own it? - I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you rather believe that you did? - I don't know that I did; all that I said to him when he was in prison was, if you can but get off for a soldier or sailor, I should be very happy.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did not you say that if he would confess, it would be better for him? - I don't know that I did, I am not positive, I rather think I did not; I desired he would tell me, and he denied it; I told him he had better confess it, because I supposed he was guilty, it would be more satisfactory to me.</p>
               <p>Q. This was before you had that conversation in the latter end of the week? - It was after that.</p>
               <p>Court. You told him he had better. confess, because you knew he was guilty; what he said was after that? - He did not tell me till the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the banker's about this check? - My wife went to the bankers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was not he employed by you to fill up the body of the checks, and you and Mrs. Ireland used to sign them? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a broker. On the 30th of March, Monday morning, Mr. Ireland's son-in-law sent to my house, No. 4, Little Portman-street; it was Mr. Brown; he told me that Mr. Ireland wanted to speak to me, he could not tell what Mr. Ireland wanted with me; then I went to Mrs. Ireland's house, and Mr. Ireland was in the shop; and the prisoner was in the shop; Mr. Ireland told me that Mr. Archer had been forging on him, and desired that I would take care of him,(I am a constable) Mr. Ireland walked about the shop two or three times, and says he, I must go up to the banker's, and tell them of it, and, he said I had better stop there with him; I said, I had better take him with me to my own house, which I did; we stopped there for a couple of hours, and then Mrs. Ireland came in; she told me that the banker was out of town, and they expected him in town about three o'clock; Mrs. Ireland said, that she hoped that they would do every thing in their power to save the prisoner, but it was a very bad thing in him to do so, it hurt her more than any thing that ever hurt her in her life. The next thing, Mr. Ireland came, I believe at about five o'clock, the prisoner was with me at that time; Mr. Ireland said he had been up to the banker's, and asked, him if he had any friends that could raise any money for him? Mr. Archer told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160148"></xptr>him that he had no friends, but he had some rent owing him, which was some pounds, and that he could not think of doing any thing of that sort; Mr. Ireland told him that it hurt him very much to think of hurting of him, and if he could raise ten pounds, and go for a soldier or sailor, he would forgive him; with that he agreed to go for a sailor on the morrow; Mr. Ireland still left this Archer in my care, with that I did not know how far it was right in that crime, I said to Mr. Ireland, if he would indemnify me for keeping him-</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You must not say any thing about that. - The next thing we did we took him to the watch-house that night, and put him down below stairs, and did not charge him, with that he stopped there about a quarter of an hour, and then the constable of the night came. and he insisted on his being charged for the crime which he had done, or he would let him go about is business; with that Mr. Ireland and another gentleman went back; says Mr. Ireland, I may as well give charge, the crime is very bad; says he, constable, take charge for the forgery, not mentioning the sum of money. That is all that passed that night; then he was brought up to Marlborough-street, before Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What passed there was taken in writing? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. So you suffered Mr. Ireland to compound felony? - No, I would not suffer him to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. You kept the prisoner a couple of days? - No, I did not; only some hours.</p>
               <p>Q. You should have taken him to gaol, should you not? - The man said he could do no such thing as raise the ten pounds.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Pooley. I am a linen-draper at Twickenham. On the 13th of July my house was broke open; I left every thing secure when I went to bed about eleven o'clock the night before. I was alarmed between two and three o'clock in the morning; I got up and found two of the shutters and the shop-door wide open; the bar of the door, which fastened the shutters, had been taken out, and a square of glass in the window cut. I found every thing in the shop in the greatest confusion; I looked round the shop, and observed a great quan<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110015"></xptr>tity of goods taken away, and the remainder in confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from the river? - A. Very near.</p>

Yes; between one and two o'clock in the morning, on a Sunday, as I came through the church-yard, I saw two of the shutters standing right against the window, and the door wide open. I immediately went in; I then went round the corner, and thought something had happened more than ordinary; I found a square of glass had been taken out; I directly alarmed Mr. Read.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. Do you recollect, on the 13th of July, being desired to watch upon the River Thames? - A. Yes; we rowed after one boat, and that was not the boat, and afterwards we saw the boat coming with the property in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - A. It might be about four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in the boat? - A. Yes; I saw some men in the boat, but could not say who they were. We pursued the boat, and jumped into the boat; they got out of the boat into Mr. Wood's craft, at the end of Northumberland-street, and ran up towards Craven-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in the boat? - A. Two bales; I do not know what they contained, they are things of linen-drapery; I found also an iron crow, picklock-keys, some bullets, and a bundle of matches, in a basket, and a coat, (produces the basket;) there was a knife in the coat, with a broken blade; I did not find it, but I saw it shewn in St. Margaret's church-yard.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect on Sunday morning, the 14th, any thing particular happening? - A. Yes; a little after five o'clock I heard the alarm of stop thief upon the water; I immediately ran down to the water-side, and saw three men run away from the boat, and run up Mr. Wood's wharf; it was a boat loaded with goods; they ran by me and I followed them through Northumberland-court, across Craven-street, up Hungerford-market, into Charles-court. I called out stop thief, and two soldiers followed them, and caught one of them in New-street, Covent Garden.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you see the face of any one of them? - A. I stood and looked at them as they passed by me.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HUTTON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Pooley. - Q.You are in the guards, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect pursuing any man with the last witness? - A. Yes; on Sunday morning, about twenty minutes past five, I heard the cry of stop thief; I had just come off guard, and was in the Strand, I went to the street-end that the cry came from, and saw three men coming up; I do not know what street it was; it was a street leading down to the river. Taylor was crying out stop thief; he said, soldiers, those are the three, why do not you stop them?</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing their persons? - A. Yes; they came close by me, and bad got about eight yards from me when I began to pursue them. Two of them took up the courts that go into Round-court, and the other ran a little higher up. Before he turned up, I went after the two together into Bedford-bury, from there to St. Martin's-lane, then to Bedford-bury, then to St. Martin's lane again, and met him in New-street. I never lost sight of them all that time; I collared Orrell, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing of the other man? - A. The other took across St. Martin's lane, and made towards Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was the other man that ran with Orrell? - A.Mackaway; I took particular notice of his face when he passed by me, by his nose and hair, he has got a large bump upon his nose.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt upon earth that he is the man you saw coming up the street from the water? - A. No, I am sure he is the man; I took him down to Scotland yard, and they told me the boat was gone to Westminster-bridge, and I took him to St. Margaret's watch-house; they would not take him in there, they said I must take him to Tothill-fields, and I lodged him there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The persons pursued by you were running? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you had not much time to see their faces? - A. I stood there I suppose above a minute before they came up to me.</p>
               <p>Q.Two of them took up one court, and the other up another? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.The person whom you pursued crossed Bedford-bury again and again, and then taking a different course, met with the person you after wards took? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then going up New-street, and the other person going up Bedford-bury, you of course lost sight of him? - A. Yes, I lost sight of him three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you met Orrell, and thinking he was the person you had been pursuing, you took him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw Mackaway for above a fortnight afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Q.Have you any doubt that the man that you saw in New-street was the same man that you saw running up from the water? - A. It was the same man.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HARRIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a private in the guards, I was with Hutton; there were three persons coming up Charles-court into the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your seeing them come, did you pursue them? - A. Yes, for about twenty minutes, till we took one in New-street, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q.Which was that? - A.Orrell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other person with Orrell? - A.Mackaway.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure as to his person? - A. Yes, he got into another court, and I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt with respect to the person of Orrell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt that Mackaway was the other person? - A. No; he smiled at me as he came up Charles-court, and I observed a dent on his nose, and that he was of a fair complexion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long time had you an opportunity of observing the person you now suppose to be Mackaway? - A.Not above half a minute, if it was that.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen that man before in your life? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.And you did not see Mackaway for a fortnight afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.When you did see him at Bow-street, had you any doubt that Mackaway was the man you had seen with Carpmeal? - A.None at all.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known them? - A. Orrell I have known about three months, and Mackaway I knew by sight; I used to take coals to Orrell's; my master keeps a coal-shed, and he served him with coals.</p>

Did they apply to you to go in a boat any where? - A.Orrell did, about twelve o'clock, on Saturday, the 13th of July; he said, he had been looking for me a day or two, he wanted me to go up to Battersea; accordingly I told him I would take him; he said he was going over the water, and he would go when he came back; I told him I might be gone out with a fare, I would go with him; I went with him to Duke-street, leading to the Borough-market; he told me to go to the Bell public-house; he said he was going to see for Mackaway, and he told me a bean was as good in my pocket as a stranger's.</p>

               <p>Q.What did you understand by a bean? - A. A guinea: I went to the Bell, and he went to seek for Mackaway; I staid there an hour and a half, or near two hours, and he came to me; I understood that he had seen him, and he asked me to go to

            's, who lives with his mother, a shoemaker, in St. Saviour's-college; he told me to go and ask him whether they were done or not, as he wanted them, I supposed he meant shoes; Wade said, he would come in a few minutes afterwards, and he did come, and had some discourse; I heard Orrell say, I must have them to-night, for I am in great want of them; Orrell and Wade<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110018"></xptr>then went out together, and I with them, and going through the Borough-market, there was a man that they knew they called Dick, and they went into the Plough and Harrow, the corner of Stoney-street, and had some beer; we left Dick there, and went by George Smith's door, and there we met Mackaway coming up; Wade said, he must go to work, and he would meet us; then we went to the Waterman's-arms, Bank-side, and had some beer there; I went to launch my boat, and Mackaway went away; I went back to Mason's-stairs, which leads to the Waterman's-arms, and might stop a quarter of an hour, when Mackaway came in with another man to me and Orrell; about seven o'clock, Orrell, and Mackaway, and I, and a strange man, got into the boat; Mackaway went for a basket, and this stranger brought it down to the water-side, and told me to put it in a dry place.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this basket? - A. It was such a basket as this, sewed over so, that the things in it should not jingle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any thing else on board the boat? - A. No; we set off about five minutes after seven, it was just at stood, the wind blew very hard down the river, I did not know where I was to go to till they got into the boat, and then Orrell told me we were to go to Twickenham, and I made no objections to it; we stopped at the Magpie and Stump, at Chelsea, we went into the white house, like a summer-house, opposite the other house, and we had bread and cheese, and gin, and onions; we staid there about an hour, or an hour and twenty minutes; then we got into the boat again, and me and a stranger rowed above Kew-bridge; Mackaway and Orrell took a spell to row, they said they were cold and shivery; I went to a place they said was Twickenham, I never was up so high before; when we got to Twickenham, Mackaway, or Orrell, I cannot say which, asked me for the basket; this was about twelve o'clock, or between twelve and one; they took the basket upon the grass plot, and took some things out of it, but what it was I did not know, I heard something jingle.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do with the basket then? - A. The stranger threw it into the boat; they might be gone three quarters of an hour, or an hour, and desired me to wait till they came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark at that time? - A. The moon was going down, and shaded in and out behind the clouds; Orrell returned in about twenty minutes, or half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You never were at Twickenham before; did you land near the church? - A. There was a building which I took to be a church, and there was a gravel causeway that I heard them run down with the things; Orrell brought two pieces of linen cloth, and he said something concerning the cloths, and ran away again instantly, and then Mackaway and the stranger came down several times one after the other, three times, or they might go four times, and brought something with them every time, and threw them into the boat; they brought some white parcels, and a bundle done up in a kind of linen, and put in the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Orrell return after the first time? - A. Yes, they all returned backwards and forwards; Orrell went about twice, I believe, or three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they performing this? - A. They might be about half an hour, or better, before they quite finished.</p>
               <p>Q. When they all came back, and the thing was finished, did Orrell or Mackaway say any thing about it? - A. One of them said, shall we have any more, I cannot tell which of them it was, I did not hear any answer given to it; then they all came into the boat, it might be about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark then? - A. It was dark when they came into the boat; the stranger said, they might as well go and do a thimble crib for about forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.What did that mean? - A. A watchmaker's shop; I made answer that it was high water, and they had better go down; by their discourse I found what they had been about.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you discover it then for the first time? - A. Yes, I judge so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was there any other conversation? - A. Yes, Orrell said, there was a good swag.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that mean; a good weight, I suppose? - A. A good load, I should imagine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other conversation? - A. Yes, they all said, they wished they had some sacks, and when we came to Kew-bridge, the stranger said, there were some sacks hanging upon a barge's quarter, and he went to see, and came back, and said, they were not sacks; then we went on, and stopped below the Red house, at Battersea, for some sacks, at the mill, they wanted some sacks there, and I told them they would be seen, and they shoved me ashore several times, and I would not land them; then Orrell and Mackaway rowed through Westminster-bridge; there were some men ashore, and I saw Orrell's countenance change; one of them said, who are they; I said, I believed they were the Marine Police-officers; I then saw that Orrell and Mackaway had got pistols, which they put into their breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first time you observed that? - A. No, I observed them glittering just after they came from Twickenham, when they put them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110019"></xptr>in their breeches, and when they came to row, they shifted them again; then a boat came off after us, and I begged they would put me ashore, and I was put ashore upon Mr. Wood's craft, in Scotland-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave in the boat? - A. Mackaway, and Orrell, and the stranger, and the property.</p>
               <p>Q.Which way did you go when you went on shore? - A. I went up towards Parliament-street, and went over Westminster-bridge; I heard the cry of stop thief; I made the best of my way, and did not look behind me; a few days after that, I went and delivered myself up at Bow-street, and Mackaway was taken by my account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. That you were at Twickenham, there is no doubt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the persons with you talked of a bean in your pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no explanation of that given at the time? - A. No, I understood it before.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Twickenham at a perfectly seasonable hour of the day? - A. No, it was night.</p>
               <p>Q. Although you went there at twelve at night, you had no suspicion that you and your companions were going on an improper purpose? - A. I had not till they came with the things.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear? - A. That I swear - when I landed them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no suspicion before that? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought they were going on a party of pleasure? - A. I had no doubt, for I did not know who the stranger was, he said he lived at Richmond, and they hired me as a waterman.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, for taking any body to Richmond, should you expect a bean? - A. Yes, it is a long row.</p>

               <p>Q. When you came back, you discovered they had been plundering somebody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then I dare say you pushed off your boat, and said, these goods shall not come into my boat? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. No fit of honesty of that sort seized you? - A. I did not know that they were stole till they came down with their discourse.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think, even when they brought these things into your boat, suspect any thing? - - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.And you went a few days after, and delivered yourself up at Bow-street, you gave this account, and then Mackaway was taken? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, upon your oath, when you first went to Bow-street, did you tell the story you have told now? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not deny all knowledge of either of the persons in the boat? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you not yourself committed for trial? - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q.Were not you committed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were not you in jail? - A. I was in jail, but not for trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your master committed to jail for harbouring you as a felon? - A. I do not know what my master was in jail for; I heard he was in jail.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not present when he was committed for harbouring you as a felon? - A. No, I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q.Where have you been since? - A. In the House of Correction.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you were sent to jail was it that you were brought up and examined again? - A. I was brought up several times backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. And you thought it a pleasanter thing to hang other people, than be hanged yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, when you were first brought up to Bow-street, and examined, deny knowing any of the persons in the boat when the robbery was committed? - A. No, excepting it was the stranger, I did not know the stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give in your examination - did you give it in the month of July? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it correspond with the account you gave now? - A. Yes.</p>

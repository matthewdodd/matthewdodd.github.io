            . On the 1st of July I had been at Shaklewell; coming home about eleven o'clock at night, I met a fellow near Kingsland Turnpike, in the high road; Rogers is the person to the best of my knowledge; he came up to me, and asked me where I was going; I said for London; I told him where I lived; he said he was going too. He and I crossed the field to go towards <placeName id="t17720715-44-crimeloc224">Hoxton</placeName>

               <p>Q. What was you knocked down with?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. His fist.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were all round you, what happened then?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. They took my watch, my shoe buckles and neckcloth. After I was down one of them said, shall we cut his throat?</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. That I cannot be positive. I said don't use me ill, for I will be still, and not make any noise, and I lay sometime.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take the things from you while you was down?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. Yes, I was there about a quarter of an hour, and they went away and I went away too.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear particularly to either of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. I am of opinion that Rogers was the person that knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear he was in that company?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to either of the other three?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you robbed by children, such as the prisoners appear to be, or men?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. By children according to the appearance of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect whether they had their own hair or wigs?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. I cannot, it was dark and over cast.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your watch?</p>
               <p>Swingwood. A silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any particular mark on it?</p>

            . I attend at Justice Wilmot's office; the prosecutor came and laid an information against these lads; I know them all very well; he brought James Fox with him to the office, who told who had the property that belonged to the prosecutor, and described the boys; we went after them directly; this was the 2d of July, the day after the robbery. About eleven o'clock as we came through Spittle-square, we saw Cole, and he made an attempt to run; Fox said he had the watch about him; he ran about 200 yards, and then dropt the watch; I put my stick to it, and said there is the watch; I saw it picked up; it was brought to me as I stopped him. I took him about fifteen yards from the watch. (The watch produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) When we brought Cole to the office, Fryer was there; he was taken before we got up, by one in court. Then Fryer offered to be an evidence, and said he would go and saw us where we might take Rogers. He went with me and another man, to Shoreditch and Tower Hill, and we could see nothing of him; we came back down by the Keys, and then to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150031"></xptr> Bishopsgate-street, there we saw Rogers drinking at a pump; that was between twelve and one o'clock; we brought him to the office with the shoes and buckles on his feet. (The shoes and buckles produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) I took Assent yesterday week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found on him?</p>

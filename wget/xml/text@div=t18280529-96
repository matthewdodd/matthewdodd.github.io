            . I live facing Cornwall-street. I saw Sarah Ann Mills with the necklace on, as I was sitting at my window, and saw the prisoner, who was a stranger to me, come up to her - he sent another child away who was with her; he then took little Sarah's beads off her neck, and before I could get down stairs he was gone; I ran to the watchman and told him, and in a quarter of an hour I saw the prisoner again; I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What part of the house were you in? A. At the one pair of stairs window; it was not dark - I was not further than the width of this Court from them; I went down directly, but the child had turned the corner, and I did not see her.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Benstead gave me the information, and I went after the prisoner - I saw him go into his mother's house; I then went and found the prosecutrix. I went to the prisoner's mother's, and knocked at the door - they denied him, but I opened the window-shutter, and saw him going to bed; it was then about half-past seven o'clock; I went in, and took him; he said he had been in bed by six o'clock; I said it was not that when he passed me - I took him to Benstead - she said that was the man: in going along he gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290062"></xptr>me these beads, but I do not recollect that he said anything.</p>
               <p>MRS. ALLEN. These are the beads.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But you do not know that they were what was on the child's neck? A. Yes, I do; I had laid them on the copper about a month ago - the fire was lighted, and it has turned the colour of them.</p>

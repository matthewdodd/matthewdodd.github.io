The prisoner came to my shop on Thursday the 18th of February, about three in the afternoon; she asked to see some silk handkerchiefs. I shewed her a paper of Barcelona handkerchiefs, of different colours. She looked at them for some time; then she said there were none of the right sort. She opened one, and spread it over the others to look at it. She then said she wanted to see some Belcher handkerchiefs. I shewed her a paper. She desired me to cut her one off, and she would call for it in half an hour with another article, and then she would pay me. Upon her not buying anything I was rather suspicious of her. She went out of the shop. I looked over the handkerchiefs, and I missed a piece of silk handkerchiefs. I clapped the handkerchiefs on the counter, and looked on the floor. There were no handkerchiefs there. I went to the door, and saw the prisoner five doors off. I seized her, and as I seized her some of the handkerchiefs fell from under her clothes. I instantly said, you have robbed me. She said, no, ma'am, I have not robbed you, child; I have paid for every thing I have got. I brought her back to the shop, and shook her, and nineteen handkerchiefs fell from her person. These are the handkerchiefs; they are mine. My husband's name is

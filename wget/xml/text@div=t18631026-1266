I live at 4, Great Queen-street, Westminster—I am a referee, in any case where I may. be employed—in the spring of this year I was introduced to Mrs. Littlejohn—I first became acquainted with her about two or three months before that—I did not know her during her husband's lifetime—I saw her with reference to a claim that she had against the Per<lb></lb>severance Friendly Society, and at her request I called upon the defendants—I have the address down—this is a note I made at the time; everything was made at the time—there is not a transaction down here but what I made at the time—I called at 8, Lambeth-square; that, is Oxford's house—I saw Oxford, and asked if his office was at that time taking lives—he said, "Yes"—I asked him for the papers and rules belonging to the company—he went up stairs, came down, and produced them, for which I paid—this is a copy of them—I have no prospectus; the book of rules states outside the cover that there is a guarantee fund of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked if he was pre<lb></lb>pared to take a life from fifty to sixty years of age, and whether the Society would extend it to eighty years of age—he said that they would—I then asked, stating as he did that they had got no papers to fill up, whether he had formerly had papers for the purpose of parties filling up who assured their lives with him—he said, Yes, he had, but not then; they did not now issue any papers for signature by the assured under 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>—this was on 4th April—I went buck to Mrs. Littlejohn, and told her what had passed—I returned to Oxford's the same day, and requested that he would meet me at Mrs. Littlejohn's, in the matter of her claim against the society—he promised to come, and after a considerable time he did come to his office, and promised to meet me in a quarter of an hour—he came in about half an hour—I then told him that I was employed by Mrs. Little<lb></lb>john to request that the society would at once pay her claim, which was something like 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that at that time they had no funds to pay—I asked if they had any at their bankers—he said that they had not—I said, "Then how can you meet this claim?"—he said, "We have had so many calls upon us that I do not know how I can meet it"—I said, "Have you any funds whatever?" "None whatever"—"Do you still gather funds from the public for this society?" "I do"—"Do you fund them?" "No, we do not"—"What do you do with them?" We keep those funds that we gather for the purpose of paying our own personal expenses in gather<lb></lb>ing them"—"Then you are hopelessly insolvent?" "Yes, we are hope<lb></lb>lessly insolvent"—I then asked him if he could not obtain funds from some of his friends, or from some source or other—he said that that was hopeless, for they had already all of them exhausted their friends.</p>

I should say, for the trouble I bad—this is a copy of the whole of the rough pieces of paper that I took on each occasion—the rough notes that I made are not now in existence—they were made in pencil, and I destroyed them after I had made my copies—this part that I have read is Oxford's own writing—the pencil additions were made by myself at the time, on 15th April—they are simply remarks made at the time—they are the original notes.</p>

Mr. Hill, M.

About three weeks after that meeting"——these were recollections—this was written at the same moment as the other—it is not headed—these pencil memoranda have no heading at all—it goes on, "About three weeks after that meeting of 15th April another meeting was held at Mrs. Littlejohn's at which Dron attended for the first time, when, after a very stormy meeting, they resolved that they would not pay her demand, and that Mrs. Littlejohn might proceed to action, when they would defend it, as the law gave them all power to act as they pleased, and if persons did not carefully read the book of rules, it was their own fault"—That was taken as a memorandum of the conversation which took place between us—there is not a word there about their not paying their liabilities—I did not put that down, because I had it in my memory—they did state that they should leave her to her action, and that they should defend it, and that it was not their fault if people did not read the rules—if I did not state that in my evidence I am saying it now—it is impossible for any soul living to be able to remember the whole of conversations taking place at various meetings—here are some words which have been struck out—they are, "Mr. Oxford, senior, states that his Society would at all times take money payments from the children of a deceased person, who died of a pulmonary complaint"—after he had stated that, which he did, I again put the question to him pointedly, "Now, Mr. Oxford, recollect the question I put to you, will you receive money payments for the children of a deceased individual who died of a pulmonary complaint?" and he said, "No, no, I won't say that;" that was why I struck those words out—Oxford told me that they were paying none of their liabilities, because they bad no funds to pay them—I cannot say that I remembered that at the time I was taking these notes; if I had, I should have stated it there—it did not occur to me, although it be the fact—I was never connected with a loan society in the Strand with a person named Reynolds—I don't know of a person of that name connected with a loan society in the Strand, or any loan society at all.</p>

               <p>did not state that the society was in a solvent state—he said that Mrs. Littlejohn might bring an action against the society, or words to that effect—the Independent Insurance Society, with which I am connected, has been registered about six weeks—it is not doing any business at present, because it is not established—it is simply registered—I don't know that I have advertised for an assistant-manager for it—in all probability I may have done so; not since the company has been established—it referred to another Fire company that might have been raised, but never was raised.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Charles Rush, of Sydenham—on 30th December, about 7 o'clock, I opened my master's shop, and noticed a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186401040039"></xptr>
               <p>loin of mutton lying on the right of the slab—about half-past 7 the prisoner came in for a mutton chop—Walter Gardner served him—the ser<lb></lb>vant told me something, in consequence of which I went to the glass door, and watched, and as the prisoner stood sideways, and Gardner was going to the scale, I saw the prisoner put some meat from the slab into his pocket—I saw directly that it was meat—I called the foreman into the shop to see what he could miss, and I afterwards missed the loin of mutton, which I had noticed on opening the shop in the morning—I knew it, because it was a Scotch loin, and it was rather stained—the ostler and I and Gardner went <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the Fox and Hounds, from information we received—we saw the prisoner, about five minutes afterwards, coming out at the door, and as soon as he saw us coming, he rushed back again—we went in, but finding he had not got it on him we let him go—we fetched him back to the shop pretty nearly ten minutes after the mutton was taken, and searched him, but nothing but the mutton chop was found on him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there a good many loins of mutton in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only eight—I paid particular attention to this one, because all the gravy had run from it in the night, and made the slab bloody—this was between 7 and half-past—the prisoner was six or seven yards from the glass-door—I looked through, across a court—the man who was serving him was there all the time—I know nothing of the prisoner, except his coming in as a customer—he paid for the chop—I will swear that it was not his pocket handkerchief he put into his pocket—I saw him wrap the chop in that—a loin of mutton will cut eight chops, and then there is the tail-piece—it was a short thick piece of mutton—I did not like to rush up to him and say, "You have got my meat"—I do not know why I did not run and seize him—I was certain he took something—he crossed the road to a baker's shop, came out, and went into the Fox and Hounds, which is about 100 yards off—he had passed our shop again to get there—I could have watched him the whole way—a man told us he had gone into the Fox and Hounds—he is not here—the man who found the mutton is a cabman, and works in Mr. Rutledge's yard; which is next door to the Fox and Hounds—the place where the mutton was found, is on the left, about four yards from the door, but Mr. Rutledge's yard lies on the right, and the Fox and Hounds on the left—I have not brought the man who found it, and who lives next door—if anything was thrown over from Mr. Rutledge's yard, it would pitch into the yard of the Fox and Hounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WOOD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If it was thrown, do you think it would go into that place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say, because I do not know the yard well enough—I have no doubt that the thing which was put into the pocket was meat—I can say that he put meat of some kind into his pocket—I could not tell what part it was, and called the foreman to see what he missed, as I wished to be cer<lb></lb>tain before I took steps against the man—it was after he put the meat into his pocket that he wrapped the chop up in his handkerchief, and put that into his pocket—there was sufficient light for me to see plainly what was going on.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he turned round had he the handkerchief in his hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had laid it on the slab, and picked it up—that was the same slab on which the meat had been—I saw him come to the place where the chop was, with the handkerchief in his hand.</p>

               <p>doing—I did not see him take the meat—he was dressed in a short jacket, with very large pockets inside, and cord trousers and waistcoat—I looked at his pockets the same morning after he was brought over; I think they would hold a loin of mutton—I went over to the Fox and Hounds, and saw the prisoner coming towards the bar—I was there when they first went—I saw him before I got in—he appeared to be coming straight to us from the back part of the house—I did not notice Pickett there then—I afterwards saw the prisoner searched, and a mutton-chop found on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he pay for the mutton-chop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was sideways, partly opposite the glass window—I did not see the meat found; I went and fetched it—I have been at the prosecutor's two months—I do not know the surname of the man who was there before me, or what he left for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Willow-road, Sydenham—on 30th December, between half-past 7 and 8 o'clock, I was sweeping in front of the Fox and Hounds, and saw the prisoner come back from there, but did not see him go in—the potman asked me to sweep up the front—I told him I would, but I had not been there long when I went in, got in front of the bar, and had a pint of beer—I then saw the prisoner come from the backyard of the Fox—he had a pilot-jacket on—I saw two persons come in; they said that the prisoner had got something in his pocket which did not belong to him, and they took him out of the house—in consequence of what was said, I went out into the backyard, as I had heard that Mr. Kush had lost a loin of mutton—I did not see anything, but another man found a loin of mutton in the urinal—I went behind the urinal—that man had not been there long—I saw him pick it up—the butcher's boy came and he said, "Is this your loin of mutton?"—the boy said, "Yes."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he go straight through the watering-place and pick it up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he went through the house as if he was going to the watering-place—the wall between the urinal and this cab-yard is about six feet high—there are two gates, one of which is only open once in three weeks or a mouth—John Welch found the mutton—I have not seen him these two or three days—he was employed in the cab-yard.</p>

I am foreman to Mr. Rush—on the morning of 30th December, I was fetched into the shop by John Hicks, and missed a loin of mutton, which I had seen safe about two minutes before—I had only just gone out of the shop—I have seen it since—I know it by it being Scotch mutton, and by the suet being half cut away from the inside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who had been serving in the shop that morning but you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nobody—the maid-servant never serves; she watches the shop—she is here.</p>

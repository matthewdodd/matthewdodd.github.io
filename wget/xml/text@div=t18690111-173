I am a private constable at the Philharmonic Hall, Islington—on 9th December, about 4.30, I was sent for to the White Swan beershop attached to the hall—the last witness said, loud enough for the prisoner to hear, "Butler, this is the young man who passed the bad money two or three weeks ago, and this is a had shilling also"—I took him in custody, and sent a boy for a policeman—my back was to the house, and</p>

            . On the 2d of October, about half past eight o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in Oxford-street; she asked if I would give her any thing to drink, and I asked her; another woman was with her, who went away. I went home with her and had half a pint of beer; the other woman came into the room; I took out 2 s. 6 d. and gave it to her; she said I should not stop there unless I gave her 1 s. more; I told her I did not come to stop, but would have something to drink; she went out to get some supper, and left the other woman with me; she wanted to get me out, I refused to go, expecting the prisoner would return. I waited nearly two hours, and when she came into the room, she told me I had better go to bed; I consented; I put my watch in my handkerchief, and laid my coat under the pillow; I turned round and felt somebody touch me; I saw her hand come out of my hat. I said,</p>
               <p>"What are you doing?" She said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing," and went down stairs, saying she would be back in a minute. I went after her, and could not find her. I returned with the watchman - I found every room in the house locked. I went to the watch-house, returned again, and saw the prisoner in the room with two others. I gave her in charge, but have not found my watch.</p>

She denied the charge, but did not deny having been with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Market-street, and keep an eating-house—on the night of 28th July, or morning of 29th, about 1 o'clock, I saw one of the prisoners about a yard from the cellar flap of the house of Mrs. Tester—I could not swear which prisoner it was, I was on the opposite side—he walked to the cellar flap, it gradually opened; he descended, and it closed again immediately—I immediately ran over, knocked at the door, and told Mrs. Tester, the landlady, what I had seen—I then sent for a policeman, who went down in the cellar, and I kept watch on the cellar flap—he brought up Cooper—he took him to the station and brought back more assistance, and they went down and brought up the other prisoner—I remained at the cellar flap all the time—the cellar flap communicates with the public-house kept by Mrs. Tester.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a public-house at the corner of Market-street, No. 8, close to Oxford-market—Martin made a communication to me about ten minutes after 1 on this night—I called the servants—if a person goes down the cellar flap they could go directly up the cellar stairs into the house—there is a very slight door with a common lock at the head of the cellar stairs—they would then have access to the whole of the house—the flap of the cellar is kept shut and fastened with four bolts—my house is in Marylebone parish.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

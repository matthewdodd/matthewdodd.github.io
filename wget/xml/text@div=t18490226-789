On 22d Nov., the prisoner offered me this bill, and said he had an action against Mr. Gibson for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he had gained, and Mr. Gibson had advanced him that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill for his present wants; and if I would advance him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it he should be grateful for it—I advanced him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he came again about the 28th, and had another pound.</p>

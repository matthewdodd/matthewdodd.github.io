            . I lost this property on Thursday, the 9th of May, between one and two in the morning. I was accosted by three women in Bishopsgate street; they took me to the prisoner's private house, in <placeName id="t18160529-149-crimeloc798">Teuscin's court, Petticoat lane</placeName>

I asked the prisoner whether I could lodge there, and when I took my watch out to see what o'clock it was the prisoner took it out of my hand, and said she would pawn it. I had no idea that they were going to make away with it; and another woman said, I will shew you where you can lodge, and the moment I went out of the door with her, the door was fastened against me, and the person who went out with me ran away. The prisoner remained in the house, and I waited and watched it until six. I never went into the house after; I found her between three and four o'clock in the afternoon in Fashion street, and gave her in charge to an officer. I have never recovered my watch.</p>

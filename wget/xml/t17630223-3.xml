I imagined they were taken away between 3 and 4 in the afternoon; we thought we heard somebody come into the passage, thinking it might be one of our lodgers, we did not go to see immediately; but, in about time, I went, and found the parlour door open, and the plate was gone; an opposite neighbour saw a woman come into the house; I pursued as she directed, but could not meet with her. Mr. Poupard, a pawnbroker, brought me the spoons, (3 table spoons produced in court.) these are my property which I lost at that time, he stopt them, and is here to give the court an account of it. I know nothing of the prisoner's, only Dilly acknowledged in my hearing before the justice, that he had the spoons in his custody.</p>

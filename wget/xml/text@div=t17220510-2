Mr. Vaughan, the Surgeon, depos'd, that upon opening the Head, he found the Temple Muscle bruis'd, the Skull fractur'd, but no depression of the Brain, and much Blood between the Skull and Dura Mater, which was the Cause of his Death; which might have been prevented, if Care had been taken in time; but no Apothecary or Surgeon was sent for till it was too late. The Prisoner, in his Defence, said, that as he was leaning on a Post, the Deceased came up, and said, I am Captain of St. Giles's, and I believe you are one of St. Ann's Boys: He was going off, but the Deceased struck at him; upon which he took a Stick out of another Boy's Hand, and gave the Deceased an unfortunate blow, which he was very sorry for. Abigal Allen depos'd to the same effect. Several Persons gave the prisoner the Character of a civil quiet Lad. <rs id="t17220510-2-verdict13" type="verdictDescription">

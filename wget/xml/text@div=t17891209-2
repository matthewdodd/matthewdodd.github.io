We are not old offenders. We are not, I assure your lordships, hardened in iniquity; and the grief under which we at present labour, is not because we are detected thus early in the commission of our crimes, but because we have so widely strayed from that golden rule, which from our infancy we were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090007"></xptr>taught, of doing to others, as we would they should do to us. We fear it is now too late to hope for such an extension of the royal mercy, as to afford us an opportunity of convincing this part of the world, of our contrition of mind, and the reality of our repentance. But we do humbly presume to hope, that the gate of mercy will not be wholly shut against us. We have made no bad connections; we are not experienced in the practices of vice; we are very young men. The distress we have occasioned our parents and friends, is a source of the most painful reflection to us. Every possible lenity and indulgence we have experienced from those who are under the necessity of prosecuting us; and we hope to meet their forgiveness for the injuries we have done them. Should mercy be extended to us, our future conduct shall, as far as it is possible, atone for those offences which have reduced us to the disgraceful situation in which we now stand."</p>

               Prosecutor. I beg leave to recommend the prisoners to mercy; one of them I know has respectable connections; they used no particular violence
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Court. Had they the appearance of being drunk, when they robbed you? - They behaved with no particular violence.</p>
               <p>You have reason to believe that they have been reputably brought up? - Yes, my lord.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to join in the recommendation, on the same ground.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wells. My lord, I saw several gentlemen yesterday, who said they would come to speak for them.</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice ASHURST.</p>

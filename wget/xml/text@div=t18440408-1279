On Sunday night, the 24th of March, about nine o'clock, I was by the side of the Regent's-canal, near Mile-end-bridge—my attention was called to the back of the premises by the noise of a dog—I went there, and after waiting a minute or two I heard a moaning in the canal—I hastened to the place from whence the moaning seemed to proceed, and saw what appeared to be a bundle in the water—I supposed from the moaning it was a person in the water—I ran for a boat-hook, and pulled the supposed bundle to the side, and there found it was the prisoner—when I got her to the side and was pulling her out, she exclaimed, "Oh my child!"—I asked her where it was—she said, "In the water"—I felt down by her side, and the child was under her left arm, which was still in the water at the time—I had hold of her right am holding it up—I took the child, and laid it on the side of the canal, and then took the prisoner out—the child seemed to all appearance dead—it was quite motionless, and turned out to be dead—I ran with it to the Globe tavern—Mr. New, the surgeon, attended, and measures were taken by putting it in a warm bath to restore it to life—no time was lost, but it was all in vain—that was the child that was seen by Mr. New atthe Coroner's inquest—as soon as Mr. New pronounced the child</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Mile End-road. I was called on Sunday evening, the 24th of March, to this child—it appeared to have come by its death by drowning—I have no doubt at all about that—the usual means were resorted to to restore it, but in vain—I inspected the body after it was opened—it was a perfectly healthy child in every respect, and a remarkably fine child as ever I saw in my life—every part of the viscera was perfectly healthy, and every part was firm and strong—I am not a parish doctor, nor connected with any parish Union.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any breaking out on the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were two or three eruptive spots about it—there seemed a dislocation of the tether—that might have been for some time—the child would have limped.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defenee.</hi> I went to Whitechapel workhouse in great distress; I was there upwards of four months, and had the best of treatment; from there I went to Bethnal-green; I had not been there longer than a month, before my little boy, four years old, had a very bad head; I complained to the doctor, and it went to the Infirmary, but it never got, to say, properly well; it was shaved five times, and the third time the barber was rather intoxicated, and cut some of the flesh of the child's head, and that troubled me; it was ill a long time, but it got well; but its eyes got bad, and it was nearly blind; after that the body was in a dreadful state; I spoke to the doctor about it, and thought it proper the child should have a little mutton, instead of the hard meat; and on soup days I wanted it to have a little meat, which was not al<lb></lb>lowed, and then it was up in the Infirmary again; and there it was all the time I was there, and it came out with breakings out all over its body, and I brought it out so; the other little child I put too soon on its feet, and its knee-pan gave way; I spoke to the doctor, whether it should have an iron; he said it would do more hurt than good, and he told me to bandage the leg up, and to use ointment; they talked about an over-haul, and many of the inmates said they knew of mothers and their children being turned out at a moment's notice, without a farthing; I made application to the Guardians, and got a loan of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I left, and went about to seek for employment, but</p>

               <p>could not get any sufficient to maintain myself; they wanted shirts made for 1 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-piece, and I could not make more than two in a day; I had two half-crowns and a shilling, which I took the greatest care of; on Wed<lb></lb>nesday I left my child with Mrs. Bock, with an intent to buy some muslin to make dress-caps for sale; I then pot my hand into my pocket, and missed my money, which was in a green silk purse; I did not know what to do, but sooner than go back again, I would endure the greatest trouble; not that I was ill-treated myself, but my dear child would, I knew, suffer as my other child did; my child was dirty, and, like other mothers, I have corrected it, but I never ill-used it, nor kept it short of food; I had a nurse-child up<lb></lb>wards of six months; when I had it the back had grown out as large as an egg; I used to wash it, and attend it in a proper manner, and it became as fine a baby as ever was known, and if I had been a bad mother to my child, they would not have let me have that child; I did not jump into the water, but fell over a plank; if my baby had been taken from me, I know how it would have been served, and that trouble was greater than I could bear.</p>

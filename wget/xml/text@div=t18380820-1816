On the 24th of July, I made up five shillings' worth of half-pence and placed it on the desk in the counting house at ten o'clock in the morning—I made up another packet, and took that there at four o'clock, and then the first was gone—the prisoner was employed there—it was his duty to open and shut the shop—we did not suspect him till the evening—he was then gone home—I sent for him he came, and I told him he had taken the halfpence—he said he had not, but they were found in his trowsers pocket, wrapped up as they were when I lost them—this is the packet—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)-when we took him to the police-office, he said he took but one paper.</p>

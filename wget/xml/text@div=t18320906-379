            . I live in Rosamond-place, Limehouse. On the 21st of August, early in the morning, the shawl was on the neck of my child, which a friend was carrying - he is not here; I had occasion to stop behind, and as I came on I saw the prisoner take the shawl off the ground; I said, "My friend, this is my property;" he said, "I wish you may get it," and run across the road-I followed; he said, "You may run, and be d - d;" I cannot say that he saw it fall from the child, which had gone on about thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where is your friend? A. Not here; I have not seen him since - I told the prisoner it was mine, and he ran off with it; I do not believe he saw it dropped - I had asked him about a minute before what he stood there for; this was before he took the shawl.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. About two o'clock in the morning I was with Pye, and heard the alarm; I received the prisoner - he said he had picked the shawl up in the road; I asked if nobody claimed it - he said Yes, there was a man claimed it; I took him back, and met the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up in the road.</p>

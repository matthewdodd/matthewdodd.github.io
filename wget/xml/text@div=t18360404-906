I believed him is a most hazardous state, form the expression of his countenance and him appearance—I believed him in the most imminent danger from the moment I saw him—he was extremely weak his eyes very mach sunk—he breathed with great difficulty; and altogether his appearance was that of a man in a very hazardous state—I conversed with himhe was not able to converse with me easily—he could not—he attempted to answer a question I put but was too exahusted—the first would he said was, "Allow me a mo<lb></lb>ment to breathe, and I will endeavour to tell you"—I then questioned him as to the remedies he had taken—he told me the purpose ha had in view in taking the medicine; next he gave me an account of the medicine itself—I examined his knee-joint—I found his knee affected with acute rheumatic inflammation—it was swollen, hot and painful—the swelling extended half way up the thighit was the right knee—he complained of</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose these pills are made up chiefly of aloes an gamboge, can you state what would be the effect of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the effect would be ac<lb></lb>cording to the dose tat is give—the effect of ten or twenty is to produce generally vomiting and violent purging—four of them are abut a moderate dose—I do not say a person might not take more without danger—it is dan<lb></lb>geruous to take them at any point—I have been called to persons who have taken, ten and have sent for me on that account—I considered that too many in that case—I never administered the pills myself—I have administered the medicines of which they are mad, according to what 1 understand)—one person can tae more that another—we are guided by the effect—there is a medium quantity given as to the dose of every medicine-ten grains is the medium quantity of aloes, and two or three grains of gam<lb></lb>boge, according to our custom, that would be fur pills—that would be six of Morison's pills l—eight of Morison's pills would about four of ours, and six would be three.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You would not expect any body to be alive after going through that process, taking that quantity for several days together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on whether they are continued—the repeated use of them once, twice, or thrice, would not kill a peso, though it might produce paid, but the re<lb></lb>petition of them would bring on inflammation and gangrene—the repeated use of strong purgative medicine would bring hat on—an overdose of the medicines I have named would—an overdose of aloes frequently repeated would kill a person—I have heard of the composition of these pills—I have heard that they contain a very small quantity of asafoetida and that the sub<lb></lb>stance of the pill is aloes—I did not hear the quantity of gamboge—the danger of the dose wold depend on the preponderance of he gamboge—I do not know which is the stronger, No.1 or No.2—that would be the strongest that had the largest, quantity of gamboge—if each pill contained half a grain of gamboge ten would be a very powerful dose of purgative medicine—that alone would be so—ten pills would be a strong dose of that alone—the gamboge and aloes together would been over dose—a very strong dose in most cases—in by far most cases it would be an over dose—I do not say it would be extremely dangerous s—I think twenty pills would amount to be dangerous—a person might survive fifty as most limey it ex<lb></lb>cites vomiting in that quantity—a person might survive if it did not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What would be the effect of an ordinary person taking twenty or thirty pills night and morning for days and night together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The effect would be, that at the first dose the bowels would be cleared out—by a repeated done they would be irritated, and the mucus secretion, the lining of the bowels, brought away—by repeated doses the bowels would be irritated, and, by con<lb></lb>tinued irritation and action, inflammation would be brought on—it depends on the state and strength of the stomach—an over dose of gamboge would kill anybody—gamboge is ranked by Dr. Paris and others as poisonous—above twenty grains it is a direct poison and would act as such on the stomach of most persons—it is my opinion that if there was half a grain in each pill, forty pills would be a direct poison—I do not think anyone could live taking thirty or forty gains daily not taking them at one time and re<lb></lb>peating the dose for two or three days the effect would be death, I belive—it would produce a mortal disease, a disease that could terminate in death.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean to say aloes in proportion to its quantity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes and in my judgement very regularly—I have four years used the gamboge pill, which is gamboge and aloes—I never gave more than three at once—I have repeated them, but never ordered more than three at one time—I was asked before the Coroner, my opinion of the cause of the decease's death—the difference between the pills No. 2 was told me in the room, but at this moment I do not remember it—the gamboge pills</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040053"></xptr>
               <p>that I have administered, contain one grain or gamboge each—I have for<lb></lb>gotten the difference between No.1 and No.2 of Morison's pills—I may happen to hit on the proper description but I do not know which are the stronger—I do not remember haring before the Corner, that Captain M'Kenzie had always a less dose administered to him than was recom<lb></lb>mended—I have heard Mrs. M'Kenzie say to day that she omitted to give No.1 at night three times and gave No.2 in the morning without giving no.1a tall—and I hard her say that Mr. Salmon said No.2 ought not to be given without No.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you, as a medical man whether it is quite fair to judge of the effect to medicine, when it is told you are not to give No.2 without No.1, and do so—is it fair to judge to that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; if a me<lb></lb>dical man sends two medicines, with a particular object in view, under<lb></lb>standing the complaint he wishes both to be given—generally speaking, it is not fair to give a less quantity than a medical man orders and judge of its effect—if the medicine is gamboge and aloes we know what it is.</p>

               <p>on the Wednesday—the effect of two table spoonsful of pills would be to in<lb></lb>crease the inflammation, and hurry it into a state of gangrene; and it is my opinion that would account for the appearances I found on examining the body after death.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D I am a physician and have been practising as such for fourteen years in London. I am physician to the London Hospital I was called in to see Captain M'Kenzie on Friday night, to make an ap<lb></lb>pointment to see him on Saturday morning the 30th of January and in consequence of the at appointment, I met Mr. Cumming there about one o'clock—I found Captain M'kenzie in a state of extreme depression and exhaustion; and in my opinion labouring under a fatal disease—I was informed by Mr. Cumming, on Friday evening, of the particulars of his illness, and the mode in which he had been treated—the statement made was, that he had taken a large quantity of Morison's pills—an evacuation was show to me on the Saturday it contained mucus, mixed with a good deal of fluid, and slight spots of blood—I cannot swear to the fact of slight spots of blood being mixed with it at that moment—the mucus had issued from the intestines, because it was mixed with feculent matter and bile—the mucus was the secretion from the inner lining of the bowels—I ordered mustard poultices to be applied to the pit of his stomach, and the same diet as Mr. Cumming had ordered, with a small quantity of mucilage given to him from tie to time together with injection s—the object of my treat<lb></lb>ment was merely to sustain life—I did not see him again that day—I saw him on the Sunday at noon and at night—I continued the same treatment with little variation, not administering to him any medicines, except broth and the mucilage; I think, just at last when the case became entirely hope<lb></lb>less, he had something to moisten his mouth—I directed enemas to be admi<lb></lb>nistered composed of strong beef soup, and a small quantity of brandy mixed with it—it was to sustain life—I afterwards attended at the examination of the body on Monday at two o'clock and took notes of it at the time (<hi rend="italic">reading them</hi>)—"Monday, February 1 three o'clock twelve hours after death—liver rather large and congested, but no active disease—<hi rend="italic">peritonœus</hi> free from inflammation or other disease—stomach much contracted—along the middle of the egret curvature exceedingly inflamed, with tow spots of ulceration, and one about the size of a shilling, at the commencement of the <hi rend="italic">duodenum</hi> the mucus membrane throughout the whole course, of the intestinal canal, inordinately injected with dark-closured blood—in many parts, more particularly the <hi rend="italic">ilium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">jejunum,</hi> the mucus membrane had the appearance of <hi rend="italic">lymph</hi> effused within its substance and greatly softened—at other parts, the membrane was so thin as to give the appearance of ulcerated destruction—the <hi rend="italic">coecum</hi> colon, especially the ascending and descending protions, was a mass of yellow pulpy matter, mixed with feca<lb></lb>lent matter and mucus—this matter did not distend the intestine by its bulk, but <hi rend="italic">coecum</hi> was extremely distended by air, and had numerous small black spots like commercing gangrene—on opening the knee-joint, a considerable effusion of <hi rend="italic">lymph</hi> was seen, but no marks of common of long continued inflammation or ulceration—in the head the vessels were rather protruded but nothing denoting disease"—with the exception of the stomach, there was no appearance about the body sufficient to account for death—there was abundantly sufficient in the stomach and bowels to ac<lb></lb>count for the cause of death—I should say, unhesitatingly that the irrita<lb></lb>tion in the stomach and bowels cause those appearances—inflammation had cause the ulceration the the stomach and bowels—I cannot take on</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR F. POLLOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not see him before one o'clock on Saturday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw him twice on Sunday and on no other occasion—I saw him three times altogether during life—the disease of which he died had established itself unquestionably on the Saturday—I will not undertake to give an opinion how long—it must have been certainly more than twenty four hours—it might have proceeded from the medicine he took—as I have no proof that it was given I say, "might"—if I had proof of it being given, I should say it was cause enough to produce the disease by the administering of the medicines Mrs. M'Ken<lb></lb>zie has described—I believe these medicines, administered in the manner she describe, would necessarily produce that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment no patient could escape dangerous and alarming illness by taking medicines in that way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not said that, and do not mean to say so—in his case it did so, I believe but others taking the same medicine might escape—I am aware of some of the ingredients of Morison's pills are gambage and aloes—those ingredients are poisonous in consequence, but not absolutely fatal, and it depends on the mode in which it is administered—I think five grains of the compound of aloes and gamboge administered twice a day for a week night produce fatal consequence if they produced inflammation at first and then were administer afterwards—if it was given to the times the amount in other cases I believe it might not produce those fatal consequences—I believe it might he administered</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040056"></xptr>
               <p>to ten times that amount without producing deleterious consequences—I speak of the compound of aloes and gamboge—but I will now speak of them separately—five grains of the compound, night and morning for a week, under some circumstances I believe, wold produce poisonous and destructive consequences, or it might not—it entirely depends on the con<lb></lb>dition of the patient—a very large quantity might be taken without pro<lb></lb>ducing any mischief—I presume a large quantity might be administered with benefit—it is a matter of very nice judgement to know when you may repeat large quantities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the largest dose you have been in the habit of administering of the compound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should ay three grains of gamboge, with from seven to ten of aloes, is a full dose—I am aware that very much larger doses can be taken without producing deleterious effects because they produce a purgative effect and nature relives herself by those means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Perhaps you do not agree with the last witness, that if a particular quantity of medicine procures a certain effect double that quantity will produce double that effect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That depends on the medicine—that applies to some medicine—I belive opium, in a moderate dose, given to double the amount twit produce a certain the effect double certain circum<lb></lb>stances—if the dose he very much increased, the effect is generally very different—most medicines have their effect according to the quantity administered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you name any medicine which throughout the whole quantity which could be given ha its effect in exact proportion to the quantity ad<lb></lb>minstered <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As a mathematical question certainly not—most medi<lb></lb>cines do—it would depend on what five grains of aloes were administered for, whether it would do good—ten times that quantity would not produce ten times that effect—I cannot name one medicine to enable me to give you a precise answer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does that observation apply to the total omission at night, or to the reduction of the quantity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The reduction of the quantity.</p>

               <p>health and the cure of disease—I would first wish to draw your attention to the position in which I stand as a non medical man—the law, I freely allow is against my attending in a medical capa<lb></lb>city provided I received dandy fee for so ding; but in he absence of that, I believe the law is clear on the point that it does not signify whether a man be a licensed or an unlicensed practitioner.; but it re<lb></lb>quires, and justly so, that a man bring to the work he undertakes to per<lb></lb>form, a sufficient degree of intelligence experience and ability I trust, therefore, gentlemen, you will not allow your minds to be swayed against me because I am not a licensed practitioner, but rather let he evidence of those persons whom I have attended, and who will prove the benefit they have derived from my advice determine the point whether I have acted either with gross ignorance or negligence e—it will be necessary for me, as an <hi rend="italic">Hygeist</hi> to account you with what are the fundamental principles of <hi rend="italic">Hygeism</hi>; which is a peculiar characteristic appellation and which is nothing more than a revival or he ancient system of human pathology and is therefore opposed to what the majority of the medical men of the present day advocate, which is technically called organic pathology or solidism—the former doctrine tracing all diseases to the fluids, and the latter as origionat<lb></lb>ing in the solids; that the blood, if not life itself is the great agent of life, and possess a prominent influence over every part of the body to which it conveys and in which it preserves vitality; and that is the existence of disease must originate injury to a geater or less degree to that vitality, so it must of necessity originate in the corruption or alteration from a healthy state of that blood which is the grand substantiation of he vital principle; the corruption, or disease of the blood, is produced by certain humour which hums are either or both <hi rend="italic">matermine,</hi> contagious and person, a that is to say hereditary acquired and original—these humours, which are sometimes more or less local are always when in existence so intimately combined with the blood, as to require the most powerful and searching purgatives in order to effect their expulsion from the blood; but purgative is may be transcendently powerful an yet be composed of such ingredients is to be transcendently pernicious the employment of them with a view to the eradication of one disease, may afford them an opportunity for the creation of another—composed frequently of con<lb></lb>flicting materials, these materials may, separating in the body, lose those qualities which they possessed in combination, and retain and expert those evil influences which they individually possess; but purgatives, composed of innocuous or nourishing constituents, are capable of producing (and alone are capable of producing,) those beneficial effects on the blood and consequently on the health, which only purgatives can produce on the former, and therefore on the latter—it is by the use of such purgatives, formed only of vegetable compounds possessing within themselves no deleterious agencies, which decomposition, combination, or alteration, can develop or bring into action (and therefore capable of producing no effect, save that which is desired, and for the production of which they are in<lb></lb>tended—(that those who practice the healing art accord to the doctrines of Hygienism, successfully endeavour to relive the suffering of their fel<lb></lb>low-cretaures—is there anything in these doctrines, or assertions incom<lb></lb>patible with reason or propriety?—is there anything incomprehensible to the meanest capacity?—is there any argument or deduction that does not bear on its every feature the impress of truth implicitly and certainly?—I feel that to these important interrogatives every unprejudiced, disinte<lb></lb>rested mind must respond in the negative—I will now compare the con<lb></lb>sistent</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040059"></xptr>
               <p>practice and sound principles of Hygeanism with the practice pur<lb></lb>sued by medical men in general—the Hygerists acting on conviction derived from experience apply one remedy composed of innoeuous ingredients for the removal of all diseases, which, as arising in one body, they consider must originally arise from one cause existing in that body—those opposed to the practice of the Hygeist apply innumerable remedies many of them containing poison in a state of temporary naturalization to the cure of all diseases and of one and the same disease—they also treat local diseases by local remidies, either by internal medicines, which they suppose and are taught to belive, will act particularly on the part effected; or, by external remedies drawing to the surface of the skin by blisters, or diverting the humours from their only, natural course through the bowels by local bleeding—the Hygeists, therefore, practising I unison with their doctrine apply one remedy and believe but one cause to exit; because they find by experience observation and inquiry, that all natural effects flow from some natural cause; and that the removal of that cause it the destruction of those effects which remedy is a harm<lb></lb>les vegetable compound la as a purgative to he utter expulsion of all mi<lb></lb>eals of sufficient strength and searching properties to penetrate and draw out, from the various localities of the human system, all the acrid and corrupt humours which the Hygeists and which their practice abundantly confirms is the only cause of the multifarious forms of disease which afflict humanity-the practice of medical men in applying innumerable and opposing remedies to various diseases afflicting one body, and to one and the same diseases can only be defended on the supposition that the human body unlike all natural productions is no governed by one grand and general agent tor principle; but that although intimately and inseparably connected in al its parts and organs it is wholly distinct, different and unconnected with regard to the pains and infirmities afflict<lb></lb>ing and impairing the various parts an organs—comparing the principles and practice of both doctrines, it is scarcely necessary to remark that the Hygeists proceed on positive reasoning funded on natural deductions, while those opposed to hem can only account to their practice by nega<lb></lb>tive hypotheses all and totally opposed equally to nature and to reason—thus by a plan of treatment so opposite in its nature, so uncertain in its effects an so injurious in its tendency the lives of hall persons who are suddenly passe from the treatment of the Hygeists to that of the doctors are placed in the greatest jeopardy—and to this mode of treatment pur<lb></lb>sued in this case, I do most solemnly attribute the melancholy death in this instance—in confirmation of this, look at the thousands and tens of thousands who employ the medicine recommended by the Hygeists in their various aliments; and in no case has an inquest been held, where medical men have not interfered with the beneficial administration of this medicine—in the case before you, I strongly protested, both to the deceased as well as to his friends against their Proceedings fearing at once the evil consequences before stated, an now so lamentably rue—in this no<lb></lb>hing can show the absurdity of their practice more than the fact that a man under the influence of an active purgative and his bowel suddenly stopped; and that followed which all reflecting persons must naturally ex<lb></lb>pect, namely infammation—on the contrary had his bowels been kept in a state of solution by the continued exhibiton of purgatives the cause of the inflammation which ensued would have been removed and a return to health he would have been the consequence—this is no chi<lb></lb>mera—you will ave an opportunity of hearing positive testimony</p>

               <p>in confirmation there f—I will now shorty state the particular of this case and my connexion with it—I visited Captain M'Kenzie on the 22nd of January by his express desire for the first time after he had the affection of his knee, which was an old complaint of his and which had existed in this instance about ten our twelve days pervious to his sending for, me and which he state had been brought on by a cold, through getting wet—it consisted of a contraction of the muscles of the knee joint with some degree of swelling and considerable paid—in fact an acute rheumatic affection—I found he had been taking Moraon's pills of his won accord; but now knowing how to proceed with them he sen for me, a and I advised him to the best of my ability and experience—by gradually increasing the doses he got up to twenty of No.1 at night, and thirty of No. 2 in the morning which were the largest doses I ever ordered and never in any shorter time than twelve hocus between, did I order them to be adminis<lb></lb>tered the contraction of the knee joint soon gave way to this treatment, and he was sealed to put his leg straight in bed which before could only be in a bent position—so far the case was proceeding satisfactorily with the exception or and increase of pain, but confined wholly to knee—here it will be necessary to mention an important fact, elucidated from the widow, and which was wholly unknown to me before—she stated she did not give the doses I prescribed—so that while I was calculating upon the effect of thirty pills, and judged from the supposed operation of that number, she had only administered twenty and in like manner lessened the various does I have prescribed—hence my administering forty pills to the deceased which was the dose mixed by me illiquid was grounded on the supposed want of power of a much larger quantity than was actually given—therefore, the species of deception coupled with the application of of a blister to the knee unknown to me, all tended to thwart my proceed<lb></lb>ings—what would he said in the case of a regular medical man sending his mixture or draught labelled to be give to his patient in a certain way, if the attendant chose to alter the quantity according to their whim and fancy?—would it not be monstrous to charge the doctor with the conse<lb></lb>quences that minds rise in such a case?—in all probability such dose as forty pills would have been thought necessary had the patient had the number given to him that had been prescribed—Gentleman you must not let your minds be led astray but the apparent astounding number of pills given in this case e—calculating a number of small pills is very erroneous way of arriving at any just conclusion—suppose, for instance, it was worded in this way, "About a table spoonful of this moisture to be given, "would it in that case strike your mind as so preposterous?—and yet the same power of medicine would exist—I now beg leave to hand you a powder, which is forty of No. 2 pills pulverised; and I am sure, from the quantity there appears when in powder, and which ha been stated to be two table<lb></lb>spoonsful (but I have no hesitation in saying it would take beyond six hundred or seven hundred pills to fill, when powdered,) it would have a different effect on your minds to forty pills in the whole state—therefore, the only way in which you can arrive at a proper conclusion on the subject, is by paying particular, attention to the evidence of the witnesses which will be examined in my defence—remember that experience is the only test of all knowledge—you will have it in evidence that persons have not only taken the number which was given to the deceased but three times, and even fur times that quantity in one day an the invariable result has been cure—how therefor can it he said that in this case I acted either</p>

               <p>rashly or negligently, looking a the experience which I have had—it has been argued that if a beneficial effect can be produced by a small number such large doses must of course be injurious—this argument, although plausible, is fallacious for experience(our only safe guide in such matters) aburr<lb></lb>dantly teaches us that very large dose of the same medicine does not always produce a more violent effect a smaller one; and that the operation of a drug depends not always on its own intrinsic properties but on the particular circumstances under which it is administered—it will be necessary he to mention the fact acknowledged to me by the deceased, that so far from his being that robust hearty man some of the witnesses would instate, he had repeatedly been laid up with serious illness when abroad—not a very long time back, he was in the hospital, in Jamaica, for three months, with fever and never was able to do without taking im<lb></lb>mense doses of calomel, above 100 grains at a dose which he acknow<lb></lb>ledged if he was obliged to continue, would undermine his constitution; in fact, he was a bloated and a very bilious subject—the apothecary states, that he ordered him chicken broth instead of medicine e—of what use could such things be to a man in he state he was while the inflammatory action was allowed to go on unchecked? and that which before was entirely local being only in the knee, gradually extended itself up to he stomach, which was aided by the application of leeches depriving the knee of a part of its resting—it cannot he pretended for a moment that I attended him for again having never received or expected to receive any fee whatever, it being contrary to the terms of publicly offer; nor was the medicine even purchased of me; therefore, nothing but a desire to do him good could in<lb></lb>fluence me in attending him. I will now just draw you attention to what has been sworn against time as as to my representing myself as a regular medical man—when I was informed on the Friday evening that they had called in a doctor I expressed a wish at al events to se the deceased, which the wire refused to allow me to do; and on my still urging the mater she fetched from the next room a person whom I did not then know, but whom I have since learnt, was Captain Allen; he in a very abrupt and unceremonious manner se asked me who I was and by whose authority I had been attending his friend, and if I had my diploma in my pocket; all of which was aid I breath and with great has t—I looked at him with surprise and sarcastically said, "Do you expect media men are in the habit of carrying this diplomas in their pockets? and as to my authority, I have a grater than any diploma could give me"(meaning thereby, that I considered my experience in this medicine superior to a diploma and which I am sorry to see, they have misconstrued to my prejudice)—and then I said, "I have attended here by the express wish or Captain M'Ken<lb></lb>zie "Gentlemen I have never held myself out to the world as a medical practitioner; and it must have been perfectly well known to the family and friends to the deceased, that I was only what I ave always represented myself to be an agent for Morison's pills—I then repeated my wish to see the deceased; but he in an authoritative tone, me I should not, unless I liked to wait the arrival of the physician whom he expected very shortly—I replied, I would wait and did a considerable time but no physician made his appearance; and at last, on my urging injustice of prevent<lb></lb>ing my seeing he deceased, who I knew in the morning of that day had every confidence in me, they last consented, and the wife accompanied me to his room when I was informed by the deceased, that it was contrary to his his wish that medical man had been called i, that his friends had</p>

               <p>insisted on it; and also observed that Mr. Cumming on hearing he had been taking Morison's pills, said he was a poisoned man—knowing the bad effects which usually result from the doctor's treatment following the Hygean, I pointed out to him the folly of allowing his friends to interfere in a matter which so much concerned himself and of their pretending to judge of medicine which they confessedly knew nothing about—his answer was he was obliged to yield there being so many against him; and after taking me by the hand, and expressing in the warmest terms his thanks for my attention, requested that I would see him the following day. You will bear in mind this all took place when, according to the evidence of Mr. Cumming, he was in a state of collapse—I afterwards shortly pro<lb></lb>tested to his friends against the course they were pursuing, and warned them of the probable consequences; at the same time adding the was in perfect safety if left to my treatment, of which I felt full convection—on the following day I went accompanied by Dr. Lynch, but we were positively refused admittance to his room by Mr. Gray and Captain Allen—we then went to Mr. Cumming, and asked him several questions—in reply to which, he said he thought the deceased would do well; but in his opinion, he had been over-purged, and he was endeavouring to give tone to the stomach; and now after bent there days under the doctor's hands his death is attributed tome, gentlemen I have now ben practising with this medicine nearly seven days, and within the last two or three years, the number of persons seeking my advice have increased considerably owing to the success which has attended my labours and in every instance my advice an attendance ha been perfectly gratuitous, Gentlemen, I would ask you, as fathers of families, whether you would not consider it tyranny in the extreme, if the law prevented your giving to your wives or your children, when ill, that which you would have every confidence is, and which you think would restore them to health—and recollect, the same law that would operate to prevent my administering to my fellow-creatmen that which I know will do them good, would also prevent you. Gentlemen I am so thoroughly convinced to the utter harmlsesseness of this medicine, as well as of its power in subding disease in all its shades and bearings that had I a thousand lives wold trust them all to this medicine—and I have reason for such confidence, having received immense benefit from it in my own person; therefore, personal experience is the basis on which I have ventured to administer it to others—I have had occasion severe attack of influenza, to take eighty pills per day; namely forty at nigh, and forty in the morning, an with the happiest results—I have had four of my own children ill of the scarlet fever, al cured by this medicine as well as whooping cough and measles with a variety of there complaints and is no instance has any other medicine been administered; and the result has invariably been successes—this is unlike the medical me, who very spar<lb></lb>ingly take themselves, or administer to their families, the drugs they send in such plenitude to their patients. Gentleman I call on you well to consider what may be the effect of your verdict in this case—you may, by a just verdict this day establish on a firm footing the medical liberty of the subject or by upholding prescriptive rights, for no other reason than because they have been hitherto upheld, support and perpetuate the most injurious domestic tyranny that can exist in society—give reason and free inquiry on this subject full scope an they will uphold the truth, by bring<lb></lb>ng false opinions and all the offspring of ignorance, prejudice, and self<lb></lb>interest before their severe tribunal and subjecting them to the test of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040063"></xptr>
               <p>close investigation. Gentlemen I ask of you justice—strict an unbending justice—it is not my cause alone, it is as much your own cause—if a mono<lb></lb>poly in medical practice be upheld, no improvement can tae place, except from one of their own body—the only verdict which the evidence brought before you will warrant that of "<hi rend="largeCaps">
NOT GUILTY</hi>." and which verdict, I am confident, will alone bear reflecting on by you—in fact any other verdict would be monstrous in the extreme, actuated as I have been by the very best feelings that ca possibly influence the human mid—that of doing my afflicted fellow creatures good—and the experience I have had, both on myself another, fully Justices me in advising the use of this medicine. Gentlemen, recollect that if medical gentlemen were successful in curing their patients there would be no room of the practice I am engaged in, as every on has a prejudice in favour of them, until they are taught by pain<lb></lb>ful experience the truth, that their practices not based on those sound principles which insure success—this system of medicine is now become entirely a party afair—look a the immense power arrayed against it; namely, the entire medical body, which but few honourable exception—look at the influence this body of men have in society—the power the law has put into their hands)—a dangerous power, and one which however right items gone by is not fit to exist now—in many instances have I known in a country town a tradesman persecuted and deprived of his business, by the secret influence of the medical man of he place, merely because he was guilty of the crime to selling Morison's pills while his own medicines might sold with impunity—I merely rmention this to show that if it were not for the intrinsic worth of Morison's medicines in them<lb></lb>selves. the opposition arrayed against them by the whole bodily of apothe<lb></lb>caries and druggists would be more than sufficient to crush them; and should not the testimony of such men against this medicine of which they confessedly know nothing be at all events received with great caution? The doctors of the present day designate Harvey the great discoverer of of the circulation of the blood, immortal but they know that their medical forefathere considered him quack, and persecuted him because he had been hold enough to declare a great truth which truth was opposed to their preconceived notions—the public are now beginning to see that they are the greatest quacks who cannot cure heir patents; and they the best physicians who can cure them, whether licensed or un<lb></lb>licensed. Gentlemen I leave my case in your hands trusting you with do your duty in the first place to your own consciences, by an unprejudiced review of all the evidence brought before you; by which alone you can do your to that society for which form a part and of which you are hare as delegates. It appears to me there are two points of importance for your consideration in this case; first, was it or was it not a proper medicine to administer in this case? an the next point is was it administered in proper quantities?—a satisfactory answer to this question can only he had from the testimony of of those who have had practical experi<lb></lb>ence in the mater, an snot from he speculative opinions of medical men, who confess they know nothing whatever of this medicine, having never analyse the pills, no have they ever used them—and cannot therefore be acquainted with their effects whether taken in less or in greater quantities, or, indeed, in any quantity at all—and beer in mind, it is not the supposed component parts of this medicine, and which are stated to be different by different chemists but the compound, as a whole, that determines its cha<lb></lb>racter.</p>

When I entered the service as cook, Major Lawrie had five servants these two gown-skirts were given me two years and a half ago; I had them before I went to Major Laurie's—I wore an apron of it there; I told the Magistrate that Miss Laurie gave me two dresses, which she had done; I took them to Mrs. Robinson, and said Miss Laurie gave me them, but I said nothing about the skirts; so many pieces of silk as there are of the same sort, is it likely that they can swear to it?</p>

On the morning of 25th August, about half-past 8 o'clock, I was on Snow-hill with Chapman, another officer, and saw the two prisoners, both carrying parcels—they went up Snow-hill and King-street, into the Golden Ball public-house at the corner of Fox and Knot-court—Shearing came out, leaving Young inside—I went in and said to Young, "You brought a parcel in just now?"—he said, "I was employed to carry it, sir, by that man just gone out"—I then went out and followed Shearing down Fox and Knott-court—Chapman remained with Young—I said to Shearing, "You carried a parcel into that public-house just now, what does it contain?"—he said, "Berlin wool"—I said, "Where did you bring it from?"—he said, "From Mr. Paine's, 72, Queen-Street, Holborn"—I said, "Where are you going to take it to?"—he said, "To a Mr. Shearing's, No. 7, Horse Shoe-alley, Wilson-street, Finsbury"—I took him into the public-house, and took both prisoners to the station—I afterwards went to 7, Horse Shoe-alley—it is let out in tenements—there is no shop or manu<lb></lb>factory there—it is a low neighbourhood, not a place where there is any weaving done—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the parcels—the smaller parcel was found on Shearing, and Young had this sack full.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 241). I was with Rowland on this morn<lb></lb>ing on Snow-hill, and saw the two prisoners, each carrying a bundle—they went into the Golden Ball—Shearing came out and went down Fox and Knott-yard—we then went in, and Rowland said to Young, "You brought a bundle in here?"—he said, "Yes; I was engaged to carry it by that man just gone out"—Roland then went out after Shearing—I asked Young where he was at the time the man engaged him to carry it—he said in Holborn—I said, "Where did he engage you to carry it to?"—he said, "To the Eastern Counties' Railway," for which he had been paid sixpence—Rowland then came in with Shearing—Shearing said it was his property; that he was going to take it to his master, at No. 7, Horse Shoe-alley, Wilson-street, Finsbury, to work it up; that he was a weaver—on taking the prisoned to the station they both said that they were standing in Holborn, opposite Day and Martin's, and that a man and boy came to them, and engaged them to carry it towards the Eastern Counties' Railway—I searched the prisoners—I found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Shearing, and no money on Young.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Davis, Williams, and Co., army lace makers, in St Martin's-lane—I have looked at this worsted (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is similar to what we are in the habit of using, and to what we have missed from our warehouse—this bag does not belong to us—this parcel, found on Shearing, corresponds with some that we missed of a similar nature</p>

               <p>—I know it from its being of a particular spin, and it is a size that is very uncommon in London—it is spun specially to order, and the machinery is arranged on purpose for it—we make all the cavalry lace—this is intended to be manufactured into the cord for cavalry jackets—we have made all the cord used for their jackets for the last three or four years—the policeman came to us on the Monday evening, and next morning I examined our stock, and missed a large quantity of worsted—I missed this particular bundle, as it was the only bundle of tens left of our India stock—the value of the whole is nearly 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where is this particular worsted manufactured? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is spun near Godalming, and comes to us by railway—similar kind of cord is used by the artillery and volunteers—we do not supply all the volunteers, but that is made differently—it is not dyed now—other persons may have this kind of material in an undyed state—this is dyed expressly for the cavalry, the hussars, and dragoons—the cord for the Indian regiments in dressed in the same way—we supply all her Majesty's regular corps—the Indian regiments wear the same dress as her Majesty's—I might venture to my that no one but ourselves uses this colour—I have asked the two prin<lb></lb>cipal dyers in London, and I have never seen it—I have also asked persons in the country.</p>

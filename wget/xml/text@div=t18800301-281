                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Yabsley, of 111, East India Road, Poplar—on 16th February I went to bed at 11.30, leaving my servant to close the house—at 2 in the morning I heard a noise, and saw the bedroom door open, which I closed at bed time—my husband was in bed—I saw a man on the floor—he crawled round the room and then went out—there was a light in the room; it was not enough to see his face—I saw his general appearance, and the prisoner is like him—I saw his side face—I called my husband's attention, who gave information, and two constables came—we found a pair of boots in the bath-room—the shutters were open, also the window—there is a cistern outside, and it is easy for it</p>

               <p>Allington. My Lord, he was sober, he had no Money to make himself drunk; - here's the Woman that paid for half a Pint of Gin after we were marry'd, because he had no Money.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you make the Man drunk, and then carry him to be marry'd?</p>
               <p>Allington. My Lord, he had but 3 s. in the World, and when we came Home, there were 5 or 6 People to wish us Joy, and they were all forced to club for a little more Gin to make us drink. I don't want to have him hang'd; I only want him to maintain me. Here's my Certificate, my Lord.</p>

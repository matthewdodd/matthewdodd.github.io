                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Britannia-street, City-road. I was in company with the prisoner and his son last September, at the prisoner's house, in Hackney-road—I went there with the son to supper—I never saw the prisoner before that—after supper I asked what o'clock it was—the prisoner took out a watch, and showed me that it was twenty minutes after ten o'clock—I asked him if he was sure he was right—he said yes, it was a very good watch, he never had a better, and handed it over to me, and said, what did I think he gave for it—I opened it, looked at the face of it, and found my name in it—I said, "Who did you buy it of"—he said, "Of two men, at a public-house"—I saw my name, and the number of it, and said, "Good God! this is my watch; my father had it eighteen years ago."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not you say you would go and ask your mo<lb></lb>ther about it, as she knew your watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I did not make inquiry about it of anybody—I gave it back to the prisoner then—he told me before I opened it, that he gave 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and it cost him three half-crowns to repair it—he did not say he was fearful he had made a bad bargain, finding the main-spring broken—he said it was very much out of repair—I was a perfect stranger to him—he did not show me the watch till I asked what o'clock it was—when I opened it, I said, "This is my watch"—he told me How he had got it before I claimed it—I did not go to my brother, he came to me—I told him what had occurred the night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. About three or four months ago I was applied to about this watch—I made several applications to the prisoner's son, and endeavoured to find the prisoner, but was not able to do so for two or three months—I went to his house—I got a warrant for him at last—about five weeks ago I saw him one day go into his garden in Hack<lb></lb>ney-road—I did not know he was Mr. Smith, but I said to him, "How do you do, Mr. Smith?"—he said, "I am very well, thank you, How as you?"—I then said I had a warrant against him respecting the matter of the watch—he said, "You are mistaken, I am not the person you mean'—I then said I should not take him away from his family without their knowing where he was going, and asked him to explain the matter—he knocked at the door, and it was opened—he went along the passage and called at the kitchen stairs for a light, and when the light appeared I saw his body over the wall in the garden—I just saw his feet going over—there was a back door in the centre of the stairs, at which he must hare gone out—I endeavoured to follow him, but was prevented by his wife—I succeeded in taking him about three weeks afterwards—it was on a Satur<lb></lb>day night that he ran away—I asked him who was with him at the time he purchased the watch, and he said his son.</p>

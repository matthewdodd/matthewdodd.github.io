I do not know; about the 27th of June, I lent it to Mr. Johnson for his horse, I brought it back to be finished; I never thought any more about that collar till the 1st of July, going through Whitechapel, I saw the collar and I thought it was mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the collar? - A. Yes, I am sure of it; the man is here that made it for us; I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Can you swear to it? - A. By that hole there, and by two little pieces here; I know I have had the collar in my hand several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not other collars that are used that have these particular marks? - A. I have had the collar so often in my hands that I can swear to it.</p>

On the 2d of July, about twelve o'clock in the day, I was standing at the further end of the shop; the prisoner came in, and took up a piece of kerseymere, which laid on a chair, three or four yards from the door - he went out, about sixty or seventy yards, and I after him; he walked leisurely, crossed the street, and went between two coaches on the stand - I followed, and lost sight of him for a moment, as he went through the coaches; I overtook him getting into the fifth coach, with the kerseymere under his arm - he struggled a little, but the waterman assisted me, and we took him back. The kerseymere is my master's property, and worth 8 l. He said it was a bad morning's work, that was all. I have no doubt of his being the man who took it out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How long is your shop - A. About thirty-three feet. I did not see him come in, but saw him going out. I only saw his back in the shop, and do not swear that it was him in the shop.</p>

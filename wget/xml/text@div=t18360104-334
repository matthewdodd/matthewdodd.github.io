                  </hi> I am the son of Joseph Walker, of Cross-street Islington, a potato-dealer. The prisoner, James Wallis, was his errand-boy—he was charged with stealing potatoes on the 17th of December—he denied it—I went with a constable to his mother's house—I asked her for those potatoes her son had given her—she said "What potatoes?"—the constable came up at the same time, and asked her for them—she went up into her room, and brought them down to us—these are them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cross-street Islington, and am a pots<lb></lb>to dealer. A little master's shop—he went in and brought out a basket of potatoes. and emptied them into his mother's basket, who was at the corner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">James Wallis</hi>. My mother came down on Thursday night for thirty pounds of potatoes—she was going out to work the following days, and was not going to be paid till she was done—she was coming down then to pay the bill—she did not like to come to Mr. Walker to ask him for any more potatoes she came and asked them to take them, and pay for them out of my wages, on Sunday morning—she came to the door, I weighed them and turned them into her basket—she went home with them—I went in, and meant to put them down but Sarah was washing the slate; she asked me to run over the way and get one penny worth of horehound—before I came back Mr. Bradsell came and said I had stolen a basket of potatoes.</p>

I allow James Wallis to server in the shop—the baskets contain about 30lbs., but we never sell them without weighing—the female prisoner was in the habit of dealing with us; and lately, we had booked her for three or four weeks—he had served his mother before, but never with 30lbs.—she had five pounds generally, and ten pounds on a Saturday sometimes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a groom. On 23rd Sept. I was in the King Alfred public house, in Lisson Grove, at a quarter pat 1 o'clock in the morning—the two prisoners were there—I was very little affected by liquor—I was able to tell what I was about—about a quarter past 1 o'clock I left the public house to go down John's Yard—the prisoners accompanied me, and while there they knocked me down and robbed me—I had 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as nearly as I can tell—I had my money safe when I was in the public house—I thought in the first instance that I had a sovereign—I afterwards recollected that I had changed that in North Street—I mentioned that before the Magistrate—I do not recollect anything after I was knocked down till the policeman spoke to me, and I told him I was knocked down—I did not tell him by whom—my pockets were turned inside out—I followed the policeman to the station—I found the two prisoners there—I said they knocked me down—Harris struck the blow—Jukes was close to my side—he had hold of my arm—I recognized them.</p>

I was on duty near the Alfred public house—I saw three men come out of the house and go up the yard—I did not know at the time who they were—I was ten yards distant across the road—I heard a man call and some groaning—I went opposite the yard, and I saw Harris coming up the yard—I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, you have knocked that man down—"he said to him, "No, I did not; he is drunk, and fell down"—I had my suspicion, and stood watching—I saw the two prisoners go into the public house again—I then went to the prosecutor, who was standing holding his head, and his pockets were turned inside out—I said, "What is the matter?"—he said he had been robbed—I topped at the corner till I got assistance; I then sent in and took the prisoners—the prosecutor stood at the corner when we brought the prisoners out, and he said, "They are the two men"—I took the prisoners to the station—the prosecutor followed, and said again they were the two persons.</p>

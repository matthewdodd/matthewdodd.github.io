                  </hi>. I am a barge owner, of 56, Wapping Wall—on 19th November, 1878, the prisoner, whom I had known for many years as a labourer, and since as a barge hirer, came to me, and said "I want to hire two barges"—I said "I cannot let them to you"—he said "Then will you let them to Mr. Wiles?"—I said "Who is Mr. Wiles?"—he</p>

               <p>said "He is a stevedore living in Pattison Street, Stepney"—I said "You must either bring Mr. Wiles to me or bring an order from him authorising me to let the barges on his account"—he said "I can do that, and I can get you an order within about half an hour"—he left, and returned in about three quarters of an hour with this document. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Nov. 19th, 1878. To Mr. Allam. Please let the bearer have two barges. James Wiles.") He said "Mr. Wiles wished me to employ lightermen to put these barges in the dock, and pay them for so doing"—I said "I cannot do that, let Mr. Wiles do it himself"—two lighter<lb></lb>men came and took them away with my consent—I relied on the docu<lb></lb>ment—no arrangement was made as to their return—they were not returned, and I ultimately discovered one in the London Docks, and one in the East India Docks—this is a memorandum of the expenses; I paid for them—they cost me about 67. expenses besides the loss of hire, which was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I informed the police about a fortnight after I found I had been victimised—I think about the end of November, or the beginning of December—I found the fraud out next day by sending round to Mr. Wiles the day after the letting, to ask if he wanted any more barges—it was nearly a month before I got the bargee back—I could not get rid of the cargo—we had to watch them, and pump, and move them about, and pay the dock dues—I have never seen the prisoner write.</p>

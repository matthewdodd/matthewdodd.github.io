                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Whitehouse, a draper and laceman, in Oxford-street. The prisoner came into the shop on the 13th of November, in company with another woman, who asked for some lace—I put a box of lace down—I cut two yards of quilling, and then I called the shopman forward—the women both sat down about the centre of the shop—Henrietta Smith, my apprentice, spoke to me, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of what she said, I spoke to the shopman who was attending on them—the other woman paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for some lace—the shopman told them he missed some lace—the prisoner said she did not know any thing about it—we desired her to hold up her cloak, and from under it dropped this piece—I requested her to go into the other room at the back of the shop, which she did—I then searched her and took from her person this other piece of lace, containing about seven yards and a half—it was in her bosom under her dress—she said she did not know how it came there—she then took from the other side of her bosom this piece of lace, and threw it on the floor—those three pieces of lace were in the box I put before the prisoner—I am confident of that—my husband's</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprenticed to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner and another woman in the shop looking at some lace—there was a box before them—I was about four yards from them, on the inside of an opposite counter—I saw the prisoner take a piece of lace from the counter and put it under her cloak—I told Mrs. Whitehouse what I had seen, and she spoke to the shopman—I heard the shopman say there was lace missing—the prisoner said perhaps it had fallen on the floor—she got up, and I saw a piece of lace drop from under her cloak on the floor—the prisoner picked it up and put it on the counter—she was taken to the back part of the shop by Mrs. Whitehouse—I saw her search the pri<lb></lb>soner, and take a piece of lace from her bosom—I then saw the prisoner take another piece from her bosom and throw it on the floor—I picked it up and gave it to Mrs. Whitehouse, and said, "Here is a piece she has taken from her bosom and thrown on the floor"—a policeman was sent for, and both the women were given in charge.</p>

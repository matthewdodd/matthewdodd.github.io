On the 28th of August he was living, I went out at five o'clock in the afternoon, and left nobody in the house, and returned at half-past ten; it was then dark. I had locked the door; I opened it as usual, and found my bed-room door broken open; but no outer door was broken. Wellman was in custody - they must have had a false key. I am sure I had shut the door, and took the key - it is a spring lock, and fastens without turning the key. I found a box under the bed broken open, and property stolen - I found part of it the same night. I have seen Wellman, but never near the house. A sovereign, two dollars, and two half-crowns, were taken from the box - the drawers were open, but not broken. I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth above 3 l.</p>

I found a time-piece stand, a looking-glass, and an old painting there; he was not at home - Day waited in the room below for him, till twelve o'clock at night, we then saw him. I asked how he came in possession of the looking-glass and things; he said, on the Thursday night before, (which would be the 28th of August,) about nine o'clock, he bought the stand and picture at a house kept by one Templar, a cobbler, and that one Hammond was with him, and bought the looking-glass at the same time. I asked who they were bought from; he said he did not know; he said he left his room to go to his place to buy the property. I asked what messenger came for him; he said a boy was sent for him. I took him into custody, and afterwards took Templar and a boy.</p>

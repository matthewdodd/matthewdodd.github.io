They said they would go and walk, and come again in about an hour. They went out, and the prisoner came in again when I was at dinner. He said he did not bring Smith, because he knew I did not like him. He went out again: then I told my wife to tell him if he came again, I was gone out; and I went up stairs. The prisoner came in just as I came down; then we had some beer and gin, and we went out. When we were at a place I never was at before, he swore he would go in and have a glass of gin: he went in, and I after him. Who should be there, but

             and the other man came there after.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. I believe it was about four o'clock. They got me into the bar-room; there were two other men in the bar-room when I went in; they were gambling. One of them said he would lay an hundred pounds, about hiding under a hat: he would guess three times out of four, if money was put under the hat. Then Smith, and the man that came in with him, said, they would play with him for a pot of hot, and a shilling; they threw down a shilling each, and I put down a shilling; we won it: then one said, how much money have you got? one said, I have so much, and another, so much: then the prisoner said, we will all have an hundred pounds each, before we leave the house. I was not willing to let them know how much I had, but they fell a swearing, and asked me what I was afraid of? then I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out ten guineas; the prisoner told me to put it into his hat; they said they would put down the same; that is, all that were in the room, were to put down the same; then they asked me, i f I had any more? I then put eight guineas more into the hat; they all said, they would put down the same quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose were they to put it down?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. For gambling. One of the other men said, neither of us was worth so much money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any money in the hat before you put in your's?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. No, there was not. The prisoner and Smith said, if I could show so much money, they could get a hundred pounds apiece, before they left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was you to show?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. They said, if among us all we could show twenty guineas, we should get the money before we went out of the house; and they said, they would put as much in as I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them said they should get an hundred pounds?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. There were only Smith, the prisoner, and the other three; it was the prisoner, Smith, and one of the other, that said we should be sure of an hundred pounds each.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070017"></xptr> Then the other man, he that came in with Simpson and Smith, put an halfpenny under another hat. I discovered the villainy, and saw what they were about, and that neither of them would put in any money; I got up, leaned over the table, and took hold of the hat in the prisoner's hand, where my money was; and, at the same time, Smith catched hold of my collar, and dragged the hat out of my hand. I said, you are all a parcel of villains, I see what you are about, you shall not have my money. The prisoner handed the hat to the other man that was pretending to gamble, and, as he was handing it to him, he put in his hand, and took out a guinea; I took hold of his hand, got it out, and put it into my pocket: they then all got up, and collar'd me, threatned me, and hauled me back, and let the man get out of the house with my money; two had hold of me before, and two behind. I saw the man take it out of the hat, put it in his pocket, and go away with it: I never got a farthing of it again; I never saw the man before, nor after he had the money. The landlord of the house hearing a noise, came, the prisoner was standing before me, and would not let me go out; but when the landlord came, I ran out, and fetched the man back to the door; they then all got round me again, brought me into the room, and insisted I should pay the reckoning; the man then ran away: I told them I had no more than a shilling, and threw it down on the table. I was afraid of my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How come these men to know you had so much money in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. I do not know. The prisoner and Smith used to come to the house where I live; he was acquainted with the man of the house; he knew I had money. I was paid off from his Majesty's sloop the Ferret. They all threatned me after I had paid the reckoning. When the prisoner and I were left, he said, I will go along with you, you will get every farthing of your money again, never fear; he swore, d - n his blood, he would get it all again, that he knew the man; (they called the man that had it 'Squire Johnson) he said he would bring me to where he lived, and said he was a rich man. He brought me to a house, and asked for 'Squire Johnson; the people said, they knew no such man. Then he brought me to another house, there was no such person there. Then he brought me back, and said, perhaps he may be there again; he was not there. Then we came away; and I went into a house as we came through Golden-lane, to enquire for a person: when I came out the prisoner was gone, and I never saw him after, till he was taken up, which was three or four days ago. I got a warrant for an assault, thinking to get my money again. Smith was bailed out.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not they gaming when you went in?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the ten guineas put down for a stake?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. Yes, but I saw they did not put down theirs; I seeing their roguery, wanted mine again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the money declared to be won?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. No body won at all, there was no declaration who had won; they all said, that man should have the money, after he had taken it away; they forcibly took the money from me, they did not win it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether that guinea was not thrown down by Johnson, to be spent?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take the prisoner up for an assault?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. I did that, thinking they would return me my money; I was advised to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Justice they had been playing with you?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>We had been drinking plentifully that morning. They had a bottle of gin, they asked me if I would have a dram; said I, I will be a quartern, and we will have a glass together; I sent for it. His wife said, are you going towards Bartholomew-Close? I went and fetched a child's skirt for them to do. They wanted me to stay and dine, I said I could not; said he, then come after dinner, and we will take a walk in the fields. I went, we were both in liquor; as we went along, said he, we will go in here and have some slip; there sat two men and a young gentleman; I never saw them before with my eyes. Smith was going over Moor-fields; said he, I will go with you. The prosecutor would go into the room where these gentlemen were; they were drinking rum and water; I said, let us keep our own company, that is best: he would go in there, we had two pints; after that he said we will have a pipe of tobacco; said I, I must get home; said he, you may stay a little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070018"></xptr> bit; I said, I will stay half an hour, with all my heart. They were talking about marrying a girl with a good deal of money; he said, he was just married, but had no money with her. They began to talk of gaming; they tossed up for a shilling, in punch; after that, for another: then we tossed up for five or six shillings, he and I won it; come, said he, will you toss for any more? said I, do not go to gambling, it does not look well; said the other man to him, I will toss with you for half a guinea, and pulled out a guinea; he won that guinea; the young man went out and left his guinea. Said Mackinally, we will have that among us. When the young gentleman came in, he said, where is my guinea? said I, it is safe enough, I have put it in my box; said Mackinally, what did you tell him for? Then they goes to gaming for ten guineas; he said, he would put it in no body's hands but mine, because he knew me; I laid it down upon the table, and would have no connection with it. Said he, this man has money enough, we can have some before we go: I said, you may do as you please; said he, you shall hold it; so I did; the gentleman put his money in my other hand: the gentleman won the ten guineas. Said Mackinally, I do not mind it, I shall win it again; said I, I will go and leave you; will you? said he; I said I will. The gentleman put down 10 guineas again, and Mackinally put down eight; I told it over, and said, he has put down ten, and here are but eight: I took out one guinea, and he took it out of my hand; I said, here is now but seven: he lost that; then I said, this is your own fault. He began to rave and tear, ready to knock my head off; I said, it is your fault. Said I, I shall drink none of your losings, I have some drink of my own; said he, d - n it, I can go home and get some more; said I, do not go home alone, I will go with you; on that he got up and said, G - d d - n him, I can lick him well, and take my money again; said I, do not go to fight: they went out, and were going to fight, and I persuaded him not to fight; said he, Simpson, I do not value my money, if I can but lick him well; the man was gone. I went to every house with Mackinally going home, to see if I could find him.</p>

             came in with them, and three or four more came with them; as soon as they came in they called for a pot of hot, and went into the bar-room; after they had drank it, they called for a shilling's worth of brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there two other men in the bar-room, when they came in?</p>
               <p>Willet. I do not remember there were. I went to serve my customers, and heard a noise. I came in and said, Gentlemen, what are you about? Said the prosecutor, I have lost my money, and the man is ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them playing?</p>

               <p>Willet. He staid half an hour after. The prosecutor went out, and brought the man back into the house. I asked the prosecutor what he had been at; he said, he had been gaming, and had lost seventeen guineas. I asked him at what; he said at hiding under a hat, and he put so much in the prisoner's hands, and the prisoner was to have gone his halves, whether they won or lost: after that the man that he brought back, went out directly.</p>

             came and asked for Mr. Bell; she told him, he was gone to the Excise-Office, and he had put his hand on the 5 s. and 3 d. which I gave her, and taken it away. I desired her to stay at the stall, while I went to look after Simpson. I went home, but Mr. Bell was not at home, so I returned to the stall. I went the same night as far as Old-street, to look for the prisoner; I could not see him; I never saw him till the Thursday. Then Smith and he came together; he asked me what I wanted with him? I said, the 5 s. 3 d. he said, he never saw it.</p>

               <p>I staid at that house half an hour, the woman had a skirt to make for my child, and I went for it. I went into the shop, and saw the man that worked for Mr. Bell; he is a chocolate-maker. I never saw no more of the money than I do at this time.</p>

            . I keep the house where this is said to be done. The girl has lost money several times, she has been guilty of several bad things. When I came home that day, the girl was crying: I said what is the matter? she said she had lost a quarter of a guinea. I said, I suppose, you have been at some of your tricks again; said she, here has been Simpson, and I suppose he has took it. I said, did you see him take it? she said, she saw him lay his arm upon the dresser, but did not see him take it. I was going to light a candle to look in the cellar, there being cracks; she said, you need not light a candle to see in the cellar, for I have looked in every place in the cellar. I never knew the prisoner to be guilty of such a thing in my life. She and I went in pursuit of the prisoner that night, but could not find him; he came the next morning to know what was the matter; I said, Jack, there is a 5 s. and 3 d. lost, if you know any thing of it, let her have it, and I will give you a 5 s. and 3 d. He said, he knew nothing of it.</p>

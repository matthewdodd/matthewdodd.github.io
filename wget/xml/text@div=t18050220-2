             sworn. - I am gardener to Mr. Ellill; I live in his house; the pork belonged to him, I had the care of it; it was fresh pork, it was killed the 1st of January; I cut it up, it was laid on the dresser for pickling in the dairy; on the 2d of January it was stole, but we did not miss it till the evening of the 3d; the man that was pickling it missed it; it was not all stolen; I saw the pork, that was stolen on the 11th of January, at the prisoner's house; he had two hands, two belly pieces that joined the loins, and one of the loins had been mangled about; and it fitted the leg that we had at our master's house; we only matched the leg to the loin; the prisoner confessed to the other; we found at his house the joints that we missed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at home at the time? - A. No, his wife was; we found the pork in a tub; he had pickled it; it was in his bed-chamber on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner himself? - A. I saw him throwing up some dung at Totteridge; I told him I found some pork at his house that was my master's property; he replied that if I was to come to his house at Christmas, I should find as much beef; I told him he must go with me to the Magistrate; he readily consented, and went with me; he denied it before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner? - A. He is a <rs id="t18050220-2-deflabel10" type="occupation">carter</rs>

               <p>Q. What quantity of pork might there be in his house? - A. I cannot justly say; I think I missed about sixty pounds; we found six joints in his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him about your master's house about the 1st, 2d, or 3d of January? - A. No.</p>

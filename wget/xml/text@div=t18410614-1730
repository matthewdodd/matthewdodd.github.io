On the evening of the 19th of May, I saw him with a snuff-coloured body coat—he was going into his house—he had some other things—about half-an-hour after he brought the coat out into the lane, and offered it for sale to a man that stood by—he asked 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he did not sell it—the man tried it on—the prisoner took it in-doors again.</p>

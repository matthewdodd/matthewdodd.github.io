                  </hi>. I am shepherd to Mr. Bacon. On the Sunday morning, I had been early in master's field, and found the sheep had been worried, and one killed—I traced the footsteps of two men, but found nobody there—about eleven o'clock the same morning, I was in company with French, with my gun—Dampford wood, is a preserve of master's—French was rather before me—when I got to the wood, I heard him call me—I was about two hundred yards behind him at that time—I went up to him, and saw a dog run by—he called out to me to shoot it, which I did—when I got up, the men had run away from the wood—I went towards Mr. Rhodes's field adjoining the wood, and saw five men—I am not positive that the prisoner was one of them—I believe, by the colour of his clothes, when we apprehended him, that he was one; but I cannot say positively—I knew him before—finding five men, we retreated, and the five men ran after us—all of them cried out—(Kitley was among them with a gun)—they cried out, "Shoot the b----b----" and various expression like that—shortly after, Kitley discharged his gun at French—he was about fifty yards from him at the time—Kitley pointed the gun twice at me before he discharged it—it appeared, by the sound of the shots, that it was pointed at French, when he fired it—there was a distance of three of four yards between French and me—when the gun was discharged, I heard the shots rattle in the hedge, and in the boughs of the trees—the men all ran away—we went for assistance, but they had got out of sight them—Fowler, Foster, French, and I went in pursuit of them, and took Page into custody, with a man named Smith, near Colney-hatch, about a mile and a half from Bound's green—we handcuffed them, and put them into a cart together—it was between seven and eight o'clock—in going homewards with them, we stopped at a beer-shop, having information that some more of the party were there—the two men were in the cart, and I with them. but all the others were in the beer-shop; and by that time it had got quite dark—Page and Smith sprung out of the cart, handcuffed together, and ran away—Kitley, George Page, and Cartwright, were afterwards apprehended and tried here.</p>

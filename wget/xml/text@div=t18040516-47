               <p>Prisoner's defence. All the time I was down there I found a good deal of ill usage and barbarity; the Captain was brought in debt to every prisoner in the ship, and he told them there should be no lenity shewed them; they had brought him in debt, and in so doing the contract was taken out of his hands; he told them they should not have the privilege of writing to the Secretary of State, and he said he would be a match for them all the while he was Captain on board the hulk; I had been on board a man of war all last war; we had a petition, and he said there should no petition go from there; there was a great deal of barbarity, and every man tried for his liberty, and I thought it was necessary to make away as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Court. As to your ill usage I do not believe.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 521). On 23rd July I was on duty in Buck's Row, Whitechapel, where the East London Railway. runs in about 40 feet of cutting—there is a railway bridge and at the end of it a hoarding—I saw the prisoners pick up several brickbats—there is a gate at the side of the hoarding with a wooden bar across, and they got up and reached over, and as the trains came in and out I saw them throw three at two different trains—they had three <hi rend="italic">shies</hi> each as near as I can tell—trains approach the station and leave it rather slower, and persons can tell by the noise and steam when the trains are coming—when they saw me they got off the hoarding and ran away—I got the assistance of another constable and sent him up Wood's Buildings—they ran up by the school and I caught them—they said they were over there to ease their bowels—I took them to the station master and from there to the police-station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 256.) Allingham called my attention, but I saw nothing of the stone-throwing—when I saw the prisoners they were standing at the corner of. Wood's Buildings—I was in uniform, and when I approached them they ran away—Allingham went down Nelson Court and I ran down Wood's Buildings and drove them into Allingham's hands—the prisoners are the same boys that I saw running away.</p>

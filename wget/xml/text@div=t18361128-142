                  </hi>. I reside at Hadley, near Barnet; the prisoner was in my employ for twelve months as a carter. On the 8th of November he left my house, at half past two or three o'clock in the morning, with a load of hay for London—he ought to have taken thirty-six trusses for the load, and forty pounds for the horses—he had no permission from me to leave hay any where on the road—on the same morning I found these two trusses at the police-station, which are mine, I swear.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 172.) I was on duty on the morning of the 8th of November, opposite the Crown public-house, in Holloway-road, and about half-past five o'clock I saw the prisoner stop his horses oppo<lb></lb>site the water-course—he then went to the cart, took a truss of hay out and took it into the stable of the Crown—he then went back to the cart again, took out a cloth, and took that into the stable likewise—he then came out and spoke to the horses to send them on—then another man came out from the stable, but I do not know who he was—I went to the prisoner, and asked him what he had put in the stable—he said he had taken in a cloth—I said, "You have taken in hay"—he said nothing to that—he stood against the door, and I went into the stable, and saw the truss of had and the cloth lying under the manger—there was no other hay in the stable—I compared it with the truss on the top of the cart—they were both Rowen hay—the load was coarse hay—I then took the truss out of the stable, put it and the cloth on the top of the cart, and took the prisoner and the load to the watch-house—the name on the cart was Samuel Strong, Hadley, Middlesex.</p>

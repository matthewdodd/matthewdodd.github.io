            . I am a constable. The surgeon's assistant who examined the deceased's body, is gone to Edinburgh; the surgeon did not open the head, the body was in such a dreadful state that we could not go near it; it was about an hour after the man's decease - nothing was said about a fight then; the fight took place on the <rs id="t18290716-63-cd366" type="crimeDate">13th of June</rs>

            . The deceased came to my house for a lodging, at Brentford, near Ealing, on Wednesday. the 24th of June; he died the next morning - he came on foot, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and appeared in pretty good health; he said he had a severe pain in his head - that was all the complaint I heard; I saw no marks of bruises on his face. I was called just before three o'clock next morning, and found him in a dreadful state; I did not hear him speak - his wife was in bed with him: one of the people who lodged in the room alarmed me - I went for a doctor, but could not make him hear; I returned, and sent another person for one; the apprentice came and bled him immediately, but he was dead before he came: I saw the doctor examine the body all over - I did not observe any bruises; he examined his head, and felt about him.</p>

            . The deceased was my husband; I accompanied him to Brentford - we had been lodging at Deptford before that; he complained of a pain in his head on the Monday morning, and died on the Wednesday; he had fought on the Saturday, and ended the fight on the Sunday - I was present at that fight - I do not know what day of the month it was: he was taken speechless at three o'clock, and died that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it made you first suppose him to be dangerously ill? A. I cannot tell - he never spoke to me in the night; one of the lodgers awoke me about three o'clock, and said he was dying - the fight was on the Saturday before the Inquest was held; the prisoner and my husband were coming up the street, and heard a woman cry out Murder! it was five or six women beating each other - my husband fetched a constable: and on Sunday morning the prisoner and the rest of his comrades came out of Rending's house, and struck my husband three times - he ran into the back yard; the prisoner followed, knocked him down, and kicked him while he was down: several men came and kicked him - my husband had struck him once or twice before he was knocked down; the prisoner struck the first blow - I did not see any blows on my husband's head; he had a black eye and a scratch on the side of his face. On the Monday my husband got a warrant against him, and we staid at Deptford till the following Friday; my husband kept his bed until Thursday - he did not look ill on Thursday: we left Deptford on the Friday, and walked to Wandsworth; we staid there till Tuesday morning, and walked from there to Brentford, but not in one day - we were obliged to sleep out of doors one night, as we could not get a lodging; he first complained of his head on the Tuesday morning, as we left Wandsworth.</p>

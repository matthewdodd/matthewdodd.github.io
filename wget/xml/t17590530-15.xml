            . I belong to the Discount-Office at the Bank, and have done for four years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the manner of discounting bills at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Rogers. They bring a list of bills, and put the sums and names of the persons upon them, then we carry them into the parlour to the gentlemen to look over them. Then they are carried to the committee and left, and when they approve of them they ring for us. The committee in waiting determine whether they are good bills or not. If they do not like them they refuse them, and we deliver them back again. Mr Tittley us'd to keep cash at the Bank, and used to bring bills.</p>
               <p>Q. What cash had he there on the 3d of October?</p>
               <p>Rogers. He had 27 l. 7 s. 9 d. before he brought thirteen bills. These bills were for 1669 l. 11 s. 7 d. produc'd. Here is my figure on the back of them. It is usual after the bills are ordered, to sign them; then to write them in a book called the Day-Book; then it is wrote upon Mr Tittley's account. Credit was given for it. He draw'd off from that 1600 l. by a write off.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain that.</p>
               <p>Rogers. That is, an order to write off. Wrote off from my bank-book 1600 l. that is wrote into his book, and he has Bank-notes, or what he pleases for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this write off paid?</p>
               <p>Rogers. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any other transaction between the Bank and Mr Tittley?</p>
               <p>Rogers. After that we discounted 'till the 3d of November, then there was only 3 l. 16 s. 4 d. remaining; that has not been drawn off yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell the balance between him and the Bank?</p>
               <p>Rogers. That 3 l. 16 s. 4 d. is the balance. Some of the bills that he discounted were paid, and some were not. I believe the four last were not paid. The bill in question, that has not been paid back to the Bank; that is, the Bank has not received the value for it.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said, he had been eleven years last April at the Bank. That he knew Mr Tittley near as long as he had been there. That he was a warehouseman and merchant. He had taken him to be a man of great credit. He look'd upon him to be very industrious, but not worth much money. That he had discounted from the 3d of Oct. to the 14th of Nov. 14325 l. That they have had bills drawn upon Tittley by the name Jo. Archer, that had been paid, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300035"></xptr> the amount of 740 l. That they were brought by Mr Tittley, but don't know to whom payable.</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Chitty. I am one of the Directors of the Bank. I was one of the committee on the 3d of Oct. 58. This bill in question was brought in by our officer, for our allowance or disallowance; and it was allow'd to be discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. What are your rules you go by; and what do you rely upon for your security ?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Chitty. We expect the drawer, the person upon whom drawn, and the accepter, should be good men.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known there had been no such person existing as Jo. Archer to this bill, would you have allowed it?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Chitty. No, not upon any consideration; we should not allow of any bill with a fictitious drawer, if there had been ever so many indorsers.</p>
               <p>Q. to Booth. Do you know what is become of Mr Tittley's bill-book ?</p>
               <p>Booth. Here it is. In this are enter'd the bills he received out of the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the bill in question entered there?</p>
               <p>Booth. It is kept regular. I have examined about the 26th of Sept. 58. to the 10th of Oct. and cannot find it. He drew 1600 l. out of the Bank on the 3d of Oct.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr Tittley and the prisoner acquainted together?</p>
               <p>Booth. They were.</p>

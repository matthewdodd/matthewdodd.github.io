                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Tarrall, a labourer, and life in Rich-street, Limehouse, on the ground floor. The prisoner and his wife Mary Ann Grout lived together in the same house, two pair of stain above me—they came on Wednesday, the 5th of September—on Sunday morning, the 9th of September, about ten o'clock, Mary Grout came into my room—she was sitting discoursing with me when the prisoner came into the room, and asked her to fetch an ounce of tobacco—she said, "I shall not"—he said, "Send one of the children"—she said, "I am ashamed to send the children, they are so deplorable"—he shut the door, and as he shut it she said, "Go to h—, you vermin"—in going along the passage he said she was fit for nothing but sitting gossiping in a neighbour's house, and if he caught her that day he would give her a poke in the eye—the was as he was going up stairs to his own place—she remained a very few minutes in my room after that, and then she went up stairs—I remain in my own place—I saw her again in about twenty minutes at the farthest, running down stairs and crying out, "Oh, help, help!"—she came into my room—she had a cut under her left eye and a bruise over the eye—she complained that her ribs on her left side were broken, and held her hand to her left side—this was between ten and eleven o'clock—she was taken to the Whitechapel Hospital a very few minutes afterwards—I heard nothing during the twenty minutes she was away, but "Help, help" called—it was</p>

               <p>her voice, I know—it came from the stairs—I did not see the prisoner till the policeman took him out of the house—I did not hear him say any thing—I saw the deceased once in the hospital—she died on the 30th of September—nobody lived with them but their children—the two oldest are ten and twelve years of age, but were not at home—nobody was there but a child of two years of age, and she was down stairs in the street—if any of them were there they were not strong enough to break the ribs ofs grown woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived in the house on the same floor as the prisoner, in the next room. I was at home on Sunday morning the 9th of Sep<lb></lb>tember—in the course of the morning, I heard very foul language used by the prisoner's wife—I was in bed and was awoke by the noise in their room—I cannot be certain of the time, but I think it—was between eight and nine o'clock—they were up at the time—I could hear them moving about—I heard her call him foul names—I heard nothing more until I heard her call for help—that might be a few minutes after—she was in her own room then—I heard people moving about the room apparently quickly—every thing was then quiet for four or five minutes, when I heard her say, "It is my own fault"—I heard the prisoner say, "Then why could not you hare avoided all this before?"—I did not see her again alive—I had seen her on the Saturday, she was quite well then.</p>

I was at the house in question on the Sunday, between ten and eleven o'clock—two boys came for me—I did not see the prisoner then—I saw his wife standing outside the front-door—he appeared to be very ill, and complained of her ribs, and she had a mark under her left eye—she was taken to Mr. Johnston, the surgeon, and "afterwards to the hospital—I took the prisoner into custody, while the de<lb></lb>ceased was at Mr. Johnston's—I found him up stairs, in his own room, with a little child about two years old, nobody else—I told him he must come with me, which he did—in going along I told him he had been knocking his wife down, and jumping on her—he said he had not jumped on her, but owned he had struck her with his fist—I saw her once or twice at the hos<lb></lb>pital—she grew worse, and afterwards I saw her dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgical pupil at the London Hopital. On the 9th of September the deceased was brought in during church-time—I did not see her till one o'clock—I examined her—she had got a contusion on the face, over the left eye, and an extensive injury at the side—she complained of great pain—I concluded her ribs were fractured; and at a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, I found two ribs were broken—I could see there was a severe injury to the side, from the pain she felt on being touched—she was regularly attended to by me—she recovered, and six days after she was admitted, I gave a certificate that I thought she was out of danger, but in seven or eight days she complained of pain over the part—I told Mr. Cooper, whose pupil I am, and he attended her—the got into a low way, and never rallied—she died on the 13th—I examined her after death—I think fever, consequent on the injury she received, caused her death—the fever, I think, was brought on by the blows she re<lb></lb>ceived on her head—I examined her head—there were marks of blood on the scull, corresponding with where she had been struck—the membranes of the brain were unusually full of blood, and there was an unnatural quantity of serum in the base of the brain, and the vessels themselves were unusually full of blood—I do not think the injury on the ribs con<lb></lb>tributed to cause death—the parts close to the fracture appeared healthy—the injury on the head was sufficient to cause death.</p>

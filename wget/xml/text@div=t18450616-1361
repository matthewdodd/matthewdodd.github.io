                  </hi>. Iam a jeweller, and live in Peascod-street, Windosor. Between eight and nine o'clock at night, on the 2nd of June, I was coming on shore at London from the Emerald steamer—I proceeded towards Lon<lb></lb>don-bridge—I felt a pressure, as ifsomething was being drawn from my side—I saw the prisoner close by my side—I felt, and missed my watch from my waistcoat-pocket—I turned and said, "You have robbed me, you have stolen my watch"—I called him—he denied it, and at the same time dropped it—I saw his hand go down—I did not see it fall from him; I saw it fall at his feet.</p>

On the 13th of September I went out at nine o'clock, and left nobody at home but the children, who are quite infants, and were in bed; I bolted the back-door, pulled the front-door too, and tried it with my hand - it was as fast as it could be, but any body used to it could push it open by putting their knee against it; I returned at half-past ten o'clock, and found my husband had come home in my absence - I missed a bonnet out of a box, and two children's hats from another box, also the lodger's hat, one muslin and one cotton gown(which had a skirt separated from the body) two petticoats, and the counterpane off the child's bed; and on Monday I missed a shift, which I had seen on the Saturday evening, just before I went out; I took it up stairs, and shut the room-door - there was a particular patch on it, where the bone of my stays had made a hole, by which I know it, but no mark. Two months before this happened I had left a message for my lodger at the prisoner's sister's, how the door could be opened. I found my child's hat at Mrs. Mills' - the maker's name had then been taken out; I went away, and when I returned to Mills', the hat was gone - it has been produced since. The prisoner was taken into custody; I was present when a female searched her - she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230017"></xptr>took the shift off her person herself, in my presence, while Fielding was searching her; I know it to be mine by the mark I have mentioned - it was clean when I lost it; here is the patch on it - it is my own work: the prisoner said her mother gave it to her two years ago, at Brixton; she was taken on Monday, the 15th of September.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not at Worship-street, give an inventory of the things you lost? A. Yes, on Sunday - I had not then missed the shift; I told Fielding I had lost it on Monday morning, before it was found - it is much more torn than when I lost it, but the patch is not torn; I know my own work.</p>

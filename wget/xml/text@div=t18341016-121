In the forenoon of Saturday, the 4th of October, I went into the Bull public-house to have my breakfast - I was reading the newspaper, and had a beef-steak, which I gave to Shearman, the servant, to be dressed - the prisoner came in, and asked me for the paper - I said he should have it in a minute or two - he said, if it had not been for me, he should have been in service at that time - I told him he had no business to make use of my name -(he had got into service by making use of my name, and the gentleman did not approve of him afterwards - I understood that to be the case) - he then began to abuse me dreadfully - I told him if he did not hold his tongue, I should get up and shake him, which I did, and struck him before he struck me - we had a scuffle, and when I got about the middle of the room, he struck me with a knife and stabbed me- he took the knife up in the middle of the room, and struck me with it in the left breast - he was in a passion, and had not time to cool after I struck him - it happened immediately after the scuffle.</p>
               <p>Q. Before his blood had time to cool? A. Yes - the knife laid on the table ready for his breakfast.</p>

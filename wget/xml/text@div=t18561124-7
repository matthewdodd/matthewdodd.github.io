                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 440). On 13th Oct. I was on duty in Cheapside, about 7 o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoners walking up and down Cheapside, and looking into the jewellers' shop windows—I and my brother officer followed them—they went to Mr. Mott's, a jeweller and silversmith, at the corner of Friday-street—they looked in at the window, and went to the corner window, and watched the policeman on the beat away—(we were in plain clothes)—I then saw Smith put his hand in his waistcoat pocket, and take out something, and smash the window—it was plate glass—he made two smashes at it—it broke on each occasion—I at once caught hold of him—my brother officer took Raymond—we took them, both to the station—I found on Smith an empty purse, a knife, and a look<lb></lb>ing glass—I went back to the window, and found this stone, which had dropped down by the side of the broken window—when Smith broke the window, Raymond was standing so as to cover Smith's arm.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 459). I was with Legge—we followed the prisoners up and down Cheapside three times—they looked in at different windows, and made a halt at Mr. Mott's—they were a few minutes in conversation, and the policeman on the beat came up Friday-street—they watched him away—Smith then took this stone from his pocket, and broke the glass with two blows—we went over—Legge took Smith, and I took Raymond—we told them what we were, and took them to the station—I searched Raymond, and found on him a small knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. William Mott, at the corner of Friday-street, Cheapside. On the night of 13th Oct. I was in the shop—I heard the glass smash, about half past 7 o'clock—I ran out, and immediately saw the prisoners in custody—there were two holes in the window, one was large enough for a man's hand to go through—at that place there was the most valuable property in the window, diamond necklaces, and other articles, worth nearly 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—every article was marked with the price—it was the most valuable part of the window.</p>

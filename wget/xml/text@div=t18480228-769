                  </hi> My husband keeps a grocer's shop, in New Gravel-lane. On 2nd Feb. the prisoner came for a pennyworth of oatmeal, and some other things, which came to 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he put down a half-crown, which looked very black—I gave him the goods and change, and put the half—crown into the till—I cannot say whether there were any other half-crowns there—directly the prisoner left I went to the till—I had not been to it for any other purpose—I could not say whether there was any other half-crown, but I found one black-looking one where I had laid it—I took it out, examined it more par<lb></lb>ticularly, and found it was bad—I am sure I took out the same half-crown that I had put in—on the following day the prisoner came again—he asked for some more things, which came to 3 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I recollected him—he put down a bad half-crown—I weighed the things—I then put the things before him, took up the half-crown with one hand, and took hold of the prisoner with the other, and said, "You gave me a bad half-crown last evening, and this is another"—he said I need not hold him, he would not go away—I let him go—a policeman came in about five minutes—I gave him the half-crowns, and said the prisoner had passed one the night before—he said to the police<lb></lb>man, "You see they put it in the till, and now they can't find it"—I was in a flurry when I told him about what and happened the night before—he said the half-crown could not be indentified.</p>

Gentlemen, the facts to bring this charge home to the prisoner, are shortly these. In the month of January, 1782, a Mr.

The clerks had not the least suspicion that there could be any fraud in this man; he had been vouched for by one of the other clerks, and he got the money. Finding he got the dividend so easily; on the 11th of May he sold out 50 l. then he saw that in May there was 400 l. placed to his account; and on the 17th of May he sold out the 350 l. so that this man, knowing in the month of April, that he was entitled only to 200 l. in the month of May, comes and transfers all his right and property in the sum of 400 l. without the bank having the least suspicion of any fraud in this transaction. Some time after this, the first Mr. Smith came to receive his dividend of 200 l. When he came to the bank, why, says the clerk you have no money, you have not a farthing here; no says he, why I had 600 l. and I sold out 200 l. and then I sold out 200 l. more, and I have 200 l. left; no Sir says the clerk, the money was sold out such a day; if that is the case says he, then somebody must have personated me: now gentlemen, this being represented to the governors of the bank, who are the guardians of our property, they thought their duty required, that this man should be immediately taken into custody, because, if we trust our money in their hands, they ought to protect our property; to them we look for that money we intrust them with; to them Mr. Smith looks for his 200 l.

               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, the only evidence that we have is this, that this man saw that 200 l. was placed to him more than he was intitled to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. The case as you have opened it (and I attended very particularly to your opening) amounts clearly to this, that the clerks of the Bank made a mistake, and that mistake enabled them to offer this man more than belonged to him, and he dishonestly took more than belonged to him; but he, from the circumstances of the case, never personated any man: yet I think the Governors of the Bank have done perfectly right, as the Guardians of the property of the proprietors of Bank stock, every imposition<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040108"></xptr> upon them they certainly ought to prevent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder to Jury. The fact that would have made this a matter to be left to you, Gentlemen, is that of the prisoner's knowing that a

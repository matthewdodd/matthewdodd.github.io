On the 28th of September, at a quarter-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was in my room, and saw the prisoners in West-street, which is half a mile from Tayler's; Law was in the road driving the pig with a whip; Newland was on the path talking to Law - the pig turned up Anne-street; Newland turned it back; they drove it to Devonshire-street; I went after them - Newland kept looking back, and I think saw me - he crossed over the way; Law turned the pig down Red-cow-lane, and towards Dogrow: Newland had then left him - Law turned it up Devonshire-street again, and there I saw Newland again; Newland turned down Northampton-street. I saw Crew, the officer, and told him - I took Law - Crew said, "Where is the man who was with you?" he said, "Down Northampton-street" - Crew went and took him - he said the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260089"></xptr>man had asked him to turn the pig back, but he knew nothing of him, and refused to go with us; Law said it belonged to B. Jackson, who worked at Box's, in Chicksand-street; Newland said if we would let him go, he would walk quietly, but he ran away; I followed, and took him to the watch-house - we could not find Jackson.</p>

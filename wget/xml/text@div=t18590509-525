                  </hi>. My father carries on business as a grocer and cheese-monger at Woolwich—the prisoner had been in my father's employ as an assistant for two months—on 30th April I was in the same shop with the prisoner—I observed him do something behind the counter, and I heard a noise at the till which excited my suspicion—I went to the prisoner, and asked him what he had put in his boot—he seemed confused—I sent for my father, and we searched the prisoner's boot, and found in it 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but before pulling the boot off, the prisoner said, "I know what you want; I am guilty"—we sent for a constable, and the constable asked him if that was his boot—he said it was, and he had put the money in the boot, which was his master's property—he asked him if he had anything else—he said, "Yes;" and he handed him a packet from his breast—it was opened, and it contained between 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver—I went to the prisoner's lodging with the inspector the next day—I saw the inspector find some bacon and cheese, and other things, and some money—the bacon and other things were exactly of the same description as the property in my father's shop—to the best of my belief it was my father's property.</p>

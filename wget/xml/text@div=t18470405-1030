                  </hi> I belong to the <hi rend="italic">vivid</hi> cutter, which is now on a voyage. On 3rd April I was at the Nag's-head, by the Tower—when I came out I saw the prisoner standing by the door—she got hold of my arm—I pulled myself away—she run after me again, and put her hand over my shoulder into my waistcoat pocket—I had half-a-crown and a shilling there—I felt her put her hand into my pocket, and after she took it out I heard something jink, and she passed something to another woman behind her—I felt, and my money was gone—I am sure I had it in my pocket three minutes before—I caught hold of her and called a policeman—he came and took her—I am sure she is the woman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police constable H</hi> 114.) I heard the prosecutor cry out, and went up—the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner and said was robbed—the prisoner said she had not got the money, nor had she done any<lb></lb>thing—I asked the prosecutor to give charge of her, and he did—I asked him to come to the station, but he refused, as he thought he should be locked up himself if he did—the prisoner did not make any charge against him—I let her go and took her again on Monday night—the prosecutor was sober.</p>

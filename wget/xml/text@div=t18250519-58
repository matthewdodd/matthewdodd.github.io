            . I am a baker, and live at No. 43, Duck-lane, opposite to the prosecutrix. On Monday night Harlow told me what had happened; I had seen the prisoners come out of her passage door, about a minute and a half before; I knew their persons before, but not their names; I did not see them go in, only come out; Royston held his coat, as if he had something heavy in it: I went after them in consequence of what Harlow said; I lost sight of them. I shut up my shop, and went after them again, and found them sitting on the pavement in Orchard-street; the watchman took them: I went to the watch-house, and saw 2 s. 4 d. is halfpence and pence found on Royston, some in his breeches, and some in his coat pocket; he said he got the money in St. James's, by holding gentlemen's horses - nothing was found on Flowers. Harlow's house is in the parish of St. John the Evangelist, Westminster.</p>

            . I am a watchman, and knew both the prisoners before this. On the night in question I was calling eleven o'clock, and just by Cat's-head-court I saw them sitting on the curb stone, eating sheep's head and bread; I crossed over, and asked what they were doing there; they said they would get up and go directly: I told them to go instantly. One got up, and threw the bread and sheep's head into the other's lap; in about half a minute Hunt called out, "Stop those two boys;" I stopped Royston first, and the other ran away; I left Royston with Hunt, then followed, and took Flowers - I searched them at the watch-house, and found 2 s. 4 d. in Royston's trowsers and coat pockets; the constable of the night asked how he came by the halfpence - he said he got them in St. James's-street, by holding horses.</p>

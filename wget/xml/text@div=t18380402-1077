                  </hi>. I am an orange-merchant, and lire in Botolph lane. On the 15th of February a person came to my shop, and asked for an umbrella to mend—he was rather a shortish, stoutish man—(I think had seen him the day before, when he came in, in the same way, and asked if I had an umbrella to mend)—I should know the man again—I said lie might mend one if he would bring a stick and do it at my house—it was the prisoner—he did not give me any name, but he gave his adders "Bear-yard, Bear-lane"—he said he would return the umbrella in about an hour, but he did not return—he left two old umbrellas behind—I saw confident he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. On the 15th of February the prisoner came to our house for an umbrella—I had seen him the day before, when he came about two o'clock—I am sure he it the same man that had been the day before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How was the man dressed that came the day before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With a blue coat and bright buttons—I did not notice who waistcoat or trowsers he had—he was not dressed like the prisoner is not—I did not take particular notice of him—I was very busy packing orange and I just looked up as he was standing there—ray father took me to the police office—he did not point the prisoner out—he did not ask me whether he was the man—he said nothing to me—it was about a month after I had seen him.</p>

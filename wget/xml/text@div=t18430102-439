                  </hi>. I am a porter. I was in Hungerford-street on the 24th of Dec., and saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> which the prisoner drove, and a man on the box with him—I saw a man cross the road—either the horse or the shaft struck him—he was knocked down, and the near fore wheel went over his foot—I only saw the fore wheel go over him—I assisted in picking him up—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went on about a dozen yards—there was nothing to prevent the driver seeing the man before him—he was going rather fast, I consider, about six or seven miles an hour—he stopped when he got about a dozen yards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe he spoke to the policeman, did not he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge—a policeman came up as we were carrying the deceased to Charing-cross Hospital—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> had gone over his foot just below the ancle—I saw the prisoner when he was returning from his fare—he stopped, and went over Westminster-bridge by my direction to fetch the deceased's daughter to attend her father—he expressed the greatest sorrow and contri<lb></lb>tion for what had happened—he offered to do any thing he could to assist them, and immediately went over to fetch the daughter to the hospital without any charge—I believe it is difficult to pull up a horse on a sudden on the wood-paving—if you stop a horse suddenly it slips along—I never drove a horse myself—I cannot recollect whether it was wet or not—I think he was not going above six or seven miles an hour in my judgment—the horse was trotting—I heard some person call out more than once about the time it hap<lb></lb>pened—I cannot be positive it was the prisoner—I cannot say whether it was half a minute or a minute before—the deceased was an aged man.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 24th of Dec. I was at the corner of Hunger<lb></lb>ford-street, Strand, and saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> come down Duncannon-street—it went down Hungerford-street, at the rate of about seven miles an hour—it was going rather fast, as it appeared to me—I saw the deceased cross the road—I heard the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man call out to him once—I did not see the horse checked at all—the deceased was knocked down by the shaft, I believe—the fore wheel went over him—I picked him up afterwards—both the wheels had gone past then, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I was in the Strand, walking close behind the deceased towards Charing-cross—he was going straight across the crossing of Hunger<lb></lb>ford-street—it was at the top of the street—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming from the Strand, in the direction of Hungerford-market—I heard the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man halloo twice—either the horse's head or the shaft knocked the man down—the near fore wheel passed over his left ancle—I then suddenly caught hold of the man, and told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man to go a few yards, which be did, and then stopped—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was going slowly, I should say—he had gone out of Duncannon-street, crossing the Strand—I have known the prisoner about six years, seeing him drive in the street—I never had any particular conversation with him—he appeared quite sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

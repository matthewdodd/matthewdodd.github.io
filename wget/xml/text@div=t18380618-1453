                  </hi>. I live with Mary Francis, who is a pawn-broker, in High-street, Poplar. At half-past eight o'clock on Saturday night, the 26th of May, the prisoner came into our boxes—we have a shelf that goes over our boxes—a person told me the prisoner had taken something, from the top of the boxes—I jumped over the counter and took him—I said, "What have you got here?"—he said, a parcel that he had taken out of Mr. Holly's—I put my hand into his basket, and found this coat with our ticket on it—it had been on the shelf—it is my mistress's coat.</p>

I was in the shop in the next box to the prisoner—I saw him lift his hand up and take a parcel from over his head—I saw him pull it inside and put it alongside his basket—I saw it afterwards found in his basket—he said he had just taken it out of pledge from Mr. Holly—I called Ogilvie from the shop and told him of it.</p>

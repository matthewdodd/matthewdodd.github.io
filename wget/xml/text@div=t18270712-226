               <p>MARY ANN WILSON. On the 7th of July, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was at the <placeName id="t18270712-226-crimeloc1237">Hope public-house, Minories</placeName>

I was awoke about half-past ten; and in about a quarter of an hour missed these things - the ring was taken off my finger, and the ear-rings from my ears. I have not found them - I thought I heard my keys in the prisoner's pocket - they had been in my purse; a snuff-box was found on him, which I think is mine - I believe it was in my bosom, but forget - my keys were found down an area.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought you heard them in his pocket? A. I think so - the prisoner and another man were in the house before I fell asleep - I believe one of them threw the keys down an area.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him throw them down? A. I did.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard a noise in George-street, Minories - I found a crowd round the prisoner and prosecutrix; she said she had been robbed - and that he had taken her keys, and dropped them down an area. I took them to the watch-house, and on the prisoner found this snuff-box, two half-crowns, a sixpence, and a half-penny.</p>

            . I keep the Hope public-house - the prisoner and Wilson came in with another man, about half-past ten o'clock, and had some rum and water - I heard a tumbler break, and demanded payment; one of the men said he would go and get one - he returned, said he could not get one, and would pay me for it. Wilson was laying her head on the table; it was fair time, and thought she was tired; I awoke her - she went out, and I heard a violent screaming in George-street. I was fetched to the watch-house - I had not observed any ear-rings in her ears. I cannot say whether she was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that he had got into the prosecutrix's company on the Ilford coach - that she was much intoxicated, and throwing her things about, and conducting herself very indecently - that she gave him the snuff-box; and as he was helping her home, she complained of being robbed, when the other man ran away.</p>

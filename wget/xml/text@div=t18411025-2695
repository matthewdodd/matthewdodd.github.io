                  </hi>. I live in Cloudesley street, Islington, and farm a little land near Mr. Lett's. Between eleven and twelve o'clock on the morning of the 20th of October, I was in Crouch End-lane—I saw the three pri<lb></lb>soners walking together in close conversation about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's house—I did not like their appearance—they went straight up the road—I fancied I saw them pass something like plate from one to the other—when I got near the prosecutor's I heard a robbery had been committed—I immediately returned after the prisoners as fast as I could, on my horse—I stopped them all—another man came up to Dudley and laid hold of him—I said, "You are my prisoners, the first man that starts I will knock him down"—I said I had information that a house had been robbed, and I suspected they were the parties—they said they knew nothing at all about it, they wished to go about their business—I took them back towards Mr. Lott's—in going along, Cowley said he met Burns at the corner of the lane—Burns said he was quite a stranger, and then Dudley said he was quite a stranger, and then two of them knew each other—I had seen Dudley give the plate to Cowley—when we got them back I said, "Now we will begin and search them"—I said to Cowley, "You have got the plate, you may as well give it up"—Cowley said, "I have, and will give it to the lady"—he took it from his pocket—I took them to Highgate station—in going along we had some remarks about a good many things—I have lost a good many sheep.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 47, Bowles Road, Old Kent Road—the prisoner is my husband—we have been married all but 20 years—on Mon<lb></lb>day afternoon, 30th December, about 4 o'clock, I was at home with my husband and daughter Eliabeth—my husband sent her out with a letter, and told her to wait for an answer—he told her to take it to 23, Bermondsey Square—that was written on the envelope—she went out with it, and he followed her out, and shut the street door after her as I believed—I was</p>

               <p>then in the kitchen—he came back to me in the kitchen after shutting the street door, and he shut the kitchen door as he came in—he stood beside the corner of the dresser, and said "Your time is up now, I mean to settle you, you have no protection now," and he struck me on the middle of the head with a chopper several time?—the first blow was on the top of the head—I struggled, and warded off the blows with my whole strength—he had the chopper in his right hand—he seemed to me to unbutton his coat, and took it out of his inside coat—we had not been quarrelling—we had had no words at all on that day—we have had different words lately on account of his having been out of work some time—we had not quarrelled for some time—I don't know how many days before—I struggled to get away, and got to the back door—I tried to get out there—it was fastened with two bolts on the inside top and bottom, not locked—after a few minutes I managed to get into the passage at the front door—that was also fastened—it seemed as if the kitchen lock was broken into the door, as if it had been hit with some force—my head was bleeding very much, and I was getting very dizzy—I heard a repeated knocking at the door, and somebody speaking outside—after the knocking had been going on for some time my husband said if he let me alone would I prosecute him—I said no, I would not prosecute him—he said he would open the back door, and if I attempted to make a noise he would finish me—he went and opened the back door, and answered the person over the wall—I went out into the back yard, dipped a towel in a basin of water and rushed into the closet, and bolted the door—I stood there until I was helped out into the parlour, and a policeman came—my husband was quite sober on this day—Mr. Cully came and spoke to me at the door of the closet—when I got into the parlour I charged my husband before the policeman—he did not say a word—I was taken to the police-station, and my wounds were dressed—I remained in bed till the Sunday morning—this happened on the Monday—I am still suffering, my head if very bad.</p>

Why don't you open the door for me?"—he said "We have had a little fright, if you had heard what I have heard you would not ask me why I did it"—I said "What, chop a woman's head open"—he walked out—Mrs. Baker at this time was in the closet—I fetched a policeman—she would not come out till the policeman came—I saw her head bleeding very much, pouring down her neck into her.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The letter was directed to John Sears, asking him to send the money that Mr. Sefton said he would send.</hi>) When I went out my father came to the door and shut it after me; there had been no quarrelling between my father and mother before I left—I heard him say a week before that mother would not live long, he would settle her—he did not say why—when I came back I found a police<lb></lb>man in the house.</p>

I said 'Very well,' and let go, and she threw it into the coal cupboard. I took her into the back washhouse and bathed her head. She said 'Let me have a drop of brandy.' I took her into the bedroom and she had some brandy and gave me some as well. As to the doors, they were not barred at all; very often the catch of the front door will slip down, and you are obliged to go</p>

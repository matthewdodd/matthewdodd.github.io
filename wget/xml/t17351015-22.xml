They took from me my Hat and Wig, a Gold Ring, a Silver Watch, the Silver Buckles out of my Shoes, two Guineas and a Half Crown, and then bound me, and telling me they would send some body to relieve me in five Minutes, they fired a Pistol over my Head and went off; but no body came. I lay there an Hour by St. Paul's Clock, which I heard strike; and if they had not taken my Buckles I had lain longer; for having got my Shoes off, I at last got my Legs loose. Two of them, Morpeth and Kiff, were convicted of this Robbery in July last, and were both executed. I cannot swear positively to the Prisoner.</p>

            . Morpeth, Kiff and the Prisoner and I went to drink at the Fox Alehouse in Kingsland-Road. We staid till the Dusk of the Evening, and then went out and met the Prosecutor by the Watch-house at Stone-bridge. Morpeth stopt him, and demanded his Money. The Prosecutor started back, and the Prisoner gave him a Punch in the Face: We took him down a Lane and rifled him. They took his Hat, Wig, Watch, Ring and Money, and I took his Buckles. We tied his Legs and Arms behind him, and told him he should be released in a little Time. He asked us how he should know that? And Morpeth fired a Pistol, and said that was a Sign for one to come to his Relies; but this was only said to make him easy. We went thence to the Magpye Tavern at Bishopsgate, where they produced Half a Crown and two Half-pence. I said that the Gentleman told me that he had lost two Guineas. They swore then the Gentleman was a Rogue, and that People often pretend to have lost more than they really have. The Prisoner had the Watch and Ring to dispose of, and next Day he told us that he had pawned the Watch for a Guinea and a Half, and sold the Ring (having knock'd the Stone out because it had a Coat of Arms in it) for 4 s. 6 d. 5 s. 6 d. or 6 s. 6 d. I forget which - The Buckles were sold for 9 s. to a Goldsmith at the Corner of Moses and Aaron Alley in Whitechapel. The Wig was valued by

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer. About 7 o'clock on the evening of 6th July I saw the prisoner in Fleet Street, with a parcel under his arm, wrapped in brown paper—I asked him what he had under his arm—he said, "What is that to you?"—I said, "As an officer, it is my business to ask you?"—he said, "I shall not tell you"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said that he should refuse to tell me—I asked him where he was going to take it to—he said that he got it from a countryman of his in the Blackfriars Road, who was gone to Paris—I took him to the station, and found on him three keys, and five more in his shirt—they had all been filed—he gave me an address—I went to the office of Messrs. Woolner and Wylie, in Mark Lane, on the following day—I found this key opened the counting house door on the first floor—while taking him to the station, I had observed that his left hand was employed in doing something under his trowsers—I said, "What keys have yon got!"—he said, "These three," but his shirt was racked up, and when I examined him, I found the five others in it.</p>

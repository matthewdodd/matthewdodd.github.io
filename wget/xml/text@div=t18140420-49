               <p>WILLIAM STRANGE. I am a cheesemonger. I live in Bishopsgate-street. The tub and butter belongs to me. On the 24th of February, I sent twenty-four firkins to the Catherine Wheel inn; they were to go into the country. On the Thursday following I saw this tub of butter at the Mansion-house; I am sure it was one of the twenty-four that I had sent to this inn yard.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday the 2nd of March, I was passing through Gracechurch-street with Miller, an officer. I met the prisoner in company with two other men; the prisoner had a knot, and appeared like a porter; I suspected him immediately. I crossed the road, and followed him on the opposite side of the way, and Miller with me. I kept my eye upon him three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go near the Catherine Wheel inn - A. No; we lost sight of him by a quantity of carriages; they were going towards Bishopsgate-street. In about a quarter of an hour afterwards, in passing down Bishopsgate-street, by the church, I met the prisoner with this tub of butter on his knot. He was alone then.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the Catherine Wheel inn from Bishopsgate church - A. About one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards, on the same side as Houndsditch, below Houndsditch. I looked at the prisoner, and let him pass a bit. He was going towards the bridge. When I had let him pass I looked round, I saw one of the other men coming after him who had been with him before. The moment he saw me he made across the road, and went down Houndsditch. I immediately pursued the prisoner, and asked him what he had got there; he said he believed it was a tub of butter he was going with to Tower-street; he said a man hired him to carry it at the corner of Sun-street. I took him to the Compter. I found out who the tub of butter belonged to. This is the tub.</p>
               <p>- MILLER. I know nothing further than what Sheppard has stated; his account is correct.</p>
               <p>Mr. Strange. That tub is one of the twenty-four that I ordered to be taken to the Catherine Wheel inn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a porter. I was unfortunately led into this. I was returning from Leadenhall-market; I crossed to Sun-street, a man called to me, he asked me to take this to Tower-street; the man said he would follow me. When I came to Cammomile-street the officer came up to me; the man was behind me. If he had any suspicion it was stolen, why not take the man that ran away. I am perfectly innocent.</p>

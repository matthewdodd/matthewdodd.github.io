On Saturday, the 29th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came to my shop, and bought some trifling things, which came to less than 1 s. I suspected them from their manner, and observed a chest of figs moved partly off another box, ready to be taken away; it was near the door. About eleven o'clock they came again, and bought a few things; the young one went away without my seeing him, leaving the father in the shop. I missed the box of figs, and asked the old man where his companion was: he denied all knowledge of him: I gave him in charge, When they first came into the shop, the youngest had a leather apron on. The box was produced at the examination, and I knew it by the import mark on it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night of the robbery, a little after twelve o'clock, I went to the eldest prisoner's house in Bangor Yard, and in a yard belonging to all the houses there, I found this box covered with a leather apron, in a nook in the yard.</p>

            . I am an officer, and took charge of Herbert, Sen., at the prosecutor's shop. He denied having had any body with him.</p>
               <p>HERBERT, SENIOR'S Defence. My son was not with me; - there were a dozen people in the shop, and if he was there, it was unknown to me. Corby went for my son, and the gentleman said he was not the person. The nook where the box was found is not so much attached to my house as to others; one house there contains fifty people, - it was once the Bishop of Bangor's palace.</p>
               <p>HERBERT, JUNIOR'S, Defence. I went to the shop about half-past nine o'clock for tea and sugar, I then went to the Red Lion, and in a few minutes I was called out. Mr. Buttenshaw looked at me, and said I was not the person. Corby told him to be positive; he took me into the bar, and said he was positive I was not the person, but he fetched his man, who said I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. BUTTENSHAW. I am sure they came together both times. I went to the public-house, but did not say he was not the person. I had no doubt of him, but sent for our apprentice, thinking it best for two to speak to him.</p>

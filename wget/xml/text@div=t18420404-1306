                  </hi>. I am the wife of Peter Robins, a carpenter and joiner of No. 49, Molineaux-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone. A lodger named Paris, occupied our second-floor back-room—on the 8th of Febru<lb></lb>ary, which was Shrove Tuesday, the prisoner came to the house, just after one o'clock in the day, and said he saw a bill in my window, and wanted lodgings—I said I had only half a bed—he said that would do for him, as he went out early, and did not want any thing in the day; that he went out at five o'clock in the morning to where he worked on the rail-road, and must be there before six, or he should lose a quarter of a day; that he was a coach-builder on the railway—he did not say what railway—I said I must see my other lodger before he came in—he said he would be in about ten o'clock in the evening—I said I should see Paris before that, which I did—the prisoner said his father was head clerk on the railway, and his name was Nodes; and that Nodes, in New Church-street, was his uncle; that he slept</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachman, and lodged at Robins's at the time in question. I came home on the night of Shrove Tuesday, about eleven o'clock, went up to my bed-room, struck a light, and believe I saw this coat and trowsers lying on the floor against the door, and believe the pri<lb></lb>soner is the man who laid in the bed—I do not know whether he was awake or asleep—he did-not speak to me, but after a minute or two, while I was undressing with a light in the room, I said, "Hallo, mate, are you</p>
               <p>in bed?"—he said, "Yes"—we got into conversation—I asked how long</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184204040150"></xptr>
               <p>he had been in bed—he said not long—I asked what time he was going to be up in the morning—he said a quarter before six, as he was a coach-builder at the Great Western Railway, and must be there by six—I said I was going to be up by six, or a little before, and would give him a call—he said his father was one of the clerks on the Birmingham railway, and he had been on the Birmingham line himself, but preferred being a coach-maker on the Great Western, as that was his business—he said he was a teetotaller—I went to bed and went to sleep—just upon six o'clock in the morning the prisoner awoke me, and asked what it was o'clock—I got out of bed, struck a light, looked at my watch, and told him it was just upon six—he said he was very sorry, but he had lost a quarter, as he ought to have been there by six, and he should not go now till nine—I dressed to go to work, we were in conversation the whole time—he told me his boxes were at St. John's Wood, and asked if I would go with him in the evening to bring them home, that he should be at home between six and seven—I said I would go—he said most likely he should go to some place of wor<lb></lb>ship in the evening, as he was in the habit of doing so (it was Ash Wed<lb></lb>nesday) he asked again what time I should be at home—I told him my business was uncertain, but between six and seven—I then went away—I came home about ten that morning, got the key from Mrs. Robins, went into my room, found him gone, went to my box for a letter I had written the evening before, and found the letter gone, and a little square box con<lb></lb>taining my money—I had left the box locked—I found it picked—I had left in it a small box with a sovereign, a half-sovereign, four half-crowns, and ten shillings, a brooch, seal, two knives, pens, and other articles in it—I found box and all gone—I ran down stairs directly, and told Mrs. Robins—she went up to the room with me, and I missed two coats, my hat waistcoat, and trowsers, a scarf, one flannel-shirt, three linen shirts, and stockings—it would cost me 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to replace them—I found an old hat, this coat, trowsers, a beastly shirt, and an old waistcoat, left instead of my own things.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what part of Nottingham he resided in? - A. No particular place I believe; when I found him, I told him he was a prisoner; that I had directions to take him up for robbing his master; he said he had robbed his master, and he was very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you made him any promise? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was that the immediate answer? - A. Nearly to; I asked him the amount, and he said between 60 and 70l. I took him into custody, and at the desire of the Magistrate, I brought him up to London.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find upon him? - A. A watch, two or three little trinkets, and a canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the canvas bag here? - A. Yes -(produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any question respecting the watch and trinkets? - A. Yes; I asked him where he bought the watch; he said he bought it of a person of the name of Hall, at Nottingham; I asked him how he paid for it, and he said by a 20l. Bank-bill; I asked him what time it was that he went away, and he said between three and four in the morning; that he walked on, and the Briton coach overtook him, and brought him to Nottingham.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This young boy was perfectly contrite, and ready to tell you every thing? - A. Yes.</p>

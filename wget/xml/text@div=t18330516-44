            . I am the wife of the last witness. On Saturday night, the 20th of April, I had twenty-four ducks - I shut the doors that night; I saw the boy fasten the door, and I held the candle to him while he did it, and saw it fastened; he fastened the outside door, which goes into the yard - there is a partition between the place where we live, and where the cattle are, there is a door in the wainscoat, and without going into the air we can get to the place where the cattle are; the cows come in at the door at the end; the ducks are kept close against the door where we live - the ducks are under the same roof, in the same place where the cattle are, but parted off in a sort of fowl-pen; we getfrom the dwelling part of the house to where the cattle are by opening the door in the partition - I saw the door, leading from where the cattle are into the yard, fastened by a chain and iron-bar across it at ten o'clock at night - I did not go to bed till after twelve o'clock - I counted the ducks after fastening the door, and there were twenty-four of them - I got up between five and six o'clock in the morning, and found the doors open and five of the ducks gone - I found the boards broken by the side of the door, and the door was also open; the bar was not there, it was found in the road afterwards; the boards were broken open to admit the thieves; they must have undone the door inside to go out of it - the door which was open goes into the shed, and from that there is a door to the place where we live - I saw three of the ducks again on Monday morning in a basket in possession of Davis, the policeman - I knew them again as I always fed them; they were the same colored feathers; they were then dead - the boards were safe overnight.</p>

            . I am a policeman. In consequence of information, I went to No. 11, Ranelagh-row, Pimlico - I went on Monday morning, the 22nd of April, about twenty minutes after six; I found in a cupboard on the right hand (in a little card-box), some duplicates; they were in a back room on the first floor - I had given the prisoner in charge to my inspector about one o'clock on the Sunday night (the 21st), and then heard him give that address to the inspector - I had taken him for breaking into the house of Mr. Grady - we asked him his address, he said he lived at No. 11, Ranelagh-row - after finding<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160033"></xptr>the duplicates, we went to the cupboard on the right hand, and there found a white duck, part of the feathers had been taken off, and in a box under a table in the same room, I found two more ducks, they were all three dead - I found a bag of feathers under the bed; they appeared to be duck's feathers - I took them to Mr. Halls, he identified them; I showed them to Mrs. Halls, she identified them also - this was about a quarter to seven o'clock; I afterwards took them to the station-house - the prisoner was there in custody; I asked if he knew anything about them; he said he knew nothing whatever of them - I examined the clothes he had on, and there appeared a great quantity of down and other small feathers on them; I could not swear what feathers they were.</p>

            . I live at No. 11, Ranelagh-row, and occupy the house there. The prisoner lodged in my house at the time he was taken; he had lodged there a year and a half - he is a carman when he is in employ; he lived in the first-floor back room - his wife has died since he lodged with me; she was not living at that time; he lived in that room alone - I have six other lodgers in the house; each of them have a room to themselves - I remember 
               <persName id="t18330516-44-person471">Davis</persName>
             the policeman coming to search - I don't know what room he searched - The street-door is always open, it has a catch and string to it; anybody can open it; but as to the doors of the different lodgers, I know nothing about them; but I got up between one and two o'clock that very Monday morning, as I have to light the fires at the London Steel Works - I went and did my work, and came in a little after six and went to unlock my room; I had the key with me- I went into the back yard, and when I came back there were two policemen at the foot of the stairs - I do not remember anything coming into the house on Sunday; I saw no ducks; I was never in his room but once since he has been there - I saw the policeman with the ducks on the Monday, but not before.</p>

               <p>MRS. HALL. One of my ducks was white, another black and white, and one a dark one - I saw the ducks in the policeman's basket, and knew they were mine - I marked them in the feet; I burnt them through the web of the feet, because I was always losing ducks; it was two holes through each duck's right foot, and I found those marks on the ducks the policemen produced - here are the feet, but they are so dried up, I can't see the holes now; I am certain I saw them on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.

            . His room door was unlocked when I went - I saw marks on the white duck which agreed with the prosecutrix's description - the prisoner gave his address voluntarily - I found the padlock hanging on the staple of his door, with the key in it.</p>
               <p>JURY to JAMES HATT. Q. Are your other lodgers men or women? A. They are all men but one; they are all married men - I never saw anything a miss of them, nor had I of the prisoner; he lived a year and a half with me, and I have known him five or six years - the lodgers come home at all hours, as their business keeps them out late.</p>

I am in the service of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway—on 15th March I saw the prisoners come into the station yard together and go towards the Brighton station—a short time afterwards I saw Shooter by himself with his back close to the book stall, and within 30 <hi rend="italic">feet</hi> of the refreshment room, standing on his toes and trying to peer over the glass—I looked into the refreshment room and saw Dean there—a constable went in, and I then saw Shooter go out and go towards the Under<lb></lb>ground Railway—Mr. Sweeting spoke to him, and he was given in custody.</p>

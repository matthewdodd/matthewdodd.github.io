The prisoner came to my father's shop yesterday week to get a sovereign changed; about a quarter past 9 o'clock in the morning—my father was at home—I am sure the prisoner was the man who came—I told him I had no silver, but I had two half sovereigns if that would do—he said, "They will do; they are just the thing, I want to put them in a letter"—I gave him two half sovereigns, and he gave me what appeared to be a sovereign—I took it to my father, and put it down by the side of him, while he was making out his bills—my father afterwards called me—the prisoner was then gone—the next morning my father gave me the same piece of money, that I had taken of the prisoner the day before—I took it to Brixton police station, and showed it to a constable—he rubbed it on his coat, and smelt it—it was not out of my sight—he gave me the same piece back—I took it home again, and gave it to my mother.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Royal Oak, in Belina-road, Clapham. In the afternoon of 13th Feb. my daughter brought me a shilling into the parlour—I went into the bar, and the prisoner was there, and no one else—I had the shilling between my teeth—I took it from my teeth, and pulled it in pieces before his face—I said, "This is a bad one"—he said he was not aware of it, and, if it was bad, would I give him a piece of it?—I said, "No, not unless you give me your address, where you came from, and where you took this"—he said he took it in Blackfriars-road, and he could take me to the place—I said I should not give him the shilling, nor a piece of it, but 1 was going the Blackfriars-road way, and he might go with me—I went with him till we got past Acre-lane, and a friend of mine said, "There is a police<lb></lb>man coming"—the prisoner then said, "I think you are directing me wrong; I don't know my road this way; I shall go the other way into Acre-lane"—the prisoner went back, and I followed him—he turned, and saw me, and he went into a private road, into a brick field—I followed him, and the constable followed and took him—I gave the constable the pieces of the shilling—the prisoner made a snatch to get them out of the policeman's hand.</p>

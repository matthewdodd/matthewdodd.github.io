                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 23rd of March I saw the prisoner at the corner of Angel-alley, Whitechapel, with these two nose-bags across his shoulder, at a quarter before six o'clock in the evening—I asked him How he came by them—he said they were given to him to hold by a man named Hookey, who was gone into the City, and who worked for a lady—I found that to be false, and found the owner—I took him to the station-house.</p>

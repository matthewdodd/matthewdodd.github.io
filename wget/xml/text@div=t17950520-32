               <p>Q. What are you? - A tripe-dresser, in Spicer-street, Mile-end New-town. I was coming down Red Lion-street, <placeName id="t17950520-32-crimeloc183">Whitechapel</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17950520-32-crimeloc183" type="placeName" value="Whitechapel"></interp>

I saw one of the prisoners at the bar (Davis) with a sack of coals on his back, some distance from the waggon. I was on horseback. I thought it was uncustomary to see them carry coals from the waggon, to stop in Whitechapel, when there was such an open street to draw up as Red Lion-street is. I stopped to see where he went to; I see him go up the second turning in Red Lion-street; the name of the street I hear is Buckle-street, I don't positively know. I then went forward into Whitechapel, and did not see the prisoner any more till I see him on the waggon, placing the empty sack on the waggon, under a coat that was in the waggon. I then stopped in Whitechapel, and see the waggon go on; they went on a considerable distance, and they stopped at a public house; the two men did with the waggon. They went into the house; they came out of the house, and drove on towards Whitechapel church; I see money pass between them, but what, I did not know. I then stopped at Mr. - , a cheesemonger, the corner of Osborne-street. I asked him to let me leave my horse there (I told him the circumstance) and I would follow the waggon, to see where it was going I followed the waggon till it went to a Mr. Burten wood, and embosser, in Mile-end New Town. I then stopped till I was certain they were going to his house, and I went in, and informed Mr. Burtenwood of it. After I had informed Mr. Burtenwood of it, I know no more of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say, at the time you observed this man, he was at some distance from the waggon? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem to be very circumstantial, and very exact; I ask you, how you know they were coals? - I see them at the top of the mouth of the sack, as big as my hat</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it for granted that the top of the sack was open? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not possible, that they may be a mixture of coals and cinders? - I will venture to swear, that what I saw were coals.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you get by coming forward on this occasion? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose name was on the cart? - Wright and Wolfe.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you know the prosecutor before? - No, nor the person where the coals were going to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Were you by at the time that these coals were delivered? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many sacks of coals were delivered to this gentleman's house? - I cannot swear that, to my own knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you? - An embosser, in Mile-end New Town. I work for Mr. Burtenwood and Mr. Yarrow. Mr. Burtenwood carries on trade for Mr. Yarrow; Mr. Burtenwood ordered me, the 8th of May, to go to the waggon, and look under a coat, and there I should find an empty sack. I jumped up into the waggon, and took the sack down. I said to the prisoners, for this sack there is an information against you; so I took the sack down, and kept it separate, while the rest of the sacks were shaking, and after it was shaked, I counted the red that were shook, which were four and thirty.</p>

            Independent of this one? - Yes. They were emptied in our yard, after the coals were emptied; I counted the sacks over three different times, to know how many there were. I asked the man for the note. He said, he had none; so my master came out, and he gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Court to Wright. Have you no other evidence? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury to Wright. Were they, or were they not measured by a coal meter? - They were not; they were what we call in the pool.</p>

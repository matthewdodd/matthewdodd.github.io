I am a little cow keeper and market gardener; I live on the edge of Wanstead-flats, which is a part of Epping Forest In the month of Sept, I had a heifer; I turned it out on the flats—it was marked W. H. M. on each rump; I marked it myself—the letters were in a triangle, the M was at top, Won one side, and H on the other—I missed my heifer on Thursday, 13th Oct—I know that Sharpless had two heifers there—I had marked them on one single side—I marked my own on two sides—Sharpless's heifers were turned out on the forest, and he missed his the day that I missed mine—he and I walked miles looking for them—we went to Brentwood fair, and had them cried in the town; we did not find them—we went the same night to Mr. Saul, a butcher, and he gave us some information—we asked for heifers marked with my particular marks—on account of what he said, I went the next day with Sharpless and Benton to Messrs. Hepburn and Co., in Long-lane, Southwark—I saw there the hides of three heifers, which I had marked for myself and Sharpless; I also identified the hide of Mr. Glenny's heifer, and one of Joseph Hewes's with the Wanstead mark on it—I had not branded that, but I had seen it ever since it had been calved—I knew it as well as I knew my own.</p>

               <p>—he said he would send the heifers on the Wednesday following; that would be 12th Oct.—on Thursday, 13th Oct., I saw six heifers at Mr. Saul's, going to be slaughtered—the prisoner had before given me a description of the heifers—he said they were middling sort of goods—he did not describe the marks they had—when I saw the six heifers on the 13th, they answered the description the prisoner gave me, as far as my judgment went—one of them was a fold heifer—they were killed, and the hides went to Mr. Hepburn's, in Long-lane, Bermondsey—the prisoner did not give me any name—I had no name with the six heifers—they were slaughtered at Mr. Saul's—Mr. Hepburn has the sole consignment of Mr. Saul's hides to dress—after these six heifers had come in, the prisoner came to Mr. Saul's on the Monday, and asked me if the heifers were sold—my answer was, I believed they were; in fact I had purchased one of one of the boys—Mr. Saul was in the counting house, and I ushered the prisoner in—I then lighted the gas, and went to my business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drover, and live in Angel-lane, Stratford. I know the prisoner—the first of my seeing him was on 12th Oct., in the evening, as I was coming from Romford with my drove—he asked me if I was a London drover—I answered, Yes—he said, could I oblige him with taking up six heifers to Mr. Saul's, in Whitechapel, and we might draw our charges there, for his man was not fit to trust with them—I said I would take them, and he went and fetched from a lane leading to the Flats six little heifers—I did not see how they were marked—they were wild young heifers—there were two light ones, one much bigger than the other; another was a little reddish one, and one was a good fold heifer—it might be about 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening—I drove them part of the way, and Maine drove them part of the way—I asked the prisoner if there was any note to go, and he gave me a card of Mr. Saul's—as I turned away I thought, I know nothing of you, and I said to him, What name is yours, pray? and he said, Smith, of Barking-side—I and Maine came on, and I put my sheep in one place and another—I did not come all the way myself; I left them in the charge of Maine, at Stratford—Peck and Sharpless came to me to say something about their heifers.</p>

Q.</hi> Had you been to Romford market? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that market is held every Wednesday, it is a large market—there are many beasts sold there, some from Wanstead-flats—I believe the prisoner is the man who gave the heifers to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drover. I was driving up with Button on 12th Oct.—I saw the prisoner that evening, I believe it was him—he met us going towards the Rabbits, he asked if we were London drovers—we said, Yes—he said he had got six heifers, he had brought from Barkingside, he did not like to trust his man with them, and we should oblige him by driving them up to Mr. Saul's and he would pay us—he went away from us up a lane, and brought six heifers to us—there were two light ones, one a fold one, and three others—Button came on to Stratford and left me, I drove them to Mr. Saul's—Button gave me the card he got from the prisoner—I saw him give it him as I was in the road—I left them at Mr. Saul's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 381). I was on duty at Stratford on the night of 17th Oct., and in consequence of some report about heifers being taken away from the Flats I made inquiries—I took the prisoner on Tuesday the 18th, at a public house in Whitechapel—I told him the charge; he said the man that was with him that assisted in driving the beasts out was a stranger to him, he knew nothing of him, that he gave him a drop of beer to assist him, and said, Whatever has been done I did all by myself, nobody else was in it—this case was heard before the Magistrate at Ilford.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live at Forest-gate. One morning, Sharpless and Peck left me at Mr. Saul's, to see if anybody came about the check—Mr. Saul was detaining the prisoner, and he said to me "This young man will tell you something more"—I said to the prisoner," What is your name? he said Smith—I said, "Where from <hi rend="italic">V</hi> he said Wanstead—I said, think not"—Mr. Saul's business began to increase, there were several persons there, and I said, "I will take charge of him myself, he shall not get away from me"—the prisoner and I then went to a public house and had some beer together; and he said" I am very sorry it has come to this; if I knew the parties the beasts belong to, if I could get the check I would have given it to the parties, and made up the difference, rather than let Benton know anything about it, because he knows me.</p>

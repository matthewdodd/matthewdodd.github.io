                  </hi>. I am a tailor, in Tottenham-court-road. The prisoner was my errand-boy—I saw him going out of the house on the 24th of Jane, and stopped him—I asked him what waistcoat he had on—he said, a new one his mother had bought him—I said it belonged to me—when I lost it it was merely three-quarters of a yard of velvet—he said his mother made it for him—when he was taken in charge he acknowledged having taken it from the drawer, to get it made up.</p>

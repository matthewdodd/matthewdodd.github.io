                  </hi>. I am a tobacco-merchant, of Manchester-street, Brunswick-square. On 6th Feb. the prisoner came to my shop, about eight o'clock in the evening—she asked for sixpennyworth of Cuba's—she gave me half-a-crown—I gave her change—I put the half-crown on a shelf behind me—three or four minutes afterwards I found it was bad—I had just dropped it into the till at first—there was no other half-crown there—I was induced to take it out again, and put it on the shelf—it remained on the shelf till the next case happened—on 22nd Feb. the prisoner came again, about eight in the evening, for sixpennyworth of cheroots—she put down a bad half-crown—I knew her directly—I said, "This is bad, and you know it; I have taken one of you before"—she said, "I have never been in the shop"—I said, "Where do you live?"—she said, "I don't choose to tell you"—I gave her in charge—the second one had never left my hand.</p>

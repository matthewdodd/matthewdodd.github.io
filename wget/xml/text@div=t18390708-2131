                  </hi>. I keep the Leather Market Tavern, at Bermondsey. The prisoner was in my service for five days—on the 27th of June she was the worse for liquor—I found a bottle which had had sherry in it empty, and some tea, coffee, almonds and raisins, and French plums which we had missed were found in the scullery wrapped up in a newspaper, and some sherry in a tin beer can—the officer searched her boxes—they were not locked, but the room they were in was locked, and the key could not be found, and in the boxes we found these other things, which are mine—these rings and brooches were found on her person—we had missed a sove<lb></lb>reign that morning, and one was found on her.</p>

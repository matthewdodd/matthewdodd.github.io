                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and have been at work in the Kent-road. I was at the Eight Bells, on Sunday night, the 26th of Aug., between ten and eleven o'clock—the prisoner was there, and I accompanied her to a house in Church-street where I slept—I had the three half-crowns, and the other money stated in a bag when I went to bed—I put it under my pillow safely in my trowsers pocket when I went to bed—I had given the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I had about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. left—when I awoke about six in the morning the prisoner was gone—my trowsers were moved, the pocket turned inside out, and the bag and all the money gone—I gave information—I had just come by a steamer from Woolwich—I was quite sobers—I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

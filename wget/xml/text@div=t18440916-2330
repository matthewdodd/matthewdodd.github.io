                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Simmons, and am sister-in-law of Edward Simmons; he has a house at Stoke Newington. The prisoner was in his service for three weeks—I lived there with them—after the pri<lb></lb>soner left I missed a worked collar off the child's pelisse, two dresses, a pair of boots, an apron, a petticoat, two handkerchiefs, some worsted, and other things—these are them—they are mine.</p>

On Saturday, the 17th of June, at twelve o'clock at night, I heard Mrs. Dalton say "Take this vagabond out of the house!" I do not know who she spoke to; she had no sooner spoken than the prisoner, who is a watchman, came up, calling twelve o'clock; she said "Watchman! take this vagabond out of the house;" and, in a minute, I saw the prisoner holding a man, and saying "Come out, come out here!" three or four followed after him, and Mrs. Dalton with them; the deceased was among them; they all got into one body, and fell down together; I think they were all in liquor except the prisoner; they appeared to be quarrelling from the effects of liquor; the prisoner fell with them - they all got up as well as they could; I then saw the prisoner take the but end of his stick and strike the man, as he laid down, with great force - I swear he struck him twice while on the ground; I ran to my door, called another watchman, and saw no more.</p>

            . I live opposite the deceased. About twelve o'clock on this night he, and two men, were going home - they went in doors - one man wished to send for porter - Mrs. Dalton would not permit it - the man then struck her - he appeared to have had enough - one of the lodgers then struck the deceased - I was at my door and could see into their room - the man was pulling Dalton about - Dalton pulled off his clothes, and wished to fight - there was a considerable scuffle in doors; Mrs. Dalton called out Murder! and Watch! said the man was a thief and a robber, and should go out; I went and met the prisoner in the court and brought him into the house; Dalton came out and said he would fight the man; the prisoner said "You shall not fight, go in doors;" they insisted on being outside, trying to fight; I and Mrs. Wallis tried to pull the man away, but could not; the prisoner was endeavouring to keep the peace as well as he could - the prisoner persuaded Dalton to go in - Dalton refused to go in, and insisted on fighting the man - they were pulling one another about, and all fell down together - the prisoner and all - Mrs. Dalton on the top - I helped her up; the prisoner then got in a very great passion - he laid hold of Dalton, and told him to be quiet or he would floor him; he bit him on his legs with a stick, and threw him down, and while on the ground he hit him twice over the stomach with the thick part of his stick; Dalton had struck at the prisoner two or three times before he threw him down, but I cannot tell whether he hit him; he dragged him up, and took him towards the watch-house; he struck him two or three times more on the legs; the other two men stood there but did not interfere - Williams had hold of one of them - Dalton was carried home by six men in shout an hour - he was unable to walk - they threw him on the bed, and he said "Oh, dear, I am a dead man!" and complained of his bowels. He died on the Monday night.</p>

            . I live next door to Dalton, and saw him come home with three men - they all appeared drunk, and were very noisy; they wanted more liquor - Mrs. Dalton was also very tipsy. A quarrel began about a stranger striking her, and a lodger striking Mr. Dalton; the neighbours were disturbed; the prisoner was brought to quiet them, and did what he could; Dalton wanted to fight the prisoner, and struck him twice; they fell down together - I then went away. I saw the prisoner raise his stick, but did not see him strike - he appeared to be doing his duty.</p>

I heard a noise in this court, and saw the prisoner holding the deceased by the collar; the prisoner struck him several blows across the thigh; he walked a little way - words arose between him and the prisoner, and he struck him again across the legs - the deceased behaved unruly, but did not then strike us; I held his arm - I took him to the watch-house - he walked slowly. I afterwards saw him coming out of the watch-house - he fell down, and I assisted him; he complained of his stomach. The prisoner has been a watchman four years.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house charged with riotous conduct; he was evidently intoxicated, and complained of ill-treatment; he seemed ill in about a quarter of an hour, and I told his wife to take him home.</p>
               <p>Mr. THOMAS DAVIS. I am a surgeon. I was called to the deceased last Wednesday week; he complained of a dreadful pain in the abdomen - there were no external marks, but his bowels were very tight: he died on Monday night. I opened his body, and found a quantity of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220033"></xptr>thin fluid in the intestines; I found a large intestine ruptured; his bowels were dreadfully inflamed; it must have been occasioned by a blow, a kick, or a fall, which I cannot decide - it certainly was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was desired to make haste to this court, as there were some drunken Irishmen, and murder would be done; I found a disturbance in this house; there were three of them down on one another in the passage; I dragged them up: the deceased struck me twice or three times, which much irritated me; having been wounded in my head I am very hot when irritated; I got them out - we all fell together, and I did strike the deceased two or three times with my stick.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lurgan, county of Armagh, Ireland. I am a manufacturer of cambric handkerchiefs—in Feb. last I came to London—I went to the premises of the defendant Taylor, No. 1, Church Passage, Gresham Street—I had seen him before, in Lurgan—when I saw him on this occasion, I had some conversation with him about the sale of some Irish linen handkerchiefs—I do not recollect what day in February this was—Taylor agreed to dispose of these handkerchiefs for me—he offered to sell the handkerchiefs at 2 1/2 per cent for his commission—he said that the market was bad, that it was glutted with goods—I had a sample box with me—I said that I thought it would be as good for me to take them down to Manchester, I thought I could sell them there—he said that he thought I should not sell them there, that it would be better to leave them with him—I left them with him—I did not take them to Manchester—after this conversation I returned to Ireland—the sample I had was of several, seventeen or eighteen dozen of different ones that I had at home—they were different prices, and numbered from 80 to 97—after I got to Ireland, in March, I received this letter from Taylor—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "1, Church Passage, Gresham Street, London: March 5th, 1857. Mr. T. Gorman. Dear Sir, Could you do 100 dozen each more of the 5/8 handkerchiefs, Nos. 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, to go with the lot? It would make them a far better parcel, and perhaps during the next month they could be placed. Let me know per return what you think. I could have sold the last well three weeks back, but two or three of your Lurgan friends have glutted the market. I find you have offered them in most houses before coming in to me, as Mr. Roberts wished. Your's very truly, W. Taylor")—The 5/8 there means the breadth—I left a list with Mr. Taylor, with an account of the lot—I think there were 2, 568 dozen—some of those were 5/8 in width—I wrote an answer to that letter to Mr. Taylor—this (<hi rend="italic">produced by Mr. Serjeant Ballantine</hi>) is it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Lurgan, 7th March, 1857. Mr. W. Taylor. Dear Sir, I received your note this morning, and all the 5/8 handkerchiefs. I have ready now 8/12/8 dozen 8/13/8, 8/88/8, 8/99/0; if they would be any use to you, I will have them ready by the time you require them. I did not know of my samples being in any house but one, and Mr. Ward had seen them; but they were offered at the high list I left with</p>

               <p>you, and only 2 1/2 off; and the last list of prices that I sent to you is a great deal lower. Hoping you will be able to sell them soon, I remain, dear Sir, your's truly, Thomas Gorman")—After I had written that letter, I received this one—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>; "London, Thursday, 12th March, 1857. Mr. T. Gorman. Sir, I have an offer from Mr. J. H. May, of 10, Huggin Lane, Wood Street, City, for your handkerchiefs. I find that the list you first had and the one you left me to sell from at 2 1/2 off, and sixty days' bill, is 20 per cent. to a pound; he can buy them at 22 1/2 off, up to and including the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and an extra five from 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. upwards; terms for payment, half cash in one month from the time the goods are in and examined, and the other half by sixty days' bill at bankers'. Of course you take off the 2 1/2 for cash, and bill payment as usual. You can either write me per return or Mr. May. You must let him have the low numbers you have coming round. Your's, etc., W. Taylor. The Lurgan Banking Company know his bills")—On the receipt of that letter, I made some inquiries, after which my son wrote this letter to Mr. Taylor, and I signed it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Lurgan, 15th March. Mr. W. Taylor. Dear Sir, I was from home on Friday and Saturday, or I would have written to you sooner. I do not know Mr. J. H. May, and you don't say anything for him yourself; I would wish to know from you his stability and character in trade. In your note you refer me to the Lurgan Banking Company; there is no such thing as the Lurgan Banking Company; there is the Belfast Banking Com<lb></lb>pany, the Northern Banking Company, and Ulster Banking Company. You know the goods would amount to a good sum of money, and I would not wish to let them go to any place but a good house; and I depend on you not to place the goods in any house you have the least doubt of As I intend to go largely into the handkerchief trade, our friendship may continue long. Concerning Mr. May's offer for the goods, could not accept it; but when I receive your answer, I will let you know immediately the discount and terms on which I will sell them to him. Please write as soon as possible. Your's truly, Thomas Gorman")—After that I received this letter from Taylor—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "London, Thursday, 19th March, 1857. Mr. T. Gorman. Dear Sir, Your favour of the 15th was to hand only yesterday. I did not refer you to any one, but I meant to say the Ulster Banking Company had had several of May's bills. However, as he is strange to you, I write to say that Messrs. Myers and Co., late of 45, Ludgate Hill, will buy the lot, if as good as sample, at 27 1/2 off nett, and will give you cash cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on delivery, and the rest in some three or four bills having some thirty to sixty days to run, and all of them endorsed by Myers and Co. I would say to you that I would sell them this moment 10, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, and not ask them one question. They also refer you to the following in Belfast, with whom they have long had dealings: McGee and Co., clothiers; Lindsays brothers, drapers; Tucker, starch maker. You know if you can take the offer or not, but you will not get a better; and in another month you will not sell them at all. Reply per return certain. Your's, W. T.")—After the receipt of that letter, I wrote accepting the offer—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Lurgan, March 21. Mr. William Taylor. Dear Sir, I am in receipt of your favour of the 19th instant. The offer of Messrs. Myers and Co. is very low; in fact it would not make the goods at present. As you advise me to part with them, and give Messrs. Myers and Co. such a good character, I will let them have the goods on the same terms as you state in your letter.

The goods are as fair to sample as any lot of goods as ever was made up, as I stood by the lappers during the time they were making them up, and the samples were taken out after they were prepared. Remain your's sincerely, Thomas Gorman")—After writing that letter, I received this letter from Taylor—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "London, Monday, 23 March, 1857. Mr. T. Gorman. Dear Sir, In reply to your's of the 21st, I would send off the goods, packed in four cases, to my address, carriage paid. Immediately on receipt of this, I will then see they are delivered. And let me have the remaining low numbers, as noted by you, as early as possible. Make out the invoice to Messrs. Myers and Co., and let me have it with the goods; I will then check them off; get the cash and bills sent you, less the amount of my commission; and when the other parcel is ready, do just the same with them, and I will also. Tour's, W. T.")—The other parcel there mentioned was the parcel referred to in the first letter of 5th March—I think that was not ready at the time—it means such stock that I had in hand corresponding with the low numbers—after the receipt of that letter, I had the handkerchiefs sent off in four cases, as directed to Mr. Taylor's, Church Passage, London—I forwarded an invoice with them to Taylor—the invoice was made out to Myers and Co.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the invoice—it is dated 26th March—the invoice contains all the goods that I sent in the four cases, and also the sample box that I left with Taylor, in London—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter of advice that was sent with the invoice—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Lurgan, March 26, 1857. Mr. William Taylor, London. Dear Sir, I enclose you the invoice of the goods sold to Myers and Co. I went down to Richardson and Co., Lisburn, yesterday, and arranged to have the goods sent off. They engaged to send them to the boat this morning, Thursday. Please send me cash and bills as soon as possible. Hoping this may lead to further orders, I am, dear Sir, your's respectfully, Thomas Gorman")—In that invoice I have charged the goods at the regular prices, and then deducted the 27 1/2 discount—that leaves the price that I was to receive for them 647<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the price charged being 893<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after these goods had been sent, I received this letter from Taylor—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "London, Saturday, 4 April, 1857.

I have delivered them, and they are all checked off as being right; and on Tuesday I will send you cash and bills as agreed for the amount. Mr. Myers was too much engaged to-day to go into it. I find I did not tell you, but I agreed to meet him a little in the price of 96 and 97; he has it down on your list that I gave him, but I will refer to it on Tuesday; but I believe it was 96, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 97, 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. You may think the price low, but they really were not so cheap as goods that I sell regularly. You had a great many numbers, and a quantity of the fine ones compared to coarse. Your's, W. Taylor")—Shortly after that I received this letter from Taylor—(Read: "London, Tuesday night, 7 April, 1857. Mr. T. Gorman. Sir, I had sent over to me on Saturday afternoon a cheque from Myers and Co. for 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and gold 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., by May, the party who sold the handkerchiefs for Myers and Co.; and thinking it strange that Mr. Myers did not come on, I wrote to his private house to say I was sur<lb></lb>prised he had not called with the cash and bills himself. He has been here, and I find that May is an out and out villain; he has intercepted the goods, sold them in his own name, and, it is said, received the cash, pocketed the money, with a lot more, and has bolted.

Wait until I write to-morrow, and then I will see if you had not better come up. I had no idea in the world that Myers had not seen the goods; he says he has never seen them, and did not know they had been delivered. I will make another effort to<lb></lb>night to see him, and write by early post in the morning. I have ever found May honourable, and until a day or two have never known from any one anything irregular in cash matters. I will not leave one stone unturned. Your's, W.

Say what you are doing")—The letter of 7th April contained no money—after sending the telegraphic message, I received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Thursday night, 6.30 p. m., 9th April, 1857. Mr. T. Gorman. Sir,—I do not wonder at your feelings conveyed by telegraph just to hand; but if the goods had been my own or my brother's, I should have done just' the same. The transaction was so clear, and I am told we can recover every sixpence of Myers. We must proceed cautiously, and have the very best opinion we can get. I have telegraphed McCullagh for you and Lawson to give me orders on this point. I carried out to the letter Myers' instruc<lb></lb>tions, and it must be tried. May is in London, very ill, unable to leave his bed; but there is an accountant, and he has promised, with May, to meet us on Saturday or Monday at latest, and state the affairs, and make some proposition. I would say wait my next letter before you come up. I enclose you a cheque payable to your order, which please acknowledge per return. Value 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Your's, W. Taylor")—That letter contained a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but I had left Ireland before that letter arrived, and was on my way to London—I arrived in London on the evening of 10th April—Mr. Lawson came with me; he is also a manufacturer of handkerchiefs—on the following morning, the 11th, I and Lawson went to Taylor's counting house, in Church Passage, about half past 10 o'clock—I saw Taylor—we had a few words, and I said, "Mr. Taylor, how came you to let May get hold of my goods?"—he said that he came and got them when he was out—we had some more talk about the goods for a short time, and then we went up to the ware room on the second or third floor, and had some talk, and Mr. Turner came in, and Taylor said, "That is Mr. Turner, the solicitor"—some conversation took place; I do not think I spoke to Mr. Turner at that time—Taylor and Mr. Lawson had been talking about the handkerchiefs sold to Meekings, and Mr. Lawson asked Mr. Turner whether the Magistrate would not make Meekings give up the goods—Mr. Turner said he thought as the goods were sold so cheap, the Magistrate might cancel the sale; but he thought it was not a fit case for a Magistrate—he then left—when Taylor said that May got the goods when he was out, he said that he (May) should be hanged—I was there the most of the day—about 1 or 2 o'clock Mr. Drew came—I understand he is an accountant—Taylor and Lawson were present; Mr. Drew came in with some papers in his hand, and, reaching one to Mr. Lawson, he said, "This is your account with Mr. May," and he reached another paper to me, striving to draw my attention off, and said, "Mr. Gorman, this is your account with Mr. May"—I said I did not know Mr. May, that the goods were not sold to him—I do not remember that anything else was said, but Mr. Drew was to produce May at Mr. Turner's office on Monday, at 3 o'clock; Mr. Drew said that—I went on the Monday to Mr. Turner's office, in Aldermanbury,</p>

Myers sets us at defiance, and says he is not respon<lb></lb>sible, because the goods or invoice were not sent to him personally; whereas everything was carried out according to his and May's instructions.

               <p>I came up to London afterwards I went to Taylor, with Mr. Law<lb></lb>son—I went in and shook hands with Taylor, and we had some few words, and then I asked him how it was that he let May get my goods—he replied that he got them when he was out, and that he should be hanged—he either said he should be hanged, or he ought to be hanged—he did not say, "He first came when I was out, and he afterwards came and got the goods"—there was a boy present when we went in, but I rather think he went out—I am not sure he did not say that May had come twice about them—I do not remember hearing such a remark—I will not swear he did not make it; I think I heard Mr. Hairby say that May came and asked for the invoice for Mr. Myers to see it—that was some time in the next week—he was not present the first time that I saw; he was there a short time afterwards—I did not learn from him that Taylor had helped to pack the goods, not at that time; I heard it the following week, I think, from Hairby, at the warehouse—we were talking about it several times, and I think he told me—I could not swear positively that it was him, I think it was, I have a doubt—I cannot say whether Taylor was present at the time, he might, or might not be—I do not remember anybody being pre<lb></lb>sent, nor can I swear positively that it was Hairby that told me, though I believe it was—this was the week following my coming to town—I think it was before I served the notice—I came to town on Friday—I saw Taylor on Saturday, and served the notice on the Thursday—I never heard, until I was at the police court, that Taylor had received the goods, and unpacked them—I heard Taylor say several times that he had delivered them accord<lb></lb>ing to his instructions—it is my belief that Hairby told me that May came and asked for the invoice for Mr. Myers to see it, and that he brought it back again—I did not, that I remember, hear that he had come a second time and unpacked the goods—I will not swear I did not, I cannot say whether I did or did not—I do not remember hearing that he did so, in the presence of Taylor—I will not swear whether I did or did not—I will swear that I heard it before I served the notice—the gentlemen I went to were Messrs. Sole and Turner, the solicitors—I took all the papers to Mr. Prentice's chambers, all these letters, and Mr. Prentice was consulted with a view to taking steps against Myers—Taylor did not, from the beginning to the end, give me every sort of facility for that purpose; at first he wanted no law at all; he did not want me to go to law—when I went to Mr. Prentice, Taylor gave me all the information, and offered to be of any use to me that he could—the order from Myers for the goods might have been produced by Taylor at the interview with Mr. Prentice; but I did not see it—I did not see it shown to Mr. Prentice; it might or it might not have been, I cannot recollect—it might be there, and probably was, I do not remember it—I was thinking of proceeding against Myers at that time—an order from Myers for the goods would be a most important matter to be produced as against Myers; I cannot recollect whether that order was produced at the consultation with counsel, for I had no conversation with the counsel, and took no part in it; I was sitting at the back of the room—I cannot tell whether or not the order was referred to on that occasion, it might be there—I cannot recollect whether it was spoken of, and Mr. Prentice's attention specifically called to it—Taylor expressed him<lb></lb>self very indignantly both about May and about Myers—to-day is not the first time that I have mentioned the conversation in which Taylor said that if I would not proceed against him he would give me all he had, even his bed—I mentioned it that night—I mentioned it when I was before Mr.</p>

               <p>Mr. Myers had paid me the invoice price of 640<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time I wrote the letter of 16th April, I certainly should not have given him into custody; if I had got my property, or my money, I should not have cared about public justice—I do not think any man would when he has got his pro<lb></lb>perty; he has got justice when he has got that—on the first occasion I only gave Taylor and May into custody—Myers attended before the Alder<lb></lb>man without any warrant, but if he had not attended there would have been one—he attended of his own accord, when he was sent for—I think that was about four days after Taylor and May were in custody—it was on the second hearing I think that Myers attended—in one part of the conversa<lb></lb>tion I had with Myers he stated that Taylor kept May in his house—I inquired where they were living, and found that they were living together in the same house up to Jan. last, and for some time previous—I do not think I made that inquiry between the 13th and the 16th—I think it was at the time the proceedings were on at the police court, but I heard it the first time I was up.</p>

I feel completely done up, because I know the misery he has caused. Any transaction I have ever had with the man up to last week was met honourably, and to the very letter of the word.

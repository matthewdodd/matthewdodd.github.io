                  </hi>. I am professor of chemistry and forensic I medicine at the London Hospital—on 29th September I received from Inspector Smith a small tumbler corked, and wrapped in brown paper and sealed—it contained about 3oz. or a little more of a liquid that smelt of beer with some tobacco floating on it—I analysed it, and found a trace of picro toxine; it is the active principle of cocculus indicus, or the Levant nut—by "a trace "I mean a quantity that I could not Weigh—I also found about two grains of nicotine, the active principle of tobacco—I do not mean that it was put in as nicotine; it might have been put in as tobacco, but I found nicotine, which was an evidence of tobacco having been put into the liquid—a small quantity of tobacco put into beer would result in the production of nicotine—I am not prepared to say that if the quantity of nicotine I found had been taken it would have been dangerous—it would have a stupefying effect if taken in a sufficient quantity—in all cases of vegetable poisoning the use of the person taking it has to be considered, and as persons of their class smoke somewhat freely I am scarcely prepared to say that the quantity I found would be sufficient to produce a dangerous effect—to a person not accustomed to tobacco it would be undoubtedly dangerous—the glass if full would hold 8oz. of fluid; it contained 3oz., and in that was two grains of nicotine; that would come under the denomination of either a stupefying or overpowering matter, or both—I found particles of I tobacco itself in the beer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, Cocculus indicus is popularly known as grains of para I dise—it is used by some of the low publicans when they dilute their beer to. I increase its intoxicating properties—I cannot say how long it would take before the nicotine would be extracted; it would certainly not be instan<lb></lb>taneous'—as a rule the action of nicotine on the system is rapid—I have known it occur as soon as in 19 minutes, but that would be exceptional—I have known it take nearly four hours.</p>

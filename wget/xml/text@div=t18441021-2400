On the evening of the 21st of Sept. the prisoners Jones, Hill, Benson, and Key came to our house—they were in the habit of using the tap-room regularly—there were a great number of their shopmates in the tap-room, as there generally was on a Saturday evening—a dispute and scuffle took place between Jones and George Benson, the brother of William Benson—I was in the parlour at the time—the persons at the bar called me, and I went in and parted them—I told them I could not allow anything of that sort going on in the house, and if they persisted in fighting I should give them in charge—Jones immediately said he did not wish to fight, and put on his coat—I heard no more of any scuffling—Jones left a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before the others, and I did not observe him come in again—he might have done so, but I did not see it—George Benson put on his coat too.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 22nd of Sept., between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the body of the deceased, on the spot where he was killed, before it was conveyed to the Warwick Arms—life was perfectly extinct—the body was still warm at the trunk, but getting cold at the extremities—I examined the body, and perceived on the left collar<lb></lb>bone the mark of a bruise—on the lower lip there was the appearance of a cut, and on the bridge of the nose was the appearance of another severe contusion—behind the left ear there was a wound or cut in the skin, about an inch and a half in length—it is difficult to say what that might have been caused by—it might have been by pulling the ear forcibly forward—there was the ap<lb></lb>pearance of some blood coming from the inner right ear—those were the only traces of violence that I perceived—on the following day, by order of the Co<lb></lb>roner, I examined the body—I found no appearance of fracture of the cranium, but on taking off the skull, I perceived, on the right side of the brain, at the upper part, appearances of severe contusion, and a considerable quantity of blood effused in the cavity of the cranium, such as would he caused by the rupture of a blood-vessel—that was, in my opinion, the cause of death—in nine cases out of ten, I should say rupture of a blood-vessel would not be caused by such a blow as I saw under the ear—such a blow, combined with the excitement the man was in at the moment, would be sufficient to account for the rupture, but I should say a man might very frequently receive such a blow as that, unless he was of very weak constitution, as I found afterwards was the case, from my examination—I have no doubt that such a blow might cause the rupture of the blood-vessel, and that that was the cause of his death—apoplexy,</p>

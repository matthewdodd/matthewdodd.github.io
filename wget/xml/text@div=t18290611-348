            . I am a waiter at the Mail Coach public-house, Noble-street, Falcon-square. At ten minutes before one o'clock, on the 11th of June, the prisoner brought three baskets of wood for sale - we had bought some old wood of some of the men at the same buildings; I found this was new wood, and I shewed it to Stottard - my employer sent to Mr. Wing.</p>

            . I went to the building to take the prisoner; he got down a ladder, and ran off, but I took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told me to run away; if Mr. Wing was here he would know how it was - I never to my knowledge brought any of that wood; some of the working men were there all the time.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM STOTTARD. Q. Are you sure it is your master's property? A. Yes - I found the fellow pieces on the premises; the men are not allowed to take any wood - they take chips; these are only part of what were gone. <rs id="t18290611-348-verdict1828" type="verdictDescription">

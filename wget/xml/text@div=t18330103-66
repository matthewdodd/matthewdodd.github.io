             (Police-constable H 49.) I was in Union-street, Spitalfields, on the morning of the 20th of December; I looked down Red Lion-street, and saw the two prisoners and the prosecutrix - they had hold of the prosecutrix's clothes, and were hustling her - I went towards them; Cook crossed the road - I heard the prosecutrix say "You have robbed me of my purse, containing three duplicates," and she called Police! I took the two prisoners to the watch-house, and in going along Cook struck the prosecutrix on the face - I got a light and on the opposite side to where the prosecutrix had been, I found this purse and three duplicates.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did they scuffle together? A. They both had hold of the prosecutrix, who was certainly in liquor; she had not been on that side where I found the purse, but Cook separated from them, and went on that side.</p>
               <p>Christmas' Defence. We had two or three quarters of gin, and the prosecutrix had some beer; we went out and she asked if she could sleep with me - I said No; she then said, "I have spent all my money, and now you will not take me home" - I said I could not; she then said we had robbed her, and gave charge of us.</p>

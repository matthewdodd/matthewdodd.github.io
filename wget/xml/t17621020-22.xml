I was robbed in the night, when I was asleep, of two guineas and a half, and some silver. There was an acquaintance of mine lay with me, and another person lay in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door locked?</p>

               <p>Lamprell. No, it was not. My breeches, that I had laid under my pillow, were in the morning lying on the floor. My acquaintance said, he thought it was the prisoner. The prisoner had lived there, but he was gone away. I found he was at the Black Horse in the Borough; I took him up with a warrant, and carried him before Justice Fielding. We called in at the Red-lion in Long-Acre; there he owned he got under the gate, and came in and stole my money out of my breeches, and went out again, and had spent the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any promises made him on his confessing?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176210200022"></xptr>Lamprell. He had threatened to knock Mr. Clarage's brains out (he is the master of the inn), and he told him, he would forgive him that, if he would tell the truth about this.</p>

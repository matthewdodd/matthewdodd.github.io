I left my shop at a quarter past 9 o'clock in the evening—I returned about a quarter past 10 o'clock—I found some one had entered my premises by a picklock key, I suppose; they could not any other way, because parties were in the shop—no one occupied the room from whence I lost my clothes; it was my own bed room—I missed from it three coats—twoof these produced are mine; this other I am not certain about—these waistcoats are mine—the lodgers had a right to come in with a latch key, but no one had a right to come into my room.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 15th of April, I was at the Opera. I was sitting in the pit, about half way down on the left hand side of the railing, near the boxes - there was only the railing between me and the passage - I was attending to the ballet and felt something at my left hand coat pocket, which was close to the railing; I turned round, and saw the prisoner close to the rails; I put my hand to my pocket and found my pocket book still there; I was talking to Sir

            , who was sitting on the bench before me - very shortly afterwards I felt something again at my pocket; I put my hand to my pocket and exclaimed "I have lost my pocket book;" Sir Thomas Croft heard it; I saw the prisoner next me, and I said to Mr. Littledale, a friend of mine, to whom I had been talking, "Look into that hat, (meaning the prisoner's) I am sure my pocket-book is in it;" I fancied I had seen his hand go from my pocket to his hat; I had distinctly seen something put into it; he had then moved about half a yard or a yard from where I had first seen him - he heard what I said; I got over the ballustrade, and Sir Thomas Croft said to the prisoner "Allow me, Sir, to look into that hat," seizing it at the same time, and I picked up my pocket-book close by where the prisoner was standing - there was a pencil case in it, but no money - I was sitting quite still when I felt, first, one snatch at my pocket, and then another - it was not possible for the book to have fallen from my pocket in the situation in which I found it - Sir Thomas Croft took the prisoner, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was the house full? A. Yes; very full, and the passages were crowded as much as the seats - when the ballet is on the stage the people press upwards rather, and then the ballustrades are the only things that were between us - when the people are straining to see the ballet, it makes some impression on those who have seats; I believe every alternate seat has a back to it; I was about half way down; the pressure I felt the first time might have been from the crowd - the prisoner had the same pressure as others - he moved from his place - my book was in the pocket next the crowd; I made no observation the first time, but the second time I exclaimed "Good God, I have lost my pocket book;" the music was playing and the ballet was going on - the prisoner might not have heard me - he had his hat before him, and I saw something put into it - he was then parallel with me; I do not know whether there was any thing in his hat or not - he denied any knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The rails do not extend all the way down? A. No; but there was a rail where I was sitting; I was close to the rail, but I cannot say whether my coat pocket was outside the rail or not; I had seen the prisoner standing there about five minutes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he attempt to make off, or did he keep his ground? A. When I saw him the second time he had removed about a yard.</p>
               <p>SIR THOMAS ELMESLEY CROFT, BART. I am acquainted with the prosecutor - I was formerly in the same regiment with him; I was sitting on the left hand side of the pit on the night in question - at that part which is ballustraded; I was looking at the ballet when I heard Captain Barton say "Good God, I have lost my pocket book, look into that hat;" I was sitting on the corner of the seat before him; I knew the gentleman before me, I therefore saw there was no one to whom he could allude but the prisoner; I seized his hat as he was standing with his back to the boxes, and said "Allow me to look at that hat," and, without waiting for any reply, I took hold of it as he was holding it against him; he turned pale, and, as I took hold of it, I saw him shuffle this pocket-book out of the hat with his right hand, and it dropped at his feet; I took hold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110047"></xptr>of him by the collar - he made no resistance; I gave him to the officer; Captain Barton took up the book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the book in his hand? A. I saw it shuffling out of his hat and he touched it, but I did not see it in his hand; I do not know whether there was a handkerchief in his hat, - I did not look into the hat, but I saw the book fall - there were many persons close to him, but I should think they were too much engaged looking at the ballet to notice him if he had taken the book from the pocket - no person said that they had seen him do any thing - this was during the dancing.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am entirely innocent of it - some person might have put it into my hat - my handkerchief was in it, and, in the pressure, my hat was doubled, which all persons who go there know to be the case; I never touched the garment of Captain Barton - if any person can say I did I will not say another word; if you find me guilty you will deprive a wife and three children of a husband and a father; I have heard of persons having things slipped into their pockets - there is no proof that I robbed him; I had my gloves on at the time; I do not mean to say the pocket-book could not have been put into my hat; I might have pulled out my handkerchief, and this little book might have fallen in.</p>
               <p>JURY to SIR THOMAS EDMESLEY CROFT. Q. When you took the hat from him, was there any reluctance on his part to your having it? A. Yes; there was at first - he was holding it close against him with his two hands; when I took hold of his hat he partly quitted his hold of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. If any person wished to pass you, would not you have kept your hat up as closely as possible to let them? A. Yes; I should, but there was no one passing you at that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there room for any other person to have passed? A. Yes; plenty of room; I swear I saw the book drop from the prisoner's hat.</p>

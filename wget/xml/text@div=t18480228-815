"James Field"—occupation? and he said, "A farmer, deceased"—at the time he said Esther Field resided in Wimpole-street, he asked me if I knew the name of "Clitherow"—I said, No, I believed there was a family of that name in Wimpole-street, and he said that was the house—I do recollect his saying anything about the lady's mother—Mr. Hamilton was not present at this time—this was before he came in—he came two or three minutes after—the party then adjourned into the Church, and the marriage ceremony was gone through—I saw Mr. Hamilton put his name to the registry after the ceremony—the registry was read over to the parties—they assented to its accuracy, and then he signed it, and I and my wife signed it as witnesses.</p>

               <p>remember the defendant and Miss Field coming there to be married on 19th June—the banns had been previously published, on 23rd and 30th May, and 6th June—it was not the invariable practice for the clerk to make the entry in the register-book before the marriages were solemnized—I believed the law does not require it, but it is sometimes done, as a matter of convenience, if the clergyman has not come, not to keep the parties waiting—after the mar<lb></lb>riage was solemnized I distinctly read out the entry in the register-book to the parties, in the form as entered by the clerk—it is a legal form, that we are obliged to go through; we have no discretion—"Samuel Brown, of full age, gentleman, 31, Wimpole-street; father's name, George Brown, farmer, de<lb></lb>ceased; is that correct?" and the answer given me was, "Yes"—I then proceeded to the second line, "Esther Field, of full age, spinster; father's name, James Field, farmer, deceased;" to which I also received an assenting answer, before either of the parties or myself signed it—I could not swear that Miss Field gave the answer herself, but my impression is that she did—an assent was decidedly given me whilst I held the pen in my hand, and before I affixed my signature—both parties were present—Brown answered his own line.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he answer the second line? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, an answer was given me, and my impression is that it was the answer of Miss Field—if there was not an assent in words, there was an assenting bow—I cannot so completely charge my memory as to whether Brown spoke, and the lady bowed, but an answer was given in the affirmative—had there been any doubt on my mind I should not have signed it—a most unequivocal assent was given, and upon that I and the parties signed it.</p>

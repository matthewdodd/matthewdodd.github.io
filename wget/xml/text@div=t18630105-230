                  </hi>. On the evening of 1st December, I was returning home from my work as usual about half—past 8, and on entering the corner of Manchester-street, Manchester-square, I was accosted by the prisoner, who struck me a violent blow on the eye and knocked me down—I was rendered insensible by the blow, and when I recovered, I found I had lost 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a silk hand<lb></lb>kerchief—I am positive the prisoner is the man—I identified him at the police—station in Marylebone—lane, from about a dozen others, on Friday, the 12th—I picked him out as the man who assaulted me—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 76). About half—pant 9 o'clock, on the morning of 12th December, I arrested the prisoner, on information, in Red Lion-square—I told him I should take him in custody on suspicion of having assaulted a man, and robbed him of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a silk pocket-handkerchief, on the evening of the 1st of the month, in Manchester-square—he said, "I will go with you, but I know nothing about it; I can prove where I was; I was at Brompton"—I was in the habit of seeing the prisoner constantly before the occurrence—after the occurrence, me and Sergeant White were in search of him, but we could not find him, or see him, in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood—I took him to Marylebone Police-station, and he was told by Sergeant White to place himself where he liked—there were ten or a dozen men there, and he. placed himself in the centre of them—the prosecutor was sent for, and he walked straight up to the prisoner, and said, "You are the man who assaulted me"—after the charge was read over to the prisoner, he said again, "I can very easily prove where I was that evening; I was at Brompton."</p>

I was on duty on 1st December, in the Edgeware-road, and about a quarter to 9, I saw the prisoner, with two others, coming out of Barclay-street—I should think that is about five or six minutes walk from Manchester-square—they were walking quickly towards Hyde Park—I knew the prisoner before—I heard of the robbery, at 11 o'clock the same night, and gave a description of the men I had seen.</p>

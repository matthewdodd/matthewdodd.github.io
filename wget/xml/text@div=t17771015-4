               <p>I know the prisoner by sight; I have frequently seen him bring timber to Mitchell's, who is a coal-dealer; I live opposite to Mitchell; I have seen him bring enough there since the first of June to build a house; my wife told me he frequently brought timber there, and she thought he stole it: on Saturday se'ennight, when I came from work at about six o'clock, I saw him bring a piece of timber and throw it into Mitchell's coal-shed; he went down Portland-street into Portland-place and leaned against a post; I went on the opposite side of the way and watched him, and saw him take up this piece of timber, and pitched it against Portland Chapel; I called another man, whose name was Mitchel, to watch with me where he took it to; I desired that Mitchel to run to Mitchell's coal-shed; we had been watching the prisoner before; we both got there before he threw it down the cellar; I saw Mitchell have hold of it while he was throwing it down; I asked him how long he meant to go on stealing peoples' timber, and bringing it there; he said, he did not steal it, a man gave it to him; he said he would go with us to the man's house; he went with us as far as Portland Chapel, and then he said the man was not at home, he would go with us to him on Monday; I went and called my masters I work for, who had lost a great quantity of timber, and desired me to look out and take the thief: we took the prisoner to the justice's; there he said Mitchell sent him to different places for it, and paid him only porterage for bringing it: when Mitchell found we were gone to the justice's, and that he was like to be apprehended for receiving it, he threw out four long pieces into the street, one of those pieces belonged to the prosecutor. Mitchell is out upon bail.</p>

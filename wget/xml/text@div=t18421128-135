On the 6th of Nov., at twenty minutes to twelve o'clock at night, Syble met me, and in a flurried manner gave me to understand that his wife had got into the station, and he wished us to bail her out—when we got there she had committed felony, and we could not—I came home—he met me and said, "Is it over?"—I laid, "No, and if there is any thing your wife has brought to my house, I insist on its being taken away"—he said, "There is nothing but a few nutmegs, and there is a box under the table belonging to Ann"—I said, "I insist on its being taken out," and he took it up stairs into his own apartment—he then brought some things down in his arms, and said he would throw them down the privy—I said I would have nothing thrown down the privy—I saw him go out, but he took nothing with him to my knowledge.</p>

On Sunday night, the 6th of Nov., a little before seven o'clock, I was coming up the Commercial-road—I saw Syble walking up and down Sutton-street—I watched him about ten minutes—I saw him look very hard at the back part of Mr. Johnson's house—I then saw Ann Kirby come out of Mr. Johnson's side door, and walk down Sutton-street—Syble followed her, they were talking together—I stopped them, and asked what they had got—Ann Kirby said, some dirty linen of her sister's to wash—I said, "Who is your sister?"—she said, "Eliza Kirby"—Syble then said, "This is my wife"—Ann Kirby said, "We live at No. 7, Martha-street, it is all right"—I said, "Then go on," but I saw they went another way—I followed them—Ann Kirby took a bundle from under her arm, gave it to Syble, and they ran—I called to another officer—I ran and caught Ann Kirby, in Charles-street, and from under her arm I took this pound of candles, and bag—the other articles which are here were found in the privy, at No. 8, Martha-street, where Syble lodged—here are a pound of candles, three cakes of soap, some nutmegs, and other things—Eliza Kirby did not come out of Mr. Johnson's house with Ann—I went back to the house, and Eliza denied her sister then.</p>

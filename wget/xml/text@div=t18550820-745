                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live at Iver, Bucks. On Monday night, 13th Aug., about 9 o'clock, I called at the Bull beer shop, for orders—I had a cart with me—I left the cart outside, leaving my coat in the cart—I came out in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, from information, and went in pursuit of a man—about half a mile from the beer shop I came up with the prisoner, on the road to Colham-green—I went in my cart, and took Smith and Merring, two militia meu, with me—the prisoner was carrying the coat under his arm—Smith got out of the cart, stopped him, and took the coat from him, and gave it to me—I then asked the prisoner his name—he said his name was Thomas West, but when I got back I found his name was George Watts—he was known there—he said he had picked up the coat in the road—I am certain I left the coat in the cart when I went into the public house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the 5th Elthorne Militia. On Monday, 13th August, I was billeted at the Bull beer shop, in company with Merring—I saw the prisoner there for about an hour—I remember Evans coming in—the prisoner went out about ten minutes after Evans came in—I saw Evans go out—he returned again, and said he had lost his coat—I gave him some information, and I and Merring went with him, in his cart, after the prisoner—we came up with him about half a mile from the beer shop—he was carrying the coat under his left arm, and a basket—we stopped him, and took the coat away from him—he gave the name of Thomas West—he was sober.</p>

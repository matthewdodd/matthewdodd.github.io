            . I live in Spitalfields. On the 18th of January I was in Clifton-street in the evening, about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's shop - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw a person running; I pursued him, and saw him throw something over a wall - he then turned, and I lost sight of him; Monteith stopped a person - and I believe it was the same person whom I had seen running - I cannot positively swear it was the prisoner- I went with the officer to the premises of Mr. Masters, in Earl-street, who gave these trousers to the officer in about half an hour.</p>

               <p>ANN DRYDEN. I live in Stepney-causeway, and am a servant. On the 1st of November, the prisoner gave me at Sewell and Cross', some nett and some lace; she told me to hem it, and make it into handkerchiefs - on the 8th she gave me a piece of Irish linen to make into shifts for her; she gave me a piece of lawn, and some bombazeen, which she told me to keep till she came to my place, on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were not these things found at your house? A. Yes, and then I stated these facts; I went to Sewell and Cross' to see her - I had no opportunity of taking any thing out of the shop; I used to go in the afternoon - I had not the least suspicion these things were stolen; I thought she came by them honestly- she told me they were come fairly by; I was taken up - I did not accuse her, till after I was put in prison; I did not know any thing of it till I was taken for; the officer and Mr. Cross came together - I told every thing I knew, but still they put me in gaol; I swear I had not the least notion where these things came from - she said she bought them; she had been there twelve weeks; I believe she said she bought the linen, but had not paid for it - I believe she said there were eight yards and a half of the bombazeen; the long lawn was new - the linen is cut up; I had worked on some of it - I have known her three months; I am still detained in the House of Correction -I wish to clear myself, and I expect if I get her convicted, I shall get out; I generally went to the house once a week- I was there four days as a char-woman, and slept there; I went through the shop to get to the kitchen.</p>

            . I was servant to Sewell and Cross. On the 14th of November I was taken to prison; the prisoner was not with me - on the Friday evening I came down into the kitchen, and the prisoner said, "I have been much frightened - there has been a gentleman down stairs, and said that William has been robbing the shop;" I said, "Why, are you frightened? you have not been robbing the shop;" she said she wanted to see William, and he came down, but what she said to him I do not know, for I went up stairs - when I came down she said,"There is a parcel yonder;" I said, "I don't know what you mean by yonder - I see nothing;" I then went into the water-closet, and while I was there, I heard a jump -I came on, and she said, "Here are two parcels, and these are stockings, which William has been taking;" she had another parcel, which she said were handkerchiefs -I said it was very wrong of William; we should all get into prison for nothing - the next morning Mr. Cross came and asked me about several things; I could not tell him - he asked me about this, and I was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That other person was convicted? A. Yes; William was - these are not the articles I speak of; I know nothing about these - on the Sunday night I went out from four o'clock till nine; Dryden was there four days together - I have seen her pass the carpet-room; there were chests of drawers, and things of that kind there - she might have been in the shop without my seeing her; the four days that she was at the house ended about a fortnight before I was taken; but she had been there on the Monday evening.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the prisoner, and got these stockings and silks from Navarino-house - I told the prisoner I was aware of what she had done with the stockings, she had put them down the privy, and I wanted to know what she had done with the silk; she said, "Then I will tell you" - I did not say, "You may as well tell me;" I said, "You and Catherine have put the stockings down the privy, I want to know what you have done with the silk;" she said, "There is a young man here, (but I will not mention who he is,) who says there is going to be a terrible hubbub in the house, and I put the stockings down the privy, but I had not the heart to put the silk handkerchiefs down, and put them into the rice-bag"- I went to the rice-bag, and there I found them; these are them - I know of no information being given to the prisoner of what Reid had said.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BURGOYNE WATTS. I never spoke to the prisoner about any conversation I had with Reid.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday, 21st March, I went to my premises in Cross-street about half-past five in the morning, and found there had been a fire there—I saw a quantity of paper bags under the counter, which we use for putting flour in, and part of a pocket-handkerchief that was still on fire when I arrived there—I remarked to the prisoner that it looked very suspi<lb></lb>eious—he was in the shop, and several of the police were there—he said he did not know anything about it—I had left him only in possession of the shop on the Friday—I left about half-past eleven at night, in company with the witness Palmer—about an hour before I left I had occasion to look under the counter, and there were no paper bags there then—it was not a usual place for such bag's to be put—we always kept them in a box at the extreme end of the shop—I never knew them to be there—on seeing the bags there, I said to the prisoner that it looked very suspicious, and that the bags were not there the night before when I left—he made no answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Spencer-street, and occasionally assist mr. Bell—I was with him on the 21st of March, and left the shop with him about a quarter past eleven—while I was there, I saw some flour bags, and placed</p>

               <p>them in the bread scales on the right side of the shop; between the grocery side and the other side, but nearer the grocery side—the counters form a kind of angle—I went to the shop next morning about a quarter-past ten—I did not see any bags then—they were gone from the counter where I had left them—I saw some in the policeman's hand, burnt—they were something like the bags, but I am not positive they were the same—afterwards saw the place where the fire had broken out—it was about six feet from where I had left the bags the previous night.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable, K</hi> 205.) I was on duty in Cross-street on Saturday morning the 21st of March, about twenty minutes to six, and called the prisoner—I heard a crackling noise in the shop, and saw some smoke coming out of the fan-light at the top of the door—I pulled down the shutters, knocked at the door, got in at the shutter, and called for water—the pri<lb></lb>soner came out to me, apparently in the act of pulling his trowsers up—he came out of his bed-room—I went behind the counter, and there found a fire kindled, apparently just lit—there was a quantity of paper bags lying at the bottom, and five or six pieces of wood, which I produce, standing over the bags, leaning against the partition of the counter—water was brought, and I extinguished the fire—the prisoner stated that it smelt like tobacco burning.</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday, the 21st of March, I went to sleep at Mr. Bell's house with the prisoner—he told me to make the bed—he was reading on the grocery side of the shop at the time—I saw him put the gas out—we both went to bed in our trowsers—he did not say anything to me till the morning—he then said, "Here is the policeman come knocking"—he had told the policeman to knock at half-past five—I did not sleep on my usual side of the bed that night, as when we went to bed he said I was to sleep on his side—my side was next to the shop door—there are two doors, one is the shop door, and one leading out into the yard—on the night in question he slept nearest the door leading to the shop—I saw him put out the candle before he turned in—whilst I was making the bed the prisoner was in the shop on the grocery side, next the window, at the side of the counter under the coffee-mill—when I saw him he was reading a book—I saw him stoop down at the end of the counter that is near the window—I could not see what he was doing—it was near the place where the fire was—at half-past five he <hi rend="italic">nudged</hi> me, and told me the policeman was knocking at the door, and he said he had told him to call him at half-past five.</p>

I am carman to Robert Groom, of 2, Pell Street, Si George's-in-the-East—on 11th December I was employed to fetch sixteen cases of champagne to Mr. Bosco's, of Crutched Friars—I delivered three cases there and received two other cases, which I put in the van, and drove to the Great Northern Railway Office, in Crutched Friars—they were a heavy lot, about 24 cwt.—I proceeded to take them in separately—I had</p>

On 11th December, I received information, and I went to Paddington and Notting Hill—I returned on an omnibus down Oxford Street about 10. 30 p. m., where I saw the two prisoners with a van—Smith was driving, and Jones was on his left hand—I saw some cases in the van covered with tarpauling—I knew the horses and van quite well; they belonged to Robert Groom—I got off the omnibus, and followed the prisoners up to the Canal Lodge, Harrow Road—they had been flogging the horses so much that they had great difficulty in getting them up the hill—I procured assistance, and took the prisoners to the Harrow Road Station, and charged them with stealing the horse and van—Smith said, "You have made a mistake, it was a tall man with a moustache"—I said, "No, there is no tall man at all"—Smith gave me a false address—I went to three No. 5's, and could not find him—there were thirteen cases in the van—they were identified. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The address Smith gave was 5, Abbey Street, Bethnal Green Road—there was a "lady" in the van, and Smith sat between her and Jones—she was taken into custody, but was afterwards discharged—I took her out of the van—Smith was shoving at the wheel—he said he was only helping the tall man with the moustache—the "lady" said she asked them in the Edgware Road to give her a ride—I knew the prisoners well by sight.</p>

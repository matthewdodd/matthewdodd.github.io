                  </hi>. I am a waiter and live at 2, Porter Street, near Leicester Square—I was walking through Porter Street on 9th May, about 11.40 p.m., and saw five men standing by a public-house on the opposite side of the street—I had my keys in my hand and three shillings, a sixpence, and twopence halfpenny in bronze, and a corkscrew in my trousers pocket—the prisoner Robarty came to my right side and said "Old man, are you going home?"—I said "Leave me alone; do not speak to me"—I had seen him before many times—Burke came on my left and struck me on the nose, knocking me down—the blood came—I got up and caught hold of him and called "Police!"—it was all done in a moment—three other men came up and they struck me behind and before, and the prisoners took from me my corkscrew and keys and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I held them both, but had to let them go—the other men said "We will kill you if you don't let them go"—I told a man to fetch a policeman and I gave the prisoners in custody in a fried-fish shop, distant about six minutes' walk—I had had something to drink, but knew what I was about—I had often seen the prisoners about before, nearly every day, and they are the men who attacked me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was coming from the Crown Hotel—I was quite sober—I had been drinking—I drink ale or stout every day—I do not remember at the police-court saying "A few nights before I had charged a man with stealing from me"—he was not taken in custody—I do not remember charging a man before with robbing me and the policeman refusing to take him because I was drunk—the live men were near the public-house—the public-house was open—the prisoners were taken half an hour after the assault sitting in a fried-fish shop eating fish, about five minutes' walk from where the assault took place—there are four compartments in the shop—I looked into the compartment where the prisoners and other men were sitting and then passed on to another compartment to look for the other three men, and then returned and said "These two are the men"—I do not know Mary Ann Crowder—my money was all in one pocket—the prisoners took hold of me one on each side and put their hands in my pockets—I said at the police-court "Burke came from the right and caught hold of me, and Robarty from the left"—I might have made a mistake—I am not quite lure which was on the left and which was on the right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I leave business very late—there is a little court off Porter Street—they would have to pass by that court where the corkscrew was found to get to the fried-fish shop—I can swear to the corkscrew, it has the name "Pickel" upon it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that is it—the fried-fish shop is in a public thoroughfare leading to Seven Dials.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 94). On 9th May, at 11.55, the prosecutor came to me in King Street, Soho—he was drunk, but knew what he was about—his nose was bleeding and his mouth cut—in consequence of what he said I went with him to a fried-fish shop in Grafton Street—there were about ten people there and the shop has three or four compartments—he walked into the first comparmen' an I looked in, and then Went to the outside</p>

               <p>of the next compartment and looked in there—he then turned back and said "These are the two"—they were sitting in the first compartment—he said "I charge them with stealing 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and assaulting me"—the prisoners both said they knew nothing about it—another constable was fetched and they were taken to the station and searched—on Robarty was found threepence and a penknife, and on Burke four shillings and a penny—I do not know the court where the corkscrew was found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The fried-fish shop is about three minutes' walk, (150 or 200 yards), from where the robbery took place—there is a good deal of traffic—I know nothing of Robarty—I have made inquiries—I do not know Mr. Woolley, card maker, High Holborn; or Mr. Hatchett, wholesale stationer, Strand—he said he had been working in the Strand, but would not tell me where—I know Burke as an associate of thieves, but I do not think he has been convicted before.</p>

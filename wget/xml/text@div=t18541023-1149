                  </hi>. I am an excavator, and live at the Old Park House, in the Isle of Dogs. On 2nd Oct., I was at the Queen's Arms, Poplar—I saw the prisoner Park there—I had some beer, but not with him; I paid for my own beer—there were other persons there—after I had paid for my bear, I attempted to go away, but Park put his hand against the door, and said, "You can't go out here"—I got out, and went in the back yard—Park fol<lb></lb>lowed me, and wanted me to pay for a quart of beer for him—I said I would if he would let me alone—I took my purse out of my pocket, and gave him sixpence to let me go—he snatched my purse out of my hand, threw me down, and ran away—I do not know what money I bad in my purse—I had one 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, some half crowns, and some shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Queen's arms. I was in the back parlour there, on 2nd Oct.—Harrison had been there all day—he had been drinking a little—the prisoners came in about half past 2 o'clock—they were all in the room together—Park caught hold of Harrison, and asked him to stand some beer—that was in the back parlour—Harrison gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and told Park to put 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to it; Park went out, and brought in two pots of beer—Harrison tried to leave the room, and Park went to the door, and told him he could not go out—when Park went to fetch the beer, Har<lb></lb>rison went out—Park went out in the yard also, and threw Harrison down in the yard—I could see from the parlour what Park did—I then went to the bar for some beer—I did not see him do anything else—after Park had been out a minute or two, Cunningham went out—Harrison was then in the yard; and in a minute or two he came running in, and said they had taken his money—when Park threw Harrison down, he stood by his side—I did not see him stoop or kneel—when Park threw Harrison down, Cunningham was sitting at the window by himself—I do not think he could see Park throw Harrison down—I do not think Cunningham said anything—I went for some beer, and the prisoners went out—I followed them to the iron bridge, and gave them into custody—after they were in custody Cunning<lb></lb>ham turned round, and ran away, and the policeman ran after him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 346). In consequence of what the last witness said to me, I and another officer took the prisoners—they were coming down the iron bridge hill—they were both walking, and were together, coming in a direction from Poplar—I stopped them, and told them they must go back with me to Poplar—they said they would not—I took Cunningham, and the other officer took Park—Cunningham went part of the way up the hill, and he gave a jump and got away—he ran back, and I pursued him—just before T got to him, he stooped down, caught me round the waist, and threw me down; he hurt me very much—I feel it now, and he got on me—I believe the boy Sullivan struck him with a stick—I drew my staff, and struck him on the head.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you have seen a great many prisoners, and have taken them, and they have been acquitted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when I gave him this blow, it was in a way which stupified him for the time.</p>

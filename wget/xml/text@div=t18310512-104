I saw her alive on Monday morning, the 7th of March, about eight o'clock - she appeared in her usual health; I saw her dead on the Wednesday - after her death was discovered I went up stairs, found the place all ransacked, and things taken out of the drawers - she had two feather beds in the house, one she slept on, and the other belonged to my sister, and was there for sale; I found both those beds gone.</p>

Yes, a very good temper indeed - I always saw him kind and attentive to his mother; I never heard him speak an angry word to her - I have received the money from the Saving's-bank; I found the document which enabled me to do so on the premises; it appeared to me that the parties had been there to ransack the house as well as destroy her.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.What kind of a document was this? A. It was a book, and was in the same box with her leases - I have administered, or should not have got the money; I have five brothers and sisters, two by the first marriage, and three by the last.</p>

            . I am apprenticed to the prisoner. On Wednesday, the 9th of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock, he told me I was to go with him to do a job, but I did not know when I went out where I was going- he took me to his mother's house, Lisbon-street, Dog-row; he knocked twice, and the second time the door seemed to open a little, and then he went in and called Mother! mother! - I was outside the door, about two feet from it, on the pavement; I could see into the room, and saw blood on the floor - he told me afterwards that it was blood; I should not have known it was blood - it was a yellowish cast; he first said Mother! mother! then said,"Oh, God! my mother is murdered, run and get assistance" - this was before he told me it was blood; it had a cloth upon it - he was not out of my sight all the while he was in the house; when he said "My mother is murdered," he was just on the near side of the blood, which lay close up to the cupboard, (here the witness pointed out, on a plan of the premises, the siluation where the prisoner entered); I could not see, where I was, whether the door leading to the adjoining room was open or shut - the door opens towards the outside of the shop; he never went out of the first room; he said, "Look there is the blood," and then I came away with him and went to the public-house - he then ran over to Mr. Cross at the chandler's shop, and spread an alarm about the neighbourhood; he sent me to the doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the prisoner in the room? A. It was so momentary I cannot tell - I should think about three minutes; I went to several doctors, could not find any, and at last went to the hospital and brought three - I waited outside the house some time, and then went about my job; I do not think the prisoner could have opened the door of the inner room without my seeing him, but I can hardly tell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say he knocked at the door twice, and the second time it seemed to open a little - how is that? A. It seemed to give a little to his knocking - he put his knee against it, and it flew open.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. About what size is this front room? I should think about ten feet square - I stood about two feet from the door, on a piece of pavement; I could see the blood quite plain, the door being open would throw light into the room.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. On Wednesday, the 9th of March, I was on duty in the Mileend-road, and was called on to go to Foster-street, Dogrow, between eleven and twelve o'clock, by a man named Stone - I found a few persons round the door; the window shutters were closed - I went into the room called the parlour; there was a large stain of blood between the fire-place and staircase in that room - the prisoner was about the centre of the room; I said nothing to him then; I heard him say twice that his mother was murdered - when I got to where the blood was, I could see into the kitchen, where the deceased lay; I went in - she was then laying in rather a reclining state, in the corner, between the door-post and the copper; her shoulders were against the corner, and nearly eighteen inches high from the floor - there was a cord suspended from the latch of the back door, and it hung down towards her head; it had been cut there - I saw she had a very severe blow on her forehead, and her face was nearly covered with blood; her lips were very black - I saw no other wound on her head; the wound appeared to have been infticted with a heavy jack-towel roller, which laid just by her side, and was nearly covered with blood; Dexter was in the room - he came as far as the door, but not into the kitchen, and requested that the body might remain in the state it was in, and the cord suspended from the latch.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he say or do? A. He was making a noise, and calling out that his mother was murdered - I then went with one of his sisters up stairs into the bedroom; a double chest of drawers there were open, and things scattered about - the whole place appeared completely ransacked, to see what property could be found; there was a small chest with linen in it, but I saw no papers - the prisoner did not accompany me up stairs; the sister told me what things were missing - I came down, and after being there a short time, asked Dexter "How long ago is it since you saw you mother last before this morning?" he said, "I have not been here for the last fortnight, and have not seen her;" I afterwards heard he had been there, and told him he must consider himself in custody - I took him to the station; I took a handkerchief off his neck, and at the corner of it there were two or three little specks of blood; I found no marks of blood on his clothes or shirt - there were several stains of blood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120059"></xptr>in his hat lining; I could not judge whether the specks of blood were fresh or not - I said, "Dexter, what is all this?" looking at the handkerchief; he gave me no answer whatever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Stone, I believe, came for you? A. Yes - he is a publican, but has left the house; he kept the Lord Collingwood, very near the deceased's house, in fact both houses join almost - here is the handkerchief; the specks of blood are at this corner - there were three specks of blood when I took it off; they might be produced by the prick of a pin, or in shaving - some of it may have rubbed off; I was before the Coroner, but not examined.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHOS. Q.It is more than two months since you saw the blood on the handkerchief? A. Yes - I have had it wrapped in paper since; here are several marks of blood visible on the hat - I gave my evidence at the Police-office, before the Coroner sat; the roller is here, that has marks of blood on it - the blood on that, the handkerchief, and hat, is faded a good deal.</p>

            . I live in Lisbon-street, very near the deceased's house. Between five and six o'clock on the evening before the Wednesday, on which this murder was discovered, the prisoner called on me to make inquiries about the deceased - I had seen him before, and knew his person, by his standing at his mother's door several times before; he asked me if I had seen the old lady at the broker's shop that day - I said No I had not; he said he thought it strange, seeing the house shut up, as he was in the habit of calling every day - nothing further passed; I wished him good night - this coversation was against my door; I was writing at the counter, and he came in -I could see part of the deceased's house at the time; it was shut up, and had been so all day - I saw the prisoner again next day, about eleven o'clock or later; he came and asked me if I would go over with him to see his mother, as she was in a fit, or otherwise dead - I refused at first, but he persuaded me and I went; when I went in he said, "It is not in this room, it is in the next one;" I could not see the body from the first room, unless I was so placed as not to be seen from the front door - this was about a quarter of an hour before Drew, the inspector, came; I cannot say whether any additional light had been let into the place - when I first went in it seemed very dark, but when I had been there some time it seemed a great deal lighter; I went to the door where I could see the body, and exclaimed, "Yes, it is right, that she is dead, and it appears that she has been dead some time;" I said I thought she had been murdered, as I saw the blood in the parlour as I passed through - those are the words I used; I said, "I think she has been murdered in this room (the parlour) and dragged from there into the kitchen," where I saw her - he exclaimed, "For God's sake, you don't say so!" clasping his hands together; I said, "Well, I must go to my business, I cannot stay any longer;" he said, "For God's sake don't leave me;" I was coming out - the front door opens against the wall; he turned round, pulled the door back, and said, "Look here, they have stopped the key-hole of the door up;" there was tow or something in the key-hole, but that could not be seen without pulling the door from the wall, unless you went behind the door, which is not likely - before I got to the door, I said, "Which way did you get into the house?" he told me how he got in - nothing was done about cutting the cord before I left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You say he came to you between five and six o'clock in the evening, and said, "The old lady at the broker's shop?" A. Yes, those were his words, but on the Wednesday he said, "Come with me to my mother's;" I was examined before the Coroner and the Magistrate - I did not state till Thursday, that Dexter was the man who called; that was after he was committed - I knew him by his standing at the door; I had seen him a great many times - I always said he called in the afternoon; I said I could not say whether the person who called was Dexter or not - I am sure I said it was in the evening; I did not say he had a basket on his head - I said I could not swear it was not Dexter; I told the Coroner I would not swear it was Dexter till I was obliged, and that I would sooner swear it was Dexter, than that it was not - I swear to him from his features; I had very little conversation with him, and cannot say about his voice - when he came on Wednesday a boy stood at the door; I cannot tell his name.</p>

I saw the deceased alive last on the Sunday before the Wednesday in question - she was drinking led with her daughter; I saw her in her room alive and well - on the Wednesday following, about five minutes to twelve o'clock, I heard of her death; I went to her house, and saw the prisoner there - he was standing on the step of his mother's door, directing a lad to go to Dr. Cane, of Whitechapel, and fetch him immediately; he then turned round to a man who was going towards the Collingwood, and said, "For God's sake come in here to me, somebody has been murdering my mother;" I entered the room - he went on before me, and as soon as he got up to his mother he said, "Here she is, here she is," before I could see her - she was laying in the kitchen; there was a copper on the left-hand side of her, a door at her back, and a line round her neck, suspended to the latch of the door- the prisoner then said, "She has either been murdered or has hung herself;" I said, "Oh, that woman has been murdered - see how she has been bent about the head;" Dexter said, "Oh, the wretches!" he said, "I will cut her down;" I said, "I would do no such thing;" he said, "Why not?" I said, "You have sent for Dr. Cane, and let her remain till some person comes and sees what state she is in;" I said, "Look at the blood laying here in the front room by the fire-place;" he made no answer, but said again, "I will cut her down;" I then left the room - I did not see her cut down; I felt ill at the sight, and went home - I did not ask how he found her dead; he did not say how he came to go to the house that morning.</p>

            . I live in Philip-street, St. Georges' in the East. On Wednesday, the 9th of March, I saw persons standing at the deceased's door, and went up - I saw Dexter with his foot on the door; I said, "What is the matter?" he replied that his mother had hung herself; I immediately shoved him aside, and said Where! I got into the room, saw her, took my knife out, and cut the cord, which was fastened round the neck - one end of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120060"></xptr>it was very long; it was twisted round, and fastened to the latch, and the other end round her neck - the body was sitting in the corner on the ground; but on my cutting the cord, which was tight, the head fell down, and a great explosion of wind came from her, by which I thought she was alive; the cord had kept her head upright - the prisoner said, "Stop, it is not my mother;" I said,"Stand on one side, gentlemen, and let him see;" then he looked and said, "Yes, it is my mother - my God! it is my mother:" I asked how he came into the house - he said he had been in the room before I had, and called out Mother! and that he went to the stairs and called out Mother! - but he had no occasion to call up the stairs for his mother, for he must have seen her if the door was in the same situation as it was when I entered; that is only my opinion - he could not get to the stairs without going by the door where the deceased lay; the room was light enough by the door she was suspended to- it had two or three panes of glass above, and the light comes down from what is called the black ditch, and showed her legs; he must have seen the body if the door had been open.</p>

            . I live in Foster-street, and am a dressmaker, when I have work - the house I live in joins the deceased's; I can hear the voices of persons in her house, but better up stairs than down - I have heard persons talking in her house; I heard a very great disturbance three times, and heard a man's voice; when I heard the prisoner's voice at Lambeth-street I recognized it - I never saw him near the house on those occasions; the first disturbance was in the Christmas week, but at what time I cannot say - it was between seven and eight o'clock at night, I think, but am not sure - I was up stairs, and heard some female halloo out "Let loose my hair - don't do what you have often threatened me, murder me;" she called out Murder! and with that I heard somebody pushed down stairs - it was the female, for I heard her squall, and then I heard the voice which sounded like Dexter's; it was just the same voice - he said he would either have money or the papers; she said she was not going to work for him to have the benefit of it while she lived - I do not know whose voice the female's was, but the man's voice I do know; I heard but two voices - I heard no more then; one night, about three weeks after, just after she had taken in her things from the door, (which I had not seen her do, but heard it, if she stirred her fire I could hear it) I heard a noise down stairs, but could hear a deal plainer up stairs; I heard footsteps of two people going up stairs- I went up stairs, listened against the wall, and heard something similar to what I heard before; it appeared as if he came for money, and she said he should have no more money, he had had enough; I heard no reply, but upon that the woman was knocked down, for she hallooed out, and somebody fell down stairs, as if she was shoved down, and then I heard the door of the house slam - I heard no more then; these quarrels were always at night - the last time was three weeks before the murder; I cannot tell the date - it was at night; there was a very heavy quarrel - I heard her say he should not have any more money from her, and she would not let him in if she knew it was him, she would not open the door; he said he would find plenty of ways if that was all - he would get up the ditch; there is a ditch at the back of the house - he then said,"Give me the papers, or I will do what I have threatened"- she said he was worse than a bad husband to her; I went down, and heard no more - I always thought she was quarrelling with her husband till one night, when I spoke to her.</p>

            ; I live with him, and sleep in the same bed with him - I am nineteen years old; I have done porter's work for the deceased, when I have had nothing to do -I have known the prisoner about nine months, and Mrs. Markham a good while. On the Sunday night before she was found murdered, I had been to my mother's; it was just upon dusk, while I was in the street, near the Collingwood, I saw Dexter and another man; I am quite sure Dexter was one of them - I was going by, and another man at the same time; as I went by I heard Dexter say to the man he was talking to, "If I cannot have either money or goods, I will have her," and he said, "If I cannot get in any other way I will come up the black ditch;" and he said to the other man."So help you G-d, you won't deceive me;" the other man made some reply, which I could not understand, as his voice was so low - all I could hear was"No," and then the prisoner said, "There is one place I have a suspicion of money, and that is in the clock;" the prisoner raised his head higher, and said again, "So help you G-d, you won't deceive me, but meet me at the time;" I could not hear what the man answered - Dexter then raised his head up so that he could see me; I was standing between the two door-posts of Mrs. Markham's shop, listening to what they were talking of; he raised his head so that he could see me, and made a motion to the other with his head, to look at me standing there, and then Dexter said, "Enough said, good night;" as soon as I saw that he saw me, I pretended to be calling a dog, and on whistling my mother's dog ran up to me; I went home to my master's - he was in bed when I got there, and while I was undressing I said something to him about what I had seen and heard - I went to my mother's on the Monday evening, a little after ten o'clock, for some money that was due to my master; he had sent me for it - I am sure it was Monday night; when I went by Bethnal-green new church the clock struck something, but I do not know what, and at my mother's door the clock struck - I looked at a public-house clock, and it was about ten; I knocked at my mother's door, and she opened the window - I just saw her, but she did not speak to me; she was in bed - I hallooed out "Never mind," and went away; she lives about fifty yards from Mrs. Markham's, but not in sight of her house - I passed Mrs. Markham's as I came back, and saw Dexter coming out of his mother's door, with a bed on his right shoulder; I saw nobody else - I am as sure it was him as that I see you now; I heard of Mrs. Markham's death on Wednesday morning, and said something to my mother on the subject; when I heard of her death I knocked at the door, and asked for West, the Policeman; I did not see the prisoner there - it was about ten o'clock at night I saw West - I told him part of what I knew of the matter, entirely of my own accord; I went with West before the Coroner and Justice.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, of St. Mary, Whitechapel. I was called in on Thursday, the 10th of March, to see the body of the deceased, and made a written statement of the examination, (reads) - I found two mortal wounds on the top of the head, at the back part, with fractures of the bone, penetrating the brain about a quarter of an inch; the large wound on the left was the fracture of the posterior superior part of the parallel line, forcing in a circular portion in fragments, about two inches in diameter, which perforated the membrane and penetrated the substance of the brain - the smaller wound was to the right; it had also fractured and forced in a portion of a bone, about an inch diameter, in a circular form, also penetrating the brain - there was a slight contusion of the right eye-brow, and marks of pressure on the fore part of the neck at the sides, but not extending to the back of the neck, and an indentation on the right side; it had the appearance of a rope having been tied- the indentation I suppose to be where the knot had been; on the 11th of March I stripped the body, and could not discover any other mark of violence or appearance of injury - I have no doubt her death was occasioned by the wounds and fractures, either one of which was sufficient of itself to produce death, by pressure on the brain; I should imagine the indentation in the neck was not the cause of her death, because she did not exhibit the appearance of having died from strangulation - if the cord had been tied round her neck when alive, there would be a mark to show it, which there was not; I should suppose it had been applied to her neck after her death - I am satisfied she could not have destroyed herself.</p>

On Monday, the 7th of March, I was at the Swan public-house, Whitechapel, between five and six o'clock- it was getting dusk; the prisoner came in there about six, or a little after; there were other persons there, and there was ajoke about a woman who Knowles was going to be married to, and something was said about a parcel, in con<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120064"></xptr>sequence of which I went out with Dexter for twenty minutes or half an hour - I do not know how long it was after he came there; we went to Mr. Knight's, an oilman, and there he got a piece of brown paper - we went from there to his house in Five Inkhorn-court, and made a parcel of it, tied it up, and directed it for a joke; we left there and went to the Elephant and Castle, kept by Mrs. Graham - we did not stay there more than ten minutes, then returned to the Swan; Dexter had not left me at all in that time - we had been from the Swan twenty minutes of half an hour - when we returned, the parcel was produced; Knowles was there then, and some gin was had - I left the Swan about nine o'clock, and left Dexter there; he had not left my company all that time - I presented myself for examination before the Coroner and the Magistrate, and gave this statement.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.It was between five and six o'clock when he first came to the Swan, and it was then growing dusk? A. Yes, I never looked at the clock - it was not dark; I cannot call it dark till between seven and eight o'clock - it was between six and seven when I went out with him; it was not right dark then - I cannot say whether the oilman had lights; the direction was written at Five Inkhorn-court, by the light of the Heavens - I cannot say whether I mentioned getting the brown paper before the Coroner; I cannot say on what day I went there - I was not hindered from going; I saw Drew there.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you any particular reason for observing the time you went away? A.

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say he was not absent a quarter of an hour, did he go out then? A. He might, but not to my knowledge; but nature will call a man to go out at times, but it did not, to my knowledge.</p>

            . Mrs. Kean is my sister. On the 6th of January, Twelth-day, I was with her at my mother's, and that evening there was a quarrel between me and Mrs. Kean - she got a warrant out against me in consequence of it.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. That was not in the Christmas week? A. No; we quarrelled down stairs; I did not threaten to murder her - no words of that kind were mentioned; I said nothing about papers or money, or any thing of that sort - it was a quarrel between her husband and me, and she took it up; it was about eleven o'clock at night, after supper - my mother was there, but not the prisoner; there were only three of us.</p>

             re-examined. I never saw Clemminger or Garniss in my life, to my knowledge, till now - I attended the Inquest, and was particularly attentive to the Coroner and Jury, but I was not at the door, and had nothing to do with it; Clemminger did not apply to me to be examined, nor did I refuse him, saying he could do no good; nor did any woman apply to me, nor did I refuse any woman - I sent one or two persons up, who were sent down again by the parish authorities.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Who were they? A. One was a constable; I only know one that was refused - I did not say it was two; I never went to Bruin or Reader to try and prevent their coming here - I went to Reader's house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120065"></xptr>and asked if he knew Dexter, on the Wednesday night that he was taken; I went to him again on the Sunday following, with a brother inspector - I did not state that he could know nothing about it, because he was up stairs, nor any such thing, to any body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the first battalion of Cold-stream Guards. On Wednesday night, 21st Jan., I was in the Walworth-road—a house was on fire there—I rendered what assistance I could to put the fire out—I was at that time wearing my Crimean medal and the Sebas<lb></lb>topol clasp—after the fire was put out, I went across to a public house to have something to drink—while I was there I saw the prisoner—after having something to drink, I proceeded towards my home, and when I had got about 300 or 400 yards I was seized from behind by two men, and thrown on my back in the road, and my medal disappeared—I saw it on the 23rd in the possession of the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How long was it before you lost your medal that you had seen me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty minutes or half an hour—I was. not unbuttoning my coat and wanting to fight persons.</p>

On the night in question, near 8 o'clock, I saw the prisoner outside the White Hart public house—he was about three feet from the prosecutor—I noticed that the prosecutor had his medal on him then—I saw him go away up the road, and the prisoner close behind him, with another man.</p>

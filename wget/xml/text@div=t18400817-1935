The prisoner was nearly two years in my em<lb></lb>ployment, and went out with messages and newspapers to meet my son at different offices—I frequently employed him to take money from me to my son—on the 11th of February he said, "William wants 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." which was his usual way of addressing me—I gave him two sovereigns, and then he ought to have come down with evening papers—but instead of seeing him, my son came down, and I found he had not been to my son—I gave him the sovereigns, believing my son had told him to ask me for them.</p>

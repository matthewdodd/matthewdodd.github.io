                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 17, Mount-street, Lan<lb></lb>beth. I was called to deceased on—4th Sept.—she was labouring under sipelas—I saw her once on Monday, twice on Tuesday, and once on Wednes-day, and on Thursday she died—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination company—with Mr. Smith, the medical officer of the parish—erysipe lasthe immediate cause of death—the scalp was rather soft: that would in serous effusion, which would be the result of previous inflammation—I think that erysipelas, acting on a feeble frame in a broken-up constitution, the sequence of intemperate habits, with a tendency to delirium tremens, was the immediate cause of death—I found a lacerated wound at the back of head, and a contusion about the size of a half-crown—they were probably the result of two injuries; a broken brick would be likely to produce the one and any obtuse substance the other—there were contusions about the and eyes—I think all these circumstances together were sufficient to produce erysipelas—I should say it was produced by violence—I do not attribute: to the blow on the back of the head, but more to the contusions about the face and temple—it certainly might be produced by intemperate habits alone—I think the violence would necessarily accelerate it—erysipelas might not have ensued immediately on the violence—if it had existed for three weeks, I should have expected to find suppuration, but there was none—I think it had commenced four or five days previously.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you send him a letter in answer to that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and received from him the following letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"17th of May. Sir,—Since your pre<lb></lb>vious letter, I have had an opportunity of making the requisite inquiries re<lb></lb>specting you, which are so satisfactory, I do not hesitate to enclose my draft on you for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I shall wish you to get endorsed by some respectable party in your own neighbourhood; and I hereby agree to renew the same from time to time for twelve months. When you return the acceptance, have the kindness to say through what bank you would wish the money to be paid, and it shall be remitted to you by the next post, less three months interest, at the rate of eight per cent. per annum. Trusting it may be of some service to you, I am, Sir, &amp;c., John Bull. P. S. You must furnish me with the address of the party who indorses the bill, and the same must be made payable in London")—I received in that letter a bill, wrote my name under<lb></lb>neath the drawer's, which is the way they do in Scotland, and got my bro<lb></lb>ther, Andrew Alexander, to write his name across it on the face of it, as an indorsement—we both understood it was a legal bill, and that it would go perfectly safe—I enclosed it in a letter addressed to the prisoner, and posted it—on the 21st of May I received this letter from the prisoner, in which there was another bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by him—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"May 21st, 1847. Mr. John Alexander. Dear Sir,—I am pleased with your punctuality and atten<lb></lb>tion to business. I duly received your enclosure this morning, but am sorry to say it is neither accepted nor endorsed in the proper manner, at all events</p>

               <p>for a legal security; if you will refer to my letter, you will perceive I wished it made payable at London. You must excuse my being particular, but in matters of this kind I am obliged to be. I have enclosed you another draft, with a form in, which must be accepted and endorsed, on the receipt of which I will remit the amount through Messrs. Jones, Lloyd, and Co., to the Commercial Bank of Scotland, to be placed to your account. I shall not be at all particular about the whole being repaid in twelve months, so long as the interest is regularly paid. I shall be very glad to make your acquaint<lb></lb>ance when you come to London; meanwhile believe me, dear Sir, yours very truly, John Bull. As the other acceptance is not available, I shall get it exchanged for a fresh stamp at the stamp-office")—In consequence of that letter, I accepted the second bill, according to the way described in the letter, had it endorsed, and sent it, directed to Mr. John Bull, as before—I never received any answer—the instrument I sent was to be substituted for the other bill—I did not provide the stamp for it—it struck me that he was a downright straight-forward man, and I did not know the difference between the English and Scotch law—he said he would either destroy it or get 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the stamp—I thought he detained the first bill in order to get the stamp allowed—it was not my 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid for the stamp—I do not know whether I was to pay for it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a drug and general broker in Great St. Helen's.

               <p>to him to write to Mr. Alexander to substitute another bill for it, and I would give him an undertaking to return the first one—he subsequently asked me not to part with the bill to anybody unless for the whole amount for which it was drawn.</p>

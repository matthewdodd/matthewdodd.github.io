            Then, if I understand you right, you took four back in all, you did not take the fifth back? - No. At that moment that he was going to give me the sixpence, he had five of my shillings, and I had got four of his in my hand, and he was going to give me sixpence, at that time a person named March came out of his own shop, and asked me if I was sure the prisoner gave me good money, and wished me to give it him, which I did out of my hand; he told me there were one or two very bad ones; he took and collared the man, and took him into the shop, and I followed him, and these five shillings that I gave to the man, my husband gave me about five minutes before I left home, and they were all the silver I had in my pocket.</p>

               <p>I am a fishing tackle-maker, in Fleet-street. On the 15th of January last, between one and two o'clock, I was sitting in my back parlour at dinner, and I observed this lady bargaining for some oranges with that man, and when she had bargained with him for the oranges, she gave him a piece of money, which I believe was a shilling; he took it into his hand, and then put it to his mouth and gave it a bite, and then returned, as I thought it was the same; she held out her hand to him and gave him another; he then tried that on the sleeve of his coat, and returned that; she then gave him a third and then a fourth; it then struck me he was playing some trick or other, and I went to the door and asked the lady if she was positive the shillings he returned into her hand were the shillings that she gave him? she said she did not know; and I immediately took the shillings out of her hand, and dragged him into the house, and the lady came in after him; I searched him in order to see if he had any more about him, and I found one bad sixpence, and three or four good shillings he dropped out of his mouth, and six and sixpence good about him, and these four I took out of the lady's hand were all bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So that six and sixpence, and the three shillings you describe to have been in his mouth, were all good, only one bad sixpence out of the number.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Look at the good shillings and see if you made any observations on them you gave to your wife? - I cannot say to one of them; I presume them I gave to my wife were all good.</p>

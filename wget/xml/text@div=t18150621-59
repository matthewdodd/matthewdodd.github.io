Moody came up to me and said he was going to get a drop of rum, and I might as well have a shilling or two as not; he then walked up the basin side, and said, go you to your post, I have got a fellow here, that will get a drop in no time; he then went up the side of the Basin, towards the guard room, and in two or three minutes he returned in company with another man, whom I knew by sight not by name. The man seemed afraid of me, but Moody said, you be not afraid of him, because I know him very well. They then went and hauled the boat away from where she was, opposite the guard house, and there the other man went on board the boat, and was there about three quarters of an hour; Moody said, he was a d - d long while about it. He then handed two bladders to me while Moody was by him, I don't know whether they were full; the man brought one or two in his hand. When they came on shore, I asked them how they were going to get rid of it; one of them said they would get it over the wall: they put one of the bladders underneath the slider, and then went over the wall with the rest, I permitting them. I saw no more of them until they came back, and then Moody gave me ten or twelve shillings in three shilling pieces. We then went and sit down in a box, and there was a drop drawn off to drink; one of the constables came by at the time, and the prisoner proposed to let him drink; he sat down with us, and drank with us. Another constable came, and he drank with us also. We then seperated, and Moody proposed to get a drop more for ourselves; the same man went again, and got some more, and they gave me some in a skin.</p>

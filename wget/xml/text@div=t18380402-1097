                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the employ of Seth Smith. I produce some pieces of leaden pipe, molten lead, and solder, found in Carr's house—on the 20th of March I looked into a bag of Holden's and found a hammer, which I produce—I have compared that hammer with the marks on this leaden pipe—they exactly correspond—I know</p>

               <p>Holden was in the habit of using such a hammer—I have a ladle, which is one that Woodfield, the foreman, had used at Mr. Smith's premises—the solder fits the ladle—this ladle was used on Mr. Smith's premises, and this molten lead fits it—there are dents in it which correspond—here is another ladle used on our premises, and this lead corresponds with it—I was pretest when this lead and things were found at Carr's house, down below—we have brought the ladle from Mr. Smith's to match with it—I have compared several pieces of pipe with the hammer—here are two pieces of lead which match with the piece I produced on the last trial—these two pieces were found up stairs—I am confident that lead was on my master's premises on the morning of the 16th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Thursday, the 15th, I received information from Fitzgibbon, and on the 16th I watched Buckingham from the building at the corner of Wilton-crescent, Belgrave-square, belonging to Mr. Smith—I saw Buckingham and Holden come out together—I followed them along Belgrave-mews—Holden went into a public-house, and Buck<lb></lb>ingham went into Carr's shop—that was about twelve o'clock—I heard Buckingham ask Mrs. Carr if Mr. Carr was at home—she said he was not—he was going away, and we took him into custody—after taking him to the station-house we took Holden, a little before one o'clock, and afterwards went to Carr's house—when we went in Mr. Carr came into the shop—we asked him about apiece of sheet lead which was produced on the last trial—we asked him if he had any other place where he kept lead—he said all the sheet lead he had was in the shop—he gave us no answer about any other lead—I went down into the cellar, and found a great quantity of sheet lead doubled up, and also cuttings of leaden pipe and solder—I found all that I have brought here—there were scales in the cellar—I afterwards went up stairs, and found the sheet lead in the cistern—I heard part of the conver<lb></lb>sation between Thatcher and Carr—I cannot say I heard it all.</p>

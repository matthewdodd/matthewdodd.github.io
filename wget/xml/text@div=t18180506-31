On the 21st of April, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to Fore-street; on my return I went up stairs. When I got half way up, I heard some person in my bed-room - I thought I had not left the key in the door - I felt, and found it in my pocket. I looked up, and saw a woman at the door; I asked her what she wanted? she said she had been to the shoemaker's in the garret to get her shoe mended. I told her I had no lodgers in my house, and suspected she had robbed me. She put her hands on my stomach, and tried to throw me down stairs - I caught hold of the banisters with one hand, held her petticoats with the other, and called my husband, who came to my assistance and took her.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get in - A. With a false key - I saw it in the door. She had moved the cash-box and another box off the drawers, close by the door, ready to take away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I have no lodgers. The street-door was left open. There is a half-hatch, which was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Any person could open it - A. Yes. I was gone out about a quarter of an hour. I had moved the boxes out of the cupboard on to the drawers between ten and eleven o'clock - I am sure I did not put them behind the door. The prisoner was locking the door when I caught her. I could see the marks of her feet in the room, which had been cleaned that day.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness. I was at home while my wife was out. The spring of the half-hatch was broken - I sat in the counting-house. When my wife returned she called me; I ran up, and found the prisoner by the bed-room door, and my wife with the door in her hand, and a false key in the door. The prisoner said she had been up to the cobbler - I told her nobody lodged there. I took her into the counting-house, and gave her in charge. The boxes contained the money, notes and bills stated in the indictment.</p>

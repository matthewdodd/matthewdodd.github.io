             deposed, That Mary Ipsley hired her Cart, giving her 2 s. to carry the Corps to Eling; that a Boy drove the Cart, and that she was went along with it; that by the way the Horse fell down, upon which Mary Ipsley cried out, and she asked her what she was afraid of: she replied, she was afraid the Coffin would burst open; that she answered her again, suppose it had, what then? she hoped she had not buried the Corps naked: she replied, No, she had buried it in a white Mantle . She added, that she said it was a Woman who died in a Convulsion-Fit, but she said nothing of a Child. Mr. Tille, the Curate of Eling, deposed he gave the Clerk Orders that when any Persons were to be buried to let him know of it before hand, that he might be in the way; that there were two Children to be buried the 30th of December, and he having been invited to ne that Day with the Church Warden of Brentford, he desired him to let him know when they would be ready and he would be there as soon as they, and that the Overseer of Brentford and his Wife dined there also; that after Dinner he went to Eling, and the Children being brought there to be buried, he looked behind him and saw a Coffin in a Cart, upon which he asked the Clerk from whence it came: he answered, from Tumble-down Dick's at Brentford. He then asked the Clerk if there was a Grave ready for it, he answered him there was one almost ready; he enquired if the had gone for it, and was answered No. he then enquired of the Prisoner who the Person to be buried was; he answered Wife that came to her House the last night, and was taken with a very violent Fit, and continued in it till she died. He said that was a little odd. He asked her if she had acquianted the Church-warden or Overseen of the Poor with it, The answered she had: he asked her if she was sure of it, the fact she had acquainted them with it; he asked when, she replied about 2 or 3 Hours ago: he asked her again if she was she had , she then snapped at him, saying, don't I tell you so? That then he answered her it was false, for he had been for 4 Hours at the Church-warden's House, was at Dinner there , and the Overseen was at Dinner with him there, and if so he should have heard of it. Then she made him no Answer He then told her, I much suspect you, I will see the Corps: she replied to him, can you answer that? he made answer, I can't tell whether I can or no, but however I will try for once: With that she came and whispered him, telling him in the Ear, she died of a very bad Distemper , she is all over full of Plague Spots ; that then he replied, let it be Pox or Plague, he did not fear; he was in the way of his Duty, and with the help of God he would see. Then she came to him again, and said, to tell you the Truth she has no Shroud on: to which he replied, the more Breast you then, and sent for Tools to open the Coffin, and desired what Woman were present to inspect the Corps, and also that the Men would withdraw at a distance, and that he himself stood at some distance from it, but observed how Mary Ipsley behaved her self: and when the top of the Coffin was railed at the Head and about half open, she ran to it, put her Hand into the Coffin, took the Corps hold about the Head or Neck and shook it: he asked what that was for, and she answered to make her purge and ink them all out of the Church. That after the Women had viewed it, he was informed that the Corps was indeed stark Naked , as when born, and that they saw Marks of Violence and barbarous Usage; and that there was also a young Child in the Coffin.

            , the Clerk deposed, That on the 30th of December, about 3 Hours before the Corps came, a Woman came from Tumble down Dick's at Brentford, and order'd him to make a Grave for a Woman, who was a Pensioner's Wife who had died at her Mistress's, he asked her why she did not send to have the Bell ring, the Woman answered she did not know; that he made the Grave and the Corps was brought, and that Mr. Tiller talking with him about it, he said he was in a strange hurry of Mind, and am taken with a Trembling and so strange, I can't tell what is the atter with me , I wish this Woman is not murdered, I will have the Coffin opened before I bury her; That when the Minister would have the Coffin opened she told him the Deceased had the Plague and flunk, and was so nasty that it was not fit to be seen.

             deposed , That Mr. Tillet asking Mary Ipsley when the Woman died, she answered, the Night before: then he asked her why she buried it so soon, that she replied she died of the Pox and the Plague, and she stank so she was not able to bear her in the House: that they afterwards opened the Coffin, and Mary Ipsley thrust in her Hand, as had been before related: that they found the Corps naked, and a Child at the End of the Coffin, lying under the Deceased's Feet, one side of her Head was bruised, and her Hair was matted with Blood, and Blood came out of one Ear and one Nostril, and she had received much more Damage than is usual below, and was not ragged but seemed to have been cut, for the length of an Inch or more. There was no Spots on the Woman's Body, but a clean Corps from head to foot: there was a Call over the Face of the Child, one of the Women pulled it off, and there was no Nose, but what was flat, even with the Face, only two Nostrils did appear. This was also confirmed by Mrs. Floyd, Mrs. Prestons, a Midwise , deposed the same with the other Women, adding, that the Blood stood in the Left Ear of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171804230006"></xptr> Deceased ready to run, that there were two places on each side her Mouth looked as if they had been hurt, and from her Shoulder to her Elbow as if there had been hard Gripes, a very great Bruise on the Right side of her Belly, and that there was such a Vacancy that no Child ever made in a Woman by its Birth; that the Call being taken from over the Child's Face, the Nose was flat, the Nostrils of the Child Bloody, and the Blood flew out of the Child's Mouth in a Bladder, and there was a Bruise on the Child's Head and the right side of the Neck, and that the Child was at its full Time, and that upon the whole she did not believe that Life of the Woman and Child went out by the common Course of Nature. Mrs. Banister confirmed what the other Evidences had said; and deposed it was her Opinion, that the Deceased had been cut, for that no Woman ever received so much Damage, or could, by the Birth of a Child; and that the Child had no Nose only Nostrils, and was as flat as the back of the Hand. Mrs. Levings, another Midwife, also confirmed what the other Evidences had said; and added, she did belived the Woman was ded dry, because she never purged in the Coffin first nor last.

               <p>Mary Ipsley pleaded in her defence, that the Deceased came to her House on the Monday before Christmas-day in a very poor Condition, and desired she might lodge there that Night, but she refused to let her, till by the Persuasion of some Men who were drinking there she did; that the Deceased said she would go to London early the next Morning; that about 9 a Clock the next Morning she sent to call her, but no answer was made and wondering at it, they went up to see, and found her in a Fit; that she got Geneva and robbed her Temples, got Sack and Black Cherry Water, and her Teeth being set they could not get it down her Throat; that some time after she seemed to be a little recovered by lying still, but soom after she fell into another Fit, and so continued all Day on Wednesday, on Thursday she fell into her Fits again, and continued in and out of them all Thursday, and so Friday and Saturday; and she never heard her speak from the Night she came till she died; and on Sunday Morning a Woman that came with her from Windsor, and tended her as a Nurse, went up Stairs to see how she did, and came down in a Fright and said she was in Labour; they went up immediately, and both she and the Child were Dead, the Child being born dead.

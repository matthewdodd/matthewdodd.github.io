On the 17th of November, I was standing in my shop, and saw a man at my window; I looked very hard at him, as I thought he meant to rob me - I went and removed every thing from the door; I then shut too my folding-doors, and lighted the gas; I went into my parlour and sat down - I then saw my shop-door very gently open; I rose up expecting it was a customer, went forward and saw a man stooping down, taking some plates; he ran away - I went to the door, and cried Stop thief! and then I saw the prisoner. (who was the man I first saw at the window) standing at Dr. Sharpe's, four doors from my house - Dr. Sharpe's boy came and asked what was the matter; I said I had been robbed again - he went and told his master, who sent for an officer. I described the man I had seen at my window - he came and brought these eight plates the next day, which, from the pattern, I believe to be mine; I have no mark on them - I did not see any thing in the prisoner's hand in the street; I first saw him between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This young man has a brother has he not? A. Yes, and he is like him; I do not know whether any thing was found upon the prisoner - I had not seen him before, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen his brother before? A. No; I saw him at the office, and their hair is alike - I do not think it possible I could mistake the one for the other.</p>

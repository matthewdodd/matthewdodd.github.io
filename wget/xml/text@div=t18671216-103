I am carman to the prosecutors—on 3rd December I received six water-closets to be delivered to Collins and Co., 2 and 3, King's Place, Borough, with certain directions—when I got to Stones End, which is opposite King's Place, I saw the prisoner—he was dressed like a plasterer—I told him I had got six water-closets, and I had got to take the money—he said, "All right, get them out"—he helped me to get them out of the cart, and said, "I will pay you"—another man assisted us, and I delivered them at King's Place—the prisoner said, "Jump up, we must drive to Mr. Collins's office in Cannon Street"—he jumped up into my cart, and we went to 118, Cannon Street—he went in, and I followed him to the place—he then said, "I have made a mistake, I have come to the wrong place"—we came down and looked in several doorways to see if we could see the name of Collins—he said that he had only been to the place twice, and he forgot where it was—he looked into a public-house opposite, and said that that was the house he used, but we did not find him—the prisoner said that his workshops were in Blackfriars Road, and if I went there there would most likely be some one there who would pay me—I went with him to Green and Collins's, Blackfriars Road—he asked a woman if Mr. Collins was in—she said, "No, he has not lived here for two years"—he told her that it was wrong—she said that she had lived there two years, and she was certain he had not lived there—I told him I must have the closets back, and drove off to King Street to get them—he said that it was more than his place was worth to let me have them</p>

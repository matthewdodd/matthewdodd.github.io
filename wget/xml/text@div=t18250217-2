               <p>JAMES PLUCKNETT. I now live in Bartlett's-buildings. On Thursday, the 27th of January, I lived at the house of my brother-in-law, James Helps, No. 21, <placeName id="t18250217-2-crimeloc7">Cummins-street, Pentonville</placeName>

I went to bed on that night about half-past twelve o'clock, and was the last person up - I was in care of the house; only Noe, (the servant,) and myself were in the house: she went to bed before me. I did not particularly notice the back parlour window; but the girl called me about twenty minutes to eight o'clock in the morning: I then found the back parlour window shutter forced off its hinges - the hinge was fresh broken. I had heard a little noise about half-past one or two o'clock in the morning, as if something was moving about below. When I got up I missed the weather-glass, a tea-caddy, a swing dressing-glass, a few volumes of the Quarterly Review, belonging to Mr. Helps - a great coat, an umbrella, a prayer book, and a neck handkerchief, of my own - they were taken from different rooms. The weather-glass and tea-caddy were produced at Bow-street on Saturday, when the prisoners were in custody - also a pair of gloves and a handkerchief of mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LUCASEY. Q. The weather-glass is not yours? A. No; but I know it by its general appearance - I have no doubt of it. I had put tea and sugar in the caddy that evening - it contains the same quantity, and one of the inside divisions opens very hard. I had often observed the cut glass bason which is in it. They were in my care.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Helps. On the night of the robbery I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock - I fastened the house up between five and six; I fastened the back room window. I got up between seven and eight o'clock in the morning - it was light. I found the back parlour door open, the window up, and the right hand bottom shutter broken - every thing was in disorder. I called Mr. Plucknett, and we missed the property as he has stated - it did not appear that the thieves had been up stairs, but into the back and front parlour. I have known the barometer for years.</p>

            . I am servant at Mr. Dales, at the Thistle and Crown, public-house, St. Martin's-lane. The prisoners came into the house to breakfast, about half-past eight o'clock on Friday morning, about three weeks ago; when they came in they gave me the weather-glass and tea-caddy to take care of till the afternoon, when they would call for them; both gave me something, but which each gave me I cannot say. Lucasey came about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, and asked if Moses was down stairs - I understood him to mean the other prisoner - I said No; Wood came in in about half an hour, and both went up stairs to the parlour, to play at bagatelle; they had been at the house twice before - they went up of their own accord, and had a pint of beer. I went up stairs to stir the fire, and when I came down I told the constable that they were the young men who came in the morning - he apprehended them in half an hour. The tea-caddy and weather-glass were left in my master's care. They did not ask for their things; the officer had been to the house in the afternoon, and seen the things - he told me to let him know when the prisoners came again. I am sure they are the men.</p>

            . I am a constable. In consequence of information I and Lack went to this house, about half-past one o'clock on Friday, the 28th of January, and saw the weather-glass, and tea-caddy. I informed the Magistrate, who told us to wait till they came - I staid there till five o'clock, then went home, and Haffron fetched me - Lack was there; we went up stairs, and found them alone - we said we were officers, and asked them where the things were, not mentioning; what things; Lucasey said they had bought them, and sold them - Wood must have heard him. I asked where they were; they said, "They are here," meaning in the house. I found a tin box and a pair of gloves in Lucasey's pocket.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the public-house with Donaldson - his account is correct. I searched Wood, and found a handkerchief on him, with part of the name cut out, and some money. When I entered the room I asked them what they had done with the weather-glass and tea-caddy, which they had in the morning - Wood said they had sold them; I asked how he came by them: he said he bought them of a man in Princes-street, Drury-lane, and had sold them again. He afterwards turned round and said, "I have left them at this house;" all this was in the hearing of Lucasey - one of them said the man who they bought them of was a stranger. After they were examined I took the barometer to the prosecutor's house, and it fitted to the mark on the wall as complete as possible, in size, length, and breadth, and the mark of the nook behind.</p>
               <p>MR. PLUCKNETT. I have not the slightest doubt of the barometer, and should think it worth 1 l. at least - it exactly fitted the marks on the wall. I am certain of the tea-caddy - I had filled it with tea and sugar about half-past ten o'clock that night, and I find precisely the same quantity in it. The gloves found on Lucasey are mine, and I lost a tin box similar to this. I believe the handkerchief to be mine - I can trace the top of the letter P still on it; the rest is cut out.</p>
               <p>JANE NOE. I know the barometer by the maker's name, and its general appearance - my master had had it four years. I know the tea-caddy, and have cleaned the shell in it for the last nine years.</p>


               <p>The prisoners jointly put in a written Defence, as follows: -</p>
               <p>My Lord, we have been acquainted for many years, and were school-fellows together. On the 27th of January we were drinking together, and got intoxicated - we went home and slept at the house of Mrs. Wood; we got home about half-past ten o'clock, and did not leave the house till half-past seven next morning - we proceeded from home (John Wood being a <rs id="t18250217-2-deflabel8" type="occupation">cooper</rs>

We found the caddy locked, and asked the man for the key - he said he had lost it. We shook it, and found it sounded as it something was in it - he said it was only the glass. We left the house, and proceeded to leave the things at the Thistle and Crown, a house we had been in the habit of frequenting for the purpose of playing at bagatelle, and asked to leave the things there till evening, as we were going on our business. We returned again about five o'clock, and went up stairs to play at bagatelle as usual; the landlord came up, and we asked him if he had the things safe - he said he had: he had been down but a few minutes when the two officers came up and asked Lucasey how he came by the property; he said he had bought them - they then asked what had become of them - he said he had sold them; the reason for which was, he thought they had no right to ask such a question, not knowing them to be officers, but immediately they said who they were he said they were in the house.</p>

               <p>"Received for three payments for licence by me, J. Smith;" he told her if you will send your girl with me to the Excise Office, I will give you the 3 s. in change, the girl followed him so close, he tried to get rid of her; at last he gave her the change, he gave her three shillings, the girl went home, soon after this Beardmore applied to the Excise office, and upon producing this receipt, it appeared to be very manifest it was not any person belonging to the Excise office, or that was entitled to receive it; Beardmore desired therefore that Mrs. Palmer might attend; they attended, and when they came, there was some suspicions arose on the prisoner at the bar, from his known character and situation in the office; and being shewn among other persons, Mrs. Palmer, together with the girl, immediately pitched on the man, as the man who had been there pretending to be a clerk of the Excise, intitled to receive the money for this six weeks duty, and had given the receipt in the name of Smith; upon this the prisoner was committed for the offence, and having given a receipt for the payment of this sum of 18 s. You may well conceive that the Excise office would not on the consideration of so small a sum have taken up this prosecution, but it is a very material question to the revenue, and to the public in general, if persons employed under that office, who by being employed easily learn the different sums due, either from publicans, or other persons, liable to pay duties, by this manoeuvre of theirs, knowing, as they must do frequently, that the sums are in arrear; if, by going to persons that owe the money, they get it, it becomes a very serious thing to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178907080011"></xptr>the public; you see in this case, his having been an officer in the Excise he knew how to commit this fraud, because he knew very well that in general these publicans were sometimes in arrear in their payments, he knew likewise what was very true, that carrying these receipts in his pocket, would forward his design; says he, you see there are three receipts of the same kind; when persons are employed in this way it is necessary they should be careful of what is entrusted to them; he knew perfectly well the whole manner of conducting this business, he knew he could by an artful tale impose on the publicans, and by that defraud the public and the revenue; he knew perfectly well that the Excise office always give receipts with particular caution on the back of the licences, he to avoid that gives it on a distinct piece of paper; if there was any doubt of his not knowing the fraud, why go by a false name? his name was not Smith, his name was Sutton; he had represented himself as an officer of Excise under that name, that name was made use of to avoid detection. Gentlemen, the facts I have opened to you lie in a very narrow compass: his going and his pretending to be an officer; his writing a receipt: for it is not left as a vague uncertain point, who wrote the receipt; he himself wrote the receipt in the name of Smith; so I shall prove that his name is not Smith, but Sutton; where then can be the doubt but he was conscious at the time of being guilty of forgery, and endeavouring to defraud the publican of 18 s.? Gentlemen, in this great town, these frauds amount to very large sums indeed. The revenue is defrauded by a number of tricks by those persons that ought to protect them, and when found out it becomes a serious question indeed, because that confidence that is placed in them makes an exemplary punishment necessary: Gentlemen, I shall prove these facts, which seem to be very short, and when I have done that, it will become your duty to pronounce the prisoner guilty of the charge, as laid in the indictment.</p>

               <p>What passed? - He asked me if Mr. Beardmore was at home; I told him he was not; he asked me when I thought he would be; I told him it was uncertain; he told me that our six weeks licence was deficient, and the payments were due, it was not paid up; he said he was sent from the office, that he was a clerk there, and if it was not paid, it was one hundred pounds penalty, and five pounds if it was not paid that forenoon; I told him my uncle said that it was of no consequence, for it was to be paid up when he renewed his licence, all together; he said it was no such thing, for it was dangerous if it was not paid then, or something of that kind. He asked me if he could see the licence; I told him I could fetch it; I fetched it down, and wished him to write on the back of the licence; he shewed me his pocket book, and told me I need not think he was a deceiver, for by that I might know he was come from the office; so I fetched the licence down, and gave him the money; I wished him to write on the back of the licence, but he refused; I gave him two half guineas, the money due was 18 s. for three payments; he said it was of no use to write on the back of the licence, so he wrote on a bit of paper, and said my uncle might take that when he went to the office, and it would answer the same; that what was wrote on the back of the licence must be done at the office.</p>
               <p>Look at that paper? - That is the paper he wrote, which I afterwards gave to Mr. Law.</p>
               <p>After you had given the two half guineas, and he wrote that, what did he do afterwards? - I told him I had no change, and he said he had none; I had a little girl in the room going of thirteen, and he said if I would send her with him, he would send the change back.</p>

               <p>How soon after did you see him? - I saw him on the Tuesday following at the Excise-office; I am sure that is the man that wrote that receipt, and to whom I paid the guinea; my little girl went with him and brought the change.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see that man at Mr. Beardmore's house in June? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The Bunch of Grapes is the sign of the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go with him from the Bunch of Grapes to any place, and for any purpose? - Yes, for change for a guinea; he went into four public houses first.</p>
               <p>Did he give you any change at last? - Yes, he gave me four six-pences and a shilling, I brought back the money to Mr. Beardmore's house; I am sure that is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Law. Was you at the office at the time the prisoner was taken into custody? - I was.</p>
               <p>Was the witness Palmer and this little girl there at this time? - They came just at that time, they were sent for and attended.</p>
               <p>Have you known the prisoner any length of time? - I do not know him at all, I do not know his name, I heard him answer to the name of Sutton.</p>
               <p>Court. What, when he was taken up? - When he was called for to the Board.</p>
               <p>Had he had any office in the excise? - I do not know, I will tell the story from the beginning.</p>
               <p>You must not tell us any thing that passed when he was at the office? - I have nothing to say; he had no authority that I know of to receive these payments; they are paid at the Excise-office, to the receiver-general's clerk.</p>

               <p>I am entirely innocent of any forgery whatever; and there is no person in the office whatever that is authorised to receive any licence, which I believe Mr. Law will acquaint you and the honorable Court.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. You have taken upon you in the indictment to describe this house by the sign of the Bunch of Grapes, and the licence is by the sign of the Grapes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. It only states it is known by the sign of the Bunch of Grapes, it does not state it is so.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Law. Do you know this house? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, the only evidence to serve me on this business, I subpoened today, and he will not be in town till tomorrow, which is one Mr. Davidson of London-wall; I have a wife and four children, and I hope for the mercy of the Court in my situation.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the prisoner seems to wish to point out to you that there was no person in the office of the name of Smith, entitled to receive the money, and that if he had signed Sutton, she would have paid him. To dispose of the first question, it does not in any degree alter the nature of the crime; the crime of forgery consists in making a false writing with intent to deceive or defraud another; and it is perfectly immaterial, considering this offence, whether the name that is written be that of a person in existence, or of a person that never existed in the world; if the name be false, that is all that is required; then upon that fact, and in order to see whether the name is false or not, it was necessary for them to prove that this receipt given by him, was given in a false way; in order to do that, they have proved to you, by two witnesses, that the prisoner's name is Sutton; if his name is Sutton, and he assumed another name, and signs this receipt by the name of Smith, it is a false receipt, it is a false writing, any name that he had made use of, which was not his name, makes it a false writing, and the very purpose for which a man makes use of another name, and not his own, is to deceive and to defraud; for it is to prevent detection; and if they had not known him by person, they never could have found out that he was the same man; he thinks fit to sign this receipt with the name of Smith; therefore there is no question, but that in point of law it is a false writing, which will constitute the offence of forgery, if it is done with intent to deceive. The next article is that it was immaterial whether he had used the name of Smith or his own name, namely that of Sutton; but that would make no difference in the offence, whatever his name had been, she said she would have paid the money, because she referred to that authority with which he pretended to be cloathed; for he came to her in the character of a clerk of the Excise-office; and if he was a clerk in that office, she giving credit to his report that he was so, it was perfectly immaterial whether his name was Sutton, Smith, or any thing else; therefore these two points will not serve the prisoner at all, if you believe the evidence, and are satisfied upon it; with respect to the intention it is laid in the indictment in different ways; first to defraud the King; secondly to defraud Mr. Beardmore; it is not worth an observation to state any distinction between them. The prisoner by means of this receipt did obtain the eighteen shillings; of which sum, if the receipt had passed genuine, the King would have been defrauded; if it turns out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178907080015"></xptr>afterward, and is detected as a forgery, the case is that Beardmore is defrauded, and must pay it over again. Gentlemen, if upon these facts you are satisfied that the prisoner gave this receipt in a false name, with intent to defraud, you will find him guilty; if not, you will acquit him.</p>

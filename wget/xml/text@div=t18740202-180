I am a labourer, and live at Old Town, Croydon—on 13th January, about 12.45 at night, I was in the Standard public-house, Woolwich—the prisoner was there—I left the Standard with a woman, and the prisoner followed me out—I walked about sixty or seventy yards with the woman, and the prisoner pushed the woman from me and struck me a violent blow on the cheek bone, which knocked me down and rendered me senseless—when I recovered, I found I had been robbed of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a scarf; I had those articles before he struck me—as I was coming to myself he was bringing me into the street, and he took me to the Pier Tavern Coffee Room—he was with another man—I said "I will wait upon you in the morning," and they both left—I missed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a white handkerchief, and two coloured ones out of my pocket—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my handkerchief.</p>

About 2 o'clock, on 14th January, I was called to the Standard public-house, and saw the prosecutor there—I afterwards went to Rope Yard Rails, where the prisoner lives—he was not there—I returned to the Standard and saw the prisoner pass the door when I had been there about a minute—I called him in, and told him he would be charged with stealing between nine and ten shillings, two handkerchiefs, and a white wrapper—he said "I know nothing of it"—the prosecutor was there at the time—he said "You know very well you robbed me, and where is the handkerchief?"—he said he did not know anything about the handkerchief—he said "Where is the wrapper, the white one?"—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it—he further pressed him, and he said "Well, I have sold it, but you know you gave it me"—I accompanied the prisoner to seek for Elliott, but I could not find him, and I took the prisoner to the police-station—he called witnesses at the Police Court, and they were bound over to appear here, and I ordered them to be here last night.</p>

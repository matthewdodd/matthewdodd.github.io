                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Union Bank of London at the Argyll-street branch. On 1st December, a person came to my desk at the bank, and asked for Mr. Whitehead's pass-book—I cannot say for certain that I see that person here to-day—the prisoner is very much like the person—the person said, "I want George Whitehead's pass-book and cheques"—Mr. Whitehead keeps an account at our bank—it is not our custom to give back the cancelled cheques, unless they are asked for by the customer—it was the practice in Mr. Whitehead's case—I handed the pass-book to the person, together with the cancelled cheques in the pocket—among others, I believe there was one drawn in favour of Colonel Tynte—the person opened the pass-book, took out the cheques, and said, "It is all right."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier at the Argyll-street branch of the Union Bank of London. On 3d December, about twenty minutes to 11 in the morning, a cheque was handed to me for payment over the counter—this is it—it purports to be drawn by a customer of ours, Mr. George Whitehead, in favour of Colonel Tynte, for 259<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 1st December (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—on looking at the cheque, I made some references, having some doubt as to the signature, which confirmed my suspicions—I did not ask the prisoner any questions about it—I immediately communicated with Mr. Inkpen, the manager, and the prisoner was introduced into his room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the manager of the Argyll-street branch of the Union Bank of London. On 3d December I was summoned to my room, and found the prisoner there, and this cheque—I asked the prisoner from whom he got the cheque—he said from a person in Poland-street—I either asked him whether he knew the person, or he volunteered that it was Mr. Whitehead who had given him the cheque—I asked him if he had seen the person before—he said that he had met him a day or two previously, when he told him to come for the pass-book; that he had got the pass-book, and made an appointment for that morning to meet him again, when he promised him half-a-crown—I asked him his business—he said he was a brass-fitter, but was out of employment—I then inquired whether he did not think it strange that a person should entrust him with a cheque for 259<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to present—he made no answer—I then sent for an officer, and gave him into custody.</p>

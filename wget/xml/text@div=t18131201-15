She left me on Wednesday the 17th of December. On the day she left her service I missed all the articles mentioned in the indictment. I applied at Lambeth-street office the same evening; Miller, the officer, came to me on the next day, we could not find the prisoner. In the mean time, Mary Hayes, my washerwoman was with us in the house; she confessed of taking many things. She gave up some duplicates to Miller, the officer, and said she had taken many things to pawn. She, Miller, and I, went to the pawnbrokers, Mr. Fleming, in Whitechapel. I there saw a silver soup-ladle which I knew to be my own. On the Saturday evening following the prisoner came to my house; she gave me a considerable number of duplicates out of her pocket; I said it was a shocking business she was engaged in; I asked her what could have induced her to have done so. She said, her family had been the ruin of her; she had to pay her brother's funeral expences. I said, I could not pass it over. I sent for the officer, and gave him the duplicates.</p>

            . Q. You have pawned several things for the prisoner, have not you - A. Yes; she first asked me in May if I would take the articles, she had no money to keep the house. I said to her, you know you do wrong. She said she should be arrested for her brother's funeral. I pledged for her a silver soup-ladle, a butter-ladle, and two table-spoons. I took them to Mr. Flemings; I got four pound for them, and I gave the duplicate and the four pound to the prisoner. I pawned several things for her afterwards; I gave her the money. The prisoner told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010017"></xptr>that she had twenty-one pound to receive, and when she received that she would take them out again. I told her it was wrong to pledge these things; she had only to go to the counter and ask for the money.</p>

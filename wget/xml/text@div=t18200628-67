            . I am an officer of Smithfield-market. On Monday morning, the 12th of June, about half past seven o'clock, the prisoner was exposing this gelding for sale in the market, it had been rode very hard, and Monday not being horse market day. I was with Taunton, we went to the prisoner and asked the price, he asked 9 l.; I asked where he brought it from, he said from Daventry, that he bought it three months ago, of one Clift, a jobber. I questioned him about it, he afterwards said he bought it of Clift in Smidfield-market, Birmingham, a month ago; I took him before a magistrate, and locked the horse up. A bill came into my hands, describing the gelding, and I found out the prosecutor. I took the gelding to the Bear and and Ragged-staff yard.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought it in Smithfield, Birmingham, and rode her to town to see my sister; I was in Smithfield, the gentleman asked me to sell it for 5 l.; I said he was making a joke of me, and he rested the pony from me. A gentleman said I had better get an officer to get the pony again, I went and got an officer, they took me to a public-house, and wanted me to drink, and tore all my tickets to pieces. I bought it of Clift. The magistrate wrote to Birmingham. I have lived there twenty-three years.</p>

            . I live in Stingo-lane, Marylebone. I am an ivory turner, I have known the prisoner twenty-four, or twenty-five years, and always knew him to be a deranged man at the change of the moon; he has been confined by his father several times, and has been in prison many times for his mad tricks, but I never knew him confined for theft. I have not seen him for five years, I have known him afflicted with insanity eight or nine years. I married his sister, he is well known all over Brimingham as a madman; if he gets a pint of ale, he roves about and foames at the mouth like a madman.</p>
               <p>- ARMFIELD. I am the prisoner's sister, he has been deranged ever since he was fourteen years old; where he was apprenticed to a baker, his master gave him a blow on the head with a peel, since that time he has been deranged.</p>

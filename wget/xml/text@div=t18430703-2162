About eleven o'clock in the forenoon of the 10th of June the prisoner came for a pennyworth of pudding—I served him—he put a shilling on the counter—I gave him change, and put the shilling into the till—there was no other money there I am sure—a short time after, my master came into the shop—no one had purchased any thing after the prisoner—my master went to the till, and said I had taken a bad shilling—he took it out, and gave it into my hands—I looked at it, and it was bad—I put it into my pocket, and in the evening I gave it to the policeman—about a quarter after eight o'clock the same evening the prisoner came again for a pennyworth of pudding—he put down another shilling—I took it up, and saw it was bad—I called Mr. Glass, and told him he was the same boy—Mr. Glass marked it, and gave it to the officer—the prisoner said he had not been there in the morning.</p>

About nine o'clock in the evening of the 10th of June I was called into Mr. Glass's, and received charge of the prisoner—Mr. Glass marked one shilling, and gave it to me—I saw it was bad—I am sure this is the same—I have kept it ever since—I went to the station, and searched the prisoner—I found on him two penny-pieces, one halfpenny, and a pennyworth of pudding in his pocket—I received this other shilling from Webber.</p>

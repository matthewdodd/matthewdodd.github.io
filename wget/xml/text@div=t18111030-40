               <p>- HODSDEN. On the 21st of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was at Mr. Barker's in Houndsditch, I saw the prisoner pawning two pair of shoes, knowing he was employed at Mr. M'Laren's it gave me suspicion. When the prisoner walked out I stepped forward and looked at the shoes; I told the pawnbroker I thought they belonged to Mr. M'Laren, Cornhill; the young man said he would be aware for the future. I went up the next morning to Mr. M'Laren's and told him; he desired me to go with him to the pawnbrokers, and there he saw the shoes, and knew they were his property. I am sure the prisoner is the man, I am in the habit of seeing him every day. I work for Mr. M'Laren.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have this to say, I am as innocent as you are. I believe it is nothing else but a piece of malice. I went out about thirty-five minutes past six o'clock, I went into the Black Lion, Bishopgate-street, to get a pint of porter; I stopped there till near seven o'clock, I got into the shop a few minutes after seven. I was never in the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

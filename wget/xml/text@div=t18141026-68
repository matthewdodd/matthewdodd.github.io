On the 17th of August, I left my room; the watch was hanging up at the mantle piece about five o'clock; when I left the room, I locked the door, and took the key with me. I returned about eight o'clock; I looked for the watch, it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see anything of the prisoners wife - A. Yes I had been walking with her; she asked me to take a walk with her. I went with her. I saw the prisoner come out of a pawnbroker's shop at the corner of Widegate-street, with a pound note in his hand: I went up to him, knowing him. He took his wife and me to a liquor shop, and treated her and me to a glass of peppermint each of us. When I went home, I went to my husbands, and asked him if he had got in at the window and taken the watch; he said not. On the next day a young man and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260047"></xptr>prisoner's daughter brought me the watch; she said, her father was very sorry for it. This is the watch. I am sure it is my husband's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am astonished my prosecutor is not here; I wish he had been here; I expected to see him; I then should have had an opportunity to have asked him whether he did not tell me to go to his wife to borrow some money, or if I saw his watch to bring it to him; he and I had been drinking together all the day.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

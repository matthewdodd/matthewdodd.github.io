            . I desired my lad to look for it; there was no gown of that description. I immediately called the eldest lad, thinking the young lad might omit looking for it. He could not find any thing to answer the description; and then he went round the shop door; and said, Sir, there is a gown gone from the door. I had never left the shop at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was that after the prisoner had left the shop - A. About seven or eight minutes; I immediately sent him in search at a neighbouring pawnbroker's. He found it at Mr. Bradley's. I am sure it was within the door,</p>
               <p>MR. BRADLEY. I live about twenty doors from Mr. Hulme. About two o'clock in the afternoon, on the 4th instant, the prisoner pledged this gown for five shillings. I am positive to the prisoner's person. I produce the gown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hulme. It is my gown; it has my mark on it now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much in distress. I applied to the parish to take my child; they refused. I have a bad state of health, and am very poor. I am not able to go to service.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is the prime cost of the gown - A. It stood me in nine shillings. I value it at seven shillings. It pledged at the next shop for five shillings.</p>

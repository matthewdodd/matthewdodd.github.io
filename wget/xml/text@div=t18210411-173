            . I am a broker, and live at Battle-bridge. On the 5th of April, between one and two o'clock in the day, I was going through Seven Dials; the prisoner, with four others, were tossing up with halfpence, a gentleman crossed the Seven Dials, his handkerchief just appeared hanging out of his pocket - I could hardly observe it; the prisoners and the others immediately jumped up from their halfpence and ran after him down <placeName id="t18210411-173-crimeloc1067">Queen-street</placeName>

I saw Kitchen take this handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket, and put it into his breast - they all ran away one after the other. I then returned back, they observed me coming back after them. Kitchen ran into a coffee-shop and eating-house, with two others, while Barry, and another, stood at the door to watch me. I thought it unsafe to go into the coffee-shop. Just as I was going in, Kitchen ran out, Barry whistled and he ran into an iron shop. I took him with the handkerchief, and have had it ever since. I took Barry two or three days after, and have never found the gentleman.</p>

            . I am a japanner and an officer. I was with Coulton, going to Bond-street, and observed the prisoners and others playing in Seven Dials, Coulton said they have taken a gentleman's handkerchief. I ran after the others - I had seen them altogether in company.</p>

I saw Coulton with Kitchen in custody, and about one hundred and fifty or two hundred men after him. I I told him he was charged with stealing a fogle - he said it was through distress. I found 2 s. 11 d. on him - this was Thursday; on the Saturday following, I received Barry in charge.</p>
               <p>JAMES FOWLER. I am an officer. I went with Coulton to Seven Dials, into a coffee-shop, there was nearly twenty bad characters there. Coulton said that was one of the party who robbed the gentleman (it was Barry) I told him I wanted him for robbing a gentleman of his handkerchief, he said he knew no such person as Kitchen, and afterwards, as we came along, he said he did know Kitchen, but he did not know he would split.</p>

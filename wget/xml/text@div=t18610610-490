               <p>—on Thursday, 26th February, I went to Messrs. George Lee and Co.'s premises, and found the car cases of seven sheep—they were in the back premises, lying on the ground—they were in a very bad state—they were car cases of animals very much diseased, and totally unfit for human food—the whole seven weighed about 170 lbs. odd, together—these sheep would have weighed about six or seven stone each, in a proper state of health; that is about 56 lbs.—I did not institute further inquiry on the subject—I on demand the car cases at the time, and gave Mr. Lee a certificate of condemnation—I have not got that note—in my opinion the sheep had not been dead long; about two days perhaps—I have been a butcher—I was brought up to the trade—from the state of the meat when I saw it, the animals were decidedly diseased before they were killed, and that must have been quite apparent before they were sent off from the country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose you mean that an experienced Butcher would be able to tell that a sheep, when alive, had something the matter with it, if it was in such a state as you saw these sheep? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a person with a very slight knowledge of cattle would been able to tell they were diseased—the disease was, what we call in London, the rot—I am not acquainted with the professional name of it—it affects the liver—that is generally the seat of the rot disease—that disease generally proceeds from a previous wet season—I believe it generally begins with the liver; what we call the flounders in the liver—I do not know whether that is the hospital term—I did not see the livers of these sheep, I had no opportunity of seeing them; but I could judge from the general appearance of the car cases—I am not aware what would be the external indications, if those sheep were alive, that they had flounders in the liver—I am not a veterinary surgeon—they would be in a very lean and weak state—I do not know of anything else—I do not say that any<lb></lb>body who sees a sheep lean and weak ought to see that it had got flounders in the liver—I am not aware what other indications there would be—I did not apply to Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee sent for me—I had a conversation with him, merely on the state of the meat—I did not see the hamper in which the meat had been Brought—I did not learn from Mr. Lee that they had been sent to him by a Butcher of the name of Clifton—I asked him who sent them, and he told me he did not know—I believe I asked him since if he knew, and he told me that he did not; that he had had no advice with them—it is not the usual way of packing meat to send it up immediately after being slaughtered—it is not a good way it is only done so in hot weather to save it—it does not spoil it if done in cold weather—it is a bad way, because it would spoil the appearance of it—if the meat was packed warm, toe effect of a journey from Dorsetshire would be, that it would hot look so good a shape; it would be stained by being packed hot—it would not present many of the appear<lb></lb>ances that I found in this meat—it would not present a shiny appearance—it would depend on the weather, whether it presented a damp appearance—it would not present a damp appearance in February, because the weather would be cold—if it was warm in February it would alter the appearance of the meat; it would spoil the shape and cause it to be stained, it would not alter the quality—stained meat would not have an appearance of putridity, not to any one not a butcher, I should think—I cannot tell you when the first complaint was made against the defendant of having sent up Bad meat to the market—it was some time afterwards that I went before the magistrate about it—I cannot tell the exact date—it must have been about six weeks ago—it was some time in April—I did not take any</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What age were these sheep? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know; I could not tell—late lambs is an expression used in the country; supposing them to have been born in March, April, or May, in the preceding year we call them tags; that is the trade name; they are neither sheep nor lambs, but between.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you believe these sheep would have weighed 56 lbs.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think that would have been about the weight of them—the actual weight was 25 lbs.—I should certainly think that a sheep weighing 25 lbs. would present appearances of disease while alive, or just before death; I mean a sheep of that age—they would present while alive a very lean and emaciated appearance—if they were lame, the lameness might arise from disease, or accident, or from cold—I did not see any part of the inside of the animals; it was merely the car cases that were sent—the appearances of the car cases and the flesh were what one might expect from their having the rot; they were very wet; what I should call very wet sheep, which is an indication of disease—from what I saw of the car cases, I have not the slightest doubt that these sheep were diseased at the time they were killed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer at Shack with, in Somersetshire—in October last, I sent 100 sheep to Mr. Seymour, the defendant, to keep—they were to remain there till 6th April; that was the arrangement—I remember going to see them in February—I was not sent for—I saw the defendant, and we saw the sheep together—I saw the sheep altogether; they were very much crippled, as a flock—these seven were, and a few more were crippled, but not so bad—we took the seven out of the fold into the field, just away from the other sheep, over the hurdles—I told the defendant that he had better try to sell them or get rid of them, for I did not think they would be able to walk down into Somersetshire—I had them separated from the other sheep because I did not think they would be able to travel home—I never directed that those sheep should Be sent to the London market—I never directed them to be sent anywhere—I told the defendant he had better try to make sale or get rid of them, for I did not know what to do with them—that was all that passed in reference to those seven sheep, as far as I know—he told me that one or two of them were dead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you bring these sheep to Mr. Seymour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were sent there, I think, in October—they were driven from Shack with, that is near Glastonbury—I suppose it is about seventy miles, or nearly; I don't know exactly—they were taken to Mr. Seymour's to keep—they were what are called stock sheep—we also call them lambs—they were lambs when we sent them—they were born late that spring; about February or March—there is a good deal of difference in the weight of lambs—they may be seven or eight pounds a quarter, or ten pounds they may Be—when I speak of the weight, that is supposing them to be in good condition—there was nothing the matter with the sheep when I saw them, that I know of, except that they were lame—I could see nothing wrong except that they were lame—Mr. Seymour had no interest whatever in them, that I am aware of; not a farthing—they were mine—I did not see the butcher who killed them—I have seen him here, but never to speak to him in my life—I sent them to the higher lands to be there for a time, and then to come back to me again for store sheep—I found they were lame—if they had been able to walk I should have taken them back again—on my oath, I knew nothing else, and found nothing the matter with them at that time—I knew nothing wrong in the slightest degree with them except their being lame—I got back the rest of the sheep to Glastonbury, the whole of them—they are very well indeed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eleven years old. I live with my father and mother, in Bermondsey-st.—the prisoner is my father. On the 29th of may I got the tea things ready for breakfast—my father was down stairs, and my mother up in bed—she was not quite well—it was about nine o'clock—my father was at the table—there were cups—I had placed them in saucer—my father sent me to fetch a penny loaf—I was not long gone—when I returned mother's cup was in the middle was in the table with the saucer over, it which was not so when I went out—my father took it off the cup put the cup in the saucer, and Poured a little drop of tea, in and filled it—he then told me to and go up and ask mother if she would have a cup of tea—I went up, came down, and told him mother said "yes"—he then took the cup, by is side, filled it with tea, put some milk in it, and was skimming the top off the tea, and throwing what he was skimming off on the carpet/—he saw me looking at him, and he took the cup, and put it on the side of the table so that I should not see him, then put some milk in it, stirred it up, and sent it up to mother did with the tea—I came down again—I have seen my father and mother put soda in to the tea-pot—I did not see any put into the tea-pot on this occasion—I know soda when I see it—we have been annoyed by rats, and my father and mother have put arsenic on bread and butter to throw down the rat-holes.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been married to the prisoner eighteen years—we have had eight children, and have five living—we have always been on good terms—we had little differences, as others do—we have not lived so happy lately as formerly—he struck me once, three or four months ago—on the 29th of May I was indisposed, and did not come down to breakfast—my son came to ask if I would have a cup of tea, and afterwards brought me up one—he told me something—I did not take any notice of what he said—it was too hot, and I let it remain—I afterwards drank a small portion of it—it was a great deal too sweet for my palate—I did not swallow it all—I spat some of it out—I put it on the washhand-stand—some time after my son brought me up another cup of tea, which I drank—I did not send the first cup down—I went down about half-past nine, and took the cup down with me—I afterwards went with it to Guy's Hospital, as I looked at it, and saw some bits of white powder in it—I felt a little burning in my throat, but so simple it might be fancy—I showed the powder to the medical gentleman there—I went there to be satisfied privately, what was the powder in the tea—they gave me an emetic—we have rats in the house, and used arsenic to</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Cooper, surgeon of Guy's Hospital. I remember the prosecutrix bringing a breakfast cup to the Hos<lb></lb>pital—I poured off the liquid—there was a sediment, which was analysed—it was three or four grains of finely powdered arsenic—in my judgment that would most likely not be sufficient to cause death—one or two grains more would very likely do it—I administered an emetic, but found no arsenic among the contents of the stomach—I have examined the contents of the paper produced—it is arsenic, and is labelled arsenic.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner at half-past one o'clock the same morning - the prosecutor had described what had occurred; he described her person, and I found her in Fleet-street - I charged the prisoner with stealing the watch; she denied it, but I found it in her hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you seen the prosecutor that night? A. Yes - he said he had been with the two women; he gave the other in charge for stealing the watch - she was discharged on the Monday; he accused the other woman of stealing 3s. 6d., but when he got half-way he said he gave the money into her hand- he was not sober.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WATTS. This is my watch.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean that you was not nearer to the woman than a yard and a half? A. No - we walked up the lane together with the other woman; I had agreed to give that woman 3s. - I had not 3s., and laid half a crown and one shilling on the table; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180049"></xptr>put it into her bosom; I made a noise, and the landlord came up - we all went down together, and we settled it; she might have given the prisoner the watch - I did charge that girl with stealing it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the girl, and she gave me the watch.</p>

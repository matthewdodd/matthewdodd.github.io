               <p>Q. When did you loose your watch - A. Last Saturday week, in Vine-street, he fell down, and they took the watch out of his pocket; he thinks it was a girl that took it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons surrounded him - A. Two women.</p>
               <p>A. Look at the prisoner does he know any thing of her - A. He thinks it was her, but he cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him if he ever picked up any women - A. No, I understood him that he had been drinking with a clerk in the Treasury, it was not in the house that he had been drinking that he fell down; he says, it was in another house, he believes on the second floor; the two women took him to that house.</p>

On the 27th of October, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw him on the other side of the way with two boys, whistling up and down the street; I went out about four o'clock in the afternoon, and locked the room door, and then saw him opposite the door with the same two boys, and heard one of them whistle to him, as I went up the street; I came back at half-past five o'clock, and put the key into the lock, but it would not open the door - it was bolted - I called Elizabeth Holland down, who lodges on the second floor - we both pushed against it, and I got my knee in, and saw the prisoner through the crevice, placed against the drawers - he then unbolted the door and let me in, and placed himself against the drawers again; I saw a fork in his hand - I pushed him from the drawers, and missed a scarf from one of them, which was open - I had left it locked - I asked what made him come there - he made no answer; I said he had broken the drawers open and taken the scarf - he then knocked me down - Holland asked him to let her search him - he said he would see her ********* first, and then ran out; I then examined further and missed nine shells, a waistcoat, and two handkerchiefs of my brother's; I saw two shells in his coat, and two in his breeches pocket, as he went out; they rattled when Holland took hold of him to search him, and there was a bulk in his thigh, which I suppose was the scarf. He came back in a quarter of an hour, and said "Search me;" he let a little child, named Sweeting, search him, and she found two shells in his coat pocket; he then took an old shell off the mantelpiece, and put a new one in its place, out of his breeches pocket; he then went out; I sent Holland for Furzeman, but he would not come, as he said we were making game of him. The prisoner went out, and ran through the Sugarloaf public-house, with two more boys. Here is the shell he put on the mantel-piece - I am sure it was in the drawer before - those on the shelf were quite old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not live with you? A. No, with his mother; he moved three months before this - he was not in the room at all that morning, and had not bought me any pears - he would only have one pocket searched, and when the little girl found the shells, he gave her money not to say any thing - I have not seen Holland since Monday week - her father will not tell us where she is.</p>

            , JUN. I live with my father. I saw these things safe the night before the robbery. I had brought the scarf from India, intending it for my sister, but had not given it to her. I came home about six o'clock on this evening, and heard what had happened, and about half-past nine o'clock somebody ran down the street, calling out "Jack Keeffe, have you found your scarf?" I ran out and met the prisoner soon after, crossing Queen-street, with another boy and girl, thirty or forty yards from the house. I know the shell found on the mantel-piece to be the one which I had left in the drawer - it is new, and those on the shelf were old. The lock of the drawer had been picked with a fork.</p>

            . I am an officer. Keeffe gave me the fork - I tried it to the lock of the drawers, and found it would force open the lock - I did not examine the room door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. For the last six months an intercourse took place between me and that girl - the friends proposed marriage, which I declined - since then there has been a little malice. I was passing the door on this day- this girl and three or four more, were at the window - they called me up stairs - she asked me to tea - I had dined with her the day before, and gave her 1s. to fetch some pears; I pushed her out of the room for two minutes, and she came in again, and said she saw me picking the lock with a fork - I said they might search me - she has given the witness money to swear falsely - witnesses came for me on Friday but she has frightened them away, saying they would be confined.</p>

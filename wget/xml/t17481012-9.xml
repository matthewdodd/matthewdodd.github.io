No, I cannot, but he owned he took a pound of hyson tea, and a pound of chocolate; I said these are my goods, and he said they were; I told him I would make it easy, and as we were carrying him before my lord mayor, he got away, but was taken again in Seething Lane, in about five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120011"></xptr> minutes time: the reason of my laying those goods so low was because his parents are very honest people. <rs id="t17481012-9-verdict50" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>John Watson. I live in King street, Grosvenor-square. Happening to be in liquor, I was pick'd up by some bad women, went into a house with them on the 2d of November at night, and was rob'd of upwards of 30 l.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of money was it?</p>
               <p>Watson. There were 26 guineas, a 36 s. piece, a moidore, and half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you pick'd up?</p>
               <p>Watson. I was at Smithfield market that day, but at three o'clock next morning I found that I was in Swan yard, opposite Somerset-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in a house?</p>
               <p>Watson. I was, but not in a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you there?</p>
               <p>Watson. I do not know, neither do I remember a step of the ground as I went; I was very much affrighted to think how I came there. Looking about me, in a court or yard I saw a light through the sash: Then there came a watchman with a woman, and opened the room door; I had the candle in my hand. The woman came to me, and said, "Get you gone, you have been robbing the house, and if my husband comes home, you will get knocked on the head, or something or another."</p>
               <p>Q. What was her name?</p>
               <p>Watson. Her name is

I seeing the watchman, said, Honest watchman, I do not know where I am, if you will shew me my way, and tell me where I am, I will give you a pot of beer; I put my hand into my pocket, and had not a farthing there. After that I saw another watchman, whom I charged with the woman, named Brown. Then she said

               <p>Q. Have you got any of it again?</p>

            . I did live in Swan Yard, at a lodging, and have known the prisoner about a week or a fortnight; the prosecutor was in my apartment on a Friday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought him there?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. Mrs. May happened to bring him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mrs. May?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. That is the prisoner at the bar. She lodged in a garret at a shilling per week, and I, out of good-nature, let her be in my room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she and the prosecutor come in?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. I believe it was between nine and ten o'clock, or eight and nine; I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she bring him there for?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. I do not know; I saw nothing disagreeable there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. I really do not know, for I was backwards and forwards, because I expected somebody coming in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go to bed together?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. The gentleman was on the top of the bed to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she on the bed?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the room all the time they were?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. I was some part of the time, but I went out, because I thought somebody was at the door.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050009"></xptr>Q. Did you see the prisoner take any thing from the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. I know so far, that she did take some money from him, I know she did do such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How much?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took any?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. She offered me three guineas, and put it into my hand, that I should not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she offer you that for?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. She said, Brown, here this is a gentleman that looks as if he would not be so ridiculous as to expose himself, saying, he would not advertise himself to make himself look scandalous.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she come by that money?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. I can say so far, she was rustling about his pockets, and she said she took it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she say so to?</p>
               <p>S. Brown. She told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you she took it out of the man's pocket? in your examination before the justice, you did not say one word of her taking the money.</p>
               <p>S. Brown. I really have forgot whether she said she took it out of his pocket or no; for she was a little surprised, and took herself away; I followed her as far as Temple-Bar, she had some rum, and treated a watchman with a pot of purl. I followed her, but she got from me, and I went to my landlord but could not find her; she has absconded ever since, till she was taken up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.</p>

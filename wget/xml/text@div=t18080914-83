            . Q. What are you - A. I am a Bricklayer, I was standing on the threshold of Drury lane stage door, I saw these men and the prisoner coming down the street towards Nag's head court; the prosecutor was in the center, the prisoner had his left hand upon his shoulder; I took notice of them both, there, were only them three in the street; they made a halt and they told him this was the place to go up; then I had a sight of them because I was right perpendicular, I thought they were skylarking; they were not five minutes there before they come down, but when the prisoner came down I thought they were all joining together, I might have taken him if I had thought there had been any robbery; I saw this man run down, he wore a brown jacket, he had his hand under his jacket, he ran down the court and jumped right across the street he made, a false step when he came nigh to me, and the prosecutor ran after him with a poker; he cried out a robbery, when I saw he was near me I got up and pursued him, I saw the man double up by the play house; I ran down Vinegar yard to see if he would come by that way, instead of that he ran down Change court. As a soldier catched him a publican at the corner of Catherine street said the soldier would have him; I saw the soldier pursue him, the man turned down Change court and I took it easy; I pursued along with this man, he followed me up the court it is called Round court; I believe it is a very bad place; I was told that the man had got a knife and run into a house; I went and got a light; I saw the door was locked where he went out upon the top of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him go into that house - A. No; we pursued him so far I went over the roof of the house; I was not a constable or else I would have gone farther.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehended him - A. Not that time. I went back and got a constable and went to the place where he was robbed, and his hat was found there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. Did you find his hat there - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was you afterwards present when he was apprehended - A. No; he was taken to the watchhouse with the woman; he was there before us.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw him at the watchhouse, did you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark upon him - A. Yes, a cut on the left hand side of his head, occasioned by the stroke of the poker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the blow with the poker - A. No, I was too far away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner before this happened - A. No; I was just come to my work; I work at Drury lane theatre.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. You say you did not know this man before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them altogether - you say Sullivan was elevated, you thought they were all skylarking together - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It appeared to you that they were all of one party - A. It did, or I could have catched him.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the men at work there then - A. The men were at work there at six o'clock; I found him there about eight o'clock, I believe; when I found him under the place I desired him to come out; he did; his head was most dreadfully cut behind, and his shoulders<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140043"></xptr>all over blood; I asked him what business he had there; he told me he made his escape from some soldier who was going to murder him; I told him I wished it might be so, but under appearances, and from what I had heard, I thought it not right to let him go; I saw a beadle in the street, whom I called in; he took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what you had heard - A. I am not clear whether I did or not; he was very willing to go to the watchhouse; he seemed to wish to go.</p>

            . I am a labourer, No. 9, Change court. On Monday morning the 16th of July, I was awoke by the noise of two people running down the court, I heard the alarm of stop thief; I saw a soldier run down the court following a man; when I had dressed myself I saw the soldier come back; he picked up something, I could not see what it was, with that the soldier made his way off; the prosecutor and the prisoner were gone into the Strand; the soldier let the prisoner go when the prosecutor came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that is what you heard - A. In the course of the day I was at work in the cellar; I throwed some dead mortar of oneside, I saw something glisten; I pulled it out; it was a watch case. My cellar is at the first house in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a person, running away, have thrown it into the cellar - A. I cannot say; I should suppose he might, there is no window, only railing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is nothing to prevent any person from throwing it into the cellar - A. There is nothing but the railing. I have had it in my custody ever since I picked it up in the afternoon between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether it was put there by the prisoner or any body else you cannot say - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a soldier run down the place - A. Yes; he either picked up something or put down something.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That watch case is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark upon it by which you know it - A. I never put any mark upon it.</p>

            ; I told him I did not; he said nevertheless in case you do not know his name, we will have something to drink; I said I am going to work at Mr. Clarkson's, Middlesex hospital; I went with him; the name of the court I cannot say, it comes into Drury lane; he asked me what I would have to drink; I said a glass of peppermint; then he said would I go with him to a friend's house; I said no: he pressed me very hard and he took me to Nag's Head court; he said will you come up stairs: I said no, this is a house for girls of the town, I do not like such places; I went out of the court; a young man said to me there is a man running after you with a poker; for what, I said, I have done nothing; the prosecutor came up to strike me, and as I was running down the street I was struck with the poker; I was stopped by the soldier; he then said I have had what I wanted of you, you may go now to Hell. I was not gone far before a man says he is coming again; I went into an old gentleman's house: he there said I had robbed him of his watch; I said is there any assistance; he came into the room and said he would murder me; I ran out of the window and went into that gentleman's house, and what with the blow and with the running, I went to sleep; when the gentleman came to me, I resigned myself up, I knew I was innocent, I wished right to take place.</p>

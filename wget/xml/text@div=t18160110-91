             was on the foot-path; I had just been through the gate, and paid the toll; the cart had gone before me some distance; I ran to overtake it; I saw Roache before me, passing off the foot-path; he came up, and gave me a violent blow on my head, and knocked my head against the side of the the cart; before I could recover, he gave me another blow on the other side: as soon as I recovered myself, I struck at him with a whip I had in my hand. My hat and handkerchief he had knocked off my head, and where on the ground at the time. I called to the watchman, and as soon as he came up, Roache ran across the road, and took the hat and handkerchief in his hand, and I never saw it since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. I and the prisoner are brothers-in-law; we have been on very bad terms; he has always been insulting me. I indicted him for an assault in this case, and took him up on a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100049"></xptr>warrant, upon the 23rd of December; it is about sixteen or seventeen months since I indicted him on a waistcoat before. That night, when he came up to me, he said, you had better go now and get another judge's warrant against me. I went to the magistrate's, and told my story. Upon my oath, I charged him to them with the robbery at the time;but through the neglect of the police clerk, it was omitted in the indictment, and when I was before the magistrate, both he and they told me, although the theft was not in, he was to be prosecuted for the theft, as well as for the assault.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the COURT. It was between six and seven in the evening. I did not pick up the hat; a boy came up, and said, he saw him knock me down, and take my hat away. Upon my oath, I told the magistrate of the robbery. I have read in several books there is a reward of forty pounds for convicting a man of a highway robbery; I have heard so; but I don't know it will stand good in this case. The magistrates only held him to bail for the assault.</p>

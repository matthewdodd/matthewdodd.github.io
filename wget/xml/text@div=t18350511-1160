Great, however, as is my love to your daughter, I would rather have perished than married to satisfy a sordid and selfish desire; but, being fully aware I could provide a comfortable home for her, and feeing I could not live happy without her, and knowing, too, that my love was re-turned, I did not hesitate to propose an immediate union, without asking your consent. I hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing you and Mrs. Thorburn on Sunday, and then I hope to explain all to your satisfaction. I cannot say more, as my time is limited to ten minutes, for I expect to be called every moment; and must conclude, with kind respects to all, and believe me, yours to command, S.

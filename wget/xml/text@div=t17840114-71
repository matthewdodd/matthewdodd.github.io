               <p>Did you ran mute? - At first I ran mute, wish intention to catch him myself, but I found he gained ground of me, and in Queen-street I hallooed out Stop thief! he dropped the boots in a minute or two; I had the man in my eye till he turned the corner of Red-lion-court.</p>

I never lost sight of him from the first.</p>

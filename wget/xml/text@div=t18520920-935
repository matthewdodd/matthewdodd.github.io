                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Park. On Monday afternoon, 30th Aug., about 4 o'clock, the prisoner Price came to me, and said her mother had been dead four years; that her father was sick in the hospital; that she had been without food two days; she had two sisters at home, and the woman of the house threatened to turn her out; and she begged very hard of me to buy a pencil of her, which I did—I asked her if she would like to have a situation—she said she should be very glad, and that a man named Davis, of Rosemary-lane, could give her a character—I said, if that was the case, she had better come into my kitchen, and help the servant—I asked her if she could recommend me a laundress—she said she could recommend Mrs. Simpson, who lived in Haydon-street—I knew nothing of the prisoner before. but she seemed to tell such a pitiful tale—I gave her my card, and sent my servant with her to go to Mrs. Simpson's, but she left my servant in the Minories, and she returned; and the prisoner returned, after about an hour, with her father, who she had told me was ill in the hospital—they left, and she came again on the Tuesday after, at 7 o'clock in the morning—she went to her work—I went upstairs, and about 11 o'clock she called me down, and told me the laundress was waiting for me—I went, and found the prisoner Reid sitting in the kitchen—I said, "Are you Mrs. Simpson?"—she said, "No, ma'am; I am Mrs. Reid, and I have washed before for you"—she said Mrs. Simpson was ill, and could not come, and had sent her—I had no recollection of her having worked for me, and asked her, but said she might have done so—my servant brought the things which were to be washed down-stairs; and while Reid counted them, I took a list of them and gave it to her—there were eight pairs of stockings, fifteen shirts, nine handkerchiefs, and several other articles—I gave them to Reid with my own hands—on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening I sent Price with another bundle of clothes to Mrs. Reid, for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185209200072"></xptr>
               <p>her to wash, and to tell her I wished to have the former bundle brought home on the Thursday—she returned in about an hour, and said she could not find her—I then went with her, but could not find her—a woman she represented as her mother went with us, and we went from one place to another with her till between 11 and 12 at night, but could not find her—at last she took me to Somerset-street, and knocked at two doors, and said Mrs. Simpson was gone out, but she could give me no account of Mrs. Reid—Price then knocked at a door, and three ladies came out, and she then began to cry, and said that was not the house, in fact she did not know which it was, and in consequence of that I took her to the station-house—on 2nd Sept. Reid was brought to my house by a policeman—I went with them to the station, and Reid there said she had never had my clothes—I have not seen the clothes since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mrs. Park's service. I saw Reid in the kitchen—she said she had worked for my mistress last May—my mistress said she did not recollect her; and after my mistress and her had talked about the clothes, they were delivered to her—there were twelve shirts, eight pairs of stockings, nine pocket handkerchiefs, and other articles—I saw her go away with the clothes—I am certain she is the person—she carried the bundle in her arms—Price was there when she came, and let her in—they appeared to know each other, and Price said she knew Reid perfectly well—Price said that Mrs. Simpson was very dilatory in her work, and not a good laundress at all, and she had sent Reid instead—on the Monday evening I was going with Price to look after Mrs. Simpson—there was another person coming out, and I asked Price to wait—she said she would not wait; she could go much quicker than I could; and she left me, and never returned till two hours and a half, when she returned with her father—I never found out where Mrs. Simpson lived; Price would not let me go.</p>

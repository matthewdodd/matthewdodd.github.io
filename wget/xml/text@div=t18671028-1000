                  </hi> I live at 8, Castle Hill, King Street, Ramsgate—I was living at the Gothic Hall coffee-house, Deptford, and left two bags there, containing two shirts, two white frocks, some handkerchiefs and stockings, a flannel waistcoat, a Guernsey frock, and other articles, value 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 10th May I applied for it, but did not obtain it—I had not autho<lb></lb>rised any person to give it up—the prisoner was at one time in my em<lb></lb>ployment, but I discharged him—he knew where I resided, at Gothic Hall, sod that I had the bag—this order is not my writing, nor did I authorise any one to write it for me—I did not see the prisoner from 9th May till 21st September—he left my service on 9th May.</p>

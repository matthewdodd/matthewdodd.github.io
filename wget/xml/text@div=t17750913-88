Upon the 19th of July, I had been in the city, when I came to my lodgings, upon the 20th at one in the morning, I found it locked up. I had been drinking a little, but I was sober enough to know any thing that passed. I had not a mind to disturb the family, therefore I went out to look for a lodging elsewhere. I went into the Coach and horses, a public house, in Marrigold-Court. I called for a pint of beer and enquired for a lodging, I could not get one there. I am positive that at that time I had nine shillings and six-pence in my pocket. The two prisoners were then sitting in the next box to me. As I could not get a bed in that house, they said they would shew me an honest house, where I might get a bed for a shilling. I paid for my beer, and went out with them. I had not got a dozen yards in the street, before they both got hold of my arm, one on each side. Ann Green put her hand in my waistcoat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130050"></xptr> pocket, where I had a key and nine shillings. She took out of it the key and the nine shillings. While she was so doing, and I was struggling with her, the other picked my pocket of my watch. Then they both ran away. I was afraid to call out, supposing there might be some bullys by them; therefore I went back to the house. I heard from the master of the house where I was likely to find

            . I saw Riley and the prisoners at our house that night; to be sure he was not sober, he had been drinking; but he was sober enough to know what passed: the prisoners were both sober; I asked Riley to see what a clock it was; he pulled out a silver watch to tell me; he was not there, I believe a quarter of an hour. I saw him go out with these two women; he took out some silver when he came to pay, and after he had paid his reckoning, I saw him put the remainder of the silver into his left-hand waistcoat pocket.</p>

            . I am a patrole. Coming down the Strand, between Exeter-Change and Marygold-Court, I saw the two prisoners and Riley in the Strand. This was about one o'clock in the morning. They had him one in each arm. They passed me very peaceably and quietly, and so I took no notice of them. In five minutes he came back again, and said, he had been robbed. I saw nobody at that time in the street, except the prisoners and the prosecutor.</p>

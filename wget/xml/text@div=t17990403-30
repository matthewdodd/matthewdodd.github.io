             sworn. - I live in the same court; I was going down the court towards home between ten and eleven in the evening, I saw the prisoner get in at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she break it open by force? - A. I do not know, I saw the fash up; she stood in the room as near as I can guess about five minutes, and then she brought out the bed-clothes with her; she carried them into her own room, and then I saw her go in again and bring out the bed; she then went in again, and brought out a bonnet and a waistcoat; and the fourth time she went in and brought a trunk out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to her? - A. Yes, the first time I saw her I spoke to her; I cried out, holloa, who is that getting in at that window; she made no answer, but went into her own room.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is her house to this? - A. Next door but one, and her daughter's is next to that; she took the bed into her own room, and the rest of the things into her daughter's.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any quarrel with the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- DOWNES sworn. - I am a watchman in Whitechapel parish; I was in the watch-house that night along with the beadle; I went down to Little Essex-street, and found the property out in the middle of the street. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>- SELFRIDGE sworn. - I am a watchman: On Tuesday, the 12th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock, I saw three women running; I asked them what was the matter; I went and took the prisoner into custody, and took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Harcourt. This waistcoat and bonnet are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you fastened the window? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Isaacs). Look at that bed and bedding, are they your husband's property? - A. Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had a drop of liquor in my head, and I made a mistake, the rooms being near to each other; I took the things out, thinking to frighten them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Bird's housekeeper. On 22nd Jan. he gave me a purse containing one shilling and a sixpence, which I put in a glass sugar-basin in his bed-room—the next day, Thursday, in conse<lb></lb>quence of what Mr. Bird told me, I found the purse was gone—on the Saturday I saw him find the purse in the prisoner's room, under the bed, in a stocking, it contained 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a bill, with part paid off it—I brought the purse down to the parlour, and said to the prisoner, "Ann, where did you get this purse from?"—she said she brought it from home—I told her it was false, and gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and sent her away—she came again afterwards about her wages—she was very abusive, and Mr. Bird gave her into custody.</p>

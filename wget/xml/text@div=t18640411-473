                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, P</hi> 44). On the 27th February Mrs. Thomas pointed out the prisoner to me—I took him into custody, and she gave me this bad shilling—when I took him he put his hand into his left-hand coat-pocket, and seemed to be fumbling with some papers—I said, "What have you there?"—he bummed and hawed something—I said, "Let me see what you have there," and I took out of his hand a piece of paper—I unfolded it, and found it contained two counterfeit shillings wrapped in paper, with paper between the shillings—I said, "0 here are two others wrapped up separately"—he said, "It is usual for me to wrap my money up separately"—I then took him back to Mrs. Thomas—I searched him, and saw he was very fidgetty to put his hand into his pocket—I did not search that pocket, for a moment, but finding he was so anxious I said, "Well, let me see what you have there," and I took this other counterfeit shilling from that pocket, that was the waistcoat pocket—I produce that shilling, as well—when I found that, I said, "0, here is another one"—he did not say anything to that—I found on him a small parcel of tea, about two ounces of butter, a cap, another besides the one he was wearing; it was not a new one, two sixpences, and sevenpence-halfpenny in copper, that was good money.</p>

               <p>about the man he had seen on Saturday morning in Suffolk-street—he said it at the police-court—I searched him very diligently—I believe he had no good money but the shilling and sevenpence-halfpenny in copper—the cap I found was an old one—he said it was an old working-cap—it was just about similar to the one he was wearing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 440). In consequence of information from Mr. Fitch, I was watching the prisoner's premises—I went there at 5 o'clock in the morning on 16th June, and a little before 8 o'clock I saw the prisoner open the door, and look out up and down the hill—he went to the corner of Old Fish-street; he looked about there and came back—Mr. Fitch lives at No. 3, Old Fish-street-hill—the prisoner went inside his own door, and shortly after I saw Ingram, who was tried here last Session, bring a basket full of something with some shavings on the top; it was apparently very heavy—he rang the bell—the prisoner opened the door, and Ingram went inside the passage, and Ball lifted the basket from Ingram's shoulder; Ball and Ingram came to the door, and Ingram went away without anything—in the course of ten minutes Rolfe came, who was tried with Ingram last Session, Rolfe had nothing with him—he went into Ball's house with Ball—Rolfe then came out without anything, and went away—I waited there till half past 11 o'clock, during that time the prisoner came out three times—he came and looked about him, and went away for it might be an hour—he came back again, and then went out again—I saw him come in three times—the last time he went in he was followed by George Davis, who came out within five minutes afterwards with a parcel on his shoulder—it was in a wrapper, and corded—I followed Davis, he went up Old Change; there</p>

               <p>Knight joined me—we went from there to the Red Lion, in the City-road; Davis went in at the public entrance leading to the bar—I went in at the private entrance at the side—I saw Davis speaking to two persons who were there; one named Fitch, and the other Griffin—Griffin went in the back yard, followed by Davis, without the parcel—that was left in the house—they came back again and took the parcel, and came out and went to Mr. Birkett's, a stationer's shop in Norton Folgate—Davis there put down the parcel, and Griffin took the cord and wrapper off, and handed them to Davis—they were then about to leave the shop, when I and Knight took them into custody, and the parcel—it contained these three reams of paper which I have here—I then went to Ball's house, I looked round it—I found there some books which I have here—some envelopes, and a few sheets of paper—I looked after Ball, but I did not find him in June—I continued to look after him—I found him at last on 20th July, close to Kennington-gate, coming from Brixton—I told him I had a warrant against him for receiving property belonging to Mr. Fitch, he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

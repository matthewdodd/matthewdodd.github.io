On the 7th of November, at seven o'clock in the morning, I went out and locked my room door, and left the key in a private place where I had for two years past, for the maid to find it to make the bed. When the maid got up, she found the door open and the things gone; I suspected the prisoner and took him; the two pair of stockings were found upon him, he had one pair on, and one pair in his pocket: I found the coat and breeches in Lombard-court seven dials, by the prisoner's direction. He made a confession of all the night he was taken up; I found the three shirts at a pawnbroker's in Queen-street seven dials; all the other things he had disposed off.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. On the 8th of November, between twelve and one o'clock, the prosecutor brought the prisoner to me, and charg'd him. I ask'd him of what, he said the prisoner had found means to get into his room, and steal his things: I ask'd him if there was any thing about the prisoner that was his, he said there was a pair of stockings on his legs; I had him search'd, and we found these stockings upon him (producing them) which he owned to be the prosecutors. I carried him then from the watch-house to the round-house; he there said, he hoped I would be merciful to him: He would not confess he had any accomplices.</p>

               <p>Q. Where are the goods, mentioned at the time the prosecutor charged you with him?</p>
               <p>Cornelia. He told me he had found means to get at the key of his room, and had robb'd him of every thing he had but what he had on his back, but did not mention any particular thing; but the next day before the justice he mentioned most part of them, there was a search warrant granted, and I went by the prisoner's directions and found these goods (producing them.)</p>

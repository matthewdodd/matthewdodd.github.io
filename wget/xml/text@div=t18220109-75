            . I used to go on an evening to Mr. Wetherill's house, in Providence-row, to keep the prisoner company; and on the evening of the 1st of December, he asked me to pawn a piece of black kerseymere, which was at his master's, where we were. He told me his master allowed him to pledge these things when he wanted money. I was to ask 11 s. for it; I went to Mr. Attenborough, Sun-street; the prisoner stopped outside the shop - the pawnbroker offered me 8 s. I brought it outside, and told the prisoner; he told me to pledge it for 10 s. I went in again; they sent me to fetch him in. I told him that Attenborough wanted to speak to him, and took him in. He asked him a few questions - the prisoner said it was his cloth, and he bought it at a pawnbroker's. He ran out - and I was detained.</p>

            . On the 1st of December, Swift came to pawn the kerseymere; I offered him 8 s. - he went out to know if he might take it. I told him to bring the owner in, and he brought in the prisoner, who said it was his, and he lived in Providence-row, with Mr. Wetherill, and that the property was his own - that he bought it of a pawnbroker. He ran out. I detained Swift.</p>

               <p>Q.How can you swear that to be your's? - From the number that is on it, twenty-five, nearly erased; the servant has so many spoons given him with such a number on them, and when we looked over the spoons we found it was No. 25 was lost; I told my servant it was that number; I am sure it is mine; I can safely swear it. On Monday week I had intelligence of it from Mr. Heather; on Mr. Heather's coming to me I looked over the plate which I should not have done then, because we were so busy.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WILLIAMS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer belonging to Bow-street; I was sent for to Mr. Heather's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200028"></xptr>and took charge of the prisoner; I brought the prisoner down to the office; Mr. Heather has kept the spoon.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Heather. How soon did you go to the Crown and Anchor? - I sent to Mr. Simpkins directly from the office, the 11th of February; I sent the spoon and the same person brought the spoon back; I can swear to the spoon; I thought first of all it belonged to Mr. Willis in St. James's-street, I sent it to him, and he came; I shewed it to Mr. Clarke, and he said, it was Mr. Simpkin's.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Simpkins. Can you say of a certainty that that spoon was missing? - I can.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it Mr. Heather sent to you? - It was the 11th of February when I went to Bow-street, and I saw Mr. Heather there; the spoon brought to me was carried back to Bow-street; my own clerk gave it to me, who brought it in I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it given to at Bow-street? - Mr. Heather had it at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say for certain that this was the spoon that was carried to Mr. Heather at Bow-street? - Yes, I can, here is Crown and Anchor on the bowl which has been partly erased, and here is five, the remainder of the twenty-five.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Monday week I was coming up Long-acre, I met with a Mrs. Brown, she asked me to go into the shop and get the spoon weighed; when I went into the shop she was at the door, and when she saw me laid hold of she ran away; I was neither to sell it nor pawn it, but only to have it weighed and return it again; then they took and searched me; I had a good number of duplicates about me, but every thing was my own. Then on the day following I was carried down to Tothill-fields, and the next day there was a Mr. Willis swore to the spoon, the same as Mrs. Simpkins has. I am quite innocent, and I beg of your Lordship to look into it; I have lived twenty-nine years with various gentlemen, particularly nine years with judge Nowel; as for my part I know no more of it than only receiving it of the woman in the street, and was to return it to her immediately; they took away from me my almanac, my pocket book, and my letters, they took away all the duplicates of things I had pawned when I was ill of the rheumatism; my wife also was attended by Dr. Morris; I could not afford to keep a nurse for her, I was obliged to attend her myself and it prevented me from doing my business. I would be greatly obliged if your lordship would let me have my property returned to me again, my seals, my letters, my key of my trunk and other things.</p>
               <p>Court to Heather. Was Mr. Willis sent for? - He was, and he swore to the best of his knowledge that it was his spoon, but when he saw the Crown and Anchor he said, it was not; this was before I sent to the Crown and Anchor, it was in the course of an hour; the Crown and Anchor is visible on the spoon.</p>

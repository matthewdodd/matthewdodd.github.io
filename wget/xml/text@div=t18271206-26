On the 16th of August, about five o'clock in the morning, I came down stairs, opened my parlour window, threw up the sash, and sat there till a little after six. I then rang my servant up, and returned to my bed-room, having awoke my servant; I was alarmed in a quarter of an hour by her screams, and found a person had jumped from the parlour window; on coming down I missed the clock and the spoons.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Greig. I came down at half-past six o'clock, went into the kitchen, opened the shutters, and saw two men fall as from the parlour window. I gave a scream, ran up stairs, and missed the clock off the side-board, and the spoons off the dumb waiter - the window was wide open. I had seen the things safe the evening before.</p>

            . I am a smith. I was passing Mr. Greig's house to go to work, and saw Barnett and Moffit, who have been convicted, lurking about opposite the house. I went to the end of the square, stopped a few minutes, and presently saw Barnett standing outside - he went up the garden - Moffitt was also outside. Barnett received a parcel from the parlour window - a little boy jumped from the window, and all three went off together - I cannot say who the boy was - he had handed the parcel out - it was wrapped in something white. I am sure the prisoner is not one of the three, for two have been convicted, and the other was a smaller boy - there could not be any other boy on that side of the square without my seeing him.</p>

            . I am a letter-carrier at the Post-office, and live about fifty yards from Mr. Greig. About half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was going down a passage opposite my house, a boy about the prisoner's height passed me - I took no notice of him. Barnett soon after passed me, and pulled his jacket off. I looked round, and Moffitt came up with the clock under his arm - Barnett covered it with his jacket  - the prisoner was not one of the three.</p>

            . I work for my brother-in-law. I was in the Horseferry-road, which is five or ten minutes walk from Mr. Greig's house, and saw the prisoner carrying a clock under his arm - Barnett was with him; they ran down a little court, and Cole after them - I do not know what became of them. I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

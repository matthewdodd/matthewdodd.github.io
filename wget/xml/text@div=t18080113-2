            . I am a carpenter, I worked in the same street where this young man worked. At twelve o'clock the prisoner came and asked for a job; I told him it was a wrong time to come and ask for a job between twelve and one, when the men were gone to dinner; I told him he looked more like a thief than a man that wanted a job; he left me and went to where this young man worked; he could not open the door, he put his arm in the window and took the plow out; he crossed over the street and went of the other side of the terrace; I went after him and asked him what he had got. I laid hold of him; and then he said it was his partner's plow. I said I would take him to the owner, if that was his partner; I called this young man out, and he owned the plow directly.</p>

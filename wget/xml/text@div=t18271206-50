               <p>MR. A. PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH McCARTHY. On Sunday evening, the 23d of September, I spent the day with John Harman, in <placeName id="t18271206-50-crimeloc249">John-street, Whitechapel-road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18271206-50-crimeloc249" type="placeName" value="John-street, Whitechapel-road"></interp>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18271206-50-victim400 t18271206-50-viclabel250"></join> - I was out of work; my last place was at Messrs. Severn and Co. - I had left them about six weeks, having been ill, and was just getting well, when this happened - Harman was in the room when the prisoner came in - I knew them before, but did not wish to come across them, if I could help it; they staid there about half an hour then - I bade them good bye; they had insulted a first cousin of mine, who was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were in the room? A. Three or four women and four men; about ten persons altogether, besides the prisoner; we had a little to drink - I had drank beer and gin, but not much, because my doctor told me not to drink for a fortnight, or three weeks - I was sober when I left the room, with my cousin; when they insulted my cousin, I asked what they wanted, and who sent for them, and the prisoner made a slap at me, but I was on the other side of the table, and escaped from him; he did not hit me - I did not lift my hand to him - I tried to get away, because I was so weak and low in spirits; we stopped there half an hour after that; we had sat down again, and the dispute was over; I and my cousin came down stairs together; his name is Daniel Hayes; he is not here; we were going home together, till the Ragens pounced between us; he was a little distance before me, about twice the length of this Court; they came across me.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by their coming across you? A. The prisoner came before me in the highway; he came sideways, and struck me, and knocked my hat off at one blow; they had knocked my cousin about, before they attacked me, and almost killed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Before your cousin was struck, had the Ragens passed you? A. I had not seen them till they came before me, and struck me; they might have passed - I had not seen them strike my cousin; it happened in John-street - Michael's wife came and asked to shake hands with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know your cousin was ill-treated? A. There were signs on him, and he told me of it - I had not heard him knocked about; it was not a very dark night; my cousin was out of my sight when I was attacked.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came up to you? A. The prisoner; he did not speak a word, till he stopped me, and struck me in the highway - I remained standing - Michael then came up, and kicked me; it was between eight and nine o'clock - I tried to run away, but Dennis ran after me, and collared me; he struck me, and knocked me against the wall, and said, "You b-y rogue, I shall give it you," and said he would have my life; he said nothing about money - I stood against the wall; Michael collared me, and gave me a kick, and brought me on my knees, and while Michael was holding my collar, Dennis put his hand into my right hand waistcoat pocket - I had two sovereigns loose in that pocket - I know they were safe when I left my friend's house, for I had had my hand on them the moment they came up to me - I begged for mercy, and put my two hands up; he tore my pocket, and took the two sovereigns out; here is the pocket; I have had it mended; when he knocked my hat off, I ran to pick it up- Michael's wife picked it up - I saw it in her hand, and do not know what became of it, till I got a warrant against them, and the officer got the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the warrant for? A. I swore a highway robbery against them; I told the Magistrate I was robbed - Mr. Lee had the warrant - when I went to swear the highway robbery, two or three officers would not let me in - they brought the book outside, and swore me, and they did not make any thing of it but an assault - I told my story to the Magistrate after he had signed the warrant - when the men were taken on this warrant, I thought it was all right, but he got false bail, and I cannot find the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sent to gaol or about his business? A. He was sent to gaol of course; he had his trial before the Magistrates; he was sent to Clerkenwell, and got bail.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first went to the office, you say the officer would not let you in? A. No; the warrant was granted without my going before the Magistrate; the officers shut the door, because they said I could come down upon them with the warrant, and find him; I and my cousin both went to the office.</p>
               <p>The warrant, being here produced and read, was for a common assault.</p>

               <p>Q. What further passed, was Michael's wife with them? A. Yes; she asked me to shake hands with her; she kept delaying me till my friend got out of sight, and was knocked about; I felt my money between the prisoner's fingers when he tore my pocket, and he ran away as soon as he got his hand out - I went to the office next morning, and they would not grant any warrant, but kept me about for two or three days, and afterwards the officers would not let me in, but brought the book to me, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060051"></xptr>made nothing but an assault of it, and I indicted them both; I saw two watchmen, and told them I was robbed - I asked them to come after the prisoner - one of them said, "Do not you know what way the watchman was served the other day? he was struck by an Irishman, and knocked down with a stone and killed, you must go to Whitechapel watch-house, and get an officer" - I did not go to the watch-house - I have subpoenaed two witnesses, named Riley and Graddon, who saw me knocked down, but they will not come.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been ill in the hospital, how came you to have two sovereigns? A. I got it from my master - the foreman paid me off - he gave me 3s. 6d. after I came out of the hospital.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Now, on your oath, did you say a word about the sovereigns till you went before the Grand Jury? A. Yes; I said I was robbed of two sovereigns - I told Lee, the officer, so - I am sure Michael held me while the prisoner robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate the prisoner and Michael robbed you? A. Yes, when they led me in the second time; I swore the first time before the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to persist that you swore before the Magistrate that you lost two sovereigns? A. I swore it from first to last, and proved it too - I have known them since I was twelve years old - we only had a few words inside the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were in the street when you were robbed. A. The two Ragens, Michael's wife, and me - the disturbance did not last long - when they first struck me, I ran away about twelve yards, and Michael came and put his hand into my pocket - I cannot swear how long it lasted - one of my witnesses was present - I told my cousin I was robbed - I saw him as soon as I got home, and told him of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you cry Stop thief! when you got up? A. Yes; but he was gone as soon as he got the money - I hallooed out, Watch! Stop him! the watchman came up, and two men hallooed out, Shame and Murder! they are not here; I subposuaed two men, but they will not come; they are Irisltmen, and acquainted with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did you take your cousin before the Grand Jury? A. No; he did not see any thing of my robbery; we had one of them before the Justice.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bethnal-green. The prosecutor came to me early one Monday morning, and said he had been robbed about a month or three weeks ago - I found his hat in the first-floor room, at No. 18, John-street, Whitechapel;

            's wife occupied that room - I saw the hat taken out of there into another house - when I went to apprehended Michael, I saw him escape over the wall, on a signal being given to him - he is a labouring bricklayer, and when I got on the scaffold, a signal was given, I took the person who assisted him over the wall, but did not take Michael - the prosecutor went before the Magistrate with me, and swore a robbery against them both - only Michael's wife was before the Magistrate - he discharged her; I did not see Dennis or Michael afterwards - I was not before the Grand Jury - the prosecutor subponsed me last Monday - he came early on a Monday morning, and gave me a warrant for felony - I do not know who it was signed by - I cannot read writing, but I gave it to somebody to read - I read the printed part of it - it was from Lambeth-street - it was for felony - I gave it to several people to read - I gave it back to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is it now? A. The Magistrate took the warrant, rolled it up, and threw it away, and said he would have nothing to do about it, and abused me in some respect; a person in the office took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said you gave it to McCarthy? A. Why, after a bit, I asked the Magistrate to have the kindness to give me the warrant - he gave it me, and I gave it to McCarthy.</p>
               <p>Q. What, after he had thrown it down? A. No, before that; he requested to see it again; he rolled it up and threw it down, and said he would have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you in the habit of taking warrants for felony from the parties themselves? A. Sometimes I do; the officer who had it first would not go. I did not know the Magistrate had said he would have nothing to do with it; it was after I had it that I heard the Magistrate say so. I thought it would be my duty to apprehend the prisoner, particularly as the man was knocked about and robbed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say you would have taken a man on a warrant for felony, which you saw the Magistrate reject, and say he would have nothing to do with? A. I mean to say when it first came into my possession; but after the Magistrate rolled it, I should have nothing to do with it. I first knew McCarthy about a week before he gave me the warrant. I found the hat about twelve o'clock on the day he gave me the warrant.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH McCARTHY. This is the hat they knocked off my head.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Myerson the first person you applied to? A. No - Mr. Lee. I went to him several times before he went after the prisoner. I was obliged to give him 5s., for he used to say "I am tired and busy now;" he went and found the man on the top of the scaffold. Lee did not take the prisoner; the street-keeper of London-bridge took him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Myerson requested me to go after the men. I went to a house where the hat was found - we did not find the prisoner there; we went to a building, and a signal was given to Michael to escape. I did not read much of the warrant, and cannot say whether it was for felony or assault.</p>
               <p>- LEE. I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I did not see the prosecutor at the office when he applied for the warrant. I apprehended Michael and saw the prosecutor at the office then; he spoke of a fight between them; he made no charge of robbery, and no warrant was granted for felony - it was a peace warrant; he said he was afraid to go about, for he was in danger of his life, and that the people had threatened to kill him; the Magistrate granted the warrant produced.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long was he stating his case to the Magistrate? A. I suppose about ten minutes - he was heard all through patiently; he said he had lost two sovereigns in the scuffle, and his hat, but it was not stated in the way of a robbery at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew his torn waistcoat before the Magistrate? A. He did not.</p>

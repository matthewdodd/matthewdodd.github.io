I was at the door, working - the prisoner came up in a direction from there, and asked me for the young man up stairs - I had seen her twice before. The mistress of the house said he was not within - she laid the bundle down, and went away. It was tied in a cheque handkerchief.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the prisoner's room - it was locked; we waited till about seven o'clock, when she came home, unlocked the door, and I found the bundle untied - she appeared confused, and hoped I would not take her, and said her mother would make it all right, and satisfy me. As she went to the office, she said she did not do it herself, but was with the girl who did - I told her to bring her forward.</p>

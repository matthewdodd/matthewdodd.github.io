               <p>Where did you travel from? - From the Coach and Horses at Ilford.</p>
               <p>Did he take your handkerchief off your neck? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you travelled with the prisoner also? - No, I never saw him before the evening that the mischief was done.</p>


               <p>Where did the prisoner join the other man? - At the White Swan, somewhere in London, almost over against Rag-fair, then the prisoner tied my hands, and the other stood at my head, and the prisoner swore he would cut my throat from ear to ear; and just as they had done tying my hands, there happened to be a gardner come up to the hedge at the instant, and he said, what are you after; and I said, for the Lord's sake, come and help me, and they both run away, and he run after them, and would have taken them, but they turned again, and he took me up, and brought me to his master's.</p>
               <p>Was you robbed when you was upon the ground? - When I was upon the ground, they took the watch out of my pocket.</p>

               <p>Which took the watch out of your pocket? - It was the prisoner I think.</p>

               <p>Where was he taken? - In Wapping.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night or a dark night? - It was darkish, it was not over light, nor over dark when the mischief was done, one could not see a great way.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in company with the prisoner before this mischief happened? - Two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Had you ever parted company in the course of this two or three hours? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you positive sure of the man? - Yes, Sir, I am.</p>
               <p>Did you see him while it was light? - Yes, Sir, we eat and drank together.</p>
               <p>Did you part company with him at all afterwards? - No, Sir, not out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear positively and directly that is the man? - Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>Which had the cutlass? - I cannot say which, it was rather dark, so I turned back again; they said they would do for me if I did not go away, I came back and picked the man up, and had him home, and washed his wounds, and had him to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Was he much wounded? - Yes, my Lord, he had several cuts over the backs of his hands, and three or four on his head, and one on his leg.</p>

            ; if you are satisfied (and he has told you that he was sober, and so the witness Strong says) that he is not mistaken in the man, and that this prisoner was one of the men who committed this robbery upon him, there can then be no sort of doubt of the verdict you must give; the only consideration with you is, whether, as it rests intirely on his single evidence, you will think that sufficient; now you find in the first place, he was perfectly sober, in the next place he had been in company with this man for two or three hours before, it was not an accidental casual meeting of a moment or two, as is frequently the case when a robbery is committed, he had eaten and drank with him, and he positively swears that he never had been out of his company so as to lose sight of him; you find too,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100005"></xptr> that through Strong cannot confirm him as to swearing positively to the man himself, he very cautiously and properly declines that being so dark, and having only that momentary opportunity of seeing him, which is generally the case; yet he confirms Spicer in this, that one of the men had a cutlass and one had a smock-frock on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The man says, he was in my company so many hours, he must certainly know whether I had a hanger about me or no.</p>
               <p>Court. As to that gentlemen, we know very well that these kind of men do carry their cutlasses about them concealed under their coats, if you have served on Juries here before, I dare say you must have seen that they carry them loose within the coat, without a scabbard, and it is by no means impossible that the man might have sat with him for hours, and not have discovered this; it may however have some weight with you, but if you think he is clear as to the man, and there is no mistake at all in it, then to be sure there can be no doubt at all of the case: but if you have any doubt you will acquit him.</p>

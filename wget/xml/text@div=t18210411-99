On the 29th of March he was employed in the east warehouse, and had access to what was called the further east warehouse. Some coffee was in the east part of No. 1, warehouse - it had come by the Havannah. I saw the bags perfectly safe in the morning, just before. I examined a bag, and found it had been cut - the cut, which was at the top of the bag, was about six inches long - it appeared to have been plundered. I went to Mr. Royce, and he kept watch. I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody at the front door of the east wing. I said to him</p>
               <p>"Oh, Pyne, shame on you, what have you been doing?" I saw the coffee taken from his pocket. I believe he took it from his pocket himself. There was about 2 lbs. of it.</p>

The coffee bags had been there ever since July. I saw them safe about ten o'clock in the morning - they stood in rather a dark place. I saw the prisoner in this warehouse.</p>

            . I am foreman of the coffee warehouse. Between one and four o'clock I was placed to watch the warehouse, and saw the prisoner between two and three o'clock coming from the inner east passage; when he came to one of the bags he stopped, turned himself round, leaned over the bag, and appeared to be taking coffee out - he stood there about two minutes, and then returned the same way he came; I then went and examined the bag, it appeared to have been disturbed. I gave information, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many were employed in the warehouse - A. About thirty. I was about eighteen yards from the bags. I saw no coffee on the floor - there was a deficiency of 5 lbs. in the taring weight.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 29th of March I was on duty, and took the prisoner into custody, standing on the quay in front of the warehouse, No. 1. I found two pounds of coffee in his coat pocket - he said it was coffee sweepings, and desired me not to take notice of it, as he had a very large family - I have a sample from the bag also; he said he intended to put it into the bag he thought it came out of.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You speak to it from its similarity A. Yes; there is a great deal comes from the Havannah, there may be two bags alike, but in general they are very different. He had no business with any coffee whatever.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been many years in the Customs, and was transferred to the Excise; in execution of my duty I gathered up what loose coffee there was to put into the packages. I put it into my pocket, not with intent to take it - for I would not forfeit that solemn oath I took when I had my place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Williams, of No. 7, Quaker-street, Spitalfields. Caroline Haines used to lodge there with me, before this took place—I know the prisoner; he kept company with her, but did not live in the house—on Tuesday, 2nd Jan., about half past 12 o'clock at night, I was in bed in the down stairs room—the prisoner and Caroline Haines came up to the street door, and were quarrelling there some time—Caroline Haines afterwards came into my bedroom, and said that a young man had assaulted her at a public house—the prisoner was at the door and could hear every word, and while she was telling me he came into my room, and said, "It is a lie <hi rend="italic">Bet</hi>, all that she has told you"—she said, "I have told her all the truth, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—he said, "If you say another word, I will cut your throat with a razor"—there was a razor with a fixed wooden handle which I use in my business, lying on the table—he took it up, rushed towards her, and said he would cut her b—y throat; she put her arm across, and it cut her right arm—I did not see what part of her person it was pointed at, as he ran so quick—the wound bled very much—the prisoner then ran out, and I fetched Haines's father—I was not in the house, when the prisoner returned—Haines was taken to the hospital—she had very much aggravated the prisoner, but had not done anything to him—she often aggravated him; he is a very passionate man, and she knows very well that he cannot take aggravation.</p>

                  </hi>. At this time I lodged at No. 7, Quaker-street, Spi<lb></lb>talfields—I have been keeping company with the prisoner for three years and a half—I had been to a public house with him on the night of 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> Jan.; we left about 12 o'clock or a quarter past—two oyster men were quarrelling there, and I said that they ought to know better than to serve a poor man like that, and that I would give one of them in charge—as I came along with the prisoner to No. 7, Quaker-street, we had words, and also at the door—I went to the room which Mrs. Williams occupies, and left the prisoner at the street door—while I was telling Mrs. Williams what had happened at the public house the prisoner came in and said, "It is false"; and began to tell Mrs. Williams what it was himself—I told him he was frightened of the men there, or he would have allowed me to go in, and we had a few words—I said I had told the truth, and he said that it was a lie—I did not see a razor on the table; I was at the door, and the prisoner was at Mrs. Williams's bed side; the table was about a quarter of a yard from the bed—I did not see the prisoner take anything off the table—he was stand<lb></lb>ing about two yards from me—he came towards me and <hi rend="italic">up with</hi> his hand; I thought he was going to hit me—I thought he made the blow at my face and put my arm up to save my face, and received the blow on my right arm—it bled very much—I did not see the razor, until he <hi rend="italic">heaved</hi> it at me—I was taken to a hospital, and remained there a fortnight all but two days.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prisoner has a great impediment in his speech? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and it is difficult to understand him—I had been quarrelling with him, and had given him a slight scratch on the face—I was a little excited—I did not scratch him as strongly and as sharply as I could—it was sharp enough to make him feel—that was just before I went into the room where Williams was, and he followed in afterwards—we had both been drinking—he had been drinking a good deal of ale and wine, and was certainly the worse for liquor—I did not hear him say anything when he ran towards me.</p>

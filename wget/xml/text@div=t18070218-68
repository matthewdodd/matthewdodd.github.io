I jumped over the counter, I saw a piece of calimanco drop from between her legs.</p>
               <p>Q. On taking up the calimanco, did you know it was some of the goods that were in your shop. - A. Yes, I knew it was my property, she said the child had pulled it down, it was impossible, it laid in another part of the shop.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On my removing the child, the bit of stuff, as I believe, might fall, I was going over to look at a bit of lace; when I took the child up, I dare say it pulled it down, but unknown to me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

I let lodgings to the prisoner in the beginning of December last, I let them to her and her husband. She took the lodging ready furnished at five shillings a week, she took away all the articles mentioned in the indictment. She left the lodging on the 12th of April, I had a mistrust that she had stripped the room, and found all the things gone, as mentioned in the indictment; her husband was gone, and she was in the eve of going; her husband was a stone mason, I found my things at the pawnbrokers.</p>

            None whatever. She said, she had taken the things out of the room, being in want of money, but I believe it was merely for drink.</p>

            . I am a neighbour to Mrs. Jury, I was constable last year, I was sent for hearing there had been a robbery committed, I went and found the prisoner sitting on the bed, and Mrs. Jury accused her of taking this property out of her room, she said, she had done it out of distress, her husband had been out of work for five weeks, and produced the duplicates. When she came to Hatton Garden office, the magistrate let her go on her own recognizance; she said, she would get the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went before the magistrate in Hatton Garden, I told him that I was in great distress, and that on Saturday night, I would take them out, provided Mrs. Jury would give me till then; the magistrate let me go, and come on Friday; I could not raise more than nine shillings, which I gave to Mrs. Ashley, who took some of the things out, and if I could have raised more, I would have taken them all out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, of No. 27, Great Tower Street. On 5th Aug., the prisoner, whom I knew as a customer, came to my shop, and asked me to purchase this pawnbroker's ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I declined having anything to do with it—he told me he had sold some coals to a stationer, who had not the money to pay, and paid him in paper, which he pawned, and that ticket was the result—I afterwards found that it was forged—I saw him again on 1st May, and said, "You are the man that sold me the ticket for the paper"—he said, "I am just going to keep an appoint<lb></lb>ment with a gentleman who proposes to engage me as clerk, and unless I keep my time, I am afraid I shall lose the appointment"—I said that his remarks before were so untrue that I could not believe him, and if he would follow me to my house, I should give him in charge, and if not, I should call a policeman at once—he said he hoped I would overlook it—he had said, when I bought the ticket, that he was in great distress, and starving.</p>

            . Q. On the 8th of March were you robbed any where in the highway - A. On Wednesday the 8th of March I was returning to town from Hendon. About ten minutes before six in the evening I was stopped by three footpads on the <placeName id="t18090412-6-crimeloc30">Hampstead road, near Chalk farm</placeName>

Afterwards they asked me for my pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them asked you for your pocket book - A. I believe it was the prisoner at the bar, he was upon my left; I told him I never carried one. Afterwards the same person said there was no time to lose, the same person felt about me and felt my watch; he dragged the watch out of my watch pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it - A. A silver watch, a steel chain, and a small silver seal. After they had robbed me they told me to return back from whence I came - to Hampstead - this was in the Hampstead road.</p>
               <p>Q. When they presented the pistols what did they say to you - A. They said nothing further than stop.</p>
               <p>Q. When the man had taken the watch from you, he told you to return back to Hampstead - A. Yes. When I went back towards Hampstead on the Hampstead road, one of the parties called after me and said, if any body stopped me, to say my business was done by a party on the road; I returned back some Distance, I met some gentlemen coming to town, I returned with them, and when I came with them to the Half way house we met some Bow street officers. I told them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the persons that stopped you before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a light was there - A. It was light sir, not very light indeed, there was no moon.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was a cloudy night - how was the person dressed that took the watch from you - A. He wore a velveteen jacket and breeches; they were all in velveteen or a dark brown thick set.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed in other respects - A. I took no other notice of his dress than he had on a velveteen jacket and breeches. I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. What size man was he - A. Tall and rather stout; I saw him about a fortnight afterwards at Worship street office before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the person who robbed you, so as to speak with certainty - A. I cannot say any further than with regard to his dress; I think he is the person that took the watch from me, I cannot speak to his features; on the contrary, I was too much frightened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You say one of these men had a jacket on, it was a cloudy night, and you were under very great alarm - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>OBADIAH COOPER. I am a pawnbroker, I live with Mr. Cordy, 163 Ratcliffe Highway.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any watch pawned by the prisoner - A. Yes; on the 9th of February a watch, chain, and small silver seal.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner was the man - A. Yes, he pledged it in the name of

               <p>Mr. Arabin. You do a great deal of business at your shop - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You say that whoever it was that pawned the watch at your shop, you had never seen him before - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT, to prosecutor. Look at that watch - A. This is the watch that was taken from me on the 8th of February, and this is the chain and seal, it is my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120006"></xptr>property; I am certain it is my watch, chain, and seal.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time search the lodgings of the prisoner - A. I did, at Priest's court, Tower hill, on Sunday the 19th of February; he told me it was his lodgings. In a small box, in a chest, I found that duplicate of a watch, with several others.</p>
               <p>Q. Now let Mr. Cooper see whether that is the duplicate he gave to the prisoner - A. It is.</p>

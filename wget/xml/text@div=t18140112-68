             took her bonnet off, and laid it on the top of the drawer of the ribbons; I suspected them, the difficulty of her choosing them, and the motion of her arms that she was stealing some property; I tried gently to remove the bonnet off the drawer, she held the bonnet very tight in her hand. I then gave it a sudden pull, and discovered half a piece of ribbon in her bonnet; I threw her bonnet off the counter, and withdrew the drawer of ribbons, and desired my servant to call the constable; she asked me what I was calling a constable for, and desired me to some of the ribbon that hung in the window for her; I replied, I would do no such thing; I would call a constable for her; she dared me to do any such thing, and ran out of the shop; immediately Mary Smith followed her. Johnson, the officer, was waiting outside of the door, he came in and asked if they had stolen any thing; I replied, that I had found the ribbon in her bonnet.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the 31st of December, I saw the three prisoners in Holborn, between one and two o'clock, knowing them I suspected them; I went into one or two shops after they came out, they never purchased any thing. They all three went into Mr. Saxton's shop. From there the two women went into Mr. Lee's shop; the man was standing outside, waiting for them at the corner of a court. After waiting there a short time Fercley ran out of the shop briskly, leaving the other prisoner in the shop. Perry, who is her brother, concealed himself in the passage of Mr. Bett's shop, the baker; about half a minute afterwards Smith ran out of the shop; Perry gave them a signal; they all three came together. I immediately went into Mrs. Lee's shop, I asked whether they had bought or stolen any thing; Mrs. Lee said they had concealed a piece of ribbon, she took it from them by snatching the bonnet. This is the ribbon that was in the bonnet</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that - A It is the ribbon that was given to me. I searched them, and found nothing on them but some silver.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The ribbon is mine; it is what I found in

            's bonnet.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not it get into the bonnet by accident - A. I conceive that impossible; the back part of her bonnet was on the drawer. These two young women had been in the shop two or three days before; I lost some ribbons then.</p>
               <p>Fercley's Defence. I went into this lady's shop on Christmas Eve, I bought several yards of ribbon; this young woman was with me. I did not go into her shop again for a week. I then asked the price of ribbons, I pulled off my bonnet to match the colour, and that young man was not in the shop at all. If the ribbon was in my bonnet it might have catched it by the wire of my bonnet when the lady took it up.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I did not take the ribbon.</p>
               <p>Perry's Defence. I was coming up Holborn; I met these two young women; that young woman is my sister; I was going home at the same time, we were going to have something to drink; they said they were going to buy some ribbon, and when they came out the two gentlemen took us into the wine-vaults and searched us.</p>

               <p>Q. What manner did you deliver the salt. - A. We weigh the salt on board a ship at a hundred a-time; the fellowship porters carry it away; we put in each sack two hundred pound weight. When I had done my work I went to the waggoner, I said you have had good luck to get your waggon loaded, as it is late in the evening; the excise officers have been kind to let you have it; he said I have got my load, the whole of the three ton.</p>

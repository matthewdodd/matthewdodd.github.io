                  </hi>. I am porter to James Smith, a wine-merchant, in Crescent-place, Bridge-street, Blackfriars. About twelve o'clock, on the 28th of Jan., the prisoner came to the warehouse—he told Mr. Smith he wanted four dozen of wine, to go to Chancery-lane, I do not know that he said who for—I went with it on a truck—he went before, and was at the house when I got there, and helped me in with it—there were two covered baskets—the house belonged to Mr. Pearson—I was ordered by Mr. Smith not to leave it without the money—I waited an hour and a half before I was told that Mr. Pearson was come in; and while I was looking after my track, part of this wine was gone—I then made up my mind not to wait any longer, and went to take it—I found a dozen and nine bottles were gone—it had been placed opposite the bar, inside—none of it has been found—the landlady and a great many customers were there at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had two samples of wine to take to Edward-street, Portman-square. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes, but it was before this—they were taken to Mr. Milman's, and he paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Pearson. I ordered four dozen of sherry—they brought two dozen of sherry, and two dozen of port—my husband tasted the sherry, and said he would not have anything to do with it—the prisoner took it away from the counter—in two or three hours after I saw him take two or three bottles from the basket out of the passage, and put them under his arm, under his coat—I had not sold him any wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The bottles I took out of the basket were two sample bottles.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The samples were delivered into Mr. Pearson's possession two or three days before; these quart bottles were put on the counter, the corks drawn, and they were not so good as the sample; samples are never taken back again. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I saw my husband and another person taste some bottles—I do not know what became of them—Goddard had not missed these twenty-one bottles at the time I saw the prisoner go out with the bottles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have always been in the habit of taking wine out; they have given me good samples, and have sent bad Cape, and it has turned sour; I have been obliged to go to a better house; this wine was booked to me; I have been wounded, and am incapable of lifting a basket of wine.</p>

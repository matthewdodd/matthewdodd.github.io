                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Jay, the contractor for the works of the Great Northern Railway. The prisoner was foreman to Mr. Gregson, the contractor for the East India Dock Line, which is to pass over the Great Northern—at the part where it passes over, there is a temporary bridge of wood, and men were employed to carry earth across it to a place called the Tip, where it is thrown down—it was the prisoner's duty to look after the men—the drivers of the carts would be bound to attend to his orders, to go on or stop—on the morning this occurred, about twenty minutes to eight o'clock, a temporary shore under the bridge had been struck by the Great Northern people underneath—carts had not gone over the bridge after six, only a trace-horse—I was not there till six—about a quartet to eight I was informed by the people below that the bridge was unsafe—soon after<lb></lb>wards I saw two trucks laden with earth drawn by two horses approaching the bridge—I hallooed out, "Stop!"—the prisoner was about thirty or forty yard from me—I should say he could hear me—I was on the same side of the driver that he was—he said, "Go on, you b—r, never mind," three or four times—Dallen was with me—I do not think he called out, except to a labourer who was on the bridge, to stop the wagons from coming over, but he would not stop for him—he hallooed," Get out of the way, or else you will be run over"—that was after he called out to stop, and the prisoner said, "Go on"—the driver drove on, and when the trucks came on the bridge, it all came down on the under line—a beam of the bridge came down and a shore—a man named Richard Gumm was underneath—we knew him by the name of <persName id="t18490917-name-444" type="victimName">

                  </hi>. I manage the works for Mr. Jay. This bridge be<lb></lb>longed to the East India Dock Line—on 29th Aug. we were raising some uprights to support the bridge, from five o'clock in the morning—the carrying earth over the bridge, was carried on all night—I am not aware whether it was stopped at all—carts laden with earth passed over from six until about a quarter to eight—to put the new supports to the bridge we had to remove one shore—we had got the upright part of the way up the night before—we were obliged to remove the old one before putting the new one up—when we were about to remove the old one, notice was given to the people above that the bridge would be unsafe—I saw Leary on the bridge, and saw the two trucks approach—I heard some one on the bridge call out," Stop, stop! the bridge is unsafe!"—the prisoner was just behind the two trucks when the call was made—the driver attempted to stop, and the prisoner said, "Drive on, drive on, "and made use of a bad expression—before he said that, I saw Leary holding up his hands, and doing all in his power to stop the horses coming forward; in fact he had to scamper out of the way—a man was there who we employ, dressed as a policeman, to keep people back—he was above me, calling out to stop—he was sent by the foreman of the carpenters for the purpose—the prisoner has to see that the people get on with their work—I have heard Mr. Gregson give him orders to do so—I have seen the prisoner direct the men who were driving the trucks, and have seen them attend to his orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Why did not you send notice to the East and West India Dock Company that you were going to undermine the bridge that night, and knock down the shores in the morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We had no occasion, we had frequently done so before—we were not undermining the bridge that night—we did not wish to stop the works of Mr. Gregson—we should have been done in ten minutes—I did not say we could carry on our works while they were going on with the trucks, and they might go on all the same—it was not proposed to me several times, the week before the accident, that they would stop the works altogether while we did what was necessary to the bridge—Mr. Gregson sent one night, and said he would stop if I had anything particular to do to the bridge, but he kept on work—I did not state, in answer, that it was not necessary for them to stop for us as we could repair the bridge while it was going on—I said, "Very well, sir"—I do not think we did anything that night, I do not recollect—the East and West India Dock Company have taken some proceedings against us in the Court of Chancery—there was an arrangement afterwards that we should repair the bridge, which we set about.</p>

"and I heard Anderson call out to the same effect—I saw the prisoner behind the trucks—I heard him say," Go on"—the driver went on, and the accident happened.</p>

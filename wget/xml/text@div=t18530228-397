                  </hi>. I am shopboy to Thomas Bishop, clothier, of No. 9, Holborn-hill; he has got one partner. On 29th Jan., between 4 and 5 o'clock, I was just returning from an errand; I was just outside the shop, and saw the prisoner coming out of the shop, with a bundle of eleven pairs of trowsers on his arm—they were fastened together, and had been hanging up about two steps inside the shop—I tapped the prisoner on the shoulder, and asked what he wanted; he sneered at me, and went away—I took the trowsers away from him, and he ran away; I followed him, and he ran down Plumtree-court, and I lost sight of him—I went back to the shop, and told my master.</p>

On Saturday, 29th Jan., Pocock made a complaint to me, and described a man—next morning, Sunday, there was a man shown me at the station-house in custody and, from the description I had received, I believed him to be the man—on the Monday, as soon as the prosecutor's shop was open, I went, and said I thought we had the man, and Pocock came and identified the prisoner—there were two in the cell at the time.</p>

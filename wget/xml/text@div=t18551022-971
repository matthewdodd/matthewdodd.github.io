                  </hi>, I am a labourer. I was lodging at the Railway Arms at Stratford, I was in the taproom about a quarter before 8 o'clock on 18th Oct.—I saw the last witness and the prisoner in the taproom—several other were in the room—I saw Wing go to sleep—the prisoner took a white-handled knife, seated himself by the side of Wing, and tried to cut his pocket with the knife—the knife was not sharp enough, and he asked a young man named Dignum to sharpen it for him, which he did—the prisoner then cut Wing's pocket on the right hand side—I could not exactly see which pocket it was—I did not see what he took out of the pocket—I saw him with some money in his hand—he gave a lad 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for three pots of beer—he did not stop to drink it—I believe he took one drink, but the greatest portion was left behind.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 233). On 18th Oct I was on duty near the Railway Arms, at Stratford, about 8 o'clock in the evening—I received information—I went and saw Wing—his pocket was cut—he said it was <hi rend="italic">Mike</hi> Collins—I went and found the prisoner in the taproom of the King's Head public house—I asked him if he would come out and come to the Railway, thinking to get him out of the house, as there were a great many others there—I got him out and took him to the station—as we were going we were surrounded by a number of persons—I was covered with stones and mud, the prisoner struggled very much, I was obliged to use my staff to keep him in safe custody and to keep the crowd off me—while we were struggling on the ground, the prisoner's brother, Edward Collins, came not, and the prisoner reached out his hand to him, and I heard money jink, and Edward immediately ran off—I had previously sent to the station, and another officer was coming up—he caught Edward, and he was taken to the station, but no money was found on him—we got the prisoner to the station, and I found on him this duplicate, which the prosecutor identities—it. his name on it.</p>

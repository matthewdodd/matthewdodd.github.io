On the 9th of November I went to bed at nine o'clock, and left every thing safe; between twelve and one o'clock I heard a noise like the breaking of a wall - I got up and went to bed again, leaving a candle burning; in a few minutes two persons burst into my room - They came in at a door which I had fastened with a small stick, it joined the privy; one of them laid hold of my hands, and the other took the candle - I had put my pockets on the floor - He struck them to see what was in them, and pulled them up, he then put the candle out, and I could see no more. They both came to my bed side-the prisoner was one of them; I saw him at the office among several others, and knew him immediately; they remained in my room and the next for nearly two hours-one of them afterwards struck a light. The other man was in the next room, and the prisoner stood over me, with a knife in his hand, and said,"where is your notes, or your life." I said I had none. He kept swearing at me, and said he would take my life if I did not say where my notes were. The other man went to rummage for more. The prisoner clapped his hand on my throat, and almost strangled me. Next morning, I missed the articles stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA ARMSTRONG. I am an officer of Worship-street. I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday morning last, about eleven o'clock, at his room in Peartree-court - I knew him before. I asked him if he had been in possession of any goods for a person in Cooper's-gardens?(this related to another circumstace). I asked him to walk there with me, and shew me the woman. He got up and went with me, Gleed, Warwick, and another man, to the prosecutrix's house. I asked her if there was any person whom she knew? she immediately said the prisoner was the man. We took him into custody, and conveyed him to the watch-house. I told him I should search him. He began to be very violent-at last he was overcome. I took a watch out of his fob; he immediately said,</p>
               <p>"That is the old woman's, and a man gave it to me."</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Armstrong - He has spoken correctly. I went to the prisoner's room, and found some tea and sugar, and a chissel, in a bason on the shelf-the sugar was in the cupboard. I also found a dark lanthorn. The chissel looked as if it had been used for breaking down a wall; I compared it with the place where they had broken down the wall of the house, and it fitted it. There was a hole in the wall of the prosecutrix's house, large enough to admit two persons.</p>
               <p>HENRY IZARD HUGHES. I keep the Star and Garter, in Shoreditch. The morning that the prisoner was apprehended, I saw him and another man at my house about six o'clock, they had some gin. The prisoner produced two crown pieces, which I bought of him, and two of the other man.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of April I went with the prosecutor to Dorrington's lodgings, No. 6, Love-court, Mutton-lane, I met Dorrington just coming out of the door, I took her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060035"></xptr>into her room; Pittard was sitting on the bed; knowing of Hounswell, I said to her, I suppose you have got the man's watch; I searched her, in her pocket was this apron, the prosecutor claimed it; I searched them all three, and the room, I found nothing. The prosecutor was in liquor.</p>

On the day this happened I went into the Magpie and Stump, the prosecutor was there, I drank with him, he followed me home, and immediately Dorrington came in, he struck her; she asked him what business he had in her place, he said she had robbed him, but she did not know of what: Hounswell was coming along the court, he said take this apron, I am going for an officer; she came in and asked us if we would take this apron, we said, no.</p>
               <p>Hounswell's Defence. This man was in liquor, he met me in the court, he said, take this, I am going to to fetch an officer. I took it into the prisoners room, they would not have it.</p>

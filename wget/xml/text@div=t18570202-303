                  </hi>. I am a labourer for my father, of Gilson, near Hounslow. On Thursday, 6th Jan., I was watching the prisoner when he left work, and saw him come out of the barn with a full sack on hit shoulder—he put it on the partition between our and our neighbour's premises, and some person on the other side, who I could not see, took it—I told my father, and he went out—while I was telling him, the prisoner locked the barn up, came in with the keys, and hung them up, as if he was going home-—my father went out at the front door, met him, and asked him to go down to the neighbour's yard with him, but he ran away—we then went and saw our neighbour's son, John Martin, close to the place where the sack was put over—my father asked him what he had done with the sack of oats which had been put over—he showed my father where they were—they were covered over with some dung, within five or six yards of where they were put over—my father went to his father, and told him, and John Martin brought the oats, and put them into our stable—Martin was taken the next day, and had six weeks summarily, or to pay 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can swear to the sack—it is here—I cannot swear it is the one he had on his shoulder, but I have no doubt of it—it was five or six minutes from the time the prisoner handed it over and it being found covered with dung—I compared the oats found in the sack with those in the barn, and in my judgment they corresponded.</p>

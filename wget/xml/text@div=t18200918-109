            . I am a Marshalman of the City. On the 11th of July, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was walking by Mr. Patrick's premises in <placeName id="t18200918-109-crimeloc621">Newgate-street</placeName>

He looked round, then took his hat off, and put something from it into the child's lap. The child went away, and Forrester followed her home. Next morning I saw her bring his breakfast again, and saw him put something from his hat into her lap - I followed her and stopped her opposite Mr. Alderman Cox's. I found five illumination lamps in her lap. I went and took the prisoner at Mr. Patrick's; the child was brought before him, he said nothing to the charge.</p>

On this Thursday, she came about twelve o'clock—my son and the lodger were then out—I told her she could go up, and wait for the lodger—my son came home about a quarter to one—I went out about two for a few minutes—the prisoner did not leave before I went out, or before my son came home—I do not know what time she left.</p>

On Thursday afternoon, between two and a quarter-past two o'clock, I went there—the prisoner opened the door, and said Mr. Neble was out, and the landlady had left her in charge of the house—I waited, and Mr. Neble came in in about five minutes—the prisoner spoke to him on the stairs, and then went down stairs—I do not know whether she went out—I went up stairs—I went down about three o'clock, and the door was open—it was shut after I was let in—I did not see the prisoner again that afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business with my brother William; we are wholesale grocers, and live in Leadenhall-street. On the 14th of May, this hogshead of sugar was sent out, but I did not see it—I received infor<lb></lb>mation, and went to Gray's-inn-lane, where I found Allen, with our cart and horse—I heard that an accident had happened—the hogshead was in the road—I looked into the cart, and saw Allen in the act of removing a bag of sugar to the front of it—he was ourcarman—I asked what he had got there—he said the sugar which he had picked up out of the road—I examined the hogshead, and on looking to the drawing-hole, I perceived the tin was off, which caused my suspicion—the hogshead was perfect except that—I gave Allen into custody after he returned to our house—the bag contained 98lbs. of sugar, worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Dadds. On the 14th of May, about half-past six o'clock, I saw a hogshead of sugar weighed; it was fifteen hundredweight three quarters—I gave it to Allen, to take to Euston-square—I did not see him again—at a quarter-past eleven o'clock the same night I saw the hogshead of sugar, and I weighed it again the next morning—I had seen the hogshead put into Allen's cart; there was nothing else in the cart; there was no bag—when I weighed the hogshead again, it weighed fifteen hundredweight all but fourteen pounds; there was a deficiency of ninety-eight pounds—I took the bag of sugar out of the cart myself, when it came back, with the officer—the sugar in the bag weighed ninety-eight pounds—Allen told me he had picked it up in the cart, and put it into the bag—I recollect, when the hogshead went out, the drawing-hole was quite perfect, and a square piece of tin was nailed over it—I did not see the tin again; it was off the hogshead.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Pinder's-place, Gray's-inn-road. On the evening of the 14th of May, I was in Gray's-inn-road; I saw the cart, with the horse hanging up; there was a hogshead of sugar and two boxes in it—I went up to give assistance—Allen said there was a man behind, that the hogshead was upon him; and he was sure he was killed—we cut the tarpaulin to get the hogshead out, and Chapman, who was under it, was taken to the doctor's, insensible—I saw the hogshead taken out of the cart, and placed in the road—I was there the whole time the cart was in the road—no sugar came out into the road there was no tin over the hole then—when Mr. Dadds came up, Allen said he had got some sugar in the bag, which he had picked up out of the street, and then he said he picked it up out of the cart.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he say both things in the same place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have heard the policeman say that it was after he got to the pro<lb></lb>secutor's that he said he picked it up out of the cart—I am sure he said "street" to me—I do not know whether Mr. Dadds was close to me at the time he said it—he was on the spot—I and others were assisting to get the wounded man out; I cannot say whether Mr. Dadds was near enough to hear it—it was Mr. Dadds who put the question to him—I saw the hole in the cask—if any sugar came out it could not be above a pound or a pound and a half—not such a quantity as this produced.</p>

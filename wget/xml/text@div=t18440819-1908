                  </hi>. I am a solicitor and live at Shaftesbury, Dorsetshire. I came to London on the 10th of May, and lodged at the Southampton Cof<lb></lb>fee-house, Southampton-buildings, Chancery-lane—I had a small carpet-bag, a memorandum-book, some writings, a deed, and other papers; the bag was placed on the window-seat in my bed-room, and near it was a wrapper or great coat—about half-past six in the evening of the 13th of May, I went into the room and locked a paper in the bag—I missed it next morning—I have since seen the papers that were in the bag—these produced are them.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Southampton Coffee-house—in conse<lb></lb>quence of information I advertised a reward for the recovery of the papers—I have not got the advertisement—on the 15th of May I received this letter, in consequence of which I folded up two sovereigns in a sheet of paper, and sent them by my waiter to the Brown Bear public-house—I directed the piece of paper to "A. B."—I went to the Brown Bear and found a letter in the hands of the bar-maid there—I made some communication to the bar<lb></lb>maid, and returned between seven and eight o'clock to the Brown Bear—I found the prisoner there in conversation with the bar-maid, and saw the book and papers now produced lying on the counter before him—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I was bar-maid at the Brown Bear, in Broad-street, Bloomsbury, which was kept by my brother. On the 15th of May a letter was brought, and left with me, directed to "A. B."—shortly after<lb></lb>wards a girl came in and inquired—I directed that person to send the indivi<lb></lb>dual who wanted that letter—about five minutes afterwards the prisoner came in, and asked if there was a letter directed for one "A. B."—I said there was—he asked me to let him look at it—I told him I could not allow him to have it in his hands, as he was to bring a carpet-bag, containing papers, before he was to have it—he said he wanted to look at it, to see if there was money in it, as he expected there was—I opened it in his pre<lb></lb>sence, and it contained two sovereigns—he left the house, and fetched these papers, tied in a handkerchief—he opened the handkerchief, but I told him I could not let him have the sovereigns, because he had not the carpet-bag—he said he did not know there was a carpet-bag; if I would let him have the two sovereigns he would leave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the carpet-bag—I said I could not do that, because I did not know whether they were the right papers or not—he said he did not know there was a carpet-bag, for he was not acting for himself.</p>

I went with Mr. Oakman to the Brown Bear—I waited outside—on receiving a signal, I found the prisoner standing in the bar, in a private box, and the book and papers on the counter—I took him into custody—I produce a letter directed to "A. B."—Mr. Oakman took it from the bar-maid, and gave it to me—the letter sent to Mr. Oakman was produced before the Magistrate—it was never traced to the prisoner.</p>

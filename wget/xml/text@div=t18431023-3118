                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Ashton, of Blackroan-street. On the 2nd of Oct. I had been with some friends, and about half-past twelve o'clock at night I went into a public-house—the prisoner was there, and from fifteen to twenty more men and women—she asked me to treat her to a glass</p>

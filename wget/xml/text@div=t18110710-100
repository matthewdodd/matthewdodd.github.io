On the 8th of June, about dusk, the prisoner came to my house, she gave me a shilling for a half quartern loaf, or half a quartern of flour, I do not know which, as I had suspicion of her I wrapped it up in paper, and put it in my pocket by itself until the Sunday morning, I kept it in my pocket until she came again. On Wednesday the 12th of June, about twelve o'clock, she came again,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100053"></xptr>and offered my wife sixpence, and a penny for half a quartern loaf; I looked at the sixpence, I observed it to be a counterfeit; I then shewed her the shilling that I had taken the Saturday before. I sent for Mr. Sapwell, and gave him the counterfeit shilling and sixpence. The other officer found a sixpence in the bosom of the child.</p>

            . I was coming home from my work; the prisoner follow'd me to pretty near where she liv'd; she said to me, if you will go along with me, I'll give you a pot of beer, and make ready your supper? she saw I had got it in my hand. I was a little merry, having had two or three pots of beer that day; she took hold of me by the arm, and took me into the house where she lived; and another woman took me by the collar: I saw the prisoner was getting my watch; I laid fast hold on her cloaths; and she got a knife, and cut her cloaths; and left me a handful of cloaths, and nothing else; and went away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take the watch with her?</p>
               <p>Read. She did, I had seen it in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you catch her soon?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300037"></xptr>Read. No, I found her about a week afterwards; I had told an old woman that knew her, I would give her half a guinea to let me see her: then she went to a house and came back again, and took me to the prisoner: I had a warrant in my pocket from justice Berry; I took her there, and he committed her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch since?</p>
               <p>Read. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Read. She said she had given it to another person; and that person had carried it to pawn for 4 s. and 6 d. she said before the justice, that I had given her the watch to pledge for 2 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own that she had taken it?</p>
               <p>Read. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sensible at the time?</p>
               <p>Read. I was quite sensible; I had been drinking a little, but was not out of the way.</p>

               <p>The woman that was guilty of the fact, was taken up, and clear'd last sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is that true?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found a bill against a person that took me by the collar, but I happen'd not to be here when she was try'd; so she got out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of your watch?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was worth 3 l.</p>

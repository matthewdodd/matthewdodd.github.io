             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer belonging to the Public office, Worship-street: On Saturday, the 6th of February, I went with a warrant to the house of Mostyn; the prisoner, Mostyn, was sitting down at a table, I was in the kitchin part; I told him I had a warrant to search his house; I went up stairs, and on the landing-place, up one pair of stairs, I found some papers containing some counterfeit halfpence, some with the impression, and some without,(producing them) I came down immediately with them, and searched the drawers, where Mostyn and Wingrove were; in the drawers I found these two other papers, containing some blank halfpence; and another paper with some farthings that have got the impression on; the prisoners, Mostyn and Wingrove, were then secured; we then went from that house to a house where Kelly and his son were found, at No. 1, Bellalley; I had been round, and looked at the back of the house, and returned, and knocked with my feet hard; Kelly came and opened the door, he was without a hat, and a handkerchief tied round him as if he had been unwell; the lad was without a hat and coat. I told Kelly I had a warrant to search the house, and would he come and see what we did? he said, give me your names, and do what you like; I wrote the names of the five officers that were present, on a piece of paper; I told him Mostyn was in custody; and asked him had Mostyn any thing to do with that house, or came there; he said, no; there was a closet in that room where Kelly, his son, and family, were just going to dinner; it was a lower room; there was the appearance of a trapdoor in the room, in the bottom of the closet, that was pulled up, and Ray was let down into the cellar; after he had been in the cellar a few minutes, with a lighted candle, he holloaed out, "secure the people; here is the press, with a halfpenny in it." I went down afterwards, and saw a stamping-press standing, with a pair of plain dies fixed in it; not with the impression of Britannia on them, they only produce blanks; there was a box that contained some saw-dust, which is used to blacken the money: there is a person that stands by the press to feed, two pulls, and one feeds; there were four candles hanging up on a nail against the wall; there were three arched vanlts together, such as might be used for beer, or any thing else; there was a door to it with a lock and key in it, and a bolt, that any body, being inside, might bolt it; the upper part of that cellar, which was under another house, of one Bailey, a broker, was a boarded floor.</p>
               <p>Q. The door that led to the premisses of Bailey was blocked up? - A. That door was fixed to the part of the cellar where the arch was.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a cellar, not an arched vault, which entered into the third? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And within the door of that there was a bolt, by which any body might keep themselves in? - A. Any body might be in the cellar and not perceive them.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the press and those other things found, in the cellar or the vault? - A. In the vault there was a bench which I saw, where they might paper them up; it is in Ray's possession; there was some brown paper by it; after we had found these, I looked at the front cellar, and went up a pair of stairs and found the stair-case that leads into Mr. Bailey's shop, a broker, who is here; but against that door there were a couple of wooden spars fixed against the wall, that nobody, at Bailey's, could open that door, as it appeared to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that door appear to you to be opened lately? - A. Not at all; quite to the contrary; the two spars were fixed against the wall; and the cobwebs and dust all about it; on the examination of the prisoners, when they were committed, the money was looked at; and the halfpence I found in Mostyn's house, appear to have a ridge on one side; and comparing them with the dies found in that press, there is a flaw in that die; they correspond exactly; I have them here.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170026"></xptr>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You talked about the blank halfpence; they were nothing but blank pieces of copper, were not they? - A. Yes; such as I have seen in circulation, and do every day; but there were some struck with the dies.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Mostyn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been reading till you went in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - A. As workmen in general are.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing particular about him? - A. No; nor the woman neither.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went into Kelly's house, you asked Kelly, whether Mostyn used to come to that house; and he denied it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Where is Mostyn's house? - A. No. 1, Ar thur-street; and the other, No. 1, Bell-Alley; they are the next ally to one another; there is no communication between the two houses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. You tell us, that when you went to Kelly's house, that they opened the door, and told you, that if you would give your names, you should be admitted to see what you pleased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what kind of cellar is this; what may be the depth from the floor of the room to the ground of the cellar, into which you afterwards went? - A. I dare say, between eight and nine foot; I take it more nine than short of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a person being in that cellar could not, without assistance, get up into Kelly's room? - A. I got up with a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. There were three doors; the trap-door, through which you got into the cellar, another from the street, and another from Bailey's? - A. No; whatever communication from the street, must come through Bailey's shop, by taking up some part of the window in his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no other communication than that you saw, through Kelly's, and through the shop? - A. I searched attentively and could find none.</p>
               <p>Q.These vaults run under other houses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was this machine with which the dies were struck? - A. It is here.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the width of the trap-door? - A. Two foot.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get the machine up, could it have been introduced in at the trap-door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not bring it through that way? - A. No; because we had a coach brought to the door, and came through the broker's shop; the house was up an alley.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were there any stairs from this trapdoor to the cellar? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. But there were stairs to the broker's shop? - A. After I had got possession of the tools, with my candle, I went to the further end of the cellar, and found it boarded, not arched; I then went round through the street into Bailey's shop, and asked, who had the key of that door, (the door that was sparred); and they said, one Myers; I came to the further end of the cellar, with a sledge hammer, and he came and removed his goods.</p>
               <p>Q.It must have been some trouble to open the door going into that shop? - A. Yes; with a hammer.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no trouble the other way, and you chose that troublesome way? - A. The stock of the press is a very heavy piece of iron, and we chose that for the most convenient way.</p>
               <p>Q.Those bits of copper, that you found in Kelly's, were not stamped? - A. Ray has them here.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not stamped? - A. There were some stamped.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, that only those found in Mostyn's house were stamped? - A. I said, there were some found but I did not compare them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any boarding over this trap-door, which went into the cellar? - A. Yes; three boards nailed up.</p>
               <p>Q. It was so covered that you did not discover it at first? - A. We knew it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that block fixed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You know the prisoner Mostyn is a hatter, don't you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know that that was used in the hatting business? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. This block was not fixed? - A. This was fixed to the block.</p>

               <p>I am an officer: I went, on the 6th of February, to Mostyn's house, with my brother officers; Mostyn was sitting at the table; he had been reading; I secured the prisoner, and searched his pockets, and found these two papers; I stood over him all the time they were searching that house, and part of the time they were searching the other, (produces them).</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else? - A. No; then I went to Kelly's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Were you in the closet in Kelly's house? - A. I saw the place where Ray and the other officers went down; but I did not go down myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this closet very dark? - A. No; not when the door was open.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the door of the closet obvious to people's view? - A. Yes; young Kelly's hands were pretty dirty, as if he had been at work; the other officers were there before me.</p>

               <p>I went to Kelly's house, with Armstrong, Harper and Blackiter; I went to the back part of the house and heard a knocking; I said to Armstrong, they were knocking something to pieces, the curtain was not drawn quite close; I heard the knocking cease, and saw Kelly, the father, come out of a place on the outside of the house that looked like a closet; that closet was level with the back window; we could not get in at the back door, we knocked there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Kelly any thing in his hand? - A. Not that I observed; I went round to the front door, and there we got in; we went to the closet in the lower room, out of which I saw Kelly come; I went to this closet with Armstrong, we looked, and there was a hole about two foot square; the boards were cut, and a door pulled up; at one corner of it there was a new nail stuck in it, drove within a quarter of an inch of the head; I pulled it up and let myself drop into the cellar; Armstrong gave me a candle; the moment I dropped through this hole, there was a door open, and there were three large arches covered with brick; I looked in the first and saw nothing; I went into the middle one, and at the further end of it I saw a press fixed; I returned to the hole where I got down, and informed Armstrong that every thing was right, there was a press and every thing for coining in the cellar; Blackiter and Armstrong came down to me; these are the dies that were fixed in the press, there is a very particular mark in one of the dies.</p>
               <p>Court. Let the Jury look at it, and compare it with the mark in the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Ray. This halfpenny I found between the dies; all the things that I found in the cellar are here; I found a great many halfpence there, (producing them); I found a pair of trowsers, a jacket, and a bed-gown, and some bags with saw-dust, and sieves, they are all here; a paper of brimstone; I went the same evening again, and examined the situation of the premisses; the cellar is a very long one, it formerly belonged to a public-house, there is a flap in the street where the beer was let down, and another door that goes down a dozen stairs, but that is so barracaded with wood, that it is impossible for any body that lives in the front house to go down; Mr. Bailey, a broker, lives in the front house; then you go down fifteen or sixteen yards, and then a door opens that lets you into these three vaults; they are about twelve or fourteen yards in length, each of them; in one them there was a deep hole dug, where there was a great deal of water; there is no communication at all that I could see, but through this cellar, no way in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the prisoner Kelly's hands? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. All that you have been relating is with respect to Kelly's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Mostyn was not by? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. I understand you that this trapdoor was nailed down? - A. A new nail stuck in it, but not drove quite down.</p>
               <p>Q. And a cellar communicates? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long Kelly had lived in this house? - A. No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with the other officer to the prisoner Kelly's house, young Kelly was standing with his coat off; I looked at his hands, they were all black and greasy; I did not observe the elder Kelly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. He told you, I believe, that he had been cleaning shoes? - A. Yes; but I am sure it was not that; I did not see any shoes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Armstrong.) Look at all these implements produced by the other witnesses, and see what is the use of them; I believe you have had a great deal of experience in the coining business? - A. This is an edging engine, this is to round the edges; I have been at the apprehending of many coiners; I have always seen such as these.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That was found in Mostyn's house; that would not coin of itself without something else? - A. No; this is a stamping-press; here is a sieve; that when the halfpence, or money is coined, they fist it to get the saw-dust from it, and this is handier than a wire one; the saw-dust is mixed with oil to make them greasy, for they are boiled in brimstone; it puts a greasy black upon them, to make them better for circulation, it takes off the newness; this cross bar is a fly, a couple of weights are fixed at each end for farthings, it is lighter than the other; this is the fly, one seeds it, sitting in a chair, and two pull it round, and it receives the impression, either plain or whatever the dye is engraved<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170028"></xptr>with; this is fixed in a large piece of wood in a cellar, and then nothing can be heard but a jarring found, the earth keeps any person from hearing it; it flies downward, and here the dye is placed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say, from your experience, that these implements, found in Kelly's house, were complete for coining halfpence? - A. They will make plain halfpence, or with a stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the halfpence, those found at Mostyn's, and those found at Kelly's? - A. They are all counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. All those things found in Kelly's house, are compleat for coining? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What you found in Mostyn's house, could not be? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. Button-cutters make use of the same kind of presses? - A. I have seen them worked by the hand by women, it is too heavy a press for making buttons; besides, they generally work for buttons in garrets, not cellars.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What quantity of halfpence were found at Mostyn's? - A. Six papers; some stamped and some unstamped; some that are stamped appear of the date 1775; there are six papers, each containing 1l. 10s.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do any of those found at Mostyn's appear to have the flaw of the die found at Kelly's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many? - A. A great quantity; but I cannot ascertain, without it was counted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. There were some that had not that flaw? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all tied up in separate papers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you say, by looking at a piece of copper, whether it has been passed under the edging tool or not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at those found at Mostyn's. - A. Yes; they have all passed under the edging tool.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at some of those found at Kelly's, and see whether they have been under the edging tool? - A. Here are four of them that appear not to have been under the edging tool; the greater part of them have.</p>
               <p>Q. They are always passed under the edging tool before they are fit to circulate? - A. Generally, because they don't go so well; they are not reckoned finished, some call it rounding, and some edging; here are some that were found down with the press, and these have never been edged.</p>
               <p>Mostyn's defence. When the officers came into our house, I was reading over a book, and they asked me my name; I told them; they asked what I was; I said, a hatter; they went up stairs, and on the landing-place, I believe, they found these things; and then they went down stairs, and said, there was nothing there, only that block and that machine; and they took them away, and took me into custody; there is no communication between my house and Mr. Kelly's; that is all I know; the things were there, and they were left there by somebody.</p>
               <p>Kelly, the elder's, defence. Our premisses are seventy or eighty feet long; the front comes into Goswell-street, and the cellar runs under four houses; the next evidence, though he is against me, will prove, one of his children had like to have broke his neck down there; there are a great many communications; I am told it was a bad house before I came to it; these gentlemen, you know very well, swear for gain; they must get something by it; and when it is so; if they can swear a man's life away, and foul to, it is done; the man that is to come in next has been much urged against us; the Justice exposed him to us, or we did not know it; my son is apprenticed to me; I am a cabinet-maker; he is as innocent as the child unborn; I am a freeman of the city of London; he is only fifteen years old.</p>
               <p>Kelly, the younger's, defence. I know nothing about it; I know the hole was there before we came there.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mostyn). Q. Whether you mean to give any account of these things found in your house? - A. The engine has been left there by a person that desired me to take care of it; and the block to these halfpence was behind the door; they were left there; I did not know they were there.(The prisoner Kelly called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.)(The prisoner Mostyn called three witnesses, who gave him a good character).</p>

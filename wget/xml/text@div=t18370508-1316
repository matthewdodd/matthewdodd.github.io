                  </hi>. I keep the Jolly Farmers public house, near the cattle market, at Islington. On the 6th of May I went out, on receiving information, and saw the prisoner and another man running—I followed, and saw the prisoner throw this lead from him—I passed on, and took him into custody—-Nicholls took the lead up—it belongs to John Perkins—I made the model for it, and it passed through my hands—it was the trap of the water closet.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Francis-street, Hoxton. On this Saturday, I saw the prisoner take this piece of lead from his trowsers—he was trying to run with it, and he ran after he got rid of it—Fysh was after him—there were two nails in it when I picked it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner in the privy near Mr. Perkin's house—this lead was taken from the privy—I spoke to him—as soon as he was gone I went into the privy, and found the boards ripped up, and the lead gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I had seen the lead safe half an hour before, and while he went in I waited, and went in directly and missed it—there were three taken before.</p>

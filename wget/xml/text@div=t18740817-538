                  </hi>. I am a surgical instrument maker, of 239,. Tottenham Court Road—I was plaintiff in the action of Woolhams <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Sparks, and on 1st July having obtained a judgment debtor summons, I went to Mr. Spark's office, 3, Craven Street, Strand, to serve it—he calls himself a broker, but it is a long firm of swindlers—I saw the prisoner there, who said that Mr. Sparks was not in, and he could not tell me when I could see him, or make an appointment—I then watched the house from the outside, taking care that the prisoner should not see me, end in about half an hour he went out with an envelope in his hand, as if he was going to the Post Office, but he did not cross over to the Post Office, he turned round the corner at" Charing Cross, and I followed him up Trinity Court or Place, where he met Mr. Sparks, and they walked up to the top of the Court by themselves—nobody else was in the Court—I followed them up the Court, and as they turned round, I confronted them, looked at Sparks, and said in the prisoner's hearing "You have given us a great deal of trouble over this judgment summons by keeping out of the way; it is no use now, here it is, and if you wish to see my authority for serving it, you can see it"—he stood motionless, and looked very angrily at me, but did not speak, nor did the prisoner—Sparks wore a waistcoat which was very open in the bosom, and I was about to put the summons into his bosom, but I offered it to him first, and he would not take it—the prisoner reached over my arm., snatched it oat of my hand, and began tearing it up, and threw the pieces into my face, his fingers touched my cheek the first time he threw them, and he continued tearing it and throwing the fragments for about a dozen yards—I said "You give me your name, will you?"—he said "I'll name you with the devil to you"—he appeared so fierce, that I thought he would strike me, and ran out of the Court to a policeman who was at the entrance of the Court who went down, and the prisoner gave his name and address.</p>

I am an advertising agent, but have no office at present—I was in company with Mr. Sparks on 1st July in Trinity Place—the prisoner came towards us—I did not see Woolhams at that time, but he afterwards rushed between Churchill and me with a piece of paper folded in his hand, which he thrust into Mr. Sparks' breast, inside his waistcoat, saying "You know all about it"—Sparks said "What is it?" and took it out of his breast, and handed it to the prisoner, who immediately tore it in pieces, and threw it out of his hand—the prosecutor said" I will give you in charge for an assault," and ran out of the passage into the street—he was very much ex<lb></lb>cited indeed—neither the prisoner nor Sparks said anything after it was torn up—the three of us walked out of the passage after the prosecutor—he turned to the right, and we turned to the left towards Scotland Yard, and in about five minutes we were stopped by a policeman—I did not hear anybody state what the paper was till after the policeman came up—when the prosecutor said "I give this man in charge for an assault"—the police<lb></lb>man said "I don't see that he has assaulted you"—I said "It is merely a piece of paper may have blown upon him"—there was at no time any des<lb></lb>cription of what the piece of paper was which was torn up.</p>

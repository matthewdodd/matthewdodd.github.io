Martins, the bankers, and saw the cheque presented and heard the answer given—after that I went to the house and reached there about 12 o'clock—this was the 14th, on the Mon<lb></lb>day—the transaction was on the 12th(Saturday)—it was too late on the Saturday to present the cheque—there was a servant sweeping the snow from the door, and I asked for Mrs. Martin—I did not see Mrs. Martin, or Catchpole, nor Mr. Martin—I went again the same evening with the same result; I went again the next day with a like result, and again the following day, I think twice with the same result—neither of the prisoners called at our premises as she bad promised, and I never saw them until they were in custody—I have since seen the goods in the custody of the police, and identified them.</p>

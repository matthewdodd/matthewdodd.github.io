               <p>Q. Did you say something came out of you or something came in? - Something directed me within; when I got up stairs I was greatly surprised at seeing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200132"></xptr>my doors a little opened, I left it perfectly safe locked, I saw my door a little opened which startled me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been come out of your room? - I suppose about twenty minutes or half an hour, it was dark when I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock your door? - I did, and I had the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair of stairs is your room? - One pair; I rushed in and he stood still and never spoke, I seized on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar the person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts did you see him? - It was not quite in the middle, it might be about half a yard from the middle; he stood still in the middle of the room, not quite so far as the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a candle in your hand? - No, there was a reflection of the lamp, by which I saw the man; there is a lamp exactly opposite my door, in the street close opposite to the door of the room; there is but one room on a floor in the house. I ran and seized on him and held him with all my might, I did not speak nor he did not speak, but he seemed to wish to speak but did not; I held him with all the strength that ever I could, he rushes from me, he did not strike me nor offer it, he rushed from me, with that I scrieked murder, stop thief, he went down stairs, he rushed down stairs, and he stumbled on some of the stairs on which he was, immediately I heard a woman come out, with a candle in her hand on my alarm, and she collared him, he wrested from her, and I ran after him, and pursued him crying stop thief, in the street, till he was taken. Mr. Leclere took him; I saw him till he was taken, be stumbled over a post by the Thirteen Cantons, that was the means that he was taken in King-street, then he was surrounded and seized; I went home, when they said, that he was secured; I did not know I had lost any thing then, and went up into my lodging room, then I looked and saw that the lock was forced open, the latch of the lock was out, I put my key in to unlock the door, and it would not take the impression as usual, it appeared forced as far as that. The lock was out, and I could not return it with my key.</p>
               <p>Q. If the lock was out there must have been force to the part where the lock was? - There was some appearance, the staple was on, but it was looser than usual; when I came to look round the room, I missed some things directly out of a soul clothes bag, there were two dirty shirts, and a silk handkerchief, and a child's gown, and a pudding cloth, all the things mentioned in the indictment; a pair of stays hung up in a bag, and a clean shirt, marked J. F. No. 4.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Who advised you to say that the lock was in that state? whether you was not advised to say so by the person who lives in the house? - Nobody said any such thing to me, nor was I ever before a justice or peace before this occasion, and I am ignorant of all matters. I am in my eight and fortieth year.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any conversation with the constable about this - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The constable that has laid this breaking against me lives in the house, and the first constable that took me, told me that the other constable had advised him to swear my life away for the sake of the reward.</p>

            ; the house belongs to Abraham Barrier; on Tuesday night last Mrs. Fletcher went out of my apartment to go up stairs, as soon as she got up stairs she screamed out violently, I ran to see what was the matter, as soon as I got my door open, I heard her cry stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know the prisoner before? - No, I saw the prisoner running down stairs, as he got on the two bottom stairs, he had like to fall, I ran and I got hold of him, but he soon got from me, I could not hold him fast enough, and a piece of his neckcloth came off in my hand, he got away from me, I followed after him, crying stop thief, by that means he was taken, but I did not see him taken; a man in the court took him, Mr. Leclere. I am positive the prisoner at the bar is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a bundle? - No, he had not as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up afterwards to Mrs. Fletcher's room? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the lock? - I did, the lock and bolt were both out of its place, the bolt was out of the lock instead of being in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see whether there was the appearance of any force? - It was forced, but how I cannot tell, the catch was forced too; I am sensible it was a good firm lock and catch too.</p>

F. and one cotton handkerchief, one pudding cloth, and one check apron; I have got them here; likewise in his breeches pocket I found two false keys, and one pick-lock; the keys have been filed; I then took him into charge. (The keys produced.) I kept him in the shop, and one Mr. Barclay, constable of St. Ann's, wanted to force him from me; I took him to Marlborough-street, but the justices not sitting that evening, I brought him back again to my father's shop.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you look at the door? - I did not positively look at the door, but I looked at the lock, the bolt of the lock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200134"></xptr>was out, it appeared to be forced open, but in what manner I am no judge.</p>

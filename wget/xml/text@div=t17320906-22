The Prisoner was Quartered at my House, and behaved himself very civilly, so that I trusted him to draw Drink. The Deceased was Quarter'd at the next Alehouse, and on the 8th of June, between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon, he came drunk to my House, and called for a Pint of Beer. The Prisoner at first refused to draw him any, but at last let him have 3 Pints, one after another. The Deceased then grew extreamly troublesome, upon which the Prisoner desired him to go out; but the Deceased swore that he would not. The Prisoner endeavour'd to carry him out; upon which they struggled together, and the Deceased beat the Prisoner violently. The Prisoner went into his own Room; the Deceased follow'd him, but we pull'd him back, and got him out of Door, and shut it upon him. He staid there damning his Blood, and would not be persuaded to go away. Then the Prisoner came down with his Sword drawn, and got out of the Window to the Deceased. I was frighted, and turned away, so that I did not see any thing farther done.</p>

They struggled in the Entry, and fought, the Prisoner's Coat was torn; the Deceased beat him, and dragg'd him about the House. The Prisoner got up Stairs, and staid some Time, in the mean while we got the Deceased out. Then the Prisoner came down with a drawn Sword, and went to the Door, and pass'd at the Deceased. We got the Prisoner in again, and shut the Door, and then he got out o'th' Window, and struck the Deceased on the Head, with his Sword. The Deceased fell down, and the Prisoner upon him, for the Deceased had hold of the Prisoner's Hair, and pull'd him down. At last he let go his Hold, got up went a little Way, and fell down again. He was afterwards sent to the Hospital, where his Hand was cut off, and he died.</p>

I keep a public house: on the 26th of April, Bridgman came to my house, and said he had some rice to dispose of, and said that he had brought it from Carolina himself; he said he had a barrel of it; he shewed me a sample. I went on board the ship; he rolled out a small cask; as he rolled it out, the cask rattled; I said I do not think this is rice, so he shook it, and said no, I do not think it is rice; said I, what is it? he said throw it over board, we shall have the officers come down, and we shall have the ship exchequered; I told him he need not throw it over board, if he could get it on shore, and I could have a sample, I had no objection to buy it; he asked me if I could get him a waterman; I said yes; he asked me to send it to my house; I said no, I should have it seized; I sent a waterman; I believe he brought it on shore. A little after that the waterman came to me with a sample of it; I went and enquired the value of it, and some offered me 3 s. 6 d. others 3 s. 9 d. I offered him 3 s. 6 d. he would not take less than 4 s. I believe the mate might easily have robbed the ship before that time if he chose.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the ship cleared?</p>
               <p>Anderson. Not then, but all the cargo was out when the ship was in the dock; he could have handed it over the ship side into the street.</p>

            . I am a potatos merchant and dealer in coals.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070052"></xptr>Q. Did you hear Captain Jones say any thing to Preston about this?</p>
               <p>Brown. I heard Jones say there were some sweepings on board the ship, he might make the best use of them he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing about the cask?</p>
               <p>Brown. I heard nothing about the cask.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. Could this be called sweepings?</p>
               <p>Jones. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been broke after you took it in from Carolina?</p>
               <p>Jones. No; we had a hard gale of wind, and a large quantity of rice casks stove on the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. It was that that was sweepings?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mean he should open any casks?</p>
               <p>Jones. No. He has a wife and family in America therefore I do not give evidence of the value, as I hope the Court will be favourable to him.</p>

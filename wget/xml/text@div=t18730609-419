                  </hi>. I live at 7, Stainsbury street, Bethnal Green, and am the wife of Francies Fisher—the prisoner is my brother—he is not married—i don't know his address—I think it is in Blue Anchor Lane—my father has been dead eleven years—I don't want to punish my brother, I want to pardon him, I don't wish to say anything against him—on the evening of 5th May I was at the Green Man public-house, in cambridge road, between 8 and 9'o clock—my brother was with me—we were having stout together—he acoused me of something with my father—I denied it—(I am thirty<lb></lb>five years of age)—he said it was true—I said it was not—he has always been a good brother to me up to the present tme, we never had an angry word—we had never had any conversion about this before—I never knew there was such a thing in existence—he had never made any such charge against me before, nor any of them—I have had my brother to live with me and I have brought my sisters up, and we always lived happy togather—he was very tipey, I had been drinking all day—he has worked at peek &amp; Frean's, the biscuit manufacturares, for years, and bears a very good characters—after talking about me and my father he put his hand on my shoulder as if he was going to tell me something, and I don't remember anything else after that—I felt the knife afterwords—I did not feel anything then—he put his hand on my soulder—I felt the blood come down my neck, but Idid not feel the cut—I had not been taking more drink than was good for me—we had only had two pints of stout, one pint in the Weavr's Arms, and another at the Green Man—I am not on ther habit of taking anything; we aere about twenty minutes at the Weaver's Arms—after I felt the blood coming down my neck, I don't remember anything else till I found myself at the police-station—he did not say anything to me when he put his hand on my shoulder—he laid hold of me with one hand and put the other up—I think he laid hold of my right shoulder—he was standing in front of me—he kept saying it was true, and I kept saying it was not—I don't know what led to his saying it—I did not see any knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head barman at the Green Man Tavern, in the Cambridge Road—I was behind the bar on the night in question, and saw the prisoner and his sister there—I served them with some stout—he was perfectly sober; if he had been drunk I should not have served him—she was perfectly sober—they were in a private compartment by themselves—I heard her call out "For God's sake, George, don't!"—I immediately went to that part of the bar which looked into that compartment—he had one hand on her shoulder, and a knife in the other—I can't say in which hand it was—it was two or three inches from her throat, which was bleeding—I immediately reached across the counter and seized hold of his hand and arm with the knife in it, and sent the potman for a constable—he did not say anything, that I remember, except "Oh, Nancy!"—my fellow barman took the knife from the counter—the prisoner did not talk like a man that had had too much drink.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S., 254, Bethnal Green Road—on 5th May I was sent for to see the prosecutrix at the police-station, she was very faint and excited at times, also hysterical—I found on the left side of her throat a cut made by a sharp instrument, extending across the centre of the throat from left to right, partially through the skin, about five inches in length—also a cut on the right side, extending midway between the collar<lb></lb>bone and the right cheek, over the lower jaw—that had penetrated the skin entirely for about one inch under the jaw, from whence blood flowed—they were skin wounds; none of them were serious—they were of such a character as might have been inflicted with this knife, they could not have been done with a great deal of force, except the one under the jaw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I had been drinking all day. As I had not seen my sister for a long time I thought I would go and see her. I have no recol<lb></lb>lection of anything till I met her. I have no recollection of the first public-house. The witness Coote says I was perfectly sober; he says he saw blood flowing, which was impossible where my sister was standing; the doctor says the wound was on the right side, and Coote could not have seen that from the bar. I recollect going into the Green Man with my sister and standing there talking, but upon what subject I have no recollection. I recollect flying into a passion about something and seizing her by the throat, but I had the knife in my hand at the time, and she caught hold of my hand, and she was as likely to cut it as me. I have no recollection whatever of using the weapon to her throat. When we got outside the public-house, she caught hold of my arm. I said "Go away, don't follow me, you will get locked up." I called to somebody to take hold of her and then I saw that her throat was cut. I said "For God's sake, take this woman away; she is my sister, her throat is cut. "If I had wished to do her any harm there are dark places at the back where I could have inflicted a wound upon her, but I had no</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This letter countermanded the order, as time would not admit of reference, as the customer required the goods at once.</hi>) After the prisoner was released we received from Moss, Ryland's a post-office order 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this is the letter that came with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I now take the signature of the letter of the 26th October to be Blenkiron &amp; Co.—I could not make out then whether it was "iron" or "eron"—I sent the goods to 37, Wood Street—I directed them "Blenkwood"—at the moment I sent the samples and wrote that letter I did not personally know the firm I was sending to, when I came to London I called upon Messrs. Ashhurst, Morris &amp; Co., and they took out an attachment—I called with them at the Mayor's Court—that was with reference to the account at the City and County Bank—I made an affidavit in that case—I understood it was for an attachment against the banking account of this man—that was my object in going there—I had a bill from him showing that he had an account at the City and County Bank—this letter is in the handwriting of one of our clerks—it is dated 9th March, 1874, addressed to Moss, Ryland &amp; Co.: "Dear Sirs,—We are in receipt of your favour of the 7th instant, enclosing 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., placed to the credit of the account, with thanks.

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At that time I was in London, and they did not know in Belfast what had been discovered here—I arrived in London on Tuesday morning, the 24th—I went to Messrs. Ashhurst &amp; Morris shortly after 10 o'clock, and what was done at the Mayor's Court was done by their advice—I never intended to forego the Criminal hold I had if fraud had been committed—I did not know that he had not 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at his bankers, it would not have affected the Criminal proceedings—I showed my solicitors the letters, signed Blenkiron &amp; Co.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a buyer in the service of Dent, Allcroft &amp; Co., who carry on business at 97, Wood Street—I know a younger Blenk<lb></lb>arn than the prisoner, from having lived in our house as a junior employ—I believe he is the prisoner's son—young Blenkarn represented himself to me as the agent of Moss, Ryland &amp; Co., a firm I had not hitherto known—he did not give me the address of Moss, Ryland's, he gave me his own address, Little Love Lane—on or about the 21st November, 1873, I purchased 150 dozen pocket handkerchiefs, at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this was the invoice</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070108"></xptr>
               <p>which was sent, it was dated the 21st November—they were paid for on the 25th November, with this cheque, for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was the nett amount of the parcel—on 10th December I had another transaction with young Blenkarn, and then I purchased 100 dozen pocket handkerchiefs, at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per dozen, this was the invoice, and they were paid for with this cheque, for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 13th December; both the cheques are to the order of Moss, Rylands &amp; Co., and endorsed by them—the endorsement on this memorandum is in my handwriting, it was left by a messenger when the second transaction took place. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "100 dozen of handkerchiefs, hemmed and folding boxes, as per order, at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., less 2 1/2 prompt, clear as before, should they be sent in before to-day, do not deliver.") They were promised at an earlier date, but coming late, before delivering the goods they asked the question—I wrote across the memorandum "Up to the mark, send them in at once," and delivered it to the messenger, and the goods came in due course, these papers are copies of the invoices which have been shown to me.</p>

Lindsay.</p>

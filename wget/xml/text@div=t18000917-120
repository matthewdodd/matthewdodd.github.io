               <p>JOHN BLANCARN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a tide-surveyor: On the 22d of August, between six and seven in the morning, the prisoner came on board the ship from shore, went forward into the galley, came out again with a cleaver in his hand, and said he was going to grind it for the steward of the ship, and he was to have a bottle of arrack for so doing; he got into a lighter; I asked him what he had got before him; he said, nothing at all, only the cleaver; I insisted on his coming on board again, to let me see: when he came on board I was endeavouring to feel what he had before him, and he resisted my searching him; however I did search him, and found a bag of pepper under his frock, at his left-hand side; I delivered him to Mr. Timbrell, the commanding officer; and the pepper, to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When he was on board, the hatchways were all shut down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you never stopped a man smuggling goods on shore, who has told you that he had nothing? - A. It is a common thing, he said, he had it from a black man; the blacks were all called upon deck, and he was desired to pick him out, but he did not chuse it.(John Shrimpton, the officer, produced the pepper).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It was impossible for me to have stolen any pepper; I gave a black man some tobacco for it; I thought it was his own property.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>

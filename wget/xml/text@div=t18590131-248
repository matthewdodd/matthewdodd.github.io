                  </hi>. I am a Christian visitor, and live in Willens-row, Kentish Town. In 1856 my wife was unfortunately deranged, and she was conveyed to St. Pancras Workhouse—Mr. Ford ordered me to pay 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week for her maintenance to Mr. Birchmore—she went there on 3rd De<lb></lb>cember, 1856—the first payment was due on 10th December—I paid that to the prisoner, and he put his initials to the sum in this book (<hi rend="italic">producing it.</hi>)—I paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 10th, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 17th, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 24th, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 31st, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 7th of January; and on the 14th my wife was removed to the hospital—I paid the money to the prisoner in the lower office, under the hall—the entries are in this book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Director of the poor of the parish of St. Pancras, and one of the audit committee—the prisoner was relieving overseer of St. Pancras—there was a written appointment in 1857—I have not got it—he has told me he received money on behalf of the parish—he paid money from week to week—the money he had collected—I did not see him pay it, but I saw the book in which he professed to enter the money he received and paid—this is the book—I cannot say of my own knowledge whether Mr. Copar had acted before the prisoner did—the prisoner's course of business was to enter the monies he received during the week, to pay over the money to Mr. Hibbard, the clerk of the directors, handing the book in; and that book was handed in to the audit committee on the following Friday—we examined it—I was not present when the money was paid over—I know what was the practice—I never heard from the prisoner that he paid over any money that was not entered in the book—I cannot tell at all from anything the prisoner said, whether any sums were paid in by the prisoner without their being entered in the book—when these particular sums of money received from Griffith were called to his attention, he did not then say that he had paid these sums—he acknowledged he was a defaulter—on the 15th of October the audit committee made a certain report relative to Mr. Birchmore, and on the 16th of October he called on me at my private house, and told me that the half-year's dividend of some Consols which he had received in April had not been entered, and I then, not having a suspicion that he was a defaulter in any other amount, told him he had better go and receive the other half-year's dividend, and pay the two half-years' in together—he then asked me if I thought the audit committee would qualify or alter their report—I told him I could not say, but I would summon them for the following Mon<lb></lb>day, and give him the benefit of making any statement that he might think proper to make—the committee met in consequence, on the 18th, the fol<lb></lb>lowing Monday, and the prisoner came before them and made a statement relative to the half-year's dividend—he was then asked if he was deficient in any other sums—he replied, there might be one or two trifling amounts, but if he were allowed till the following Friday he should be prepared to give an exact statement—the special committee was appointed by the board to meet on the Friday, according to that request—on that Friday morning, the 22nd, he again called at my house, and said he wished to make a com<lb></lb>munication to me—I told him I would rather not hear it; I would much rather he should leave it until the committee met—he begged me to hear</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901310030"></xptr>
               <p>him, and gave as a reason for so doing, that he would much rather com<lb></lb>municate the case to me than it should be left to one of the directors who, he said, prosecuted him to find it out—he then said he was a defaulter to about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that his surety was good—he then asked me if I thought the directors would consent to his liquidating it by retaining half his salary—I told him most certainly they would not do that, and the least punish<lb></lb>ment he could expect would be dismissal—he then said he hoped they would not prosecute him—I told him that, personally, I had no wish to do so; but it was impossible for me to tell what the board would do—that was about ten o'clock in the morning—the committee met at two o'clock, and he attended the committee, but I should say that I advised him to make what amends he could by telling the truth—he attended the com<lb></lb>mittee in the afternoon; I don't remember that he attended with his receipt book—a paper was produced, which I have in my hand, showing all the accounts—Griffith's account was called to his attention, and he was asked if he had received it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> But you told him to make what amends he could by telling the truth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and I told him just before that I could not tell whether the parish would prosecute him or not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are one of the directors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have been so since 1856—previous to that I had nothing to do with the parish—the prisoner was relieving officer and nominal overseer—as relieving officer I am not aware that any charge was made against him—these are monies received by him as servant to the directors—in 1857 there was an appointment made—he was appointed by the Magistrate, no doubt—I can't tell whether there was an appointment in 1856—he is elected every year by the directors on their first meeting after Easter—the vestry appoint the relieving officer—the auditors were appointed in June, 1858—we disputed the authority of the Poor Law Board, and have had some trouble with our officers—some have absconded—the clerk of the works was taken in custody: not by my authority—I don't know whether one director charged another with stealing a handful of oatmeal—it was thought not a proper thing for him to do—the directors dining together at the expense of the parish was abolished in 1856—the prisoner was to pay over the money he received from Griffith—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901310031"></xptr>
               <p>was only nominal overseer—I always understood that he filled exactly the same office as Copar did—I have looked over this book—here is 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received on the 6th of December; I don't know what that means—all the money put in here was received—I was one of the persons to whom this book was in the habit of being submitted—five men chosen by the rate-payers generally were the auditors—this book was passed by the audit committee—the prisoner said he was a defaulter to the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the amount he admitted was 174<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid by the surety—the sums received for persons in the workhouse were to be paid to the prisoner, and he was to pay them to Mr. Hibbard—these sums are paid for persons in the workhouse, and in the asylum particularly for lunatics.</p>

On 11th December, and for some time before, I was foreman to Mr. Hodson, baker, in Kennington-park—the prisoner was employed there under me—on 10th December I was putting a batch of bread into the even—the prisoner and another lad, named Thomas Baker, were present—they began giggling and laughing—I asked what they meant by it—they had been going on for some time, and I had spoken several times about it, on other days—I hardly know what answer the prisoner made—he was saucy—I spoke to him a second time, and he got up in a passion—we had a few words in the way of a quarrel, angry words, and I struck the pri<lb></lb>soner on the nose—I did not strike him more than once—he did not say anything that I am aware of upon that—his nose bled, and he then went out—I saw him again about half-past 11 the same night—we had a disturb<lb></lb>ance—Baker neglected to do his work—I said it was all Denton's fault that the disturbance was caused, and I said, "It's no use any of you trying to domineer over me, for if I cannot manage you with my hands, I will manage you with the potato smasher"—we worked on till about half-past 8 next morning—the prisoner then went out after he had done his work—about a quarter to 9 I was engaged in cleaning a tin, and, while doing so, I felt a violent blow on the back part of my thigh; at the same instant I heard a report of fire arms—I felt a sort of numbness in the foot—I turned round and saw the prisoner about three or four yards of—he was running out of the bakehouse—at the time I felt the blow, I heard the prisoner say, "Hit we again"—Mr. Hodson carue in, and I was conveyed to bed—about half an hour afterwards the prisoner was brought to my bedside—I was suffering</p>

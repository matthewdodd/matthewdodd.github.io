                  </hi>. I am messenger to the Era Insurance Company, and live at No. 25, Old Jewry. On 30th June, about 10 o'clock at night, I met the prisoners in Moorgate Street—Goodwin staggered against me, as if she was intoxicated—she asked me to give her a glass—I told her I thought she had had one too many already, and told her to go home—she had hold of my arm; I drew it away, and felt a jerk at my guard, which was round my neck, forced myself from her, and missed my watch, which was safe not two minutes before—I laid hold of her, till a policeman came, and gave her into custody, then ran after Ricker, detained her, and gave her into custody—she said that she had not got my watch—I said, "I did not say that you had"—I had only said, "I must detain you; I have lost my watch"—I gave 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it.</p>

               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge her with the theft - A. On the 28th I went out to my employ; I left my children in my house. I returned home at half past past nine at night; I missed the sheet from my bed. I am sure it was on my bed when I went out. I saw my sheet again on the 18th of October, at Mr. Brooks's, the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of your own knowledge that the prisoner was at your house that day, do you - A. No, not of my own knowledge.</p>

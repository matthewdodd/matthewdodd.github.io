               <p>Where is the bill and receipt? - The prisoner took it away, he then said he did not know how to give me my share of it, he had an uncle in town, and he believed he could get forty or fifty pounds of him, to give me my share of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he tell you where his uncle lived? - No, Sir, he did not, before he went out to go to his uncle there was another gentleman come in, and said he was a Wine Merchant in Bishopsgate-street, at No. 19, and he shewed the bill and receipt to him, and the ring; says he how came you by it, and the wine merchant wanted him to leave it in his hands, till he went to his uncle's; he returned in about ten minutes, and he said his aunt was gone into the country to lay-in, and his uncle was gone to see her, the prisoner said he was a gentleman's servant, and lived with a single gentleman, and he must go, and the wine and liquor merchant said, if you have a mind to leave it in my hands, it will be as safe as if it was in your own pocket, till it can be settled; but he was not willing to leave it in his hands, unless I would leave something in his hands along with it, and he asked me what money I had, if I could raise five, or ten, or fifteen pounds, I told him I had not it about me, but I believed I had a friend in town, that I could borrow that value of: but he was not willing I should go to borrow the money, for says he, he will want to know what it was for, and I should not chuse it, he said he thought it might be of some value, and there might be hand bills out about it, or be put into the papers that a lady had lost it; he asked me if I had a watch, I told him I had never a watch, then he asked me what money I had, I told him very trifling, the value of two or three shillings, so the wine merchant called me out of the room, and asked me to raise the value of four or five pounds, and says he if you can raise that, it will be as safe as if you had it in your own pocket, till the matter can be settled; I told him I could not raise it, so we went into the room again where the prisoner sat, and he said he must go directly, then the wine merchant said to me, if you have ever a watch give it to me, it will be safe till you can settle it, which will be between six and seven in the evening, when the prisoner said his uncle would be at home, and I left my watch and half a crown, I had but three shillings in my pocket, I gave my watch to the wine merchant, and we was to meet again, they gave me directions where to find them both.</p>

               <p>Court. So the wine merchant took away the ring and watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow Prisoner's Counsel. So you understand the law to be that as the prisoner had found it, he had the best title and you was intitled to part? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Who went out of the room first? - They both went out before me.</p>
               <p>Did not you stay and dine there? - No, I only staid while we drank our liquor.</p>
               <p>Where did you dine that day? - At the Alphabet in Stanhope-street.</p>
               <p>Did not the wine merchant dine with you? - I am very clear he did not, I should have been very glad to have seen him at dinner.</p>
               <p>Then you did invite him? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You looked on Mr. Jones to be a very honest and good sort of a man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And when he told you your watch and money would be safe, you believed him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was upon the faith of that promise that you gave him your watch and money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He told you he was a housekeeper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Would you have parted with your watch and money, unless you had thought they had been honest men? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The prisoner never had your watch or your money? - No, it was delivered into Jones's hands, they seemed to talk as perfect strangers to each other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashurst. Who began first conversing with Jones? - The prisoner, when Jones first came in the prisoner shewed him the bill and receipt, he says do you know any thing of this; no says he, how came you by it, he said he found it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe you considered this as a very valuable prize at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was a little shy of the prisoner's going away with the ring? - Yes, as he had offered me a share of it, he proposed that himself, Jones mentioned to him that the young man would not like he should go away with the ring, I said as he had brought me there I should not.</p>
               <p>Look at this paper, and tell me if that is your name and writing? - It is my name, it was drawn up that it was not to be parted with, without we were both present.</p>
               <p>Who wrote that? - Jones wrote it.</p>

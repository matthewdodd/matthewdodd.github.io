I am an attendant at the Strand Theatre; I have been there about seven years—I am there to prevent persons selling tickets out<lb></lb>side—on 4th April I was in attendance, from half past 6 up to 7 o'clock, in the gallery, and a man came and told me there were two men selling tickets—I left, and went to the door, where I saw the prisoner and another man with him—I said, "You know you are doing wrong by doing that here" (they were selling tickets); "you had better go away; if any of my <hi rend="italic">governors</hi> see you, you will get me in a row"—the prisoner said, "Who are you?"—I said, "If you will stop till such time as the policeman comes, I will let you know who I am"—he said, "I suppose you are some b—detective," and he up with his fist and hit me a severe blow in the left eye, which gave me a severe black eye—he then ran for about forty-five yards—I ran after him, and overtook him; I caught him by the collar of the coat, and held him till the constable came up—before he came up the prisoner kicked me severely about the privates—when the constable came up I gave him into custody—there was a great mob—I said to the constable, "I give him in charge for striking me; he has been selling tickets at the door, my <hi rend="italic">governors</hi> will see to that; I will give him in charge for striking me in the street"—he turned and said, "I will give you in charge for robbing me of my purse and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., snatching it out of my hand"—I had not done so—the policeman caught hold of me—I said, "You know me very well, I am a man different to that; leave go of me, I will walk quietly to the station"—he let go, and I went to the station—I was searched, and nothing was found on me but my own <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi>—I was committed to take my trial—the prisoner was let go—I was in custody up to the trial at Westminster—when the trial came on, the prisoner appeared as the prosecutor—I defended myself, as I am only a poor man—I put questions to the prisoner—I asked him where he lived, and he said at No. 6, Wellclose Square—I asked him whether he ever got his living at anything else but ivory turning, as he had described him<lb></lb>self as an ivory turner in the charge sheet—he said, "No"—I then asked him whether he ever got his living by selling sham sovereigns in the street—he said, "No"—I then asked him whether he had ever sold rings in the street—he said, "No"—then the Judge asked him a few questions—I asked him whether he had ever gone by any other name except Anderson—his answer was, "No"—the Judge asked him, in my hearing, if he had ever gone by or used the name of Barnett, or Moses Aaron, and he said, "No"—the Judge asked him if he had been in prison under the name of Barnett Aaron, or William Barnett, and he said, "No"—the Judge asked him if he had ever been in the House of Correction, and he said, "No"—he was asked if he had ever been convicted under the name of William Barnett, for having assaulted Eliezer Bath—he said, "No," he had never been in any prison at all; he had never been convicted at all, nor been in prison in any shape or form, in Whitecross Street, or otherwise—I was acquitted on that occasion.</p>

             had some word about pileing some coach fellies in Mr. More's wharf. They went backwards into the stern of the barge and strip'd to fight. They went at it at once. Philips was naked, the other in his shirt. Beck knock'd Philips down on his back. They got up again, and I'd have had them put their cloaths on, but they would not and went at it again; they had three or four blows, and the deceased received two blows, one on his ribs, the other on his temples, upon which he fell and never spake more.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he fall ?</p>
               <p>Price. He fell upon his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he die of the blows he received at that time?</p>
               <p>Price. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be in good health before?</p>
               <p>Price. He did.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did this quarrel begin?</p>
               <p>Price. In the fore part of the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go backwards by consent to fight ?</p>
               <p>Price. They did, and had a fair set to. I'd have had the deceased put on his cloaths and he would not, but would fight on. The prisoner is a good natur'd man.</p>

            . I was on board when the prisoner and the deceased fought. I heard them quarrelling as I was pilling of the fellies in Mr. More's wharf, and heard them agree to go back in the barge to fight. At first the deceased knock'd down the prisoner. They both fell, and they got up again and fell to it again; and I saw two blows strack upon the deceased by the prisoner, one on the head, the other about the belly part; he then fell forward on his hands and face, and never spoke a word, not living ten minutes after. There was a surgeon fetch'd in order to let him blood, but he did not bleed. The prisoner put on his cloaths, cry'd very sadly, and ran out of the barge immediately.</p>

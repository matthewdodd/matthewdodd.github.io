On 20th March, from information I received, I went, about the middle of the day, to 19, Blue Anchor-alley, the prisoner's shop and residence—I saw him on the other side of the counter—I told him I was an officer, and said, "Have you any uppers in your possession?"—he said, "No; I have nothing of the sort"—I said, "Have you any uppers at all; or anything of the sort?"—he said, "No; I have not, who do you mean?"—I said, "Messrs. Hickson's, of Smithfield"—he I said, "No; I have none of their's"—I said, "I have reason to believe you have some here, will you allow me to look?"—he said, "Where is your warrant?"—I pulled out my book and showed him my warrant-card, which plain clothes officers carry with them as an authority—he opened the door, and I walked in behind the counter—he went to a corner, and took down a curtain which covered a recess—I commenced searching, and the first lot I laid hold of were some of Messrs. Hickson's, and two pairs of uppers, and two pairs of soles tied to them—the soles had Messrs. Hickson's stamp upon them—I asked him to account for those goods—he said that he could not, no more than that he bought them—I said, "Who did you buy them off?"—he said, "I do not know; if they want them back again I will sell them with a little</p>

               <p>profit to myself"—I found a great quantity of uppers, but I called his atten<lb></lb>tion to these first—I said, "Do not you keep a book?"—he said, "Only that one"—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was lying on the counter, and I said, "What does this relate to?"—he said, "To a few shillings which I lend to the neighbours in the court"—I searched further, and found 152 pairs of uppers, 132 soles and pieces of leather for making soles, and about 21 pairs of boots unfinished—there was some of Mr. Josephs' among them—here are three pieces of leather, and an odd boot, not quite finished, stamped with Josephs' stamp—I took possession of all the articles, and took the prisoner in custody—while I was talking to him one of Hickson's men came in—after I had made the charge at the station, the sergeant asked what account he could give of the articles—he said, "I know who I had them of, but I do not know where they live"—he was asked the names, and said that he knew them, but he did not tell them to us.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know the names of the workmen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Pretty well—I can say that I have had no workman named Ball for the last six months—I have not gone so far back as two years, because this boot has been cut out within the last six months—the names of all the workmen are entered in the work-book by a clerk, named Castle—he is not here—he could only tell you by the list the same as I do—he does not make a list of the names so that he might omit one; but he enters the names of the men in their accounts—the book is not here—I have had no such person as Stone, a workman, during the last seven or eight months—work like this is given out to workmen to be made into boots, which they bring back made—these uppers were cut out on 21st February, and these others about, the middle of January—I know that by certain marks on them, which lead me to the men, and by referring to the men's books I know the time—the cutter is not here, or his book; but there are several references as to each individual cutting—I also recognise them as bearing my stamp, and as cut from my leather—I cannot tell when any of them were taken away—the cutter is in my service still—I take security from the workmen when work is given out, and if they do not return it we get the price of it, when we can, from the security—we very rarely have to come upon the security—the workmen never get a loan on the deposit of their work with my permission or knowledge—they have to find thread and wax, and those trifling things, but nothing more—I have heard of shops where they get supplied with those things, and leave the leather until they can take it out with the money they obtain; they are called "leaving shops," and are a great curse to our trade, for the money is generally obtained for drink—our principal reason for taking security from a workman, is that he shall not run away with the work, or dispose of it—uppers and soles are to be bought separately, but not stamped with the initial of any particular firm—they are regularly dealt in to a very large extent—from inquiries I have made, I can say that these have not been given out to be made up.</p>

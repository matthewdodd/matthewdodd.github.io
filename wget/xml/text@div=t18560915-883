                  </hi>. I am a wholesale stationer and paper bag manu<lb></lb>facturer, No. 79, Upper Thames-street I have one partner—Tucker was in our service, he was foreman of the bag department—it is part of our business to make paper bags for grocers and other tradesmen—we are in the habit of sending the bags when made, and sometimes the paper before they are made, to printers to have our customers names put on them—when the paper or bags are sent to the printers, there would be on each parcel of bags or paper, a label with our names on it, and the quality of the bags—here is a parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) where the label has been torn off—sometimes the paper would be sent to the printer previous to making the bags, and then he would have to print the customer's name on them, which would be sent to him on a piece of paper—Stirling was a printer we were in the habit of employing—Tucker would not have authority to dispose of any paper to Stirling, except for the purpose of printing—when he sent out any paper or bags, it would be his duty to make an entry both of the bags and paper in a book which was kept for that purpose—from information, I went on 24th or 25th Aug., to the premises of Messrs. Dando, in Aldermanbury—I was there shown a large quantity of paper and bags—I recognised them to be mine—some of them are here—this is one of the bundles of paper—here is part of my label on it—it is partly torn off—I also saw four reams of blue cartridge paper, which I particularly recognised by the mill number, and the progressive</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Robinson It was Tucker's duty to enter all bags that he sent out to any customers—if he sent out five parcels of bags on the 26th to Stirling's, it would be his duty to enter them in this book—here is no entry since the 18th—Tucker would have no authority, under any circumstances, to tear off any labels—I have seen Hurley at our warehouse and also at Stirling's, on several occasions—when he came to our warehouse, he merely asked me if Stirling was there—recollect seeing Hurley there on the 27th—on that morning Stirling Tucker, and Hurley went to the Swan public house.</p>

Q.</hi> When you saw me, did I go alone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You followed these two men, with another of our men—very probably you went to have your dinner, it was about 1 o'clock—all this blue paper that is here was kept on your floor—it is not usual to tear the labels off to my knowledge—it is usual to keep the labels, to show the size and quality of the bags and paper—it was usual for you to go to Mr. Stirling's about the work, when articles were wanted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Robinson. I know Hurley and Stirling—I have frequently seen them in company—Stirling has frequently come for work—I have not seen Hurley on my master's premises, I have seen him and Stirling together outside—I have seen Tucker with them, on about two occasions, at the Swan.</p>

               <p>frequently there alone, when you were not present—I recollect Mr. Grainger telling you, on the Saturday, that Stirling was to have no more work—there was no more work given to Stirling after that, which was on the Saturday before 27th Aug.—I cannot tell whether the work given him that day was 2,000 flour bags—I tore the labels off once or twice, by your direction, because, when you pretended to send one quality that was ordered, you sent another, if we had not got that quality—I never knew you to give more work than was ordered—I know almost all the orders—I do not keep the books—I have marked the orders myself with you—you cannot be accountable for any one taking goods from the other room—when I saw you with Hurley, it was at dinner time on both occasions.</p>

On the 5th of September I left a watch on the mantel-piece - when I went out a little before nine o'clock in the morning; I came back a few minutes after ten - the prisoner had left her key in my place before I went out, and when I returned it was gone, and the watch likewise - I then went after her and took her to one of our officers who found the duplicate in a box with three half-crowns.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. This watch was pawned with me, between eleven and twelve o'clock on the 5th of September, by the prisoner, for 30s.; I gave her a sovereign and three half-crowns.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This woman keeps a bad house. She has two or three husbands alive; on the night before she picked up a man and brought him home; they had breakfast and then went out; the man came back and asked me to pawn this watch - I said "Where is the landlady?" he said, "She has got a drop." I came back, and they were not at home; the door was shut - I then opened the window and took my key.</p>

             re-examined. Q. When you went there, did she say anything to you about it? A. She said all the property she had about her was a few halfpence - we took her in a back room; she threw out those few halfpence - we then searched, and found the box and duplicate: she at first said, before the Magistrate, that Mrs. Allen gave her the watch, and 1s. to pawn it; she afterwards said a young woman gave it to her - in coming home, she said she was a poor unfortunate creature and was sorry she had done the crime.</p>

I had seen them all safe on Saturday night. I had eight fowls in all in the shed near the house; two were left. On Sunday morning, I missed them, about seven o'clock. I was informed by a neighbour that the fowls were gone. I found six were gone, and two remaining alive. The heads of three of them that were gone were lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door kept locked - A. No, it was not. I traced the blood of the fowls to a neighbour of mine; not the neighbour that alarmed me. I went to that neighbour's house; his name is Santy; I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250024"></xptr>the neighbour that I thought his son had robbed me; he assured me that his son was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What magistrate did you go before - A. Mr. Sellon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your fowls afterwards - A. Yes, at the constable of St. Luke's. I found some of my fowls there. The constable shewed them me. Three of them were without heads, and three with, and their feathers. I knew my fowls again. I took the heads of the fowls with me, and applied the heads; it appeared that they were the heads of the fowls that were without the head. Matthews, the officer, took me to the watchhouse; there I saw the prisoner the same evening. The prisoner said, he himself, in company with young Santy, had robbed me, and he said so at the office. I am sure they are my fowls. The value of the six fowls are twenty shillings.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I saw the fowls alive on the Saturday evening; they were all safe in the shed in the garden. I always feed them before they go to roost. Four of them that were lost we bred. I saw them the next day at the constable's. I am sure they are mine.</p>
               <p>JAMES FORDHAM. I am an officer of St. Luke's. About half past two o'clock on Sunday morning, I was coming up Golden-lane; I saw the prisoner, and another lad standing behind the turnpike house; I got almost close to them. They came away. I saw the prisoner had something underneath his coat; I caught hold of him, and asked him what he had got there; he replied, fowls; immediately the other ran away. I called out stop thief. The prisoner had three on him, and the other had three. I kept hold of the prisoner. The watchman went after the other person; he was not taken. I examined the prisoner. He had three fowls under his coat; two of them the heads were off; the other with the head on. I asked him where he got them; he said a man gave them him in Old-street to carry for him, and the other lad had three. After I secured the prisoner I went to see if the watchman had taken the other lad. He had thrown the fowls away; they were taken to my house. I produced the fowls to the prosecutor; they were the same fowls that I produced before the magistrate when Mr. and Mrs. Panckurst were there; they identified them. They were afterwards given to them. The prisoner said the name of the other lad was

               <p>I am an officer; I had information that the business of coining was carried on, at No. 10, Maypole-court, <placeName id="t17880910-102-crimeloc428">Aldgate</placeName>

               <p>Do you mean a perfect shilling, or a counterfeit? - He was rubbing it with some salt; it was wet; as soon as I caught hold of the man, I turned round and saw the woman lay hold of this saucer, which stood on her side, and throw the contents towards the fire-place, and this stick was in the saucer, which she threw away, when she threw away the liquor; and that sixpence which was in her hand, she put upon the table at the same time.</p>
               <p>Is it a real sixpence or a counterfeit? - It is a counterfeit; on that side the table where the woman was sitting, that saucer was standing; and on the other side the table, near the man, was this bason, with a counterfeit sixpence in it, with some sand and water; and this pot, which I think, had vinegar in it, and the salt cellar with a little salt in it; these were all on that side the table near the man; I immediately secured the man, and tied his hands, and took him to another corner of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100114"></xptr>room, and tied the woman's hands; Wilkinson and me then staid in the room till Whiteway went for Mr. Clarke, as I am not so well acquainted with this business; I never had any thing of this kind before; he came back, and brought word that Mr. Clarke was ill; upon which, I searched the woman, and in her pocket I found this shilling, (a bad one) with two good shillings, and a good half crown; I observed that the lower parts of the windows were lined with this paper all the way round; I put a piece in my pocket; (cartridge paper) then we searched the man; he had nothing; I saw the woman drop a number of bad shillings and sixpences out of her lap; I believe there might be six, seven, or eight, while Mr. Whiteway was gone to Mr. Clarke, some conversation, which, if you think is evidence, I will repeat, passed between the woman and me.</p>
               <p>Did you make her any promise? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any thing at all pass from you to her that could possibly induce her to hope, that if she told you the real truth it would be better for her; that she would have a chance of escaping? - No, my lord, I guarded her against it; she first asked me what I thought they would do to her; I told her it was impossible for me to answer that question; that it was a pity she, as a woman, (she said, she had been a hard working woman) should give way to such business as this; says she, I never was concerned in such business as this but three times; my husband was a hard working, honest man; by whom, I had three children; I asked her where he was; and she said, he was abroad; but since she had carried on this business, she had made a point never to pass any bad money in the neighbourhood; that is nearly all the conversation that passed in the absence of Whiteway; and when he returned, we proceeded to search the room; in one corner of the room, in a hole in the ceiling, I found this pot and contents, some blacking; and here is some more, that stood on the table; we then put them together, and brought them together; and in a little bag by the side of the fire place, I saw a bottle of aqua fortis found, which will be produced, that was hanging right over the man's head.</p>

               <p>Describe to the jury, in what manner it is that people endeavour to colour money? - The process is after they are cast; they are smoothed, and after being smoothed they are put into aqua fortis; after they have been in momentarily, they are taken from that and thrown into water; from that it draws the silver, if there is any, on the surface, and makes them black with the strength of the aqua fortis; and after they are put into water, by being scoured with water and sand it takes off that blackness, and leaves the silver on the surface; that makes them bright, and they have, in general, a black stuff that they put over them, to make them look old, as if they had been worn some time, and then they are ready for currency.</p>
               <p>Now just tell us what is, or what has been at least in that phial? - That is aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>What is that black stuff for? - This is what they generally put on the outside, in order to deaden the rubbing of it; this bason has every appearance of sand and water; there is a piece of money in it, and I dare say, by rubbing it, it will become white.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Then you have aqua fortis, water, sand, and that blacking; is it the complete apparatus for the business of colouring? - It is.</p>
               <p>Here is some salt, for what purpose is that? - I do not know; they may rub it, in all probability, with salt, instead of sand; I apprehend this shilling has been in aqua fortis, but I will rub it in the sand, and tell you in a minute.</p>
               <p>(Rubbed it, and it had that effect.)</p>

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr.

                  Baron

               <p>N. B. When sentence was passed, the prisoner, Catharine, pleaded that she was with child; upon which, a jury of Matrons were sworn, who returned with a verdict, which the forewoman thus delivered.</p>
               <p>"In my real opinion, if she is</p>
               <p>"with child, it is very young, for she is</p>
               <p>"not with quick child."</p>

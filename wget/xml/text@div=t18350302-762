I saw the prisoner, and watched him to the corner of Marl-borough-street—I saw him go into the first public-house, and come out—I went in, and received a sixpence—I followed him into Oxford-street, and saw him go into a public-house, and put down a sixpence—I saw it in Har<lb></lb>vey'shand—I said, "That is a bad one, mark it"—I then wanted to search the prisoner—he was resolute, and resisted very much—I handcuffed him—I found 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper on him, besides silver, a half-crown, and a good sixpence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Chequers Alley. I knew the deceased little girl, Mary Coney—I saw her in Chequers Alley, about three weeks ago, play<lb></lb>ing against some bricks; several little children were there at the time—the prisoner was there cleaning some bricks—he told the little girl to go away several times; she would not go, and he struck her with a leather belt on the right side of the head; it had a buckle to it—her head did not bleed—she went home crying—I did not see her afterwards—I am quite certain that the prisoner is the man who struck the blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 34, Paradise Street, City Road. On 11th Dec. I was called in to see the child, Mary Coney—I found a discoloration on the right temple, about the size of a half crown—she was labouring under great difficulty of breathing, and fainting; I could not account for it at that time, I imagined it was from fright, from what the mother told me—she rallied, and got apparently well; but the symptoms were continually repeated, and I was continually fetched to see her, and administered medicines to her until Wednesday, 30th Dec., when I saw her last—shewas then in a worse state as to breathing and fainting than I had seen her previously, and she died in that state about 6 o'clock in the morning—I made a post mortem examination next day, and found on the right temple a discoloration about the size of a half crown—it continued much the same through the whole depth of the skull on that side, but no further—the inside of the head was perfectly healthy under that part, and all the brain until I came to the left lobe, where I found a clot of blood about the size of a hen's egg, about two ounces of extravasated dark coloured blood, and some soften<lb></lb>ing, or disorganization of the surrounding mass of brain—every other part of the brain was perfectly healthy, and so were the other parts of the body—I attribute the cause of death to the clot, and I believe that to have been caused by the blow on the right temple—the appearances always follow on the opposite side to the blow, it is a law in surgery—I know of no disease which would cause similar appearances—I should say the external mark was caused by some instrument; it might be by a fall, or a blow of the fist, or a strap.</p>

I am a master shoe maker, and live opposite the bricks where three houses were being pulled down—two or three men were employed in pulling them down—I am always at home, and could see anything that transpired—I remember the circumstance with regard to this child perfectly well; there were two children there, the little girl and her brother—there are generally a number of children there, after the pieces of lath and old wood, and the men have a great deal of trouble to drive them away—the prisoner's brother called to the little girl and boy, and told them to go away, in a very abrupt way—they did not go; the little boy turned round to the prisoner's brother, and made use of a very awful expression to him, which caused him to say, "Do you hear him?" and he pointed to his master to call his attention to it, and laughed, and so did I; and then he said, "Hold him, I will nail his ears to the wall;" that was merely to frighten the child—the children then ran round the corner, and no more was seen or heard of them—there was no blow struck that I saw, and I was there the whole of the proceeding.</p>

               <p>I had brought the parcel of linen out of the garden, where it was put to dry; coming into the parlour, I saw the prisoner take a flannel petticoat off a chair. I screamed out immediately, and threw down the basket and pursued the prisoner, who got out of the window. I never lost sight of him; he was taken in a ditch with his back upwards, and his head thrust into the hedge, with no shoes on. He is the man, I never lost sight of him; it was about six o'clock, in the dusk of the evening, the 6th of this month; the prisoner was found in the ditch.</p>

I went to the hedge; it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230069"></xptr>dark; Lee went and got a candle, and we took the prisoner; he had dropped the things as he ran away. We brought him to the publick-house. Mr. Ford's maid came and said he was the man she saw in the parlour. The prisoner said, Young woman, take care what you say, that you do not swear falsely, for it is wet linen, and will take my life away. I asked her if she had brought the things with her; she said, no. I went and fetched them.</p>
               <p>He said it was wet linen before the linen was brought? - Yes, he did.</p>

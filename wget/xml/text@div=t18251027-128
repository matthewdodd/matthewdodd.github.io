On the 5th of October the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at a pair of child's socks - I shewed her some - she bought a pair for 6 d., and gave me half a sovereign - I went to my uncle, to get change, in another part of the shop - I was gone two or three minutes - I then came back - she bought a bit of white ribbon and paid me 8 d. for it - she then left the shop, and in a minute or two I missed the piece of gauze ribbon - I told my uncle - he went out, and brought her back in two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PITTS. I was on the drapery side of my shop; my niece came to me for change, which she gave the prisoner - when she was gone she told me she had taken some ribbon; I pursued and found her about fifty or sixty yards off, with the ribbon under her shawl, and in her basket - I took her back, and sent for Gibbs, the officer; she was very desirous for me to let her go, and said she would give me all the ribbon she had.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had my niece with me, and while I was looking at the socks, she put it into the basket, and I knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>JURY to ELIZABETH PITTS. Q. Had the prisoner any companion with her? A. She had a little girl, three or four years old - she could not reach the counter - she was not put on it.</p>

               <p>THOMAS WARNER. I live in <placeName id="t18270405-260-crimeloc1423">Hosier-lane, Smithfield</placeName>

The prisoner took a lodging of me on the Tuesday before the 28th of November - he took my kitchen, and I provided every thing for him, for 3s. a-week; he went away on the Tuesday following, at six o'clock in the morning, without paying his rent for the last week; I had my suspicions, and two minutes after he shut my street-door I went to his room, found the door wide open, and missed these articles. I have never seen them since - I met him in about three months, at the Ship public-house, in Tower-street, and secured him; I had one more lodger; he continued with me - he usually went out at eight o'clock, after breakfast; he never went out till eight before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Other people lodge there; I left to go into the country for work; I afterwards met the prosecutor at a public-house, and went up and spoke to him myself; he offered at the watch-house to take 10s. or 12s. as a compromise, but, being conscious of my innocence, I refused.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WARNER re-examined. He did not speak to me first; I seized him the moment he came in; I am certain he did not speak to me; he did not attempt to get away.</p>
               <p>- FULLERGRATH. The prisoner was in my employ, and usually came to work at six o'clock in the morning; I think he was never later than a quarter past six; he worked for me the latter end of November, but whether he was with me on the 28th I cannot say.</p>

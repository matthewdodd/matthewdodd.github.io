I am the wife of William Averre, of Wilton-terrace, North Woolwich, a tobacconist—on 12th May, the prisoner came to our shop about 4 o'clock in the afternoon and asked for half an ounce of tobacco, which came to three half-pence; he gave me a shilling in payment—it was a bad one—I told him so, and asked him how many more he had like it—he said he had no more money but one penny—my husband was by me at the time; I gave him the shilling, and he gave the prisoner into custody—he gave the shilling to the constable.</p>

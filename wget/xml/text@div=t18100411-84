               <p>Q. When did you lose these things - A. On Wednesday the 4th instant. I went up into the shop where the prisoner worked on Tuesday the 3d, in the evening, after he had left work, I saw the goods in question hid under the prisoner's work-bench, I called the witness to see how they were situated, and in the morning, when the prisoner was gone to breakfast, I found four gross of-tips were gone; the remainder were still under the bench; he came back from breakfast, and when he went out to dinner, by enquiry, I found they were gone; I sent the witness after him; he come back; I asked him what he had done with the property, he said he had no property; I felt his pockets and would not feel any thing; the witness saw the prisoner take them out of his bosom up stairs. The part of the property that he took away at breakfast time was found at his lodgings.</p>

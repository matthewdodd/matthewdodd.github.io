                  </hi>. I was a waiter at the Tavistock Hotel, Covent-garden—on this Sunday morning, shortly after 1, I was coming off duty down Bedford-street, going home, and saw the two prisoners and the prosecutrix having a struggle at the corner of Bedford-street—Andrews appeared to have tight hold of her arm, whilst the other got between them and was picking her pocket—I was about three yards from them—they then round the corner, and the prosecutrix after them, down a court into the Strand—I went straight down Bedford-street and met them at the corner of the court, in the Strand, and told a constable—the prosecutrix came up calling "Police" or "Thief!"—I am quite sure the prisoners are the two men.</p>

I was on duty in the Strand on the morning of 7th May, between Bedford-street and the Adelphi theatre—I was holding a conversation with a cabman, a few yards from Exchange court, which runs from Maiden-lane into the Strand, when I heard cries of "Police!"—I went to the end of the court and saw Lewer come down the court—he went and stood against a post, directly afterwards Andrews came down and the prosecutrix—she directly went up to Lewer and said, "That is the man that has been robbing me of my purse and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., along with the soldier"—they said it was not them—I took them both into custody—I saw Charles Ward there; he was leaning against some shutters, drunk—he was two or three yards from the corner of the court.</p>

                  </hi> I am chief usher at the Thames Police-court—I was present at the Court on Wednesday, the 9th October—I have a summons here against Martha Burridge, of 9, Oley Place, Stepney Green, dated 4th October, 1867—it was called on and heard by Mr. Benson—on that hearing the prisoner was a witness, she was sworn and said she was with her sister, Martha Burridge, the whole of that day, the 2nd October; that she well recollected the day, because they had both been to the County Court; that they were not in Johnson Street that day, nor had she been in that street for three months; and that her sister did not knock at the door of the complainant—she repeated this more than twice.</p>

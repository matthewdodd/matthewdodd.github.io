                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. William Andrews, a surgeon, at Islington. On 26th Feb., about two o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a double knock at the door; I went, and saw the prisoner, and an older person—the elder one asked if the doctor was at home—I said he was not—he asked if I could tell him what time he would be at home—I said I did not expect him home till five o'clock—he said he was ill, and required some medicine, and asked if I would allow him to write a note, that the doctor might call upon him; and he and the prisoner went into the parlour of their own accord—I gave him pen, ink, and paper—he said Mrs. Smith was likewise not well, and she had lately been confined—the prisoner had a blue bag in his hand—the other man turned to the prisoner and said, "George, will you write it? you see how ill I am"—the other wrote it, but the prisoner was by—Smith then said, would I oblige him with a glass of water—I turned</p>

               <p>to the sideboard to get a tumbler, and went from there to the surgery to get the water—the sideboard closes in, and the glasses are on it, and the plate-basket stood under it—any person in the room could see the plate-basket when I took the tumbler out of the cupboard—I went into the surgery for the water, and was returning with it in my hand, and Smith met me just within the door—he drank the water very slowly, and remarked how good it was—after he drank it, I went into the parlour, the prisoner was gone, and the door was a little open—Smith seemed quite agitated—in a little time after he was gone, I missed a sovereign from the chimney-piece, which I am certain was there when the prisoner and Smith came in—soon afterwards I missed the plate, fourteen spoons, two sauce-ladles, and other things—they were worth above 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were my master's, and the sovereign also.</p>

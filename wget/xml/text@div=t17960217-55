               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been at work in Essex; I came up to go to the hospital, being very bad; I went to get some work to support three motherless children; I went in there to ask for work, and I saw this saw outside the door; I took it up, and then this man came, and said, I had got his saw; I told him, then I begged his pardon; he let me go fifty yards, and then came running after me again, and said, you old blackguard, you shall go and ask my master's pardon, before you go now.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mendez). Q. How far had he got from the shop when you took him? - A. About fifteen yards; as we came to Devonshire-street, he slipped from me, and ran five or six yards.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you sure you left the saw in the shop? - A. I cannot swear it, but I believe I left it in the shop; I had used it three or four hours before.</p>

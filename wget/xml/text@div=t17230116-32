The Prosecutor depos'd that as he sat in an Ale-House he saw John Smith take the Boards out of his Work-Shop, and carry them about 600 yards, into another House. That Render was one he had put in Trust to look after his Goods, as his Foreman. John Smith pleaded, That he having Occasion for two Boards, went to Robert Render, and desir'd him to let him have two Boards, and bid him charge them down to his Accompt; he said also, there was an accompt depending of about 40 l. The Prisoner Smith call'd Evidence to prove, there was no clandestine taking the Boards, but having a Job of Work in Hand near that Place, and his Deals falling short, he went and took the Deals on Accompt, rather than to go home for them, which was a great Way off. He appear'd to be a Man of Reputation, and Robert Render a Person whom the Prosecutor employ'd as his <rs id="t17230116-32-deflabel173" type="occupation">Foreman</rs>

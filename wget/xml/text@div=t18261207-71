            . I am in Mr. Brown's employ. The prisoner lived in the neighbourhood; I do not know what he is. On Thursday, the 23d of November, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I stationed myself in the middle of the field, about twelve yards from the hay; I saw the prisoner and White come into the middle of the field, and take the truss up - it would weigh 30lbs. - they each took half of it; I followed them with it into the road, and asked if they had stolen that hay - they said, No - they both had it on their backs; I followed them into the town, but let them go without stopping them; I have not found it - there was no hay in the field, but what was my master's - the prisoner was taken on the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where were you when we took the hay? A. About twelve yards off - they did not appear to see me - they each had a sack, which they put it into.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The sack would not hold half a truss; I never had any hay out of his master's field - he came and said I had stolen his master's hay; I said I had not; he said, "You have, and I shall know you."</p>
               <p>GEORGE CLAYTON. I said, "Tims, you have stolen this hay;" he denied it, but when we got nearly into the town, he said he had, and it was the first time.</p>

               <p>Wilson. Did not the shopman charge the girl with stealing the boots? and was not I on the prosecutor's side of the way? She called me, and I crossed over, and stood there some time. Witness. The other girl was first charged with stealing them, and Wilson walked down the street with the man - she did not run away - I am sure it was Wilson took them- the other girl turned back, to see if any body was coming, at the corner of Jewin-street - she had been with the prisoner, when she went into the shop, and came out with her- they were all three together at the corner of Jewin-street- I never said I did not know which of them took the boots - I did not say, at Guildhall, that they gave them to the man.</p>
               <p>JOHN CAPEY. I am a linen-draper, and live in Aldersgate-street. A little before five o'clock, Wilson, and two more females, came into my shop, and made a trifling purchase - I suspected them, and moved every thing away from them - they laid out 2d. - when they got to the door, they went out, and three of them came crowding round the shop together - in a few minutes, a boy and Jennings came, and said, "They have stolen a pair of boots" - they were followed, and taken in Jewin-street - the boots were found in Mr. Green's, the baker's cellar - I secured the prisoners.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I heard a cry of"Stop thief," on the 20th of August, in Jewin-street - I saw the male prisoner five or six yards behind them, commence running - I pursued him, and saw him pull a pair of green boots out of his pocket, and throw them down a cellar - he ran several yards, and was stopped.</p>

             (policeman K 160). On the 16th of February, I took the prisoner Wilson into custody, for stealing some ribbon, and was present when she was tried and convicted - I got this certificate from Mr. Clarke's office - she is the person who was tried (read).</p>
               <p>Friswell's Defence. The prosecutor said three females came into his shop, and bought some ribbon, and that he came out and pursued me - the girl rushed by me very violently, she might have thrown down the boots herself - I was taken by the policeman, and accused of throwing them down the cellar - the other female got away, who was being pursued- the man who appeared against us had not a bit of shoe to his feet, and was in a very deplorable state, but the prosecutor has since taken him into his employ.</p>

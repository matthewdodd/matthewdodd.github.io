               <p>bookbinders, Lovell's-court, Paternoster-row. The prisoner was their porter. On the 23rd of March I saw him in the counting-house, about seven o'clock in the morning, where he had no business to be, till half-past eight o'clock—I watched him through the other counting-house window, and saw him go to a drawer and take out this silk, endeavouring to con<lb></lb>ceal it, by placing it under his waistcoat—I went in and asked what he was about—I pulled it away from him, and gave him in charge—this silk is the property of ray employers—(<hi rend="italic">examining it</hi>)</p>

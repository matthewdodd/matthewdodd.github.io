               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at your master's house - A. Yes; about a quarter after two o'clock in the morning on the 5th of April I found him in the pantry, it adjoins the kitchen, under the stone steps of the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you in the pantry at that time - A. The housemaid got up at that time to washing, she came and alarmed me. On opening the kitchen door I found him laying fast asleep. I did not wake him; he was searched in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing taken from his person - A. I saw about a pound and a half of beef laying by the side of him, on the floor. I desired the watchman to come in and take him; the watchman asked him what he came there for; he said he came to take a nap. The watchman locked him up in a room and went to get further assistance, he broke out of the room where he was locked up and made to the hall; I secured him in the hall after a violent scuffle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. This poor fellow broke out after you locked him up in the cupboard - A. Yes; I dare say I should have done the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he partly drunk - A. He was partly so. There were some eggs in the pantry, he had them in his pocket, they were broke. He must have got in over the iron rails of the area.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no damage done; I believe you have taken pains since to find that this poor creature is of reputable connections - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Yesterday week I was going my beat, I met this servant at the corner of the street, with a poker in his hand, he told me there was a man in the pantry; I went with him to the house, the servant opened the pantry, there I saw the prisoner; he was just on his feet, hustling about as if he was half asleep; I asked him what he was doing there; he hum'd and ah'd a good while, at last he said he was taking a snooze; by the side of him was about a pound and a half of beef; the flour was scattered about the area; the servant said there were eggs in the flour tub; I found them in one of his pockets and butter in the other; I locked him up in a little room under the kitchen stairs while I went out and got the patrol; he took the butter and eggs into this little room; there was nothing at that time taken from him; at the time I was out he escaped from that little room and got into the hall; the house was searched by the patrol; we did not find any thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060066"></xptr>broke; he had a pair of boots that he brought with him; he could give very little account how he got them we found no picklock key nor iron crow upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to you as if he was drunk - A. I dare say he was; he was drowsy.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WEBB. I am a shoemaker; I live in Marchment-place, Little Coram-street; I was passing along Great Coram-street; I heard the alarm of thieves being in the house, by the servant maid out of a two pair of stairs window; I knocked at the door, I said if they wanted any assistance there was some at the door. The footman opened the door with the prisoner in one hand; I collared him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be drunk - A. He did not appear to me to be altogether drunk, he seemed confused; he was bleeding freely from a blow that he received from the footman.</p>

            . I searched the prisoner; I found a duplicate on him; he had a silk handkerchief in his pocket; the boots were left for the prisoner and the handkerchief; he said he bought the boots at Marybone, and the duplicate he bought as he was going along.</p>

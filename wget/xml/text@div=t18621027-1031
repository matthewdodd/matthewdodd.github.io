I live at 33, East-street, Red Lion-square—on the night of 12th October, about 20 minutes past 8, I was walking along Argyle square, just by the church—I saw a mob of about two dozen men, I should think—I saw the prisoners there; they were coming towards Grays-inn-road, in a direction to meet me—I went into the road to avoid them—they were close upon me then—some of the others that were with them came into the road as well—the prisoners were with the rest of the mob—they were not among those who came off the pavement after me—I then went on the pavement again, and my hat was knocked off with a large stone—I turned round to see who it was—they were then all round me; I was sur<lb></lb>rounded—I saw both the prisoners there then—I found my handkerchief on Crawley—when my hat was knocked off, I turned to see if I could see who it was—I then saw both the prisoners close to me, arm-in-arm together—Crawley had my handkerchief in his hand—I told him the handkerchief belonged to me, and I caught hold of it—just then a constable came up, and I gave him into custody—the handkerchief was taken from my breast-pocket—I am sure the prisoners were arm-in-arm together when I turned round.</p>

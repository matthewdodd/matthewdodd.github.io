            . I am a Goldsmith, and live in New-Bond-Street; the prisoner came to my house about the beginning of December, and offer'd me four pieces of silver; three tops and one bottom of silver fork handles, in the same condition they now are, scratch'd upon the graving; (producing them) he offer'd them to sale. I asked him how he came by them? He said, he bought them at Harrow for 3 s. 6 d. but said, he thought them worth 13 or 14 s. Upon seeing them in this condition, I suspected he stole them, sent for a constable and stopt him; then he said he had an uncle who kept the Tennis-court in the Hay-market; we went there with him. The gentleman said, he was related to him. and he believed he was a very honest man. Upon which I let him go, but kept the things and advertis'd them the next day; the prosecutor came the Monday following and owned them. I went on the Tuesday to Harrow-on-the-hill and took the prisoner as he was at work in the fields, and brought him to justice Fielding's, there he confessed he stole them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150038"></xptr>Fonseca. I can't justly say the time; but I lost them about a fortnight or 3 weeks before the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Fonseca. I did, he lived with me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity?</p>
               <p>Fonseca. He worked in the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come to work with you?</p>
               <p>Fonseca. He came about 2 months or 6 weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live with you?</p>
               <p>Fonseca. He lived with me but 3 days, and I missed the things the day after he went away; I lost a pair of silver buckles about that time, but cannot swear the prisoner took them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I found these things a little way from my master's door, in the same shape they are now in. His doors were open at the time. I went to that man's house to sell them, and he stop'd me.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you hear the prisoner confess he stole them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not. I have heard he has an exceeding good character.</p>

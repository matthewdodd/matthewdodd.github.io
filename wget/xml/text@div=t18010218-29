             sworn. - On the 29th of January, about five in the evening. I was passing by Mr. Nias's door, in <placeName id="t18010218-29-crimeloc156">Leicester-fields</placeName>

               <p>- HISCOCK sworn. - I am shopman to William Nias, in Leicester-fields; I was engaged in serving a customer; there were a great many pieces of calimanco at the door, and I heard one of them fall; I then heard a cry of shop thief, and almost immediately Shelley brought in a piece, but I cannot swear to the property, there is no mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss such a piece of calimanco as that? - A. No, we had such calimanco at the door, but I cannot say that is it. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Shelley). Is that the piece that you carried back? - A. I cannot say. A. Is that the piece that you saw the prisoner drop? - A. I cannot swear that it is.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hiscock.) Is that the piece that was delivered to you by Shelley? - A. I cannot swear that, because there were two pieces brought back and delivered to the constable; I cannot say which was which.</p>

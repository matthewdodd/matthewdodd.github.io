                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, residing at 10, Ironmonger Lane, St. Luke's—on the morning of 18th September, about 1 o'clock, I left some friends at Wanda worth, in order to go to Bromley, to look for work—I come over Blackfriars Bridge to Water Lane, where I met the prisoner—he overtook me—he said, "Good morning," and entered into conversation with me—we went through Smithfield into Long Lane, and I said, "The house will be opened at the top of Milton Street, and we can have a pint of beer"—he said, "It is too soon yet, you can come to my lodging"—I said, "Very well"—he took me to a place in Golden Lane, where the baths are—we went into a room, and he locked the door and took the key out—there were four more men in the room—he blew the candle out, and then hit me in the mouth—I was knocked down, and I felt two hands, one in each trowsers pocket—sixpence and half an ounce of tobacco was taken from me—one of them said, "What sort of boots has the old be—got on"—they were on the top of me—another one said, "Pull off his clothes"—I said, "No, you don't do that, I will sooner die than lose my clothes"—I had another blow on the head, and they opened the door and kicked me on to the stair head—I found my way down stairs, and gave information to the police—I showed them the room—I went up with them, and saw the prisoner in bed—they asked me to identify him—I said, "No, not without his clothes"—they made him put his clothes on, and I said, "That is the man who fetched me in"—he spoke while his clothes were being put on, and I recognized his voice—I gave him in charge—I saw half an ounce of tobacco</p>

               <p>taken from under the pillow—this is it—it is mine—I had another half ounce in my coat pocket, but they did not find that—I was kicked till I could hardly get down stairs, and my mouth was cut and bleeding.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 112). About 6 o'clock, on the morning of 18th September, I was on duty in Golden Lane, and heard a disturbance it the baths—I had seen the last witness go in with a man—I waited about there—I saw Jordan come out, bleeding from the mouth and nose—in consequence of what he said, I got assistance, and went into the baths—I went up stairs with him, and he pointed out a room to me—I kicked and hammered for some time, but no one would open the door—I looked through the window, and saw the prisoner and two other men in the room—I told them if they did not open the door I should burst it open and one of them came and opened it—I saw the prisoner put his font under the pillow—I said, "What have you got there?"—I got hold of his hand underneath the pillow, and took out half an ounce of tobacco—Jordan said it was his, and pulled another half ounce out of his pocket and said, "I have got another half ounce like it"—the floor was smothered with blood—I asked Jordan if he could identify any of the other persons—he said the light was put out so quick, he could not; but he could swear this was the man who walked with him, and took him up into the room to stay a little time—the prisoner said nothing till he got to the station; he then said it was not him, it was some of the others—the prisoner does lodge at that place—the prisoner said at first he was not the man—I said, "Let me look at your boots"—his boots were quite wet—it had been raining over night—I found sixpence in another man's pocket; but the prosecutor could not swear it was his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. William Miller Christy and others. There are more than two partners—Pearson is a labourer in their employ—he had been about four years in their service, and then was discharged—he came back about Christmas twelvemonth—Brooks had been in their service from about June—there is a part of the manufactory which is warmed by steam—that closes at seven o'clock—it is then my duty to go and see that all is right—on the 24th of January, in going round at seven o'clock, after the engine had stopped, I came to a saw-mill, or shed, which is about thirty-nine feet long—it is open at one end, and closed at the other—there is no thoroughfare through it—there are a whole range of windows on one side—I was standing at the open end of the shed—the gas was out—there is a range of shops opposite this shed, with glass windows, and the gas was alight there; that in a good measure lighted the saw-mill—there was a candle burning in the shed—about seven feet down there are some pegs on which the men hang their jackets, about where the candle was—I believe Pearson usually hung his jacket there—he would leave work at seven o'clock—I first saw the light, and said, "Halloo! Who has left a light there?"—I then saw a person nearly at the end, with a bundle in his hand, whom I thought was Samuel Pearson, being well acquainted with his figure—I then thought something was wrong—I went down the mill, and Pearson came up and met me—he had then nothing in his hand but his hat—that was not what he had in his hand at the bottom—he had his hat on then—he said, "It is only me, Sir, looking for my hat"—he then took his hat off, waved it, put it on, and passed on—he sail, "Good night, Sir"—I saw him first on the other side of the candle—when he came towards me he took the candle, and was going to blow it out, and I said, "Don't put it out, I will light the gas"—he then went away—I proceeded to the bottom of the shed where I had noticed him standing—I found this parcel—it contains fine German wool—I searched the shed thoroughly—I found no other parcel there.</p>

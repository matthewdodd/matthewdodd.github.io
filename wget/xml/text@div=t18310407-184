The prisoner came into my service on the 1st of November, 1828, and left me on the 12th of February last - he was my assistant; he kept my books, and it was his duty to make an entry of every transaction that took place - he made out all the bills, and if money was offered him it was his duty to take it; I had a patient named Rebecca Howard - she resided at Ealing; she is the wife of a labouring man - she had not been a patient prior to the 2nd of August - the prisoner had a salary of 85l. a year; he has entered in the book which I have here that he had attended Rebecca Howard - I saw it as a matter of business; here is the entry "Mrs. Howard's delivery 10s. 6d.," with the medicine sent - when it is paid he enters it as paid; here it is, on the 17th of August, "Mrs. Howard paid 10s. 6d.," and here are my initials placed against it; I believe I did receive a bill for medicine from

             afterwards, but I did not receive 4s. 6d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he your clerk or servant? A. I should consider him my servant - there was no specific meation about his receiving money for me, but it was understood generally, and he was in the habit of accounting for what he received; there was nothing said one way or the other about his having any cases to attend on his own account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. On what date was the payment made? A. On the 17th of August - here are my initials against it; I presume it was handed over to me on that day, but it might be a day or two afterwards; most likely I put my initials there on a Monday - I had not seen Mrs. Howard myself; the prisoner is a member of the Company of Apothecaries - I presume he had some notion of setting up in business; he told me before I preferred this indictment that he intended to set up at Ealing -I did not like that, of course; I am the only doctor in that village, but there are others in the vicinity - I indicted him as soon as I found any charge against him: I suppose it was four or five days after I heard of his intention of setting up in business - he had left me four days; I desired my friends to get him to sign a bond not to set up in business within several miles of me, and to refund the money; the message brought back was that he refused point blank to sign any such thing - I have always paid the prisoner in money; he has desired me to get him a bottle of brandy, and when I have done so he perhaps has not been able to pay me till his salary was due; his coal-merchant has called on me, and I think a brewer has, but that was to pay in advance, before his salary was due; I do not recollect that any one called when his salary was in arrears - his milkman never called on me; his baker spoke to me once, but I never paid his baker - I think the greatest number of times he ever had brandy of me was twice; it might have been three times; I had a partner in the beginning of 1828, but the accounts have been settled, and he is dead - the prisoner was in our service at the time of the partnership; he informed me that he expected to attend Mrs. Howard - if he had wished to defraud me, he certainly need not have told me of it; he was in custody last Session, on a charge respecting Elizabeth Reed, but she was not then able to attend.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What was the charge at which he was allowed to attend a patient in this case? A.10s. 6d. if paid at the time, but if not it was to be 15s. - I was satisfied with the payment of the 10s. 6d. at that time; I am not aware that persons are in the habit of paying more to the assistant.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. You have stated that supposing payment to be made at the time, 10s. 6d. was the regular charge? A. Yes, for my assistant, but 15s. if credit is given - the attendance was on the 2nd of August.</p>

            . My husband is a labouring man, and resides at Ealing. I was a patient of the prosecutor's in August last, and was attended by the prisoner - I paid him 15s. on the 8th of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And you were very well satisfied with this young gentleman's attendance? A. Yes, I liked him very well - I was not inclined to make him any compensation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What passed when you paid the prisoner on the 8th of August? A. I gave him the money: I had asked him on the 3rd what was the charge, and he said 15s.; I gave him a sovereign, but he could not give me change, and on the 8th I gave him 15s. in silver - I had never employed him before; I sent for him as Mr. Dickinson's assistant - I met the prisoner walking on Ealinggreen, and asked him to attend me; that was about four days before he attended - I asked him what the charge was, and he said 15s.; the reason I asked him again on the 3rd of August was, because I had had some medicines, and I did not know whether that was in the bill; I paid 4s. 6d. in another bill, for medicine.</p>
               <p>MR. DICKINSON re-examined. The prisoner has charged too much in this case - the woman has been the sufferer, and not me. <rs id="t18310407-184-verdict1003" type="verdictDescription">

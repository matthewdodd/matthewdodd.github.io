My master sent me out on the 9th of November; I called at Somerset-street, where my master lived until the day before; he had left the house without any person in it; the things had not all been removed. As soon as I had put the key in the door I heard something drop inside, I went in and shut the door, but I did not fasten it, I felt about to see if I could find any thing, and I found a skeleton key, I then came out and procured a light; at that time Mr. Bamfield's coachman came up to the door, and accompanied me in; we went into the back-parlour, and found the shutters open. We thought we smelt tobacco, and went down stairs, when we had got about half-way down we heard a noise, sounding like bottles rattling; we turned back, meaning to lock them in, some person pursued us up-stairs immediately, before we could get to the door. Mr. Bamfield's butler was outside the door, and said we were thieves, and shut us in; I got out, and told the coachman to come out also, and not to let any body else out as he came, but the prisoner got his head out, which we pushed in again. I am sure it was the prisoner, I saw his face distinctly, I had a candle in my hand at the time. The coachman had hold of the door, the prisoner made the coachman let go his his hold, and he got out; we laid hold of him, he knocked the coachman down, and I tumbled over him and let go of the prisoner; He crossed the street, we ran after him, crying stop thief, and he was taken at the corner of Bride-street, in Henrietta-street; I returned to the house, and found a dark-lanthorn laying on the kitchen-stairs, four baskets about three bottles of wine, and a bottle of furniture oil. The cupboard under the kitchen stairs was broken open; the wine-cellar was also broken open; on one of the binns there was a lighted candle, and several of the corks were out of the bottles, and seven bottles of wine had been taken from the back-cellar. I found two pair of my boots had been removed from the pantry into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Mr. Kingston now lives in Gloucester-place; he formerly lived at this house, and had not removed all his furniture; his family had all left.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner ran away, did you keep sight of him-A. No; I lost sight of him for about a minute. I had a candle in my hand when I saw his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear to him-A. I will.</p>

He struck me with the iron crow and I fell down; I am sure the prisoner is the man, I saw him plain enough to swear to him. I ran after him, and cried stop thief, the watchman stopped him; I saw him all the time.

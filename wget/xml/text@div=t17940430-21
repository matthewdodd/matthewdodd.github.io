               <p>I came home from the chambers between nine and ten o'clock, on Saturday night, the 12th of this month. I am a laundress, in Gray's Inn, and put my cloak and bonnet where I always do, in my room where I live in Clement's-lane, and then I went out of the room, and went into the shop where my husband was, and I was coming back again into the back room where I put my bonnet and cloak, and I met this man coming out of the door with my bonnet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough for you to distinguish his person? - There was a light in the shop, and a snuff of a candle in the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. You had light enough to see him? - Yes, I had, I perceived the bonnet in his hand, and I asked him what he wanted? and he asked me for some name, I don't know what name; but I said directly he was a thief, and he had got my bonnet, and he took and throwed the bonnet out of his hand, when I called for a light on the stairs, when I went into the back room to see if he had got any thing else, and he was stopped immediately by Mr. Evans; I stopped him myself, but the man shut too the door and kept him in; the cloak was taken away the same night, but he had not got the cloak, the watchman stopped another man in the street with the cloak; I am certain this is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was no light in the passage when I went into the place.</p>

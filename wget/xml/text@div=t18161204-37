On the 25th of November, I had been to a public-house, in Westminster, with a friend. We stopped there until about half past ten o'clock at night; we had very little to drink; on my way home I went to another public-house, and had some gin and water; I then left to go home; it was about eleven o'clock. When I had got about one hundred yards I came to a dark place. The prisoner and three more were standing there, with their hands over their faces. The prisoner struck me several times, trying to knock me down. I fought with him as well as I could. He made three or four attempts at my seals; he got them at last. He ran up New Pye-street, and I followed him, crying stop thief! I never lost sight of him. I saw him taken by the watchman; nothing was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. He was searched by the watchman. I do not know the other men. I was quite sober. I am sure he is the man. Some of the other men struck me behind; I should not know them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the magistrate, that you did not know which of the men it was - A. No. I have no expectation of a reward; I did not know there was one. He said he would cut my seals; but I do not know whether he did; the ribbon appears as if they had been forced off. I did not tell the magistrate that he cut them. The seals and key were gold; they hung out quite easy to be seen.</p>

             M'CULLEN. I am a watchman; I heard the cry of stop thief! I came out of my box, which is at the corner of Pye-street; I stopped the prisoner; he was walking; I did not see him above six yards from my box. There were other people in the street. Murrell came up in about five minutes. I called four or five times for him before he came; he appeared to be in liquor; he was sensible enough to know what he was about. The prisoner made no attempt to get away. Murrell said, he was the very man that knocked him down; he did not say what he had lost; he told the constable of the night, that he had lost his seals and key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I cannot say whether any body had gone by my box before I came out. There might be. There were people going backwards and forwards. The prisoner was walking. It was a very dark night. The place where Murrell was robbed is very dark indeed.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TRIPP. I am constable of the night; I searched the prisoner, but found nothing on him. Murrell appeared as if he had been drinking; he was very dirty.</p>
               <p>Jury to M'CULLEN. Did the prisoner appear flurried when you stopped him - A. No.</p>

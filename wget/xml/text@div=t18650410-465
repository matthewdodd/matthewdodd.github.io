                  </hi>. I am a printer—last Saturday I had charge of Mr. Heymings' house, at Hampton—I left it between 10 and 11 to go for my supper beer—two dogs were there—I had to go about 150 yards for the beer—I am quite sure I secured the house before I left—I was absent about three quarters of an hour—when I returned I found the garden-gate locked—I went round by the stables and saw the prisoner coming down the stairs—I have known him about two years, and said, "Glazier, you scoundrel, what do you do here?"—he made no reply—he had a lamp in his hand, which he put on the table, and threw himself out at the kitchen window into the garden—I caught him by one leg, and held him until he hurt my</p>

               <p>hand, and I was obliged to let him go—I saw him get up and run across the railway, in the direction of his house, which was about 250 yards off—I saw him distinctly when he came down stairs with the lamp.</p>

Q.</hi> Are you a little blind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can see distinctly with one eye—I went to the World's End public-house with the woman who was living in the house with me—we returned between 11 and 12—I did not stop there to play at cards, I only bad a glass of ale—I left the two dogs loose, one was following the prisoner down stairs—he was a ferocious dog, but he knew the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Heymings' service—on Saturday evening, 8th April, I went out and returned with Townsley—I think it was past 11 when we left the house—we went to a public-house—I had some ale—as we were going into the public-house the prisoner was coming out—we stayed there about twenty minutes—Mr. Townsley's sister, Mrs. Smith, was also with us—when we returned the gate was locked, and I saw a light upstairs—we could not get in at the gate, and had to jump over the fence—as we opened the front-door the prisoner was coming down stairs with the drawing-room lamp in his hand—I heard Townsley say, "Glazier, you scoundrel, what do you do here?—I had seen the prisoner before, he had been to my master to get employment—the gate was unlocked when we left, and the key was in it.</p>

I know James Davis, V 26, who has this charge in hand—he is too ill to leave his bed—I saw him this morning, and I produce a medical certificate—I was present when the prisoner was examined before the Magistrate—I heard James Davies examined—(<hi rend="italic">Davies deposition was here read as follows:</hi>—"I went to Glazier's house, which is about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Heymings' house—the prisoner was standing outside his house—I told him what he was charged with, and he said he knew nothing about it—he asked me to allow him to go in doors for his slop; he had nothing on but his trousers and shirt—I went with him into the house, and directly he got in he became very violent and seized hold of me round the neck, when a railway-porter, named Mills, came to my assistance—he struck Mills a very severe blow in his face—several other constables came up, and we got him to the station—I received several kicks.")</p>

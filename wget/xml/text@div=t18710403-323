                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Susannah Cottages, Mile End Road—the deceased boy, Thomas Henry Ridley, was my son—he would have been fifteen years of age next July—on Sunday evening, 6th March, he left home between 6 and 7 o'clock, to go to the Roman Catholic Chapel, with two more little boys—about a quarter of an hour afterwards, I heard a great noise in the street—I and my daughter ran to the door, and about thirty yards off I saw my boy on the ground, and the prisoner on the top of him, <hi rend="italic">punching</hi> him as hard as he was able—I went up and separated them—the prisoner was dragged off by somebody, and I got my boy indoors—next morning he went out about 9 o'clock, well and hearty—about 3.45 he was brought home on the witness Abbott's back—he seemed almost dead to this world—he did not seem to have any sense—I tried to bring him round, and I sent for the prisoner's mother, and she sent for a little brandy—I then took him to the hospital, but he died in my arms on the way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know the boys were going to fight on the Monday—I have never had to complain of my boy for fighting—I did not hear him say "It was both our faults"—he said Payne had done it, no other boy had hit him—the prisoner's mother came, and did what she could for me—I did not decline to send for a doctor—I sent for a police<lb></lb>man—he ordered me to send for a doctor directly, and I did—that was about three-quarters of an hour after my son came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live at 18, John Street, Stepney—on Monday afternoon, 7th March, about 2.30, I was in Watts' beer-shop, in South Grove, with the deceased boy—while we were in there, Payne and the other boys came holloaing round the window "Come out here, Ridley, and I will fight you"—I drank my beer, and Ridley came out with me—I said to him "Don't you fight"—they did fight, Payne and Ridley, in South</p>

               <p>Grove, and after the first round they went into Bow Fields to fight it out—I went with them—Payne struck Ridley three or four times; they struck one another—Ridley fell, and Payne fell on him several times—it was a regular fight—the prisoner did not strike him when he was down—Ridley said "I will give you best till I get down to Mr. Ford's*—that is a public-house at the corner of Regent Street—they were going to fight it out again there—the prisoner said "I want best for always," and he struck Ridley, and knocked him down insensible—he was not able to get up again—I carried him home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were three boys there—it was about ten minutes' walk from South Grove to the field—I had never seen Ridley fight before that—they both said they would go to the field to fight it out; I don't know which said it first—it was a fair fight—the blow that knocked him down was in the forehead—it was grassy ground—the blow was not struck unexpectedly; Ridley was on his guard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Crocker, of 5, Wellington Road, Bow—on Monday afternoon, 6th March, as I was crossing the field, I saw a group of boys; they had formed a ring to fight—Payne and Ridley commenced fighting, and during the time I stood there, Ridley fell three times from the blows he received from Payne; and each time he fell, Payne fell on him with his knees on his stomach—I then went away, and when I came back they were still fighting—I went for a policeman, but could not find one, and when I returned, Ridley was on the ground insensible. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see the last blow struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at the London Hospital—when Ridley was brought there on the Monday afternoon, he was dead—I afterwards assisted in making a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—he had a black eye—on opening the skull, and removing the scalp, there was suffused blood between the scalp and the bone, caused, most probably, by a blow or fall—on removing the bone there was a large clot of blood on the left side of the brain—that was the cause of death—it was probably produced by a blow or fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should hardly think the fist of the prisoner would be sufficient to produce the result; I don't think it could—it all depends upon the force with which the blow was struck—a fall would be more likely to produce it.</p>

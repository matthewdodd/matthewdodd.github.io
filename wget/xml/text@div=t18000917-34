               <p>Q. Did you get immediate access to those chests? - A. No; we asked for the keys, and she said she had not got them; my brother officer searched her, and found in her pocket the key of one of the chests; we took the sugar to the office, (produces it); I found part of it under the bed, and the remainder part was found in the back-kitchen, in a chest; the two loaves of sugar were in the papers that they are now in; the next day, I searched the house of a man of the name of Nealey, he and his wife were at home, they live in Playhouse-yard, Golden-lane, there I found in several bags, (produces them); here are two more loaves of sugar, that I found in the parlour at Robert's, in paper; on the Tuesday, the same day, I searched the house of

            , in an alley in Grub-street; there I found two pieces of sugar, (produces them); I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, at any time, had any conversation with the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Before the prisoner said any thing to you, what did you say to him; did not you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - A. No, I was aware of that; I took him to his own house, and told him there was a charge against him for stealing some sugar from his master; I and my brother officer asked him if he had got any in his house; he said he had got none.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was this after you had been to Mrs. Knotman's? - A. No, before; I staid with the prisoner below stairs, while my brother officer searched and found a piece of sugar, which he has here; after that, he begged very hard to let him go, on account of his family; and she went down upon her knees to let him go, he had five children; we then told him we could not, we were officers of Justice; and we then took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The piece of sugar found at the prisoner's house is a very considerable quantity I see? - A. Here is all there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark upon it? - A. Here is part of a mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a mark is it? - A. I believe it is a dent in the sugar in the baking.</p>
               <p>Q. Roberts is a cow-keeper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And deals in sugar? - A. I should think so, or we should not have found it there.</p>
               <p>Q. A cow-keeper a dealer in sugar? - A. We found some other things there besides; we found some linen, some liquorice, and some handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you believe all those things were stolen? - A. No, I do not believe they were; there was a tin pot that was owned.</p>
               <p>Q. This man, Roberts, gave you a great deal of information, I suppose, before you went to the house? - A. No, he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Mrs. Roberts? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make known to him that you were officers of Justice? - A. To Mrs. Roberts I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And though you told her you were officers of Justice, she refused to tell you there was any sugar in the house, and refused you the keys? - A. Yes; and she refused us other keys besides that.</p>

               <p>Q. Was good Mr. Roberts at home, the cowkeeper? - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Some sugar was found under the bed, in a place of concealment? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. It is precisely a kind of place in which a cowkeeper and a grocer would keep it? - A. I cannot say as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. You found some in the back-kitchen, in a chest? - A. Yes; it was standing by the fire-place, locked up with a key that we found in Mrs. Robert's pocket; there was a towel found there, with the mark picked out.</p>
               <p>Q. At Mr. Nealey's you found some bags? - A. Yes; and some pepper, in the chest in Nealey's bedroom; he was at home, and his wife too.</p>
               <p>Q. You told them you were officers of Justice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they shewed you directly where the things were? - A. No, they did not; they said we were welcome to search.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it in consequence of any thing that passed at Roberts's that you apprehended the prisoner? - A. It was; we desired him to go with us to his house, in a court in Hill-street, Holywell-mount; I asked him if he knew a person of the name of Nealey; he told me he did; I asked him if he had let him have any sugar at any time; he refused to tell me whether he had or had not; I then proceeded to search, and asked him if he had got any sugar in his house; he said, no, he had not; I found a great deal of sugar broke up in lumps, fit to put into tea; I found this lump, (The lump produced by Vickery), wrapped up, in a closet; it appearing to be of the same quality with that that was found at Roberts's house I took it before the Magistrate; he seemed very much alarmed, and begged we would not take him before the Magistrate, but let him go; that he was very sorry for what he had done, and would never do so again; his wife went down upon her knees, and cried; I asked him if he could inform me where he bought the sugar, if he bought it at any shop in the neighbourhood; he told me he could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search any where else? - A. Yes; from the information that I received from Robert's wife I searched Nealey's house, and there I found three bags, and a quantity of papers; there were some small pieces which corresponded with the fine sugar but we did not bring it away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You said, upon my learned Friend's examination, he refused to tell you; did he say he would not tell you? - A. No; but he did not tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. The small piece was all you found there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What would it weigh? - A. I suppose a pound, for hardly so much.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be the same? - A. I do; they are two bottom pieces.</p>
               <p>Q.Suppose I were to shew you two pieces from another shop, of the same size, should you know the difference? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You told the officers all you knew about the sugar before they came to your house? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, to save yourself, you told what you knew about it? - A. I don't understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, after giving your evidence today, that you shall be prosecuted? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. (To Phone.) Q. Look at these two pieces of sugar. (The sugar found at Mrs. Knotman's? - A. I can swear that this mark was on the sugar that is lost; it was marked 7, and a stroke on the bottom of the loaf, and the quality is the same; I believe it to have been my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bag. (The bag found at Nealey's)? - A. This is my bag, I know it by the number, the letter S, and figure 85.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the sugar found at the prisoner's? - A. It is the same quality.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Is that mark 7, and a stroke, your own making? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other mark about it? - A. There is not.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you then undertake to swear merely from the circumstance of quality that is your property; would not any confectioner have sugar of that quality? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not they also have sugar with the mark of the manufacturer? - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The sugar found at the prisoner's? - A. That I cannot swear to at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as to the bag, you know that by the number? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it ever happen to you, as it does to other tradesman, that sacks are lent? - A. I never lent a sack in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear, that on the 1st of August, that bag was not out, carried out by some one of your servants? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not they be in the custody of your servants to bring home your goods, without your knowledge? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Is the mark that is upon it your own mark? - A. No; it was a mark that I bought with it.</p>

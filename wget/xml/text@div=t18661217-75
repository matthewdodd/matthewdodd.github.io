On Sunday, 14th October, I went with Sergeant Moss and others to search Moses's premises, in conse<lb></lb>quence of a complaint he made of being robbed—we went to ascertain the state of the premises, and to get evidence of what he complained of—I had been in the next warehouse the day before about the same thing—Moses's warehouse consists of a cellar, a ground floor, and an upper warehouse—it adjoins a warehouse of a similar kind, which was empty—it is in Black Horse Yard, Petticoat Lane—there is a name up, Moses Moses, dealer in marine stores—we examined the warehouse adjoining, and found a hole had been made through the brickwork into Moses's warehouse—we then went to Moses's warehouse to see the hole on that side, and on removing some rags near the hole, we discovered an eardrop and some gold brooches and pins near the hole—we made further search and found two saddles, some silver<lb></lb>plated goods, military bridles, portmanteaus, and numerous other things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—both these saddles were under some tons of rags—here is the name of Whippy and Steggall, North Audley Street, on them, and under the flap is the name of Captain Bradford—they are both quite new, and were then in better condition than they are now—this portmanteau was about two yards from the saddles, under the rags—you could only see the rags—it is quite new—there has been a plate on it, which has been taken off—the strap of the lock has been cut, and it has been forced open—I have tried this plate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the portmanteau, and it precisely fits—it bears the name of Edmund Webb—the maker is</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Scudder and Co., carmen—Mr. Wolsey is one of the partners—on the 15th August I sent to Messrs. Smith and Elder some goods for the East India Docks—the prisoner Blake was the foreman; he had a horse and cart—I remember his return that evening—I did not ask him whether he had left them, but I have booked the cases as delivered, and he gave me this toll ticket—he told me he had booked twelve cases—there were thirteen, but my foreman took one to St. Katherine's Docks, and Blake went with the rest to the East and West India Docks—this is the book; I have written in it from his dictation: "Cart, thirteen packages East India Dock, one St. Catherine Dock, by E. Bowley, toll 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—about the 20th October I said to Blake, "You recollect the robbery of Moses?"—he paused a moment, and said, "I think I do"—I said, "It appears there is some property found there which was in the cases which you took from Smith and Elder's to the Docks, I want you to think it over whether yon gave anybody a ride or stopped to have any beer; think it over and let me know in the morning"—he promised to do so, but I never saw him again till I saw him in custody four or five days afterwards at the Mansion House—I did not employ him regularly—he was only odd man—I used to find him on the stand in Houndsditch—after I spoke to him I did not see him on the stand.</p>

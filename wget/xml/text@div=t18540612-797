               <p>—Allen was sitting on my left side, and when we were in a bye lane, about seven miles between Barnet and Hertford, he suddenly pushed me out (we were driving at about seven miles an hour); he then got out, struck me about the head, and told me to give up the vehicle to him—I called to the other constable, and when he got up I had let go, and was holding Allen—I had great difficulty in detaining him, from the horse and chaise—I was laid up for some days afterwards, and was considerably injured; this was on 4th April—I took the prisoners to Hertford, and from there they were taken to Hunsdon, and were brought back to Hertford—they were remanded two or three times—as we returned from Hunsdon to Hertford I was riding with Rainbow; and he said, would not it be better for me to take a little money than to separate him from his wife and family.</p>

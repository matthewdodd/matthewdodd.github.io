                  </hi>. I keep a trunk shop in Leadenhall-street. I have known the prisoner some time—he applied to me on the 6th of September, saying be had an order for a trunk for a lady, but was unable to make it; and he should be obliged to me to let him have one—he looked out one which was worth 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said he should have it for one guinea—he said, "you have no objection to trust me?"—I said, "I have great objection"—I sent my boy with him—he returned without it—he said the lady lived at the back of the Pavilion theatre—I took a policeman, and went for him, but could not find him.</p>

The prisoner came in Sep<lb></lb>tember about a trunk—my master sent me to bring the trunk back, or the money—I went with him to No. 24, Nottingham-street—he told me to wait outside—I waited five doors off—he said he would bring the money directly—I waited ten minutes—he came out and said the lady was gone out to buy stockings, and I was to come at two o'clock and receive 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he would call upon my master for the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

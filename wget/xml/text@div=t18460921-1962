                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a carrier at Godalming, in Surrey, and am a farmer. I had a person named Edwards in my employ as a carter—on Thursday, the 10th of Sept., it was his duty, with Wiggins, to take the cart to town—on Sunday, the 6th of Sept, I saw a sack containing corn in my hay—loft, which excited my suspicion—my stable is at the bottom, and is about fifty feet long, and at the top of that is my corn—loft and hay<lb></lb>loft—you go through the hay—loft to get to the corn—loft—for the last two or three months I have given out all the corn myself—the corn has been pad<lb></lb>locked up—the padlock has been on perhaps for twelve months—on the Monday and Thursday, Edwards, the carter, had four horses up, and he had two sacks of corn and one of chaff—the sack which I found on Sunday in the hay—loft was covered with a little bay—the constable saw it—he has had access to my stable for the last month—on the Thursday morning I saw there were two lots of corn, one in the corner of the stable, and one in the hay—loft—the sack was lying in the same situation as on Sunday—I did not mix anything with the corn in the sack—I have seen the corn that Bid—decombe found in London on the Friday—I believe, to the best of my knowledge, it is my corn—mine consisted of white oats, black oats, and split beans, and this consisted of the same—something had been mixed with it, but I did not do that—apart from that I believe it to be my corn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Moon. It was my duty to go with the wagon on this occasion to London—on Thursday, the 10th, there were three sacks that had corn in them put into the wagon, and one that had chaff—Edwards ought to have had two with corn and one with chaff—I went with the wagon to the Queen's Head, in London—it was not my duty to put the sacks in, or to take them out—I have to look to the goods, and have nothing to do with the horses—when we came to the Queen's Head I had to unload the wagon—it was Edward's place to take out the sacks and the chaff—I did not do it, it must have been done by him—my master has a stable at the Queen's Head, in the Borough, and the prisoner has a stable about ten yards from my master's—I did not see Edwards and the prisoner together on the Thursday or the Friday—the prisoner is a carrier—he has a horse—I be<lb></lb>lieve he carries to some place in Kent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am constable of the borough of Godalming—"consequence of information from Mr. Moon, I mixed about a quart of grits with a sack of corn, which I found in his hay—loft—I marked the sack with a piece of grey worsted, and a piece of red string—it was covered with hay and straw—you had to pass very near to it to go to the corn—loft—on the Thurs<lb></lb>day following, I went into the same stable, at two o'clock in the morning, and found about two bushels of white oats, black oats, and split beans concealed, and with that I mixed a quantity of chickens' grits, and a few peas—I then took a sample of the mixture, which I have here—on Friday morning I then fol<lb></lb>lowed the wagon to the Queen's Head in the Borough—it arrived about half past five that morning—I did not see it unloaded—I was so well knows "that yard it would not do for me to go in—I put another constable there—I went that day to Mr. Moon's stable—I could not find the sack nor any corn—I went to a stable ten or twenty yards off—the prisoner came in while I was there—I pointed to a horse there, and asked him if it was his—he said, "yes"—under the manger I saw three sacks; one contained chaff, another peas and pollard, and between them was three sacks; one contained chaff, another peas and pollard, and between them was a sack containing about two bushels of mixed oats—I asked if those three parcels belonged to him—he said they did—I took the sack containing the oats, and brought</p>

               <p>it to the door—he was close by my side—I took some of the oats out—I asked where he got those oats—he said, "I bought them"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "Over here"—I said, "Where do you mean by over here?"—he said, "At the corn—chandler's, at the corner of Tooley—street"—I was in plain clothes, but I told him I was a police—constable—he then said, "Well, the fact is, I know nothing about them; it is not mine at all"—I swear to these being a part of the lot I marked—the sack they were in was not the sack I had marked—that sack was brought to me—Goff took it out of the wagon at Nine Elms.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) On 27th August, I lived in Edith-road, Chandos-road, Stratford—the deceased, Joseph Kuchen, was my father—on Sunday night, 26th August, my younger brother, a man of the name of Hans, the prisoner, and my father and mother had been to the railway-station to see a friend off—when they came back I was in bed and asleep—my father awoke me about 11 o'clock, and I went down stairs—he knocked for me—when I got down stairs I saw my father and the prisoner in the workshop, close together, fighting—I took hold of my father's arm and it was full of blood—I told the prisoner to go out—he went through</p>

               <p>the window of the workshop, where he entered, and then through the garden into the street—there were three benches in the workshop, and one was just across the window—there were no tools lying about there, because on the Saturday night generally the workshop is cleaned and put in order, as no work is carried on there on a Sunday—there were no tools lying about—my father was a cabinet-maker—the prisoner was no relation of his—he worked in our workshop, in the service of my father, and lodged in our house—he slept in the same room as I did—he had been working there seven weeks—the smaller tools are kept lying on the bench, in a sort of little place, and the planes and larger tools are inside; underneath the bench there is a sort of cupboard, in which the larger tools were—my father could not follow the prisoner into the street, because my mother took hold of him, and washed his wound first—I went to the door, and told the prisoner it would be much better to go away—then he asked for his hat—my father did not follow him at first—after I gave him his hat, he said to me, "If you come outside I will stab you dead"—I did not see that he had anything with him then—I went inside and fetched a piece of wood, and then I went out—after a time my father came out—I began to fight with the prisoner, and I then, by the gas-light, saw a knife in his hand—it was a table knife—he always used that knife on the bench—while I was fighting my father came out behind me—I did not see him, and Jacob (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) went aside and stabbed him in the abdomen—I saw the stab, but I thought that it did not catch my father at first, because he did not fall at once, but he stepped back and said, "Leonard, I am stabbed"—I went up to him immediately, and we went to the door of the workshop, and there my father fell; half his body fell in the workshop, and half into the kitchen—Hans was in the street at that time—he was about twenty yards from my father when the stab was made—when I saw my father come out into the street he was not bleeding from any other place than his arm—I looked in the workshop the next morning for the knife that was usually used, but could not find it—I have never seen it since—it had a pointed blade, and a black ebony handle—the prisoner did not come home that eight—he was taken into custody the next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—I saw the deceased when he was brought there on Monday morning, about 4 o'clock—he had six incised wounds on the left arm, they were about a quarter of an inch in breadth, and nearly an inch in length—I should say they were done with a knife—there was an incised wound on the left side of the abdomen, about an inch and a half in length—that was a large wound—he died between 8 and 9 o'clock on Tuesday evening—I made a post-mortem examination—in my judgment, death was caused by the wound in the abdomen—a knife or a sharp-pointed instrument would have made that wound—the gut was cut in four places—I was present in the afternoon when he made a statement—he was then dying—he did not state anything to me as to what he believed his condition to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose he was in a very low condition at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He necessarily would be—perhaps his memory might be slightly indistinct.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 483). I took the prisoner into custody, on Monday morning, 28th August, about 9 o'clock, at a cottage in Edmund's-row, Stratford, near the deceased's house—I spoke to him in English, but he could not understand me—I took him to the station—I found marks of blood on his shirt wrist, and his bosom—I did not observe any wounds upon him—he had a black eye—I think it was from a blow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The statement made by the deceased was read as follows</hi>: "I, Joseph Kuchen, reside at Edith Cottage, Chandos-street, Stratford—I believe I am dying—I wish to make the following declaration: Yes, I know Brenner, and Hans—Brenner was going home with me on Sunday last, about 11 o'clock at night—Brenner had a quarrel with my son about three weeks ago while in the workshop—without saying anything to me, he took a knife off the carpenter's bench and stabbed me in the abdomen and on the arm—I never gave him any provocation to strike me—I always thought him a quiet man—he worked for me—I never had any quarrel with him before—I had been drinking with Brenner, and believe he was drunk—I was sober—I do not know the reason he stabbed me, unless it was on account of the quarrel he had with my son about three weeks ago—I always behaved very kind to him, and paid him for what he did for me—I know nothing of Hans, nor did he strike me."</p>

               <p>JOHN LENOX. Q. You keep the Bell public house, Bell Yard, Gracechurch-street. - A. Yes. I received three trunks belonging to this young woman on the 28th of April, they came from Kennington where she was living as servant at that time; I received them by the Clapham errand cart, to go to Mill-street, Dock Head; about four o'clock in the afternoon, on the same day, the prisoner came into my house; he passed me, he turned back and asked me for change of a two pound note; I could not give him change, so I answered him instantly; I saw no note, he said very well, I will have a glass of ale, I have money enough to pay for that; he paid me for the glass of ale, he walked into the back room with the glass of ale; the back room was facing of the tap room; at the same time there were eight or nine coachmen in the taproom; I did not see him go out; my servant gave me information that a man was gone out of the house with a trunk under his arm; two of us set out after him; there are two passages in the George and Vulture tavern, we missed him; I went home again; I found that the other man had not found him; I set off after him again, I met him in Wathing-street with the trunk under his arm, he was going towards St. Paul's and I was going home; I had given it up; I asked him what business he had with that trunk; he said that he had brought it from St. Margaret's hill, that it came from Margate, that I must be mistaken; I desired him to give me the trunk and go back with me, and I would let him know where it came from; he said he would go back with me any where; he gave me the trunk; in taking hold of the trunk I found it open; he walked very quietly with me as far as Walbrook and then he broke out of my hand; he ran up Walbrook, I called out, a gentleman set his shoulder up against him and throwed him on his back; I got hold of him by that means again; I had got the trunk in my hand; after that he struggled and got from us again into a yard where there was no thoroughfare, he was stopped; we got sufficient assistance then and took him to the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man that was in your house - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. After he made his escape from you was he ever out of your sight - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You received three trunks from the Clapham carrier - A. Yes; I put them in the passage myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not opened them to see what was in the trunks - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not swear to the trunk - A. It was a nice new trunk with A. S. upon it, the initials of

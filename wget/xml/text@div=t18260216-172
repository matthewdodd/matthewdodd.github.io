The prisoner had formerly been in my service - the last time she had been with me four days only. On the 21st of January I missed a child's plaid dress from a box which was locked; I had seen it safe the day before. I accused the prisoner of it - she said she knew nothing of it. I then sent for an officer - she still persisted in saying she had never seen it, till the officer said he would inquire at all the pawnbrokers, and then she said she had taken it, and pawned it at Mr. Lowther's, in Tottenham-court-road.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the prisoner; she denied it at first - I told her I should go to the pawnbrokers, and at last she told where it was.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They owed me 10s. wages, and some things were wanted, which I lent them my shawl to pawn for - they said they would burn it rather then let me have it.</p>
               <p>ANDREW HAIG re-examined. There was some soap and other things wanted, and my wife gave her leave to pawn her shawl for them - I did not owe her any thing.</p>

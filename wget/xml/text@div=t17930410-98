On the 21st of March, between the hours of seven and nine in the evening, I was informed there were two men robbing the barge; I having been a good deal robbed about that time I looked through the gates, and saw the two men in the barge robbing it of the coals, the barges were under the Docks; immediately I went round, and one of my clerks had secured the prisoner with the coals; I saw him in the barge, I cannot swear to the man that I saw in the barge, but I can swear this was the man the clerk had hold of; the prisoner at the bar said, sir, I have only taken a few coals for my own burning; it seems we had employed him as an odd man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you permit men to take coals for their own burning? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. His clerk came up and laid hold of me as I was coming up the wharf.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of March, about twenty minutes past eight o'clock at night, I was informed there were two men robbing the craft; I immediately went out of the counting house and saw the prisoner and another man in a room of coals filling a sack; I immediately went up the wharf and ran down the neighbouring wharf which is about two hundred and sixty yards off, and there I caught the prisoner standing by a sack of coals he had got from the craft then, and not on our premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who was in the craft? - Yes, the prisoner is one of them; then when I went round I saw one of the same men on the shore standing under an adjoining wharf by the sack of coals; I laid hold of his collar, and I said, you are the person that I have been looking for a long while; pray, says he, Mr. Cooper exeuse me, I was only taking a few for my own burning; I secured him and directly gave a man the charge of the coals; the other man made his escape.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask him whether he catched me with coals, or any coals nigh me within an hundred yards? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100120"></xptr>He was standing quite close to the sack.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of these coals? - Eighteen-pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not standing near the coals, I was out looking for a Guilford barge, expecting to work on it, and I did not see any, and as I was coming up again this gentleman, Mr. Cooper, catched hold of me and said I had been stealing his coals; with that they had me into custody for ten minutes, and left me in charge of two horse keepers, with that they went and searched all round, and asked for the other man that was with me; I told them I had nobody with me. I have not a soul in the world to speak for me.</p>

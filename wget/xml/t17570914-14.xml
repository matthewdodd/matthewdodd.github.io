I found the horse on the 8th of August in Mr. Gay's possession, in his stable. I told him he was our property, and I would take him home. He said, let him alone. I went the next day and took witnesses with me, and he would not deliver him without I'd pay him eight pounds, five shillings, which he said he paid for him to Long, and said he could sell him for fifteen pounds or fifteen guineas, which he was bid for him, and he had no occasion to let me have him without I'd pay him that money.</p>

            . Gay was my servant since the fifth of March, I have known him six or seven years, he behaved just and honest. I trusted him to buy and sell horses for me.

            . I am a dealer in horses, I saw the horse yesterday morning, I think the price given for him is as much as he will fetch in any market; I would not give above eight guineas for him the best time of the year.</p>

             has been my servant six years. I am a tobacco merchant. He has thousands of pounds in his hands of mine every day untold. I look upon him to be strictly honest. I know Gay, he liv'd with me four years ago; he used to come to my house almost every day, to Mr. Cook. The lad is one of the soberest to be found in the stables, he'll not drink nor swear, and has a very good character.</p>

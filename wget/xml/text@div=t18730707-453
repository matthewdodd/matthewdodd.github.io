                  </hi>. I am a smith, of 20, Moreton Terrace, Pimlico—last Saturday week, about 12 o'clock at night, I was with a friend in Parlia<lb></lb>ment Street, near Charing Cross—I felt a snatch at my chain, it did not break, and there was a second snatch—I turned round and caught Mahoney by the neck—I immediately received a blow on the ear from Kenningham, which caused the blood to flow from my ear until Monday—Mahoney kicked me across the nose, which gave me a black eye, which caused me considerable pain—when I caught hold of Mahoney, his hand was on the chain—I have not recovered it—they were given in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been drinking, but was not the worse for liquor—I began to drink about 7 o'clock, at the top of Great St. Andrew's Street—I did not know the name, it was not at a place called the Sheep's Head, there is no such place—I did not see the prisoners there—I did not call for some 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale—I was drinking 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale—my friend was with me and another man and his young woman—we had two pots—I will take my positive oath that the prisoners had nothing to drink there—I said to my friend "Well, we will get home, but I did not say anything, to my recollection, about going to Pimlico—I live at Pimlico—I did not ask anybody to help me home—I was capable of going home myself—I was walking arm in arm with my friend—we left the house about 10. 30—we had been drinking at intervals since 7 o'clock—we then walked to Drury Lane, but not to another public-house—this took place between Charing Cross and Scotland Yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a moulder, of 20, Morton Terrace—I was with Weston, and saw both the prisoners knocking into him—I saw him struck on the side of his head, Kenninghan was there, right in front of me, and I caught hold of him and held him till a policeman came—I had not seen the prisoners before, they were not in a public-house with us, that I know of—we had not been drinking with them—Weston did not ask them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187307070007"></xptr>

I heard cries of "Police!" went to Craig's Court, and saw the prisoners, the prosecutor, and Parkhurst struggling on the ground—Weston showed me his watch, the chain was gone—he gave the prisoners into my custody, they said that they did not, do it—the chain has not been found—the prisoners said nothing about a tall man till they were brought before Mr. Vaughan on Monday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were a <hi rend="italic">good few</hi> people round when I took them—Weston and his friend had both been drinking—Mr. Chester, who is. Kenningham's foreman, gives him a very good character—the neighbours speak well of Mahoney.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoners statements before the Magistrate, Kenningham says</hi>:—"At 10. 30 on Saturday night I went into the Sheep's Head Tavern, Great St Andrew Street; we called for some 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale, and the prosecutor and his witnesses called for a pot of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale. After a little time they gave me and Mahoney a glass of ale each, and they drank out of our pot, then, they paid for another pot of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale, and it was shutting up time. The prosecutor asked me where I lived; I said 'Battersea, 'he said he lived in Pimlico. I said I would see the party home, and I took hold of his arm, and so did a tall man, and away we went. Just as we got to Trafalgar Square, the four of us were knocked down and this tall man ran away. He had hold of the left side of the prosecutor, and I had hold of the right. The witness knocked me down and gave me a severe kick in the ribs. The prosecutor had Mahoney down on the ground: they called out 'Police!' and the prosecutor said he had lost his watch. "<hi rend="italic">Mahoney says</hi>: "I have nothing to say but just what Kenningham has said."</p>

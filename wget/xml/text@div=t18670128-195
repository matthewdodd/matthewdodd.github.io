STRAIGHT</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on behalf of Newman, took objection to the form of the indictment. The Counts for receiving did not allege that the goods received were the same as the goods charged to have been stolen; and as the Act of Parliament only permitted Counts for stealing and receiving to be joined in the one indictment, where that was the pose he submitted that it was a bad indictment, and must be quashed.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that it was not a material averment that the goods should be the same, and referred to Reg, v. Knowlden, 9 Cox's Criminal Cases. He also submitted that if the Counts were bad for duplicity, all the Court could do would be to put the prosecutor to his election.</hi>

I am very unwilling to stop a case unless I feel clearly that the objection is a good one. This case is perfectly distinguishable from that just cited by Mr. Besley, because there the qualification was this:—The rule in criminal pleading is, that where there is a general jurisdiction, and the qualification is subsequently put upon that, it is not necessary to enter the qualification on the record. Here, the authority to proceed in the way they have proceeded is given by statute; then it must appear that the statute has been complied with, and that the case comes within the provisions of the statute. By the statute it is</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">provided that they shall be at liberty to unite these Counts in the way in which they have been united here, when they are the same goods which are both stolen and received. But that is not stated here. Therefore it seems to me that this statute would not assist the prosecution. I was disposed to think at first that the only effect of that would be that under the old law I should, put the prosecutor to his election, whether he would proceed upon the, Counts for stealing or the Counts for receiving, because informer times that was the course pursued; it was only said it was irregular to unite the Counts, and the Judges held they must elect upon which they would proceed; but I have looked at the 11 and 12 Vict., where power is given to unite together in the same indictment Counts for stealing and receiving, and I find in the preamble a sort of decal<lb></lb>ratory statement: "Whereas, according to the present practice of Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction it is not permitted in an indictment for stealingproperty to add a Count for receiving the same, or in an indictment for receiving to add. a Count for stealing the same property." Therefore the Legislature have declared that it cannot be done except under a power given by the subsequent Acts, and this case not being brought within those subsequent Acts, I must act upon that, and hold that the indictment is bad, and cannot be proceeded upon.</hi>

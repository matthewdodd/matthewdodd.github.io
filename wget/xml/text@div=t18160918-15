            . On the 27th of April last, I was at the warehouse of the prosecutors. I saw a man of the name of 
               <persName id="t18160918-15-person242">
                  George

            , who was convicted. The prisoner was looking through the warehouse window. I then went into <placeName id="t18160918-15-crimeloc86">Watling-street</placeName>

I knew the prisoner's person for a little time; I turned up the Old Change, and then turned towards Friday-street. I then went into Mr. Butterworth's warehouse, and sent for Mr. Evans, in Cheapside; he came. Then he went out again. I stationed myself over the private door. When you get into the house, there is the street door on the left hand, and a warehouse door in front. I stationed myself at the fanlight over the private door; I looked through the fanlight; I saw Atkins come in first; that was the man I saw in company with the prisoner, and who was convicted, and then Morgan came in; I am quite sure he is the person. This was about twenty minutes past eight when they came in, in the morning. Atkins undid the latch of the warehouse door; he turned it round; there is a bell to the warehouse door, and they got the door open, about an inch, or three quarters of an inch, before it rang the bell. Then Atkins put this stick in to shove the bell back; this stick was longer, but I will tell you how I broke it; Atkins shoved the bell back, so as to prevent its ringing upon his opening the door. The reason this stick was broke, Atkins, when I seized him, flung scotch snuff in my eyes, and I broke it across his legs. Morgan brought this bag in with him; it was empty when he brought it. This bag he held open in this manner, just by the warehouse door; then Atkins chucked in four pieces of cotton, and then I had to pull the door towards me, and I had then to open the door and directly that the prisoner at the bar found that, he rushed out, and dropped the bag. Then I catched Atkins in the warehouse. I produced those pieces in evidence on the former trial. Mr. Evans saw those pieces in Court here. I look at the prisoner again, and have no doubt at all that he is the young man; I had not seen him from the time of the robbery, untill I saw him at Clerkenwell prison; I never had any doubt about him. I indicted him by the name of William Morgan; he was known by the name of Long Bill, and I afterwards knew him by another name. It was last Saturday I saw him.</p>

               <p>THOMAS SMITH. I am a porter, and live in this street. I am the man whom the last witness helped to sweep the door; I worked then at No.11, Walling-street. I saw the two men walking to and fro before the prosecutor's door. I believe the prisoner to be one of the two men.</p>

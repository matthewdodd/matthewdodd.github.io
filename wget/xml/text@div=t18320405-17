               <p>GILES CLEMENTS. I live at North-end, Fulham - I knew Tomlin well, and knew Shipton by sight. On Saturday, the 10th of March, I was at a public-house with them - I was there from between nine and ten o'clock till near twelve; they were not there all that time - we came away together, and as I was going along in front of them they were talking to me; I was thrown down on my head, and nearly stunned - one of them got on me; they got off, and in two minutes I found I was robbed of two half-crowns, five shillings, and a tobacco-pouch - nobody but the prisoners were near; I was quite sober - I do not know which of them was on me; it was in <placeName id="t18320405-17-crimeloc120">Brooke's-alley</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When first asked by the Magistrate did you know what coins you had? A. I said there was a half-crown or two among it; I now remember there were two - I have known Tomlin three years, and knew he lived in Star-lane, but I did not understand how to go to work to have them taken, till my master told me - I think I told him about it on the Wednesday; there were some women in Tomlin's company, but not in mine - I did not drink with them; I called for half-and-half - Tomlin asked if he might drink; I said he might - I turned my head, and then my beer was emptied into his pot.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was present when Clements went up to Shipton at the public-house - directly he came out Clements charged him with the robbery- I took charge of him, and he repeatedly requested me to go to the Wheatsheaf, to Tomlin, to settle the matter, and said he was willing to find his half if Tomlin would find the other; I afterwards went, and took Tomlin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Shipton say, sooner than go to gaol he would find 5s.? A. He said nothing about a gaol.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was he able to walk? A. He could walk, and that was all - he told me on the Sunday morning that he had been playing at dominoes at the Cock before.</p>

            . I am a patrole of St. Botolph Aldgate. I stopped the prisoner in King-street, Tower Hill, about half after seven in the evening, I asked him what he had got; he said, a piece of cloth. I called another patrole to lay hold of him, while I took the bale of cloth; he got away from me; I saw the prisoner get away, he ran, but not far before he was taken again; he ran apparently as fast as he could; I saw him taken, and brought back; I am sure the man that my partner brought back, was the same person. At the watchhouse, the prisoner told me he picked it up in Blue-coat-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the place where you stopped him to Mr. Brown's shop - A. About a mile and a half. In the watchhouse he told me a man asked him to carry it for him, he could not tell me who the man was. When I stopped the prisoner there was another man in company with him; when I stopped the prisoner that man made off, he ran off directly I stopped the prisoner with the load.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a heavy load, is it not - A. Yes. it is a pretty good load.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor You had not seen the prisoner about your shop at all, had you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the cloth - A. Between nine and ten pounds; there is my shop mark upon it; I can swear positively to it being mine.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very bulky? Could it be taken out of your shop without your people seeing it - A. I suppose it must be taken from the shop when there was a crowd of people in it; we had several bales opened that day. There are two cutters continually in the shop. The piece of cloth was missed by my brother, I was up stairs at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to suppose that any of the people in the shop saw it taken away - A. No, I am convinced it was not seen to be taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. It is bulkey and weighty; if any of your people had seen it they must have been able to overtaken any body that had taken it - A. Yes, they must.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the bulk and weight such that one man in the way it was folded up might take it - A. He might take it himself; it was heavy; he might take it under his arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up from the West India Dock, a man asked me to carry it; I was stopped by the patrole; that is all I know about it; the man was to give me eighteen-pence for carrying it.</p>

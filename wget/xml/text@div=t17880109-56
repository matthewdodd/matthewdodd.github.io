               <p>In consequence of receiving this letter, what steps did you take? - In consequence of receiving this letter, I wrote a letter to Messrs.

               <p>What step did you take in consequence of having a good character of him? - We put in hand these orders that were sent us, and prepared these calimancoes which were sent for, and sent them away.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. We have many other letters of the writing of Alvarez; there are many of them that are unimportant, but we wish to prove they are the original letters, because Mr. Hicks has the rough draft of them; they are not stated in the indictment; there are some of them which we want to read. (Shewn to Mr. Defreze.)</p>
               <p>Defreze. Here are many little differences which I think are owing to the pen; I verily believe them all to be the signature of Mr. Alvarez.</p>
               <p>Look at that? - I cannot swear to that, I cannot say I believe it; I do not think it is.</p>

               <p>Did you happen to know whether that person resided at Hackney? - He took lodgings there.</p>
               <p>Who was that person? - The now defendant; he, and he alone; as he had lodgings at Hackney, I took all the pains in my power to inform the public of it; I do not myself know when he took lodgings at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Is Mare-street, a long street, or a short street? - A long street.</p>

               <p>Then you did not live there the 8th of March last? - We went on the 25th.</p>
               <p>You have not yet been a twelvemonth? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know that gentleman with the handkerchief to his mouth? - Yes, very well; a woman that passed for his wife, came and took lodgings of me about the middle of April.</p>
               <p>When did you first see him? - About a week after the room was taken; it was a furnished back parlour.</p>
               <p>What rent did he pay you? - Six shillings a week; they slept there sometimes when they chose.</p>
               <p>Had he any ware-house there? - No.</p>
               <p>Any compting-house? - No; his compting-house was in Token-house-yard; he kept the lodging till after the many advertisements were out against him, that was either the 21st or 22d of July; July; but the last that I saw of him was at our house.</p>
               <p>Was he much there? - Yes, he came sometimes four or five nights in a week, and sometimes he did not.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you at any time what he wanted that lodging for? - I never enquired; he paid me every week; I gave them warning, and he said, he should not quit it, for he meant to keep it on, and to pay his rent; I dare say it was two months before they went.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be a man of large property, that carried on a great trade in Mare-street? - No, the woman said, they carried on no trade, but lived on what they had.</p>
               <p>Had you any talk with the woman while the man was by? - Not of any consequence.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear the woman say in his presence, whether they carried on any business? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did he pay for all the lodgings when he went away? - They paid all but one week, and came afterwards and paid that, but they took away the key, and have got it now; I may have seen the other gentleman, but I cannot be sure; I know the other Mr. Alvarez; he lives in the same street; I know the gentleman very well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You had not the less respect for the man that came to lodge with you because he was of the same name? - The woman said their name was Alvarez, being a Christian name, I did not think he was a Jew.</p>

               <p>What was the nature of your engagement with him? - In the beginning of January, I was in want of 30 l. which was all the money that I recollect I owed in the world; it was in different debts; they kept coming to me for the money, and it was not in my power to pay them; I thought I would endeavour to apply to a friend of mine to get the money; I applied to Alvarez; I then desired him to step over the way to the public-house with Mr. Pearce, I went after; he said, if I would open my breast to him, undoubtedly he would supply any sum I wanted, for he was employed by a young gentleman just come from abroad with a great deal of money, to get in good tradesmens' bills, to put into a banker's hands; I told him, I only wanted thirty pounds; he asked me, if I did not want more; he said, I cannot take more than five per cent. but what you chuse to give me more; he drew on me two bills; one for fifteen pounds for six weeks, and the other, sixteen pounds for two months.</p>

               <p>Was you employed either by him or by Jones? - He told me, that he from his infancy was brought up in the mercantile line, and he could get goods and make cent. per cent. by them, and if I would attend him, and do business for him, to go to the coffee-house for letters, and so on, I should have shilling for shilling with him; I told him, I would consider of it, and let him know the next day; I met him the next day; he said, he would be bound in the course of four or five months to clear 2000 l. I said, I must neglect my business; says he, d - n your bu- business, never mind that; I told him, I would attend him; he said, there was an old clerk of his who had promised to meet him in the Minories; we went down to the Camel in the Minories.</p>
               <p>What day was this appointment to meet in the Minories? - It was in the beginning of March.</p>
               <p>Had any thing material passed from January to March? - No, he asked, when he went into the Camel, if a Mr. Israel was there, as had formerly been his clerk, and they told him yes, there he was, pointing to the box; he introduced us, we sat down, and the first word was, Alvarez said, Israel, have you got any directions? says Israel, yes, I have, and he took out of his pocket three or four bits of paper, with writing upon them, such as names, very dirty, as if they had been in the pocket for a twelvemonth.</p>

            ; and the other was to go to France for indigo, to the best of my recollection; I will not be positive; then Israel he began writing; and on the conclusion of the letter he asked Alvarez what kind of direction, and to what coffee-house, and how he must refer himself to Mr. Taylor? Alvarez said, that we must consider on; Israel said, he was that day at the Antigallican coffee-house, and was there some days before; and that a very few Jews went there; says Alvarez, that is the very coffee-house that will do; then about referring himself to his character; he said, as to Mr. Alvarez, you know he is well known on the change; tell them to enquire there, or any where else where they like, and he said, that was the way he referred before; Alvarez said so, and to tell him my place of residence is Mare-street, Hackney; this was just at the conclusion<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090103"></xptr>of the first letter; Israel immediately made answer to it, then by God you must get a lodging there.</p>
               <p>Was his place of residence, at that time, in Mare-street, Hackney? - No, it was not; I think it was up at Goodge-street, Queen-Ann-street, not in Mare-street; Alvarez answered to it, you d - n'd fool, I intend it; I will go over there the first opportunity I can get to go; then the three letters were finished, and they were taken and put into the post-office.</p>
               <p>Who wrote them? - Israel wrote them, and Alvarez put his signature to them.</p>
               <p>Look at this, and tell us whether it is one of them? - This is one that was sent to Taylor.</p>
               <p>What was the next thing that happened as far as relates to Taylor's business? - About three days after I went to the Antigallican to look for the answer; I will not be sure whether the answer came on the third or fourth, but we had two letters; they both came from Norwich, with patterns; one was from Mr. Taylor; Alvarez was waiting at some public house, just by, while I went to the Antigallican; I took the letters to him; he opened them, and said, it was damned good luck; then he said he would go to Israel; he shewed me the letter, and he approved of the patterns very much; he said they were very fine; the evening drawing very near, and Alvarez requested Israel to meet him at the Crab-tree, the corner of Percy-street, Tottenham-court-road, the next afternoon, to dine there; I was to be there too; Israel came, and I met him; there were rump stakes for dinner, for Alvarez and me; Israel could not eat any flesh, so there was some fresh salmon for him; when dinner was over, Alvarez told Israel he should have a shilling down for every letter he would write, as many as he would, and he wrote three or four more the same evening, one of which was the order to Mr. Taylor; he wrote it, and Alvarez signed it; that is the letter that was sent by the post; he had not yet got any lodging in Mare-street; two or three days after that, Alvarez wanted me to go with him to Hackney, to endeavour to get a lodging for him; I went with him to Hackney; but before we came there, says he, I will shew you my cousin's house; there will be a house, when you come to see it, such a house as you have hardly ever seen; when we came quite upon it, says he, this is it, look! look! and it certainly is a very genteel house; says he, stand against me, that he may not see me as I go by, so I stood and he went by me, and held down his head; when we got past the house, says he, is not it a very fine house? yes, says I, a very fine house! says he, a d - n'd old rogue! that ought to be my house! I hear he is very ill with the gout, but d - n him, I hope he will not die; I am gone at once if he dies; then he came just beyond Mr. Alvarez's house, there he begged me to go down Mare-street to see if I could see any lodgings; this was after the order, near a week; because he did not like to be seen in the street, for fear his cousin should see him; I went up, and saw, at a tallow chandler's, lodgings to let, and it was furnished; that would not do, and we went up, as far as I thought Mare-street went; I could not see any; I came, and told him; God, says he, I must have one; he begged the favour of me to go up and down again, and look attentively, for I must have one; if it is at a public house I must have one; I went up and down again, and could see none but this; it was unfurnished; I informed him, and we left Hackney, and found none; some few days after that, Israel, Alvarez and me went down to Hackney again, and we missed Mr. Alvarez's house; and we came home; he said he would send his Bet that lived with him, for he would be d - n'd if Bet did not get him a lodging; Bet got him a lodging some weeks after; when the lodging was taken he seemed happy and easy; some time after that Mr. Robins wanted the apartments; and desired Alvarez to get other lodging; Alvarez was down there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090104"></xptr>frequently some time after that; he desired me to attend him very closely, because business was at the heighth; I had seen Alvarez at Mr. Robins's frequently.</p>
               <p>Did Israel go down there at that time? - Israel went there sometimes; he wished me to take a lodging, because business was at the heighth, and required to be watched.</p>
               <p>When had he first the compting-house in Tokenhouse-yard? - That was after the order sent a good bit; it might be a month, the quarter would have been up the 16th or 17th of August; about the middle of May the place in Tokenhouse-yard was taken; he had been looking out some days for a compting-house, because he said he would have a better appearance; Mr. Cohen shewed him one, she did not like that; and he shewed him another, which was No. 19 in Token-house-yard, he went in and agreed for it; in the latter end of April, or the beginning of May, Mr. Taylor's goods came up; about the 25th of April they came to the Bull-inn, in Bishopsgate-street; we had the invoice of them, there were so many pieces to be up such a day by the London Carrier; the invoice came to the Antigalican Coffee-house; when Israel saw the letter, that the goods were come up, says he, I will go and look at the road-bill, and I can tell whether they are come up or not; Israel and me went to look at the road-bill; Alvarez did not go with us; we found the goods were coming, we went to the Bull-inn to know if they were come; and they said yes; they were taken to the Goldsmith's Porter's galley-key; then Israel gave me orders to go and receive them, they were for exportation, and the desire to Mr. Taylor was, that they might be sent there, they were going by another ship.</p>

               <p>This is a rough sketch of that letter; some of it is the hand-writing of Israel, and some of Alvarez; me and Alvarez went to Goldsmith's key, and got the goods delivered; Alvarez went to the public-house, I went to get the goods, and pay the man for the warehouse room; I told the man that Mr. Alvarez expected more; I followed him, Alvarez came out and saw them, and he said I am d - n'd glad you have got them, because he was a little afraid of not getting them; now says he, let the man not take them to your house, but the porter shall take them a little way, then we will put them into a coach; they asked me if I knew any body near there; I told them I knew a housekeeper in Newgate-street; they were taken there; we paid the porter two shillings, and they were carried to my house; some few days after that, or near a week, another parcel of goods came.</p>
               <p>None of these were carried to the compting-house? - No, we had no compting-house then, I rather think we had lodgings in Mare-street, but I am not sure; they did not go there, I believe the second parcel was carried to my house; then Alvarez<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090105"></xptr>wanted to know how to sell them; he asked Israel if he knew any body; says Alvarez, sell them to any body, but do not sell them to the Jews; Alvarez took out a couple of pieces, one was a coarse piece, the other was a fine one; we came together to try to sell them, and the first house we came to, was Mr. Jones's, in Great St. Helen's; we went there with two pieces for patterns, and asked what he would give for them; Mr. Jones and he discoursed together for the best part of half an hour, in a kind of languge that I did not understand; they usually did talk English; then Israel came out to me; Mr. Jones was then in the compting-house; Israel came in and said he would not give any more than fifteen shillings a piece; Jones was not there.</p>
               <p>Did you ever mention that conversation either to Jones or to Alvarez? - Jones himself told me, he came out into the front room, and said that they were not goods saleable in England; that he would not give more than fifteen shillings for the coarsest sort, and a couple of shillings a piece extra on the finer sort; or seventeen shillings or eighteen shillings, I cannot say which; I told Israel I did not think Alvarez would sell them at that reduced price; he said why you hear what the captain says, that is Jones; Israel said, as these were the first, Jones must give two guineas for them, which he did; we returned to Alvarez, and told him, that they were not goods saleable in England, and that we could not get any more than fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen for the fine, but had got two guineas; he said it was next door to throwing them away; but in two days after, Alvarez said he would take them down, and that the man should have them at the same price; he did not know where they were going that I know of; one of them them went with me, and the other was waiting for me to come with the remainder; he came to the Blue Anchor with a coach, and there was Israel or Alvarez, and a girl waiting, and Israel told me, as I knew where he went with the other, I should go to the same place, and I went to the captain's; Mr. Jones was not at home; I waited, Jones came home, looked at the goods, calculated them up, and to the best of my knowledge, they came to thirty pounds, at fifteen and seventeen or eighteen shillings, I cannot say which, at Jones's own price; it was then late in the evening; Jones said the bankers were shut up, he did not know where to get the money, begged I would call again in the morning; Alvarez d - nd me shockingly for leaving them without the money, and bid me go back for them, I went back.</p>
               <p>Did Alvarez know with whom they were left at that time? - No, to the best of my recollection he did not; Israel precautioned me not to tell Alvarez who had bought them; I went back again to Mr. Jones, and told him not to leave the goods without the money; then he said I must take the goods away; upon which I took them away; he said I might bring them again any time in the morning, and I should have the money; I took them in a coach to my own house; the next morning we got up pretty early, and I came to that public house, and I was to go with them as before; I went to Mr. Jones's with the goods; Jones counted them over to see if they were the same pieces, and paid me 30 l. 20 l. in two bank notes; I took the money to Alvarez and Israel, who were at the Blue Anchor; the next day Alvarez said to me, tell me who bought the goods; did not Captain Jones buy the goods? yes, says I, he did; he wrapped out a most precious oath against old Israel, and called him every thing but what was good, because he sold them to a Jew.</p>
               <p>What was the time that the goods were sold to Jones? - It was about the middle of May.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Jones purchase any more of Taylor's goods after this? - Yes, after Alvarez knew that Captain Jones had bought the goods, he said he would be d - d if he would not go to him himself the next time; accordingly, the next parcel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090106"></xptr>that came, Alvarez desired me to go to Jones's, and I went to him; that was about the middle of May; his original wife was there, in Skinner-street; Mr. Jones came to Skinner-street and agreed for one bale; Alvarez told him he thought he bought the goods too cheap; Jones told him they were not goods saleable in England, and he would not buy them if he had not others to send abroad; says Alvarez, I bought them for exportation, but as you are going to send them abroad, you shall have them, and send them; Jones bought them at the same price as before; one bale was carried into Skinner-street, and I think, to the best of my recollection, there was a bale of the goods carried from Jones's house to the quay; all the goods, excepting four or five pieces, which Alvarez had pawned (he sold the duplicates off to some body else) all the rest were sold to Jones.</p>
               <p>Tell us all the conversation that passed between Jones and Alvarez, at any of their meetings, either about the goods, or place of residence, or any thing of that sort? - When Mr. Roberts wanted Alvarez to leave his apartment, Alvarez came to the compting-house and told me of it, and by and by came Jones; that was in Tokenhouse yard; he informed Jones, Roberts wanted him to quit his apartment, but says he, I will be d - d if I do.</p>

               <p>In what words did Alvarez inform Jones of that fact? - He told Jones, Roberts wanted the apartments, but I will be d - d if I will; would you have me leave it and take another, or else I shall be blowed up; says Jones, no, to be sure not, for if you do, it will be a rank fraud, and if not, by keeping of it, as your name is Isaac Jesuran Alvarez, and living at Hackney, the Devil could not hurt him, or nothing could hurt him, or something of that sort; I think he said, Jones, would you advise me to quit that, or to take another? the Captain said, keep that to be sure, you d - nd fool.</p>
               <p>Was this conversation prior to the delivery of any of Taylor's goods to Jones? - I think some were delivered, and some after; I think they were some sattinetts.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that there were any goods that were delivered after that to Jones? - Yes, because it was shortly after Alvarez was at Mr. Roberts's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I understood you to say, that all the goods that came to Mr. Taylor, with the exception of two or three pieces, which were pawned by Alvarez, were sold to Jones? - They were.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any other conversation of Jones with Alvarez, or any body? - I heard Alvarez ask Jones, if he could put him in any method, if in case Mr. Taylor was to find out that he sold the goods in this country, instead of exporting them, that he should tell him how he should conceal himself from any harm.</p>
               <p>Then Jones knew they came from Mr. Taylor? - Undoubtedly, towards the latter end he did, but not at first.</p>
               <p>Have you seen Mr. Jones lately? - I saw him this morning; Jones told Alvarez, to the best of my recollection, that there was no other way, unless Alvarez had a correspondent abroad, to send him a blank letter.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of a blank letter? - Alvarez said he had not any body, and asked Jones if he could procure him one; Jones said he would see about it, but I do not recollect that he did promise him he would.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a fraud that is not practised? - That letter was to be filled up according to Mr. Taylor's proceeding against him, to specify that the order was countermanded from abroad.</p>
               <p>That was the Captain's ingenuity? - Yes; I went to the coffee-house one day, and I brought back a letter; I took it to Alvarez, at the compting-house; as soon as I gave it him, I began scribbling on the desk, and Alvarez wrapped out a very bitter oath, why, G - d d - n your eyes, why, says he, they have sent me a blank letter, they might have had the politeness<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090107"></xptr>to have put their names into it; I thought he was going to destroy the letter, then he said, G - d d - n me, it is that sweet fellow, Jones.</p>
               <p>When did you get that letter? - I cannot say exactly; I believe it was some time in April; Alvarez put up the letter, and by and by came Israel to the compting-house; he told Israel the captain had sent that letter, that it was a foreign letter; Israel looked at it it, and said, it was his son's writing, and it was well written; by-and-by Jones came, as he frequently did, came to enquire after some direction; he said, if any thing comes, there will be no dispute, and Alvarez would have one share, and

             another, and Hicks and Israel a third between them; Alvarez shewed him this blank letter, and Jones said, I am better than a father to you, but he did not say he sent the letter; I was arrested by Alvarez, when he was taken up with Jones for 50 l. Jones come to the spunging-house, and seemed surprized, and d - nd Alvarez for doing it; at that time, he asked me what I said at the Grand Jury; I said, I told them what price I gave for the things, he said, that was right, and he would go down to Alvarez and get my discharge the same day, which he did on the Thursday, and came there on the Monday, and said, he was sure nothing would have happened of this sort, had not the stockings at Leicester been traced to his warehouse; Jones was bail for me once before; I had no acquaintance with him, only knowing him while I was with Alvarez, and had been at his house several times.</p>
               <p>To what purpose did you to go to Jones's house? - Because the directions that Jones gave, Jones did not like them to be carried up to Alvarez to sign, and I went with them mostly; a great while after I had been to the Grand Jury, when Jones had been bail as above for me, he took me to the Oxford Tavern, and he asked for a private room; we went into a room, not a private one; says Jones, this is a rough draft of what I wish you to say on the trial, which you will see to be nothing but the truth; I told him, I would speak the truth for him as soon as for Taylor, and for Taylor as soon as for him; he read the paper to me and put it into his pocket; I desired him to let me have it to look over; he gave it me, and said, put it into your pocket; I drank some punch, and as we were going away, Jones said, now you can swear that with great safety, it must be done to night; says he, we will go into a public-house; we went into a public-house, but there were so many people, we could not get room to sit down; says he, swear it, and what you and I do not like afterward, you and I will go and scratch it out; and then afterwards he gave me a copy, and he was called out, and went away; this is the copy, I had it delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Court. What induced you to make discovery in July? - He was going on so very desperately, I thought it was of great consequence to myself; there was no quarrel between us.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wright proved Alvarez taking a compting-house about the 20th of May; Hicks and another person was with him, and he referred her to Messrs. Jones and Co. at No. 17, in Great St. Helens.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heward deposed, he saw Mr. Jones by the last witness's desire, who told him he knew Alvarez, and sold him goods, cochineal, to the amount of 70 l. 80 l. or 100 l. and believed him to be a man of credit, and would trust him with 10,000 l. and he gave him Alvarez's name on paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding spoke on the part of Jones, and Mr. Knowlys on the part of Alvarez.</p>

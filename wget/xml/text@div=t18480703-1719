On 3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi> July, 1843, I received three 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-notes at Messrs Mastennan's—I put them into my trowsers pocket, passed up Cheapside, got into an omnibus at the top of Ludgate-hill, and rode till I came to the turn<lb></lb>ing that leads into St. James's-square—my apartments are very near, and I walked there—I went into my own room with a view to send the notes into the country—I put my hand into my pocket, and they were not there—I did not know how I had lost them, but something which occurred to me in the omnibus has been mentioned to me—I lost them in getting out, by some person to whom I returned thanks for helping me out—some time afterwards, in 1843, one of the notes was presented at the Bank of England, by a clerk in the branch bank at Liverpool—he was tried for having other stolen notes in his possession, and the Judge gave directions that my note should be re<lb></lb>stored to me—I did not trace the other two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Wire, we are solicitors. We had been concerned professionally for the prisoner for several years past—I heard that he came in company with Forrester—I was not there then—I heard the cause of his being taken—several days previous to that he told me the notes he bad paid into his bankers, the Southampton branch of the London and Westminster Bank, had been stopped at the Bank—I accompanied him to the Bank, and saw Mr. Marshall—I was alone with him, and explained to him the circumstances as detailed to me by the prisoner—the prisoner did not give me directions to make any express statement, or to say anything specially—he came to me, and said that on the preceding day he had paid these notes into his banker's, and in the evening, some person came from the Bank, and told him they had been stopped, that they had been stolen some years before, and he requested me to go with him to his banker's—on the way, he told me that he went to Epsom, on the Derby day, and while there, a bet was offered him of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by a person, who he afterwards ascertained from himself, was a Mr. Green, whose residence was at Manchester; and after the race was won, and it being determined in his favour, the gentleman come to him, and wished to settle the bet; that he paid him the two 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in question, and he immediately put the name of the party on the back of the notes—I believe this to be the prisoner's writing on the back of them—he said the person who came to him was attired as a gentle<lb></lb>man, was rather of an imposing appearance, and was in a very handsome carriage; that he knew there was a Mr. Green of Manchester, very much connected with the sporting world, and who kept race-horses, and he sup<lb></lb>posed this was the man; that Mr. Robertson, the editor and proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Railway Record</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Railway Times</hi>, was with him, and saw the notes, and took them in his hand, and Mr. Upham, and another gentleman, were present; one carrying on business in Blackfriars-road, and the other in Edgware-road, and his wife was with him, and other persons—I stated the substance of this to Mr. Marshall—these are the notes which were deposited in Mr. Goodman's hands, at the hearing—they have Green's name on the back of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You became attorney in this case, having acted as attorney for the prisoner for a number of years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he is a licensed victualler, and the proprietor of a clothes-exchange, in Houndsditch—it was through that, that I principally had to do with him—I investigated the title when he purchased the freehold—he has been in possession of considerable sums from time to time—we always had a very high opinion of him—we had business with him respecting that freehold property, and two or three lease-hold properties.</p>

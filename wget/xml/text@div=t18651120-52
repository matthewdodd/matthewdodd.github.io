On the morning of 31st October, about twenty minutes to 12, I was in Shoreditch—I had had information which caused me to look for Smith, and I saw him walking down the street—I followed him, saw him go into a draper's shop, and waited till he came out—he then went back as far as Church-street, which leads into Old Nichol-street—I went round and met him in Cross-street, close to Old Nichol-street—I said, "You must consider yourself in my custody for assaulting Cowley, 160, in Old Nichol-street, on Sunday-night"—he said, "Do you know who I am?"—I said, "Yes, by the description I have received you are the man; you will have to go to the police-station with me"—he drew himself up and bolted forward, calling out, "<hi rend="italic">Rouse, rouse</hi>," which means rescue—a large number of his companions ran out of the Garibaldi and Prince of Wales beer-shops, and Prickett ran up to me and struck me a blow on the back of the head with a large stick about two feet long—it knocked me down and stunned me for a moment—I bled and was senseless for a moment—I got up again and was struck by a large stone or brick on the side of my head, which knocked me down again apparently insensible for a moment or two—while in the act of rising, I drew my truncheon, but Smith snatched it from my hand and struck me two very severe blows across the head, (my helmet had been knocked off by the first blow)—I became smothered in blood—my cape is covered with it now, and it is also torn—Smith was very violent; he threw himself under two or three carts—Law came to my assistance and laid hold of Smith by the arm—he was very violent, threw himself down, tore his coat-sleeve, and got away—after we got to Church-street he threw himself under two carts—there was a great mob—they were flinging stones and sticks at me and Law—we were then the only two constables with Smith—Law caught him again on the other side of a cart, and he was very violent, and threw himself down a great number of times under some carts in Church-street, where he knocked himself about a great deal in his endeavours to get away—a very large mob still pursued us crying, "Kill the police"—I heard Prickett say, "Do not let the b—s take him like that"—he said that in Cross-street and Church-street and Club-row, till he was taken in custody himself—with a great deal of difficulty we got Smith into Club-row, and constables Allingham and Smith came to our assistance after a long period—I did not notice Crockett at all—when Smith got to the station he had some wounds—I believe the biggest part of them were done under the cart—I am sure Prickett is the man who struck</p>

Where did you first see Smith in Shore-ditch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just off Newman's-passage, two or three hundred yards from where I apprehended him—I had not time to take him in Shoreditch—he was on one side, and I was on the other—I did not go over and take him, on account of the busses and carts—I did not cross the street in Shoreditch—he crossed over and came to Church-street—I did not take him then because I had not the chance—a large number of his companions ran out—I knew that by seeing him speak to them—I do not think I said that before the Magistrate, for I was in such a state that I was hardly able to stand in the witness-box—I was struck twice by Smith with my own truncheon—Prickett also struck my head—that might have made me senseless for the moment, but I came to myself—I was then struck with a brick on the side of the head, and fell senseless—I was senseless twice for a moment, but not for half an hour, because I know the time I got to the station—I assisted Smith to the station—I did not say that I was assisted by my brother con<lb></lb>stable to the station; those are Mr. Wontner's words—(<hi rend="italic">The deposition stated</hi>: "I was assisted away by my brother constable"—I told the Magistrate's clerk he had made a mistake—he corrected it, and it was put down here, at the bottom of my evidence (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:—"I did not say I was assisted away, but that I assisted the other constable in taking Smith")—MR. Wontner addressed the Magistrate, and commented upon the feet that I was assisted away by my brother constable, and when the clerk read my deposition over, I corrected it—Law came up before I received any blows—I know that there are summonses against me and Law for excess of duty, but I have not seen any for attempting to murder Smith, nor have I heard witnesses ex<lb></lb>amined on such a summons—I heard witnesses examined for the defendant at the police-court—I heard Hall, a cab-proprietor, examined—Law and I did not lay hold of Smith by the collar on each side—I cannot say whether Smith had a parcel and an umbrella in his hand—Law had hold of him, but I had not hold of him at the same time—we were not bitting him over the head with our staves—I never saw him put up his arms to save his head—we did not drag him towards the cab, striking him all the while—I never saw him struck on the head—after the surgeon was examined yesterday, I knew that Smith had eleven wounds on his head, but I never saw him struck on the head—he did not fall down against a cab—I did not see Law drag him up against a butcher's shop—it was near a butcher's at the corner of Cross-street that he struck me on the head with my staff—I did not see Law hit Smith on the head near the butcher's, or see him fall as if he was dead—one of us did not fell on top of him, that I am aware of—I never saw him fall, but I saw him down at different times—he was on the pavement by the butcher's shop, but whether he fell or threw himself down I do not know—he did not seem to be quite insensible—I did not see one of the policemen beat him on the head, and on different parts of his body—the butcher did not say, "For God's sake do not murder the man, but secure him"—no one offered to assist us to take him, they tried to get him away—some one, I believe, went to get some water—I suppose they fetched it for Smith—I did not strike Smith on the bead with my truncheon after the water was got—I heard no one cry '"Shame!"—Smith did not put his head under a costermonger's barrow; he flung himself under an apple-stall—Law and I did not then run round to the other side of the barrow and hit him on the</p>

On Tuesday, 31st October, I was en duty with Ingram in Church-street, Shoreditch—we were in uniform—I saw Ingram collar Smith about twenty yards up Cross-street—a struggle ensued, I ran up and beard Smith call "Rouse" several times—we were surrounded by thirty or forty people, and two or three stones were thrown—Prickett was among them; he had a stick in his hand, and struck Ingram on the head With it, and knocked him down—Ingram got up, drew his staff, and was directly struck by a stone which knocked him down—Smith directly snatched his staff from his hand, and struck him two blows on his head—he also struck me on the shoulder with the staff—I drew my staff and struck Smith on the shoulder to disable him—I struck another blow at him, which hit his head and knocked him down—when he rose, Ingram wrested hist staff from him before he had time to do anything with it—I heard Pritchett say, "Look at the b—y sods, do not let them take him like this"—Smith still continued very violent—I had hold of him all the time, till I knocked him down—he was struggling violently to get away—several stones were thrown—I kept hold of Smith—he threw himself under a horse which was in a cart in Church-street, so that the mob would have parted us, but we dragged him out, and got him to the Corner of Club-row—the stones fell very thick there, and Willmot came to our assistance—he put his back to us, and kept the crowd from our rear, while we took Smith through-Club-row and Anchor-street—Allingham, 15 <hi rend="italic">G</hi>, and Smith, 95 <hi rend="italic">G</hi>, came to our assistance—I pointed Prickett out, and said, "Allingham, take that man in custody, he has assaulted my brother constable"—Allingham and Smith took Prickett—I did not see whether he resisted—I saw nothing of Crockett—my helmet was not knocked off, but it was struck several times by the brick-bats, and damaged—Smith kicked me in the stomach in, Church-street—I struck him once on the shoulder, and once on the head—I struck him on the shoulder to disable him, but as he <hi rend="italic">wriggled</hi> about it hit his head by accident.</p>

               <p>dirt round the principal wounds—I think some of them might have been produced by a policeman's truncheon, or some such weapon or stick; half a dozen of them perhaps—the small serious wounds at the back of his head, which had dirt on them, and in them, I consider could not have been produced by a truncheon—they were produced by something that would penetrate beneath the scalp—some of the principal wounds might have been produced by his struggling on the ground—the edge of the pavement or the edge of a cart-wheel would be a very likely thing to do it—he had two black eyes, one was recent and one was not—I have not seen him since—I saw the other two men at the station.</p>

               <p>together, and then they took out their staves and began striking him one after the other, blow after blow—Smith gave no provocation; he only just turned a little way.</p>

I live at 47, Bethnal-green-road—on 31st October, I was in Hall's cab, going to the hospital with my son—the cab was stobbed by a waggon at the corner of Cross-street—there was a cart on the other side—I saw two policemen some distance down the street—they had a man between them that had a very small parcel under his arm—they had it dreadful fight—the two policemen be at him at once—I do not know the man—he was not fighting with the two constables, because a policeman who had him by the collar with his right hand, beat him on the front of his head with his left, and the other policeman, the tallest one, beat him on the back of his head rapidly with his staff, but did not lay hold of him—in the five minutes the cab was detained I should think they struck him ten or twelve times, but I begged the driver to turn the cab, so that I should not see it—they came towards the cab—I could not say whether the prisoner fell or whether they pushed him down, but he" was down on the ground by the grocer's—there was a window broken—they dragged him into the middle of the road, and then he appeared to get foot-hold—he was close against the cab, I could have touched his head—he got up, and the shortest policeman dragged him towards the pavement again, and the tall policeman put up his arm and staff with great violence, I bid my face in my handkerchief and heard a blow—the people shrieked most violently, and the man halloaed as if in pain—there were many people there; they came up against the cab when he got a foothold, he had a wound on his head an inch and a half or two inches long—there was a butcher's shop near—I did not hear what the people shrieked out, but the prisoner screamed out from the treatment he was receiving—I saw blood on him.</p>

Q.</hi> On which side of the cab were you sitting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the right side—I could have touched his head—the people were thirty or forty yards up Cross-street when I first saw them, the two constables had their staves out then, the shortest man was striking Smith before the other pulled out his staff—when one took out his staff, the other took his out instantly—I should not know the man again, or the constables I was too frightened to take notice—I did not see the man wrench the staff out of the constables hand, or strike the constable at all—I do not know what provo<lb></lb>cation they had for taking him—when they took him, he was twisting himself as anybody would to get away—I saw no blood on the constable, and I do not believe there was any; but there was mud and blood both on the prisoner's head—I saw nothing of Prickett—there was no other person in Cross-street, either male or female—I heard nobody call out "Rouse"—I was nearly at the other end of the street—they might be twelve or fourteen yards from me, against a great gate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of 19, Church-street, Shoreditch, two doors from the Church-street end of Cross-street—Cross-street has only four houses on each side—it is only about twice the length of this Court from Church-street to Old Nichol-street—on Tuesday morning, 31st October, I was in front of my shop—I have a place there where I stand outside—I saw some people running towards Cross-street from each side of the way—I saw a man struggling with two officers, and as they came to the front of my shop he fell to the ground, and while he was on the ground the two officers repeatedly struck him, one on the head and the other on the lower parts of the body—I went to them and said, "For God's sake, do not murder the man, secure him, or call for further help"—the tallest officer flourished his staff over the prisoner and said, "Get out of the way"—the policeman's back was towards me—the man was all over blood and mud—by appearance he had been rolling in the mud, and his head was bleeding in more than one place—I did not take much notice whether the constables were calm and collected, because when I had told them not to murder the man, I went into my shop—the man had regained his feet, and the people had gathered round him—the constables were taking it very quietly, but they seemed very much to aim at knocking the man about, they were not more excited than other people would be under such circumstances—the man got on his feet—I left my shop, went to the corner of Club-row, and saw him on the ground, and three or four females round him—to the best of my belief they were trying to get his watch from him—the policeman told them to get away—the man asked for a drink of water, and the women all rushed away directly to get the water—as he turned round to ask for the water, the short policeman hit him on the head with his staff, and he fell senseless—he was standing before that, leaning against the policeman—the people all screamed out, "They have murdered him," and I felt so sick I was obliged to turn away—I cannot say how many blows were struck.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say before the Magistrate "As the constable was coming round the corner with the man, I saw the constable was bleeding from his forehead?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—that is not correct—when the man came round the corner of Cross-street, and the policeman were struggling with him, the policeman were not bleeding.</p>

I am a coffehouse-keeper, of 177, Church-street—on 31st October, about 12 at noon, I heard a wonderful noise in the street, and screaming—I went out, and first saw a policeman's staff up, in the act of using it on the head and shoulders of a short man—to the best of my recollection he used it on him from six to eight times, and then another policeman came round on the left side of him, whose head was bleeding—he used his staff once or twice, or it might have been three times, on the man's head and shoulders—the man twisted round and very nearly fell against the butcher's shop—he <hi rend="italic">slewed</hi> again, went on his hands and knees, scrambled under a cart, and that was all I saw of him—when he was scrambling under the cart I saw the staves going up and down a little—I saw blood on the man, and mud too—I should think I did hear some blows.</p>

               <p>soon as he was at the other side, the policeman struck him on the head—I heard the people say, "Do not strike the man any more, if you want any help we will take him," but he said, "Stand back"—he held up his staff and if they had gone to assist him I take it he would have struck them—I saw the staff going, but I did not go from the door till they had been at Club-row some few minutes—I watched the crowd some minutes, and saw the staff descending—all that I could see the man struggling, was to get away from the blows—I do not think he tried to get away from the policemen—he had blows enough to kill ten men, but I suppose his time was not come.</p>

I saw them murdering the man, and said, "Why do not you let the man alone? what do you want to murder him like that for?" He held up his staff, and said, "Stand back" I said, "Why do not you put him in a cab and take him properly?" He said, in a rough manner, "Will you help us to take him?" as much as to say, What is that to do with you? While I was looking at the shameful manner in which they were dragging him along four more policemen came up. I should not have stopped if I had done anything, but Law said, "Take that long fellow; he has thrown a piece of stick at me;" it was about twice the length of a piece of firewood, and would not have weighed an ounce. I did not throw it, but I saw it hit him. I said, "I look as if I had been throwing things, don't I?" I have a brother-in-law a constable, and I knew what I should get if I resisted them. Smith's head was cut about shamefully, and everybody said, "You</p>

               <p>wretches, you are murdering him." I said, "I will let the Magistrates know how he is knocked about." And Law said, "Yes; when you get there you will not have a word to say for yourself. When I got to the station, he said that I had struck him over the head with a stick. I said, "What sort of a stick?" He said, "A short walking stick." It is all false, they try to make out that I am a companion of thieves, but I work hard for my living and can prove it. I could not stand seeing the man knocked about like that and could not help speaking. I do not associate with any body about there, I have been in prison a fortnight, and they have had too much time to hatch up their lies. When they got me to the station they thought I was a man named Long Hunt, a hawker, and they accused me of being a hawker, they now want to patch up their case by saying they know me to be the companion of this man, which is false.</p>

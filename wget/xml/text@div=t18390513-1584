                  </hi>. I am a paper-hanger, and live in Bride-lane, Fleet-street, in the parish of St. Bridget, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> St. Bride—it is my dwelling-house. On the night of the 11th of May, at five minutes after ten o'clock, I was sitting in the kitchen with my wife—the kitchen door was shut—the parlour shutters were not fastened—the window was quite whole, and shut, and the sashes fastened—my wife hallooed out, "Thieves"—I immediately jumped from my chair, ran along the passage into the street, turned the corner opposite my house, and saw the prisoner running up the lane to<lb></lb>wards the steps of the church passage, where he dropped the time-piece—I followed him through the passage, and saw him turn down the avenue to<lb></lb>wards Fleet-street, and turn again up Fleet-street—he was making for Shoe-lane, and when he got on the pavement he went towards Water-lane—I called, "Stop thief," and saw a tall gentleman stop him at the corner of Water-lane—I got up and collared him, and directly after the officer came up and took hold of him—I am quite certain he is the man I saw drop the time-piece—it had been on the chimney-piece in my parlour—he must have got in by a false latch or plyers—he must have entered the house to get it and open the parlour door—this is my time-piece—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

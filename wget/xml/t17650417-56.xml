            . I live at Hull, in Yorkshire: on the 15th of last month, some time in the night, I was robbed of the things mentioned in the indictment, on board my ship, that lay at <placeName id="t17650417-56-crimeloc314">Smart's key</placeName>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen either of them since?</p>
               <p>Walker. I have seen the watch, coat, and waistcoat, and one book. When the prisoner was charged before the Justices at Whitechapel the book was found upon him: that was on Saturday the 16th. The Justices told me, as it was in the city I must take him before my Lord Mayor. I took him there; the crowd being so numerous I took a coach. When in the coach I promised, if he would tell me where the things were, I would not hurt or prosecute him: he seemed to be relent, said he was an unhappy wretch; and that if I would not hurt him he would tell me. I said I would not. He said he had pawned the waistcoat in one place in Rosemary-lane, and the coat was in another; and the watch he had exchanged for another in Tower-street, to a house-carpenter: thus instead of going to my Lord Mayor, we drove to Rosemary-lane. We first got the waistcoat, then the coat, then we went and got the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you count you did right?</p>
               <p>Walker. If I had not promised him, we should not have got the things again. He then was under the care of a constable: I could neither hinder or forward it.</p>

            . I live at the Coach and Horses, Whitechapel; the prisoner came there on the 6th of March. I wondered to see him with a watch in his pocket. I snatch'd a pocket-book out of his trowsers: I went to see what was in it, he snatch'd it from me. And when we came to the Justices he threw the book away; it was pick'd up. The Justice found a letter in it that belongs to Mr. Walker. Then I went to him; he said he had been robbed of the things mentioned.</p>

            . The prisoner came to a house where I was, and pulled out a watch, and wanted to sell it, saying, he was going to St. Thomas's hospital, and wanted money. I changed watches with him, and gave him 7 s. to boot.</p>

               <p>I was going upon the keys about 5 o'clock that morning; I saw a man come out of this vessel; he had a bundle tied up in a blue and white handkerchief; after that I picked these things up between two casks.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Did the prisoner belong to your vessel?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No. I don't know that I ever saw him before.</p>

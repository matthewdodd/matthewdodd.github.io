                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, and live at No. 28, Saffron<lb></lb>hill. On Thursday night, the 24th of February, I went to the Coopers' Anna public-house, which is opposite my place—the prisoners and several persons were drinking in front of the bar—I put out my hand to one of the prisoners, and said, "Shake hands with me in friendship"—he spat on my hand—I asked what he meant by that, and he hit me in the eye with hit hand—I asked what he meant by that, and he struck me in the mouth—then there was a <hi rend="italic">scrummage</hi> with the quart-pots, during which I re<lb></lb>ceived a blow on the left eye, where there is now a scar—I did not see how that was inflicted—a doctor was sent for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Laurence Bartoli, of Saffron-hill. On the night of the 24th of February, I went to the Coopers' Arms for a pint of beer—I saw my father, Jonathan Cherry and Mr. Coleman there—Coleman was very quiet—he had not been struck then—I saw the prisoner Pelagrias strike him with a knife, after my father was struck—there were not several persons quarrelling at that time—there were a good many people there after the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> commenced—my attention was attracted to my father—I am not mistaken about the knife—I dragged my father to a butt—Pelagrias Maestai then took the knife out of his pocket with a row of Catholic beads on it, and he ran at Cole<lb></lb>man, and struck him on the eye with it—the knife was open, and the beads were entangled with it—he struck him right on the eye—I saw no other blow struck—I held my father till the police came, and I said, "For God's sake lock them up."</p>

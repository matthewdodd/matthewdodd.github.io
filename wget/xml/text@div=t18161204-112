I had 153l. in my possession-there were one 30l. and seven 10l. notes, in my right-hand pocket, and in my left, there were one 30l., one 20l., and one 1l. notes, which were in my tobacco-box; and I had two 1l. notes in my waistcoat pocket, I went to look, and saw five men, I asked what business they had there; one of them said, he would soon let me know. They came over the wall, which is seven feet high.

            , is it he? I do not know him. I knew them all before. There was a great light. Warren told two of them to seize me, and they immediately seized me by the throat. They thrust me back into the shed; they took hold of my legs, and threw me into the lime. Two of them held me, and another cut off my breeches pockets, which had my money in them. They then went away; Curtis said, let us go back and kill him. I did not know him till he was apprehended. I then knew him to be the man who seized me. He told them to take out a knife, and take my head clean off. Another said, we will do it another way. They held me, and he beat and kicked me. I think they had been joined by some others while they were in the yard. I thought there were seven of them. I lost a great deal of blood; they tied my head with a handkerchief, and then left me. I begged of them to save my life. Mr. Cranch hallowed out of a window. Curtis said, I wish we had killed him; and Warren said, it did not signify if we had, for what he did to me. They then left me. I had also a protection box, and two tobacco boxes. I have seen the watch since at the Thames Police-office, about a fortnight ago, when Curtis was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoken of Curtis, Warren, and Dee, did any body else hurt you - A. Yes; the prisoner Gates was one of them. I am sure he is one of the men who robbed me; and the prisoner Baker was one also. I heard him say, when they were going away, "he does not know me, for I got in the dark; I do not think I saw him." I heard Warren say, he only knows two of us; they got over the wall, and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. You kept a great deal of money about you-A. I did. They went over the wall; I am sure there was six men; I did not lose my senses. I only knew Curtis by sight; he was dressed in a blue coat, light waistcoat, light breeches, and white handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were examined here, on Warren's trial, did you not say that you only knew him - A. I said, I should know two more. Curtis is the man who wanted to kill me.</p>

            Recollect yourself; did you not say, that if Warren(who has suffered) had not said, that Baker was there, you should not have known it-A. I worked with him for two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have found him at the time of the robbery if you chose - A. I could. I am sure it was Baker, by his voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is by the voice that you attempt to swear to Baker - A. No. I knew where to find him, but did not take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that they were all tall men - A. I did not say any such thing. I did not know Gates before.</p>

               <p>Q. What reason have you for swearing to him - A. He is one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, when you first saw Gates, that you could not swear to him - A. No. Mr. Goff asked me, and I said, he was not the man that tied me, as I thought it was another. Gates was taken up on the 20th of last month; I knew him as well as I knew Curtis; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see Curtis before Gates was taken-A. No. I saw him the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear to Gates before Curtis had said any thing to you - A. I did. I had talked with Curtis at the Police-Office.</p>
               <p>Court. Before you swore to Gates, did Curtis tell you he was one of them - A. I believe I did not hear him say so till afterwards. I saw Curtis at Union Hall.</p>

            . I was concerned in this robbery, and have been suffered to give evidence. I was in company with the prisoners Gates and Baker, and two others, who I do not know. There were only five of us. We met at the Spread Eagle, and then went into the lime-yard, and saw Millard. Baker and myself got him down, and the others took his money. I did not see him struck more than twice. I do not know how much money there was; I was to have 16l. 8s. for my share, but I did not get it. It was left in the prisoner Gates hands, in order to employ a solicitor, if any of us were taken up. I got between 11l. and 12l. One of the men said let us kill him; it was not me; I only held him down. I did not know Warren; I have heard that he was executed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. You go to commit a robbery with four men, two of whom you do not know - A. Yes. Mr. Holmes keeps the house; the two men met us afterwards; they were not at the Spread Eagle. I was not here when Warren was tried; I was in custody when he was executed.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you in custody for - A. For taking some tea on the river. I saw Millard at the Thames Police-Office. I was afterwards admitted an evidence. I told the magistrate that I knew of the robbery. After we had committed it; I think we got over the gate.</p>

Yes, she came into the shop on the first of August, between two and three in the afternoon; she asked for a quarter of an ounce of fourpenny thread; I served her the thread, and she gave me the sixpence; I looked at the sixpence and observed it to be a bad one; I took the thread and kept the sixpence, and told her when she brought me the money she should have the thread: she said she would bring me the penny.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing? - A. No; I watched her from the corner of Jewin-street, and I followed her; she turned down Jewin-street, and went into Mr. Barlow's, a tinman; I observed him looking at the sixpence; I went in and desired him not to give her that sixpence; he asked me whether she had been at my house; I told him yes; he said he would send for a constable, which he did, and the constable came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing upon this before the constable came? - A. She uttered some very unpleasant expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. The constable came, and she was delivered to the constable and the two sixpences? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she come for? - A. penny pewter tea-spoon; I gave her one, and she gave me a sixpence, as soon as I saw it I perceived it to be a bad one; she asked me to give her the sixpence again; I told her no; with that she made use of the most dreadful language that could be uttered from a woman; Mr. Mason came in at the moment; he asked me if that woman had been purchasing any article; I told him yes; he said, has she tendered any money to you; I said a bad sixpence; he desired me to keep it; I told him that I conceived her to be one of those people that went about uttering bad money; I sent for a constable; I delivered the bad sixpence I received from the prisoner, and Mr. Mason delivered his immediately.</p>

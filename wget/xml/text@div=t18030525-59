             sworn. - I have been formerly in the Light Horse; I keep a house in the City of Westminster; On Tuesday, the 10th of May, I went to Mile-end New-town, and from thence to Whitechapel, to the sign of the Sugar Loaf, in Church-street, to get a favourite sword given me by his Grace, the Duke of Northumberland; I stopped there to spend the evening, and got a little intoxicated; returning about half past nine, in Whitechapel I was accosted by the prisoner, and another girl, informing me they could get me a lodging where I could lie down with a pretty girl; the prisoner took me to <placeName id="t18030525-59-crimeloc326">Angel-court, in Wentworth-street, near Brick-lane</placeName>

At last, I found the door, and found it fast against me; by making a noise at the door, the woman in black came and opened the door; I told her I was robbed of my money, handkerchief, and gloves, and I would call for an officer; she told me she knew nothing of the prisoner, she was gone away from the house; I went across the way, and made application for an officer; a man, who keeps an eating-house, went with me for an officer; he said it was well I escaped with my life, for it was a very bad house; we could not get an officer; he took me then to the Flying Horse, where we found an officer, and he desired me to leave it till the morning, and come about half after eight, which I accordingly did; the officer came to me, and took me to a house in Wentworth-street, where we found the prisoner and a good many more eating hot rolls; the officer, when we got into the room, asked me if any of those girls was the girl that robbed me; I immediately said, the prisoner was the girl; he searched her immediately, and found upon her six half guineas in gold, and seven seven-shilling pieces, two slides belonging to my purse, and a silk pocket handkerchief; I asked her what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250048"></xptr>she had done with the remainder of the things; she said, that was all she had got.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you told her it would be better for her to give an account of the things? - A. No; I told her I would punish her; she said, that was my money, and hoped I would forgive her; I asked what she had done with my purse; she did not give me any answer; the officer took the money; I did not find my gloves, my braces, nor the purse; there was some silver found upon her; I missed all the articles mentioned in the indictment; the silk handkerchief was a striped one, I wore it on my neck in the morning instead of a white one; it was in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing remarkable about the half-guineas or seven-shilling-pieces? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you sober enough to swear you did not give her these things? - A. Yes, I was sober enough to know I did not give her any thing; she did not ask me.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not sober when you went there? - A. I got more sober afterwards.</p>
               <p>EDWARD SMITH sworn. - I am one of the officers belonging to the Police Office, Whitechapel; I took up the prisoner; I found upon her six half-guineas, seven seven-shilling-pieces, two little brass rings, he calls them sliders to his purse, and a silk handkerchief; the prosecutor applied to me about eight o'clock in the morning, and stated to me that he was picked up by two little girls; I went to George-street, Spital-fields, to a Mr. Jenkins's, where these match-girls lodge; I apprehended her, and took her to the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor know her immediately? - A. No, he did not, he hesitated some time; when I searched her, and found the handkerchief, he said, that was the girl; she said, it was not her, it was the other little girl; I asked her what she had done with the other two seven-shilling-pieces; she said, she had no more, that was all the other girl, who was with her when they picked him up, gave her.</p>
               <p>Q.She never admitted it was her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He has stated that he immediately pointed out the prisoner? - A. No, he did not; there were two or three other little girls; he did not know which to pitch upon; she begged to be forgiven, he was in a violent passion, and said he would hang her; I asked her if that was the gentleman's money; she said, the other girl gave it her; there is nothing remarkable about the money.(The handkerchief was produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The other girl and I were going up the Minories; this gentleman met us, and he says, come along, I will give you five shillings; the other little girl was but eight years old; we came back, and went with him, and when we came to the house, he gave us three shillings and sixpence; he went with the other girl, he did not go with me at all; I stopped at the door, and she came out; we came into Whitechapel; she gave me the money; she said, the gentleman gave it her, and desired me to keep it till next morning for her.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To the Prosecutor.) Q.You spoke of a pair of braces - where were those braces? - A. I had them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Smith. The prosecutor expressed a surprize bow they could get his gallows's off from under his waistcoat. <rs id="t18030525-59-verdict327" type="verdictDescription">

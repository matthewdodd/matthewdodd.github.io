                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 137, Blackfriars-road—on 14th January I went to Mr. Harriss', a pawnbroker, in the London-road, to purchase a pair of boots—I saw the prisoner there and a man named De Grussa; they offered a chain in pledge to the pawnbroker's assistant for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he offered 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., then 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. then 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but did not purchase it—De Grussa then spoke to me and said it was a beautiful chain; that the prisoner was in distress and wished to dispose of it—that it cost 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he wanted 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, but did not care whether he pledged or sold it—I said, "Well, if the pawnbroker does not give him what he asks I will give him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it if it is what he represents it to be"—he spoke to the prisoner—they both left the shop together and I with them—the prisoner put the chain in his pocket—I said to De Grussa, "I know your face, and I look to you as the responsible person"—he then interpreted for the prisoner, who took the chain out and wanted 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he then came down to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would not have anythng to do with it—he then said 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Well 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is not of so much moment, I will give you that; I have not got the money, will you go with me to get it?"—the prisoner handed the chain to De Grussa, who went with me to Russell's the pawnbroker's to pledge my watch, and the prisoner left us, but afterwards returned and waited outside while I pledged it for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the two men then went on before me—I had a sovereign before that, but in my flurry I was short half-a-crown—I said to De Grussa, can you oblige me with half-a crown—he said yes, but I then found I had it—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he went to De Grussa's house, which is a penny ice shop—he went into his parlour and brought out the chain and delivered it to me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>—I paid him six sovereigns and paid the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the chain is not gold—it is valued at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I pledged my wedding-ring and every little thing I had about me to raise the money—if I had not believed it to be gold I should not have given that price for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Church-street, St. Giles's, and let ray rooms furnished and unfurnished. The prisoner applied to me the week before last to take a room in my house—she took the top room—the bed, bedding, bedstead, three chairs, a table, fender, tea-kettle, saucepan, and other articles, were in it—I agreed to let it to her—the servant gave her possession—I never saw her in the house myself afterwards—she ap<lb></lb>plied for the room about the middle of the week, and said she would come and take it—on Sunday morning she came and asked me for the key, and gave her name as M'Carthy—she said she would come presently for the key—not seeing her all the week, last Saturday I broke open the door, and</p>

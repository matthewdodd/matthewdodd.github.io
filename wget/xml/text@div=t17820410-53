               <p>Upon the 31st of March, last Sunday week, there had been an information given to the office, of five footpads robbing about Pancras, we were ordered out, seven of us, we went to the George, at Pancrass, we went there about eight o'clock, we asked the woman for a candle and lanthorn to go and search the workhouse, we went with a candle and lanthorn to search the old workhouse, we were told they used to harbour there; we had not been long come out of that before we met the five footpads, all together, five of them, the first I laid hold of was Clark.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - This might be near nine o'clock, if not quite.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was it? - Between the George and Pancras workhouse, I laid hold of Clark immediately, one of our people said, there were seven of us, they are all here together; Clark immediately drawed his hanger upon me, and M'Manus came up to my assistance; says he, you bloody thief you, if he had not come up directly, I would have cut your head off; we secured him, he dropped his hanger immediately, the others ran away, our people took him home as fast as they could, I went to Mr. Hemmings's, of Cold-bath fields, as we heard one lodged there I told him we had been attacked by five, and four had got away out of the five, I think if all our people had come up we should have got most of them; Clark made use of a very particular expression, says he to them I saw the light in the old workhouse, and I said it was the traps, (meaning the thief-takers) one made answer, no, it can't be the traps, it must be the old woman that used to lay there.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examinations.</p>
               <p>Did they say it to one another? - No; he said it to me, that they had said, it must be the traps, and that he said, no, it cannot, it must be the old woman that lies there.</p>

When I got hold of Clark, says I to Jealous, run after that tall fellow, he is a soldier I am sure, you can run faster than I; he came back a little after and said they had got into the fields; then we went down with Clark to the George, we washed his head which was bloody, we got him to town, when we came to town the watchman was going ten o'clock.</p>

            's people came and told me, they had had an engagement with some footpads at Pancras, and that one belonging to the gang was somewhere opposite me, in a little house opposite to me, I told them they might depend upon it, if I saw any person of that description, I should certainly take them into custody, or use my endeavours so to do; a little after ten, Mr. Nicholls, my neighbour, came and informed me there was some people talking in the field, opposite my house, I went out with Mr. Nicholls, but hearing voices did not think it prudent to go into the field to apprehend them; sometime after I had returned to my house, I went out of doors again, then I saw the prisoner Wilkinson, and two others, come out of the field, opposite to my house, I ran and called Nicholls out, Wilkinson was then without his hat, and seemed as if he had been running, I walked on one side of him, by the skuttle-ground wall, Mr. Nicholls and I secured him, the other two ran away, as soon as I laid hold of him, we struggled very much, for the space of twenty or forty minutes, I quitted my hold of him, to pick up an old coat that was dropped, and I saw him stoop, as if he meant to drop something, Mr. Nicholls called out that he had dropped something, and called to my servant, Nan, says he, pick that up, with that my maid brought me this watch, she gave it me, and told me she picked it up, I saw her stoop and pick up something.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>I was close to the place where it was dropped, I don't suppose farther off than it is from this gentleman, here is the watch, (producing it) I secured him and took him into my house, and I thought it most expedient to send for a constable, I sent for my neighbour Davis, he was searched in my presence, and there was a dollar, a halfcrown, or two, and two new shillings, found upon him; we took him to Bow-street, and when we got him into Bow-street, the gentleman had just been there, giving his information of this watch that had been found, he gave a very minute description of it, we searched him, there was nothing farther found.</p>
               <p>You did not see him quit any thing, or put any thing out of his hand? - I saw him stoop.</p>
               <p>Mr. DAVIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable, I was sent for to Mr. Hemmings's, the Apple-tree, I searched Wilkinson, (he produced a handkerchief containing another handkerchief, a silver watch, a dollar, two halfcrowns, two new shillings, a sixpence, and a leather snuff-box, I believe it is).</p>

               <p>Mr. Booth deposed the watch was his, and that he had it seventeen or eighteen years, and took an account of the number, but could swear to the watch by the case, which was mock tortoise-shell, and the seal which was very remarkable, that it had engraved upon it,</p>

            , deposed the dollar produced in court had two little pieces of dirt upon it, that it looked like her's, that one of the new shillings was her fellow servant's, the other they took from her, but she cannot swear to them, there being no mark upon them.</p>
               <p>To Booth. Is there any circumstance by what you can fix the time you was robbed, with any degree of exactness? - I had been up to Islington, from thence to Bagnigge-Wells, and I think it must be about a quarter before nine, it was about ten minutes after ten when I got up to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>To Dickson. What became of you after Clark was taken? - We took him into the George and stopped there a few minutes, and then brought him to town; Mr. M'Manus and some other officers went to the watchhouse, and we went to Hemmings's, I looked upon it near half an hour before we got to Hemmings, we got there a little before ten, or within a few minutes, as soon as we left Hemmings the watch was crying ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>How far is it from the place where you took Clark to Hemmings's? - It is no great way, Mr. Hemmings's is in Cold-bath-fields, and this is a little beyond the Adam and Eve, at Pancrass, it is not above ten minutes walk, but we stopped some time to look in the ditch for the cutlasses, where they got over, and that detained us.</p>
               <p>Mr. M'Manus was asked what time he got to Bow-street with the prisoner? - He said as they passed by Red-Lion-Square, the watchman was going ten, that he stopped some considerable time at the public-house where he carried Clark.</p>

               <p>I went up to Middle-Row, Holborn, the narrow way of Holborn, and was coming home again, I went to ease myself at this place they said they saw me come out of, and was coming across the way, I had my hat in my hand, and they laid hold of me and took those things I call my property from me; that watch is mine, I have had the dollars three months, I bought the watch of my brother, and gave him two guineas and a crown for it, there was no body else with me, I never saw this man at all, there was a dollar, two half crowns, two new shillings, two old ones, a sixpence, and my watch and handkerchief there, upon one side with I.

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 19th of January, I was behind the counter in the shop, in the parish of St. George's, Bloomsbury: between 5 and 6 in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came and broke the window; I heard it, and saw his hand in at the hole; he reached, and took out a piece of cotton. I immediately ran to the door, and called out, Stop thief. I saw nobody pursued that was likely to take him. I ran, and overtook him in about sixty yards. I threw him down: He had the cotton in his arms; as he fell, that was under him. I brought him and that back, and sent for my master. The cotton is my master's property. He said he was drunk, but he ran very fast; he did not appear to be drunk.</p>

               <p>I came out of a woman's house very drunk. I had a falling out with my wife, and was going to Mr. Hull's, a pawnbroker. I am as honest an hard working man as ever was born.</p>

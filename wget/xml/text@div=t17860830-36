               <p>On the 24th of August, I was going to Guildhall to work, and coming through Fleet-street I saw the prisoner run out of the Temple mews, and afterwards the prosecutor called to me, saying to me, stop thief.</p>

               <p>Had he any thing upon him when he was stopped? - He had a bit of gauze in his pocket; I saw that found, and two pick-lock keys, and a chissel he threw out of his pocket; I believe the constable has the gauze now.</p>

               <p>Was the prosecutor present when they were delivered to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were the things that were delivered to the constable the same that was in the bundle of the prisoner? - Yes, here is the bit of gauze that was found in the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor's wife. Where were these bits of gauze? - They were in the cupboard wrapped up.</p>
               <p>Can you know these pieces at all? - I swore to them being my own.</p>
               <p>What do you know them by? - I know them by my wrapping them up; I know them to be my own.</p>
               <p>Can you know them that were not in the bundle? - I know I had a piece of gauze hung over the cupboard door.</p>
               <p>Suppose the man had any other gauze before in his pocket, how would you know yours from that? - It would be impossible.</p>
               <p>Were they such pieces as this that you lost? - They were, and I suppose them to have hung over the cupboard door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In the first place, I was in Fleet-market, going to buy some fruit, for my daily labour, and a man came up to me in Fleet-market, and asked me to carry a letter into Fleet-street, and he would give me sixpence; the door was open; I asked for one Mr. Williams, a taylor; I went and knocked at the door, three men came out; I went in; I saw nobody in the room; I turned to come out, and the prosecutor came and knocked me down; he fell upon me; he let me go; then he called out stop thief; Mr. Young and Mr. Jackson are in the yard; the two men that followed me; nothing was found upon me but the two keys; I knocked at the door going in.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is Young or Jackson here? - I do not know; Young never went to the Justice's with me, nor never came to Court with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He is a turner; he lives at No. 6, Stone-cutter-street; the prosecutor has been enquiring every day what reward he should get to hang me; and that gentleman told the people that if he did he would give it my wife for a present.</p>

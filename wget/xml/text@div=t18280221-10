            . I am the prosecutors' servant. On the 1st of February I had several parcels in a truck to deliver in the City, and near the end of Tower-street, Wing came up and asked if I had given any body a lift - I said I had not; he then asked if I had lost any thing, and on looking at the back of the truck I missed two parcels of stone blue, weighing 14 lbs. and 28 lbs: I left the truck in care of a gentleman, and followed Wing, and saw the prisoner in Fenchurch-street, walking with another young man, who had the parcels tied in a blue apron - that person escaped; the prisoner ran away directly he saw me come up - they both ran away - Wing pursued; I lost sight of the prisoner for about two minutes - he was stopped near the end of Seething-lane: I took the parcels out of the hand of the other man to see if they were mine, and he ran off; the prisoner was in that man's company - he said he had not taken them; the man also left his apron in my hand - it was not tied round him; the parcels were directed to the places I was to deliver them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came out in the evening to take a walk - I heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran, seeing other people running, and was stopped. I was taken to the watch-house half an hour before the charge was given; Wing and Johnson went out twice and consulted together, and at last gave the charge.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WING re-examined. I stated the case at the watch-house, but Johnson hesitated about giving the charge, as it might be troublesome to his master.</p>

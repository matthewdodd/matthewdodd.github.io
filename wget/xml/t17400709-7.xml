            . On the 18th of June, the Prisoner (a little in drink) brought me a Bundle in a Paper, sealed with three Seals: and says he, put this by for me till I call for it. I put it into my Cupboard, and did not look at it for a Week. But on the Thursday following I happened to be in a Wine-Cellar, where I heard that Colonel De Veil had lost 2 silver Forks. I said I believed they were in a Bundle I had from the Prisoner. I carried the Bundle to the Colonel's, and would not let it be opened till I came there. I asked him if he had lost any Forks on such a Day? Upon his saying yes, I told him I had a Bundle left with me by Sargery, which I shewed him. He opened it, and there were two Forks in it which proved to be his: he got another Fork of the same sort, and compared them together . The Bundle was never opened all the Time it was in my Custody; nor till it was carried before Colonel De Veil. This is the Paper they were wrapped up in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . I was vastly in Liquor, and have nothing to say, but to beg the Mercy of the Court.- I was vastly in Liquor when I did it , and did it for no Manner of Occasion.</p>
               <p>Mr De Veil. These are the Forks the Witness brought to me; they are mine, and have my Crest upon them. <rs id="t17400709-7-verdict43" type="verdictDescription">

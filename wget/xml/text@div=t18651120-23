                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 2, Passmore-street, Pimlico—on 5th November I was in John-street, Chelsea, at a quarter to eleven at night, and saw the prisoners—McCormack put one arm round my neck and the other over my mouth, while Green came in front of me and took my watch from my pocket; I held him till the police came—McCormack ran away, but I saw him afterwards in the crowd; I pointed him out to a policeman and he ran away again—he was brought to the station an hour afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Royal George public-house—on 5th November I closed my house at five minutes to eleven, and went upstairs to the first floor—all the parties had not gone—I heard some gentlemen going out and asked them to remain till some parties outside had passed—I heard a rumbling at the door, and heard somebody say, "You have got my watch"—I opened the door and saw McCormack run away—the man who lost his watch cried out, "Murder," and was struggling with another man who I do not know in the road.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am a professor of fencing and gymnastics—about ten minutes to eleven on Sunday night a person called my attention to a disturbance in George-street—I went there and saw Page holding Green by the collar—Page gave me a watch and said that he picked it up in the road while he had hold of Green—Green was given into my custody, but on the way to the station some one ran between him and me and separated us, and Green ran away—I ran after him, calling, "Stop thief!" Sergeant Parkins of the B division ran round the corner of Union-street, knocked me into the road and Green escaped—I had seen him outside the Crown that Sunday evening I next saw him on the Tuesday night.</p>

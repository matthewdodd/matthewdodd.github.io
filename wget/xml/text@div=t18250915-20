            . On the night of the 6th of July, I was with a person in Lincoln's-inn-fields - the two prisoners went past me, and stopped at the corner of the house No. 61 - one of them said "Not yet." Williams then went past the house, and seemed to look if any one was coming out; Lessin then went in and came out in about ten minutes with something in the left side of his coat - he ran down Duke-street, and Williams immediately followed him; I rang the bell and told the lady I suspected all was not right, and asked if she missed any thing. I afterwards went with the officer to seek for Williams, whom I had described. I had not taken particular notice of Lessin, but I believe he is the person.</p>

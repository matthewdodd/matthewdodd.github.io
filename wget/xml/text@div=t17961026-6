               <p>Russell. I know this tallow to be mine; it is a particular kind of tallow that comes from Siberia; and the heads I know to be mine, by the sale mark of the country, and my own mark.</p>

The clerk desired me to take this tallow home; I forgot it till night, and then I took it to carry it to Mr. Russell's, and these gentlemen stopped me; I told them I had got some tallow of Mr. Russell's, and was going to carry it there; one of them cut me open by a blow upon the nose with a stick; I never offered to sell it.(The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hay-salesman, at No. 64, West Smith<lb></lb>field. On Tuesday afternoon, 18th Feb., the two prisoners came to me—George Randall asked the price of a load of hay, I asked him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; be offered me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I refused to take it—they then consulted together, and went away—they came again in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; that was between two and three o'clock—they again offered 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I refused—after some time they asked me the lowest price, and I told them three guineas—they then said they were instructed by Mr. Hatt, a cow-keeper, at Westminster, to come and purchase a load of hay, and they wanted a good one, as Mr. Hatt was very ill, but he would look out of the win<lb></lb>dow—I said, "Of course Mr. Hatt will pay the money for it when delivered"—they said, "Yes"—they again asked me to take 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I refused—George Randall then said, "Well, let me have it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but as I want to get something, you must make out the bill for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I did, and the carter was to give George Randall 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the carter bad no authority to give up the hay without the money being paid—he was instructed to take it to Mr. Hatt, and not to deliver it without the money—as the hay was leaving, George Randall said be would go with the carter, and show him the way—I believed that the prisoners were in the employ of Mr. Hatt—I was out that evening, and came home about eight or half-past eight o'clock; I found the policeman and the carter at my house waiting for me—I went to the station, and found George Ran<lb></lb>dall in custody—he said he had sold seventeen trusses to Mr. Reed, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the money found on him was the money he received for that hay.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. Peter Rogers, a farmer, who lives at Fryern Barnet. On Tuesday, 18th Feb., I had charge of a cart of hay of his consisting of thirty-six trusses—I saw the two prisoners that day, and went with them to different parts of London—I had my directions to go to Mr. Hatt's, which I believe is in Westminster—I was not to leave the hay without the money—as we were going along, the prisoners told me to come and have some beer—that was in Newgate-street—they had a mind to begin very quickly—I bad some beer—they were laughing and joking, and saying I was a better countryman than some of them—we went on to Gardner's-lane, and sold half a load—nothing was said about Mr. Hatt—they wanted roe to stop back while they delivered the hay in Gardner's-lane, but I would not do that—how I came to let them have the half-load was because they said they were in the habit of going to serve their master's customers—George Randall said Mr. Hatt was very ill in bed, and very nearly blind—they were to give eighteen</p>

               <p>trusses at that slaughter-house in Gardner's-lane, but they only give seventeen—I did not see what they got for it—we afterwards went to ano<lb></lb>ther public-house and had a pot of beer, and they sold another truss to a chimney-sweeper—I believe William Randall sold that, while George Randall was drawing my attention to a piece of music—they then took me to another public-house, and gave me some more beer, and sold a truss to another butcher—(the first eighteen were sold to a butcher)—I wanted the money for my hay, and they said, "Come on, come on, we will have some more beer presently"—we went on till we came to Mr. Reed's, a corn-chandler, and he came and looked at it as well as he could—William Randall then said, "It won't do to sell it there, be won't give you more than 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more than you gave for it"—they went on, and then they came back and sold it there—the seventeen trusses were taken into a back shed—I saw Mrs. Reed pay George Randall 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and William Randall took the whip out of my hand, and whipped the horse and said, "Come on, let us have some more beer"—I laid, "No; you may go, I shall go and ask this policeman about that"—William Randall then ran off, and when George Randall came out, I gave him into custody—he was making the best of his way off, only he happened to get stopped—I did not see Wil<lb></lb>liam Randall again till I went to Guildhall.</p>

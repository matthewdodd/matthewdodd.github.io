This box was with this rag, and this woman's dirty cap, and a pair of scissars; there was a candlestick with a piece of candle lying on the floor, but not so that we could tell that it had been lighted lately; in the back kitchen, where Willis was taken from, were these two basons, in one of which there appears a settlement of cream of tartar. Both the prisoners fingers and thumbs were as if they had been using these kind of ingredients. Wray searched the place afterwards.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I went with Armstrong to this house; Armstrong went in first; and in the first room there was a woman stamped, and cried out, murder; then we went down into the kitchen; just as we got to the bottom of the stairs, Sydney passed us, I caught her, and delivered her to Harper, who then went and got a light, and went into the front kitchen; a large bason was the first thing I perceived, it had been kicked up, and there was a great deal of liquid upon the floor, I cannot say what that liquid was; there was a fire place, but no grate in it, there I found a great quantity of base money, some on the hearth, and some in the fire-place, (produces it); there are very near a hundred sixpences, and about thirty-five shillings, they were all over wet, some of them stuck against the back of the chimney, and the wet was dripping down; I picked off, I think, four. There was only one chair there, and this box turned down; there was no furniture there at all. After making a further search, I found some in the back kitchen, that was bad money too, wrapped up in a paper, five shillings and seven sixpences. There was a candlestick and a piece of candle lying upon the floor, which appeared to me to have been very recently put out, the snuff was not stiff; and I found this blacking-pot.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I was with the rest of the officers, on the 4th of July: I went into the parlour, there was a woman crying out, murder, and stamping on the floor, I secured her, and took her into the back room; then the two prisoners were brought to me without gowns or stays, and I secured them; their hands were very black, as if they had been at work at that sort of business. I afterwards went down and saw the liquid spread about, and I saw the things that Mr. Wray had found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. (To Armstrong). Q. Explain the use of these things? - A. That liquid is used to bring the silver to the surface; after that it is dipped in water, and wiped it with a rag, they rub it between their fingers, and wipe it with a rag, and then the blacking is the last thing that is used, to take off the appearance of newness, and make them fit for circulation.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Armstrong.) Did you see any strawberries in the house? - A. Yes, they were claimed by a woman who was discharged; we took five women to the magistrates; there was no basket in the house; they were claimed by the same woman that made the stamping.</p>

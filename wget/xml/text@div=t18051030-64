               <p>Q. Were you stationed on the morning of Tuesday, the 24th of September, in Lamb's Conduit-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At about two o'clock on that morning did you hear any thing in the area of No. 36? - A. I did; I went to the rails, and looked down the area, I saw the kitchen shutters wrenched.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were they outside shutters? - A. Yes, they were outside shutters that were wrenched, and upon hearing footsteps below, I called out, who is there below.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Was any answer given you? - A. No, there was no answer given me; upon that account I sprang the rattle instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. What took place upon your springing the rattle? - A. He endeavoured to get out of the area.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see one person, or more than one? - A. I saw two.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did those two persons come from? - A. I saw two persons in the area.</p>
               <p>Q. What did those two persons do? - A. They attempted to get over the rails; I struck at one of them with my stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that one that you attempted to strike get away from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they came out of the area, did either of them speak? - A. Yes, he said, shoot him.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me the words? - A. The words were, shoot him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both of the same size, or different sizes? - A. One was taller than the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether it was the tall one or the short one that said it? - A. I cannot tell; I made a strike at the first man that attempted to get out of the area, but the stick slipped out of my hand at first, and by that means he got round the corner into New Ormond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call to any other watchman? - A. Yes, I did, to stop him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see that man taken? - A. I saw him after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see any body in custody? - A. It may be four or five minutes, I found him in Morris's custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say that the man that was found in Morris's custody, was the same man that you struck at? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other man get out of the area? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This man that got out of the area first, you do not state whether you pursued him or no? - A. I pursued him, and lost sight of him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300066"></xptr>Q. Did you see him get into New Ormond-street? - A. I saw him turn the corner of New Ormond-street; I called to another watchman in New Ormond-street to stop him, and I looked to see if no person passed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it a tall man or a short man? - A. A short man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the colour of his clothes? - A. No; he got over, and I made a strike at him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pursue him? - A. I pursued him, and the watchman running after him; he turned round New Ormond-street out of Lamb's Conduit-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You still pursuing him? - A. Yes, I was following the watchman, and the watchman was following the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you outrun the watchman? - A. No; the prisoner stopped short at the right hand side of New Ormond-street, two or three doors down; he turned round to come into Lamb's Conduit-street again; the watchman there lost sight of him, I did not lose sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him stopped? - A. I saw a watchman coming running at a distance; I halloaed out to the watchman to stop that man, and I told him there had been a house broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. That was Morris? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You saw him stop him? - A. Yes; I immediately ran to his assistance, and I laid hold of him likewise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Had he never been out of your sight till then? - A. No, I never lost sight of him till he was laid hold of by the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who laid hold of him first? - A. Morris, the watchman, laid hold of him first; we brought him back to the door of the house which they had been attempting to break open; there I searched him, and found this knife, a bit of tobacco, and a bit of bread and cheese.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you are a watchman? - A. Yes, at the corner of Lamb's Conduit-street, Theobald's-road.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of which the witnesses have been speaking of, did you hear the springing of the rattle? - A. I heard the rattle when I was on my beat, at half after two o'clock in the morning; I listened to the rattle to hear which way it was, and then I ran immediately to my brother watchman's assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any person pointed out to you in New Ormond-street by the last witness, Lovett? - A. As I was running down New Ormond-street from Lamb's Conduit-street, I saw a man running, and a man said, watchman, stop that man, he is a thief; by that means I collared him; Richardson is the man, who is now one of the prisoners at the bar. When I had collared him, Lovett called and asked if I wanted any assistance; I told him if he thought proper; he came over and assisted me immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, after you had taken him, find any thing near the spot where you took him? - A. When I took him, Lovett said there was a house attempted to be robbed, No. 36, Lamb's Conduit-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you got there, did you find any thing? - A. Yes, a little green baize bag, within about three yards of the spot where I took Richardson; it was an empty bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find that iron crow? - (the witness holding an iron crow in his hand.) - A. About eight doors from No. 36, towards the Foundling-hospital, it laid in a puddle of water.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks on the crow? - A. I did not look at it till I was at the Justice's, and then there was some blood upon it, and the marks of blood is on it now; when I picked it up, I lodged it in our watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then you did not observe the marks of blood on it when you had it at the watch-house? - A. I did not observe it till I got to the Justice's.</p>

               <p>Q. What answer did he give you? - A. He said he was going to take a walk in the morning before the family were up, and as he jumped off the rails I laid hold of his coat, and he gave me a knock on the left side of my head.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you then see the person by whom you were cut? - A. He was never out of my sight till he was taken, he ran down towards the Foundling-hospital, he crossed over the street, and then he crossed back again, and leaned against a post.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who crossed over? - A. The man that cut me.</p>

               <p>Q. How far distance from you was the man when you got up? - A. About the length of eight houses.</p>

               <p>Court. From the best consideration that I can give of this case, however heinious the offence is, the prisoners cannot be convicted upon this indictment as it is at present framed. We must all feel that persons of this description should be brought to justice, still the law must not be strained to affect that purpose. This indictment states the prisoners<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300068"></xptr>as being ill disposed persons, and reputed thieves in the King's highway, in a certain street called Lamb's Conduit-street, with intent to commit a felony, and liable to be apprehended and detained by any watchman in the due execution of his duty, namely, to apprehend and convey them before some one or other of His Majesty's Justices of Peace.

             being there described a watchman in the due execution of his duty, they feloniously did assault, and with a sharp instrument did strike, cut, and stab him with an instrument, namely, an iron crow, thereby giving him a wound in and upon the left side of his head, with intent in so doing to obstruct or resist the lawful apprehension and detainer of them; the indictment is founded upon a very wholesome act passed two years ago, it has made it felony without benefit of Clergy, unlawfully to stab or cut any of His Majesty's subjects; among other things it mentions with intention to obstruct, or resist the lawful apprehension of the person that struck, or his accomplices. Upon this branch of the act, the present indictment is found, it charges the offence in different counts, only varying the manner of charging the prisoners; there was an act passed the 23d of

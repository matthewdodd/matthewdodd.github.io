            . I was in the employ of the late Mr. William Mellish - he had no partner - he died on the 27th of January - the property when taken was Mr. Mellish's - Mr. Mellish was the only <rs id="t18340220-129-viclabel753" type="occupation">importer of whalebone</rs>

               <p>Q. Is the whalebone now produced the same sort and quality which Mr. Mellish had on his premises? A. Decidedly so - I have known the trade twenty-seven years, and never saw bone in that state out of the possession of the importer - it is brought to bear a good polish in our hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Some was once sent out in the rough state? A. After the importation of 1832, some was delivered in a rough state, but not in this state.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where is Mr. Illman's shed? A. About two hundred yards from where Lacabenne and Barkworth live - there is a plank go to over a ditch - carts cannot pass over the ditch - it was there I saw Heffer with the cart - I knew him before, having seen him in his cart - I knew him to be a carman - he said he was out at the time the order was given for the cart to take the goods - I had no my uniform on, but I had my staff in my hand before I stopped the cart.</p>

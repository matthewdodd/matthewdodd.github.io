               <p>Q. Was there any quarrel between the prisoner Field and Warwick. - A. Not at first. On Sunday evening the prisoner and I were at the Clown public house; we were sitting there some time, and the deceased and an old man got to words; the deceased had chucked some ale over the old man, that was sitting there. The prisoner, on seeing the old man ill used, got up, and wished the old man to sit down, and the deceased to sit down, and not to have any words: the prisoner then came to me and sat down again. After that the deceased and the old man got to words again. The prisoner said to the old man, you had better go out of the company. The old man went in a very few minutes afterwards: after that the prisoner and I went away. In about an hour we returned with a young man. We took seats nearly opposite to the deceased. The deceased got in conversation with him concerning interrupting him with the old man. The prisoner told the deceased to keep his own company. The deceased said, why not you keep your own company this afternoon? The prisoner replied, I did not like to see an old man used ill. The deceased said, I'll serve you the same, and I will split your nose. The deceased arose to strike the prisoner, I got between them to prevent them from fighting. The deceased said he would fight him for five or ten pound, or one pound: the prisoner said he did not wish to fight, he had no money. The deceased then ill used the prisoner and his company; he said we were beggars; he insisted upon fighting him for one pound. I put the money down, and they went out to fight. They continued to fight for an hour, or an hour and a quarter, then the second said he would not fight any more. I went with the prisoner.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160043"></xptr>Q.What became of the deceased. - A. I do not know; I did not see him when I took the prisoner away.</p>
               <p>JEFFERY MORGAN. Q. Were you in this company at the Clown. - A. I was; I saw all that passed, as the witness has related, except the beginning of using the old man ill. I heard the prisoner at the bar say it was cruel of him using the old man ill. The deceased said, I will serve you ten times worse, I will split your nose. The prisoner said, I do not think you can do that. With that the deceased got up, and tried to strike the prisoner; the people stopped them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them afterwards fight. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased when his friends said he would not fight any more. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any more blows struck after that. - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEVER. I was standing at the Clown public-house door with a friend. He said there was a fight in the field: I went into the field and they were just done. I saw the prisoner there. The deceased was standing on the ground, held up by two or three men of his acquaintance; he seemed to be quite senseless. I am an officer: the prisoner surrendered himself to me the next morning after I heard he was dead.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CROFT. Q. Was you at the Clown public-house. - A. I was there when they fought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the deceased give in. - A. I heard the words said, that he could fight no more. I went immediately and fetched a doctor. The doctor ordered him to the hospital. I went with the deceased to the hospital, and stopped with him till the doctor ordered me away. I saw him no more. The next morning I went there, I heard he was dead.</p>

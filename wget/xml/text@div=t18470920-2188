                  </hi> I live with Thomas Humphries, ironmonger, of George-court, Marylebone. On the night of the 15th of Sept., from information, I looked out, and saw the prisoner about three yards from the shop—I went up to her, and said, "What have you got belonging to my master?"—she said, "Nothing"—I said, "you have"—she said, "I have not"—I lifted up the left side of her shawl, and found this iron boiler (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I took it from her, and brought her back to the shop—it is my master's property, it has "4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." in his own writing, inside the cover—it is quite new, and was not sold or mislaid—I did not see her take it—when I got up to her she was about six yards off, just turning into Oxford-street—I and the people in the shop were busy at the time</p>

On the 8th of October the prisoner at the bar came to my house, and said he was a stable keeper in Gray's Inn-lane; he looked at some horse sheets to cover horses, woollen rugs, and said he should want twenty-four of them, he agreed for them, he took one with him, for which he paid 6 s. and desired a bill of parcels might be made of the twenty-four, substracting that six shillings from the bottom of the bill, and desired me the next morning, to send them up to his livery stables, and he would pay the remaining six pounds eighteen shillings to my servant.</p>

             came to my master's house, on the 8th of October, in the afternoon, to Mr. Richardson's; I sold him the rug at six shillings, he paid Mr. Richardson, and wanted twenty-three more, to be sent up the next morning; Mr. Richardson sent them the next day with me, and two lads; when we came up there his man was waiting, he said, you want Mr. Pepper; I said, yes, I have brought these rugs, and they are to be paid for on delivery; his master was not in the way, and I went with the servant to the prisoner, at the sign of the cheese; he was sitting in the tap room by the fire side; I told him that there was the bill according to his agreement, with six shillings deducted at the bottom; he said, very right, come round with me here, and I will get you the cash; he takes me round to Mount Pleasant, the back of the Sessions House, to Sharp's-alley, No. 7, where he told me going along, that the man owed him some money; when we came, the man told him he could not pay him then, that he would pay him in the evening; so he told me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300127"></xptr>you can come up again in the evening, or the next morning; I told him I could not, my master's orders were to bring back the goods or the money; he said he had not the money, if I would come up the next day he would pay me; he said there was a bill, it has five days to run, for seven pounds seven shillings; I told him I knew nothing about the bill; I immediately suspected, to myself, that they wanted to rob me of the goods; I got him to come out of the house to go back with me to get me the goods again, coming out of Cow-cross, I told him I must either have the goods or the money; I left the goods on the fresh promise of payment, on his saying that he would go with me to get the money, that made me leave the goods; he told me he had business to do; I got him at last at the house in Cow Cross-street, with that he began to go over the way towards the Sessions House.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever consent to leave the goods? - No, I never consented to leave the goods.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Where did you leave the goods first of all? - In his stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the stable? - His man. I had orders from my master either to bring back the goods or the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever return back to the stable? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you demand the goods of his servant? - I did; I asked his servant for them. The prisoner would not return them, he told me I might get my money how I could, he was disappointed in getting his money, and I must be disappointed too.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you go afterwards the next day? - I did not. That day I went back to the stable, and told the man I must have the goods, for his master would not have them, and I sent to my master by one of the lads.</p>
               <p>Q. What justice did you take him to? - To Mr. Graham at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did he give for not paying? - That he could not get the money of the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you demand the money of the prisoner? - I did, and the goods, he said, I had delivered the goods and I might get the money how I could.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I offered him a bill that had but five days to run. - I would not take the bill.</p>
               <p>Court to Young. What was the prisoner? had he a stable? - He had no stable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Did not he come and surrender as soon as the warrant was out against him? - He did not, he committed the fraud on the 9th, and I did not see him at the office till the 17th.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I apprehended the prisoner in behalf of this swindling business, at Islington.</p>

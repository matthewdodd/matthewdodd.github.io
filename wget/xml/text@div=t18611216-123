                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Church-place, with my mother—one day last month, I was in Playhouse-court, in Bouverie-street—the prisoner came up to me and asked me to go and get him a quartern of gin—he told me to go to the public-house at the bottom of the street—that is the Welsh Harp—he gave me a half-crown and a bottle—I went and asked for a quartern of gin—I gave the half-crown, and received some money wrapped in paper, and the bottle—I then came out and stood on the step of the door where I had been before; not the door of the Welsh Harp—in a few minutes the prisoner came up to me and asked me where the gin was—I gave him the bottle—he asked me where the change was, and I gave it to him—he undid the paper, and said, "You have not brought the right change"—he asked me to go back—I did not like to; and he said he would give me a penny—Mr. Eyre then came up and took him.</p>

I keep the Welsh Harp public-house, in Essex-street, Whitefriars—the last witness came to my house on the evening of 12th November last—she brought a bottle and asked for a quartern of gin, and tendered a half-crown—I saw it was bad—instead of giving her a quartern of gin I put a quartern of water in the bottle; and wrapped a halfpenny in paper and gave her—the right change would have been 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told her to take the gin and the change—she then went out—I spoke to a person named Eyre, who was in my parlour at the time, and he went out after the girl.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer.</hi>) About 7 o'clock, on the night of 28th November, I saw the prisoners together in Sutherland Gardens, near No. 28, and they went on towards No. 31—next morning, from information I received, I went to No. 19, and I there found that a burglary had been committed, an entrance having been effected at the back window in the kitchen—I saw some footmarks in the garden of No. 19, and I covered them over with boards—I also found footmarks in that garden—I also found a Britannia metal coffee and sugar basin—the prisoners were apprehended—the boots were taken from off their feet—I compared them with the tracks, or footmarks in the gardens, and they corre<lb></lb>sponded exactly with the length and breadth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Edwards.</hi> I bought the boots I had on my feet on the Friday before I was taken, and the robbery had been committed then about three weeks as near as I can guess. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I made the examination on 12th Decem<lb></lb>ber—they said they bought the boots at a shop in Ferdinand Rood, Chalk Farm—I went there, and there is no such shop at all.</p>

             I am a Bow-street officer. On the 18th of January, I saw the prisoner in company with five others, in <placeName id="t18130217-82-crimeloc487">Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields</placeName>

I followed them until they got to a picture-shop in Queen-street. The prisoner then drew a yellow silk handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, and they all ran off. I followed the prisoner and lost him. On the Friday following, I saw the prisoner again with the gang about eight in number. I then followed him and took him. I searched him, and found these two handkerchiefs on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the handkerchief that you saw him take out of the gentleman's pocket - A. I lost him on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You do no know that he stole them two handkerchiefs, did you - A. No.</p>

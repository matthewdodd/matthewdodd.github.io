On the 29th of November Fudger lodged there - Wyer's wife is Fudger's sister - I saw Fudger and his sister one Thursday, the latter end of November, they went out together; and I saw Mrs. Wyer come back - the prisoner Wyer had at that time a bad leg, which had confined<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030076"></xptr>him to the house; but, after his wife returned I saw him go out with two or three bags or parcels in cloths.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Great Ormond-street. On the morning of the 29th of November, the prisoner Wyer came to me between nine and eleven o'clock - he brought with him a bag in one hand, which was full of something, and a can, which was three parts full - he stood at my door, and I came out of my parlour, and said to him, "Mr. Wyer, what do you do carrying things when you are on your club?" - he said,"That is the very thing that I called here for; let me leave these things, and I will call in the course of the day;" he left them, but did not call again - on that day week, a person called and said he was an attorney; and after he was gone, I opened the bag in the parlour, before my wife and her sister; the bag coutained ginger, nutmegs, soap, and a variety of articles, and the can was three parts full of oil - Mr. Gray's name and address was on the bag, stamped with a small stamp; the prisoner Wyer called the same evening, about a quarter-past nine o'clock - he said he had called for the things; I said,</p>
               <p>"I cannot give them up; I am going to take them to the owner" - he made answer, "You can take the can, but not the bag" - I said,"I shall take them all, just as I received them;" he left me, - I got a cab, and went to Mr. Gray's with them, accompained by a neighbour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you what was in the bag? A. No; I have no reason to think he knew; Mr. Gray's name was on a part of the bag, which was tied up, and was not seen till it was untied - I do not consider that he knew Mr. Gray's name was on it; he did not, when he said, "Do not take the bag," add to it, "As it may get Fudger into a scrape" - he said no more than I have told you; I have known Wyer two years - he is a hard-working and honest man; he is a farrier; I thought the bag contained horse-medicines, as they made such a smell.</p>

            . These things were brought to my shop by the witness. I sell some of these articles, but not the sugar, soap, nor oil - I know the bag is mine, and the lavender-water has my stamp on it; it has not been opened - two of these bottles are wrapped up in one of the shop-dusters, which I know, by its being burnt with our acids; the paper round this liquorice has my writing on it - and so has this paper round the ginger, and these cloves; this camphor soap is in an unfinished state - it is in a handkerchief like one I have seen Fudger use; and we have missed some soap - we do not keep pepper in bottles like this, but in large jars; I found a tin scoop bent up like a funnel, as if to put pepper into this bottle - I have one partner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you missed any pepper? A. No; there may be thousands of bottles in the world like this - these papers have the names of plants on them; I once had a large collection of them; the plants are destroyed, but the paper being in good order, I put it up in quires, and this is some of it.</p>

I went with Goddard to Wyer's lodging - he said he expected us, and that he had taken the things by the advice of a professional adviser, or fetched them away by it; he afterwards said it was Fudger who had got his wife and himself into trouble, and he felt happier than before he was taken.</p>

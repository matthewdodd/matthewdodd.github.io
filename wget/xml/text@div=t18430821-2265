I am in the service of Mr. Edward Bolton, draper, of Lisson Grove—on Monday morning, the 17th of July, about eight o'clock, the prisoners came into the shop together—Young asked to look at a piece of wrapping—I showed him some calico—he had about a yard, worth 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a sovereign in payment—I gave him what change I had in the shop—I had not the full change, and I went up stairs and got it—as I returned, Elizabeth Robins met me at the foot of the stairs, and said something, in consequence of which I looked round the shop—I did not miss anything then—Williams was then at the door, and Young waiting for the change—I gave it him and he went away—I looked round the shop again, and missed 34 yards of black satinet, worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., my master, Edward Bolton's property—I had seen it about a quarter of an hour before the prisoners came in, and missed it a minute after they were gone—nobody else had been in.</p>

On the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 17th of July, the shopman came into the house for change—I was in the parlour adjoining the shop—I saw Williams and another man, whom I did not notice, in the shop—after the shopman had gone out Williams walked down the shop near the parlour door, turned round by the end of the counter, and took a parcel covered with white paper from the shelf—I could not perceive what it was—he put it under a coat or cloak that was hanging on his arm, went to the middle of the shop, and walked towards the door—the shopman came down—I met him on the stairs, and told him what I had seen.</p>

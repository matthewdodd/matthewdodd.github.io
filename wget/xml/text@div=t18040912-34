               <p>Q. At that time was he a stranger to you? - A. Entirely; I asked him the particulars concerning it; he said he found it on Ludgate-hill, near the Bell Savage Inn, on Holy Thursday; he had been to see the children come from St. Paul's; this was on the 15th, when he came to my shop; I told him it was a thing of some consequence, and some value, and recommended him to have it advertised; he told me he had looked over the different papers since the time of finding the diamond, for the purpose of seeing if it had been advertised, but he said he had no objection to leaving it with me, if I thought proper, or if I chose to make enquiries, or advertise it myself, he had no objection; he went away, I advertised it, and I saw him again on the Tuesday or Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring you any thing but the diamond? - A. The diamond was set, but it was not a complete piece of work; it was not a ring, or a broach, nor any thing else; it was only a diamond in this enamelled border.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the enamel perfect when he brought it to you? - A. I believe it was, I am not quite certain; he asked me what success I had had, on the Tuesday or Wednesday, when he called again; I told him not any yet; his father called afterwards whom I have seen since.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be his father? - A. He said to me, I understand my son has left a diamond with you; the prisoner called on Monday on me, and said the Saturday following he should come and take it away or dispose of it; on the Saturday following he came, and his father with him; it was the same person that called before; I told them as before, I had heard nothing of it; I had made several enquiries; I had been to those in the trade; I had been to Green and Ward's, and to a variety of other jewellers; they told me they had come to take the diamond away; I gave it to them; they asked me what it was worth; I told them I supposed it was worth about twenty guineas; they asked me if I would give twenty guineas for it; I told them I would; they said they would sell it me, and they would take it no farther; I gave them twenty guineas; I gave them 20 l. in notes, a gold ring, which was 14 s. and the charge for the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what was the value of it? - A. I conceived that to be the trade price of it; it weighed 12 grains 3 penny weights and an 8th of a grain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he had found any thing else at that time? - A. He did not. Mrs. Esten called some time afterwards and she saw the diamond; I had taken it out of the setting; I shewed her the diamond, and she said it resembled her's very much; it was out of the setting then; as soon as I found it I waited upon her, which was in about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long did this diamond remain in your possession from the time the prisoner brought it, and the time Mrs. Esten called upon you? - A.Somewhat about a month.</p>
               <p>Q. You recommended him to advertise it; he had no objection to your advertising it, and you did advertise it; and he left it with you eight or nine days, till you purchased it of him? - A. I purchased it of him about eight days after he left it.</p>
               <p>Q.He left his direction with you; it was a true address? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You advertised it, and had the means of resorting to him, if you had found an owner; and the prisoner paid for the advertisement, not you? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. He said his father was a tailor and lived in Portpool-lane, No. 44? - A. The young man in the shop took down his address.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at Mr. Simpson's, 4, Atalanta Terrace, Brixton—the prisoner was general servant there—on 9th April, about 8 o'clock in the evening, I went down to the sink in the front kitchen, and there found this small table knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) covered with blood—I also saw blood on the floor—I went up stairs, and spoke to Mr. Simpson, and then went for a doctor and a constable—I afterwards went with them into the back kitchen, and in the copper-hole found the body of a female child—I had lived in the house four years—the prisoner had been there about eighteen months—I did not know that she was with child.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My going down on this evening was quite accidental—the copper was not in use at the time—the body, when taken out, was covered with coal-dust—there was a shopman of the Simpson's living on the premises—the prisoner was the only female servant—she has a sister in service at Mile End Old Town; I believe she is her only relative in London.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Brixton—on 9th April, about 8.45 in the evening, I was called to Mr. Simpson's house—I went there with constable Tee—I found the prisoner sitting by the side of her bed, dressed—I told her to get into bed—I then went down to the back kitchen, with the other witnesses—I found this knife, and saw spots of blood on the floor—I found the body of a female child in the copper-hole—it was perfectly black—there was no fire in the copper-hole—I did not notice that it was heated—I examined the child very cursorily, and gave it to Tee—I afterwards examined it at the station—I, should say it had not long been delivered—I found a jagged incised wound at the back of its neck, extending three parts of the surface of the neck; not externally, but internally—I consider it could have been done with this knife—it was dug in, and out; forced—the spinal cord was divided between the second and third bones of the neck, and the muscles of the back of the neck all divided—that was the cause of death—there was scarcely any blood in the body; about a teaspoonful—that was from the sudden drain on the body, caused by the wound—from my examination I considered the child had been born alive—the wound could have been given after its death—I considered it to have been born alive, from its healthy appearance, and the condition of the head upon opening it—the organs were perfectly healthy; the lungs floated when I placed them in water; that is a test—they were inflated as they might be if the child had breathed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am acquainted with Dr. Taylor's work; I am not acquainted with Balfour's—in a great number of cases the umbilical cord is coiled round the neck—it may be so in the majority of cases—it varies in length from 54 inches to 7 1/2; I have seen it coiled round the neck three times—in this case the cord had been torn away, about 2 inches from the body, and not tied—the effusion of blood would be likely to be greater the closer to the body the cord is torn—I found fractures on the top of the head—I examined the bones of the head, ossification was not more defective than is usual—I should think it would require a lengthened and strong labour to fracture the bones of the head; it may occur—I don't think it would be more likely in a first and concealed confine<lb></lb>ment—delivery sometimes occurs in a standing posture—I did not examine the prisoner's clothes—the fractures spoken of are occasioned before the child comes into the world—they prove fatal at once, or after the</p>

               <p>child has respired a few times—both the lungs floated; they only half filled the chest; they did not indicate imperfect respiration—there was no blood in the lungs—I could not say that there was any positive proof that the child was born alive—I could not say it had really a separate existence; that it was wholly born alive—it had breathed—the wound I saw would cause death—I can't positively say that it was alive when that injury was given—I can scarcely understand how it could be done before it was completely born—I cannot give an opinion—I don't think such a severe wound could have been done before the child was separated from the mother; I should think it almost impossible—it might have been done after the child was actually dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Castle public-house, Bullen-street, Strand. The prisoners frequented my house, and were there on the 23rd of September—they left about twelve o'clock—I was called by the officer about three in the morning of the 24th—what he stated induced me to go to my cellar—I saw there had been seventeen bottles of wine taken—I had seen them safe about four on the 23rd—they must have got in by drawing the staple out of the door-post—the door is at the bottom of the stairs—it communicates with an inner door—the policeman produced two bottles of wine to me—I am sure the bottles are the same as I had—I can tell it by the cork—here is the mark of "sherry" upon this one—it is so marked that I am able to say it was one I had.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 122.) On Monday afternoon, the 4th of Jan., I saw the three prisoners together, from half-past six to a quarter to seven o'clock—I first saw Mumford in Ayre-street, and then he joined the other two in Powis-street—I watched them—I saw the three walk toge<lb></lb>ther about fifty yards, to opposite Mr. Dixon's house—they stopped in close conversation, from five to ten minutes—Rend and Tapner went up Powis-street, and Mumford came down to nearly opposite Mr. Dixon's—I followed Reed and Tapner up the street, and they came down again the same side as Mr. Dixon lives—I saw them go to the door, and I secreted myself on the opposite side—Reed took something out of his pocket, and put it to the key<lb></lb>hole of Mr. Dixon's door—Tapner was standing by his side—Mumford was on the opposite side, walking backwards and forwards—he came to where I was—he gave a loud cough, and they both came away from the door—Mum<lb></lb>ford then went up Powis-street—I saw the other two about to leave the door—I ran across the road, and caught hold of them both—I said, "What do you do here?"—they said they had got a friend there, William Goodwyn—I gave one into the custody of a <hi rend="italic">civilian</hi>, a person passing by, and he took him to the station—I took hold of Reed's hand, which I saw him apply to the door, held his hand in his pocket, and took him to the station—at the station I took his hand, and two skeleton-keys out of his pocket—here are the two keys—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—as we were going to the station, Reed threw some<lb></lb>thing away, and I told a boy to pick it up—it was brought to the station—I left the prisoner in the custody of the inspector, and went round the town in the direction Mumford took—he was making his way to London—I know him by his features and person—I had an opportunity of seeing him—he stopped under the gas-light.</p>

I did not let Reed's hand go until I got to the station—it was his right hand—I was about twenty or thirty yards from Dixon's house, when something occurred—the lamp was the same side the way that I was—there were lamps on Mr. Dixon's side, a little lower down, and higher up, but not directly upon that spot—I was in plain clothes—that was my duty—the recess I was in is nearly opposite Mr. Dixon's house—it may be an angle of ten yards—I did not notice a brass plate on Mr. Dixon's door—I think there is no number—I took up the third prisoner about a quarter of a mile off—what I heard fall as Reed was going to the station, sounded like a key—I saw it on the spot.</p>

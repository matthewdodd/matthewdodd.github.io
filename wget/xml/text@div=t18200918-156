A person called Stop thief! I looked to my left, and about six yards off a person was taken - I saw that person put his hand behind him and missed the watch - it was picked up and given to me. They took the person into my house, and Taylor took him away. I do not know who he was.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at this place with nine other officers. I saw a gang of thirty or forty coming at the head of the glass-blowers. We followed them from Battle-bridge, and saw them surround Mr. Marks - I saw the prisoners among them, but did not see them do anything then; I am certain they were in the gang. I saw Mr. Marks's watch on the ground, and a number of people scuffling for it; I picked it up, and gave it to the prosecutor. I took the watch out of his hand, or they would have taken it from him again. I took Dunton into Mr. Marks's fore-court; we shut him in, as there was a cry of Rescue! We afterwards took fourteen more of the gang - Winkworth and Chapman were among them.</p>

            . I am a broker, and was with the officers. I saw a number of lads and men coming along. I verily believe I saw Dunton take the watch from Mr. Marks, but will not be certain - he held it out for some one to take; I rushed in, and took him with it in his hand. Winkworth and Chapman, I am certain, called the rest of the gang; they came up, I was knocked down, and lost both the prisoner and watch. Dunton was taken into the prosecutor's house. Several gentlemen complained of having been robbed.</p>

            . I am a vellum-binder, and live in Field-lane. I saw Mr. Marks attacked by the gang. Colton seized one, he was knocked down - I think Dunton was the man, but am not certain. I held him myself four or five minutes, and heard Winkworth calling the gang up to rescue him.</p>

             sworn. - I went to Brown as soon as the robbery was discovered at four o'clock; the back-door was left open, and the window hung upon a hook; the boxes were broke all to pieces; we looked among the hedges, and perceived a hair-broom stuck in a gap of the hedge; we looked further, and, nearly through the hedge, we found a large bundle of linen, gowns, shifts, and handker<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180206020018"></xptr>chiefs; James Lawrence and I watched from between nine and ten at night, till three in the morning, when I saw the prisoner at the bar come up to the gap, where he had put the broom for a token; then he threw the remainder of a sack off his shoulders, pulled out the hair-broom, and threw it across; and, after looking about him, he came to look for the bundle, and run his head into the hole in the hedge; I was not above three yards from him, and immediately I took him, and brought him to Brown's house, and sent for a constable; it was about three o'clock, and was day-light, so that I could see very well; Brown has had the things ever since, by order of the Justice, as he had lost all his clothes.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say that those things are your's, and your wife's? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you then see the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; he came to the place where the broom was, and laid the sack down; he came over the hedge, and pulled the broom out, and then he went to the place where the bundle was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I got up in the morning to go to work, and I happened to go over this gap where the things were hid, but I did not know any thing about the robbery; I thought it was a wire put down for a hare; and then these men came up to me and used me very ill.</p>

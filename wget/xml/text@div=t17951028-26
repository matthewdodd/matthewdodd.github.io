               <p>Q. Were you stationed at Mr. Masheer's on the 30th of September last? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A locker belonging to the excise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes. He was employed as a <rs id="t17951028-26-deflabel149" type="occupation">cooper</rs>

               <p>Q. Was there any coffee deposited in that part of the warehouse? - A great deal of raw coffee.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether any body was at work with him? - Another man. let him out of the warehouse. We are obliged to lock them in.</p>
               <p>Q. It is the course of business. - It is. I searched them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you search first? - His fellow workman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on him? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards you searched the prisoner? - Yes. I found this coffee on his hair, under his hat. A pound and three quarters. We generally just touch the hat. I see the coffee trickle down; I did not take his hat off; he took the hat off, and threw it down on the floor, which had been just swept that morning; I told him that I thought he had no idea of taking the coffee; he said he had only a little for his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the coffee? - About one shilling and nine pence, or two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that coffee of the same kind as was lodged in the same room as he was in? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There is great quantity of raw coffee in these warehouse? - Yes. They were all in casks, but some was loose on the floor at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280043"></xptr>Q. You never see the prisoner searched him at going out? - I see him in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not search him till his time of going out? - No</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether he took it from the floor or casks you don't know at all? - I do not. There was a great deal of raw coffee on the floor, that the had left, as much as would fill a couple of hogsheads.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a cooper? - He had cooper's tools with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have never heard of such a thing as perquisites of the little tare that might drop from the casks? - There were no perquisites of coffee; they have beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never know persons that had coffee, and considered it as perquisites; have you never heard that before? - I don't know that I have. I cannot recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. You produce this coffee; it has been in your custody ever since; never been out of your custody since you took it from him? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not taken to be weighed by any body? - The custom-house officer took it from me to weigh it. I cannot swear to the coffee.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This coffee is necessarily thrown on the ground to be dried and tared? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. The coffee on the floor is not waste coffee? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that coffee that you found on the man clean raw coffee? - It is good coffee.</p>
               <p>- RAPER sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you are a person in the employment of the customs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in these warehouse of Mr. Masheter on the 30th of September? - Yes. We have two floors in the warehouse with coffee in; one a higher than the other. I was in the lower story. I went up on Mr. Willbore's calling to me. When I went up I see some coffee on the floor, which Mr. Willbore told me that he had detected the prisoner with in his hat, and he had thrown it on the floor. I took it up and weighed it, and returned it to Mr. Willbore.</p>
               <p>Q. That was raw coffee of the same kind as in that warehouse? - Yes.</p>

On the 16th of July, between eight and nine o'clock at night, the prisoner and several others were in my tap-room - several bricklayers and labourers were there - one of them made a complaint - the prisoner at that time had his head down on his hat, apparently asleep; I roused him, and told him a man had lost his handkerchief, and they had seen him take it; I insisted on having it - he said, he had not got it; one of the labourers said, he thought he had given it to another man - I insisted on his leaving - he got further on to the box - I went to turn him out by force, and he struck me. I struck him again - my wife and servants came and moved the table from the box, and I lifted him out of the box - he stood up in the middle of the room; I changed my hand, and caught him by the left hand collar with my right hand, to lead him to the door - he instantly threw himself down on his back, and began hitting me; I stood over him, holding his collar; I did not know that he had a knife, but he stabbed me three times in my arm - people called out, "He is killing you, he is stabbing you;" I then saw the blood running from my arm; I let go of him, and went to the doctor's - he was not sober, but knew what he was about.</p>

               The Court ruled, that as, if death had ensued, this offence would not have been murder, it did not come within the meaning of the Statute. NOT GUILTY

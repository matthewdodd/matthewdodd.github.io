I was on duty in Devon<lb></lb>shire-street, Portland-place, on Sunday night, the lllh of Jan., at a quarter before six o'clock—I met the prisoner with this clock—I asked where he took it from—he said it was given him by a man in Portland-place—I said, "Who was the man?"—he said he did not know—I asked where he was going to take it—he would not tell me—I took him to the station, and on the way he said he took it from No. 52, Charlotte-street—I went there, and there was nothing missing—I went to No. 51, and found the clock was claimed there—I found this chisel, and these keys on the prisoner.</p>

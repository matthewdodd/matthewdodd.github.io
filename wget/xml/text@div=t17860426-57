               <p>The prisoner was a lodger of mine six months and a half; on the 1st of April, some clothes were hung to dry in the one pair of stairs; my wife set the door and window open; the prisoner lodged in the two pair of stairs; she went down in the low parlour at two, and staid till seven; and whenever she went up stairs, we heard her in the room above; we imagined she was going to shut the windows; she staid about a quarter of an hour there; we asked, her whether she had been in the room above, and she said, no; then she lighted her candle, and went up stairs; then she came down again, and went out; my wife went up stairs, and I went up; and the clothes were gone; the box was quite open, and nothing in it but one pair of ruffles; in about three quarters of an hour the prisoner returned; I told her she had taken the things; she denied it; on the Thursday following I took her up; her room was never searched; the things were afterwards found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. This poor girl had been six months a lodger of your's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How had she behaved? - Exceedingly well.</p>
               <p>You had a good character with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe you had reason enough to know that she was much distressed? - I did not know it, but it might be so.</p>
               <p>ISABELLA MACKY sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have had many conversations with this young woman about your things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At last, I believe, you told her, if she would give you the things, or tell you where they were, that you would say no more about it? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that before you got the warrant for her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After you got the warrant for her, and took her up, did you, after the constable came, make her any promise? - No; I told the constable if she would let me have the things, I would not hurt her. I did not tell her so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260123"></xptr>- ASHTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I took the prisoner; I found the things in the prisoner's room; she gave them me.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Macky. As you authorised the constable to tell this young woman so, how came you to prosecute her afterwards? - The constable told me he was bound over, or I should have let her go.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner left your room in the afternoon when these things were lost, did you hear where she went to? - I am sure I can swear it, I heard her in my room three minutes, unlocking my box; and I went up stairs, and came down again.</p>
               <p>Did you say you heard her unlocking your box? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go up stairs then? - I did not think she was a thief.</p>
               <p>Then, what business had she to unlock your box? - I swear I heard her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

            You felt somebody take the watch from your pocket? - Yes, I took hold of his arm and told him, you have got my watch, give it me back again; he was going to run away, but he could not, and so he was apprehended. The constable he has got the watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. What is your name? - Hyam Solomon.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your name at the time that you lived with Mr. Northern? - Hyam Solomon. I have always gone by that name, never went by any other.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did you pass by when you was abroad? - The same, except as one of the tribe of Levi, and no other name at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner the watch on him when he was apprehended? - No, it was found in the street, near the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you felt it go out of your pocket? - No, I did not feel it go out of my pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, living at Richmond. On the morning of the 28th of October, a little after six o'clock, I received information from my servant, of the house being robbed—I got up immediately—I had been up last at night—I saw all the doors fastened when I went to bed—I found a quid of tobacco at the bottom of the stairs, a match, and a small bit of wax taper—the tobacco had been chewed—I went into the back parlour, and found the cupboard had been broken open—by boring holes round the lock with a centre-bit—I could see the holes—the book-case was broken open, and all the papers thrown about—I missed some cigars from the cupboard, and a tea-caddy from the front parlour, a patent cork-screw, and a writing-desk—I had seen them in the course of the day—there was about 1lb. of tea in the tea-caddy—I had been to the desk the day before—I went down stairs, and a very strong door, which goes into the passage from the larder, was wrenched open—a person getting into the larder must break that door open, before they can get into the rest of the house—it must have been broken open by a strong instrument—I saw marks of a <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi>, or something—the larder is part of the house—it is under the back parlour—I found the larder door open, and the wire inside the iron grating turned down—the larder door is another door beyond the strong</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman harness-maker, living in Crown-street, King-street, Westminster. I have been out of work lately—I went to Richmond on Monday, the 27th of October, with the two pri<lb></lb>soners—we set out from London at half-past eight o'clock, and arrived at Richmond at twelve o'clock at night—Gray said he was going to see his friends there—we went to the corner of Richmond-green—both the pri<lb></lb>soners told me to stand at the corner of the green, and they parted from me—I staid half an hour, I suppose; they returned both together, and Gray said they had not seen their friends—they went to the corner of a place where there was a field, at the corner of Mr. Long's house, and they said they were to lie down a bit—instead of laying down, they went to a wall close by Mr. Long's—I went with them as far as the wall—Gray said that was his uncle's—they both got over the wall—I got on the top of the wall, and sat on it—they got over another wall close by, that wall parted Mr. Long's wall from the house—they then went to the left, towards the house—I then lost sight of them—after they had been gone a little while, I saw a light in the back apartment of Mr. Long's house—the house ad<lb></lb>joins others, I believe—I neared as if it were the report of a gun—the prisoners came back again in about half an hour, or three quarters, to the place where I was—it was near two o'clock—I was not sitting on the wall all the time—I was at the wall when they came back—they had two boxes, one containing the tea, and two or three square pieces of wood in the other—Bryan had the box containing the tea—Gray had the small box—I saw the spoons, but I cannot say how many—I did not see them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240194"></xptr>
               <p>open plainly, to see how many there were—Bryan had them—one table<lb></lb>spoon was broken in halves before I saw it—Bryan broke open one of the boxes, which had tea in it, he took it out of there, and put it into a handker<lb></lb>chief—he took the boxes back on Mr. Long's hill, close by the wall, and came back again—we all three went away together—we met a man having the appearance of a policeman, who stopped us—he asked us what we did over the wall, over in that field—Bryan said he did nothing over there, that he was not over there at all—the policeman said yes, we were there—he had been in the lane, and watched us—Bryan said we had not—Gray walked away—he followed Gray a little way, and I saw Bryan throw the spoons over the wall, while the policeman was following Gray—he threw them into a garden opposite Mr. Long's—the policeman searched us all after Bryan had thrown the spoons over; he did not take off our hats, and we went away altogether—we came to town in the morning, all three together—on Tuesday night I saw Ford, a policeman, and told him what had happened—on Tuesday morning, before I told the policeman, the prisoners took the tea to a man and had it weighed—I saw Bryan take it out in a hand<lb></lb>kerchief to get it weighed—it was the same handkerchief that he put it in the night before—he took it to a house next door—Hill, I believe, keeps it—Bryan came out, and came into his own house, and the tea was divided into two parts—I saw it divided by Bryan—one part was given to Gray, and the other part Bryan kept.</p>

               <p>whole of the time, I am certain—I worked a little of the time, not in the court, but in Tothill-street—one day one week, and I believe two days another—I worked for Herbert, who lives in Tothill-strett, he is a harness-maker—I worked for him only a day, or three days, I believe, while I was in Union-court—I was in Monmouth-street before I was in Union-court—I paid for my lodging myself there—I believe I was six months there—I am not exactly sure of the exact time—I will swear I was there four months—I was in work there, at harness-making for my<lb></lb>self for four months, I believe—I cannot exactly say in what months it was—it was not in this year—I do not know whether it was in the winter or summer time—I have named all the places I lived at within the last twelve months—I was pot-boy at the Two Sawyers public-house, Lam<lb></lb>beth, for sixteen months—I worked as a harness-maker longer than at the public-house—I worked for myself as a harness-maker, in Crown-street—that was before I went to the public-house—I was at work three months at a Mr. McKenzie's, as a book-binder, and I lived at a green-grocer's shop, in King-street—I think that was four years ago—I think I was at work for myself before that, as a harness-maker.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the night in question, you, say no purpose was mentioned for your going to Richmond, except Gray saying it was to see his friends? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, to get a little money of them—I am sure he said that—I am quite sure no other purpose was mentioned—I never said I went for the purpose of breaking open Mr. Long's house—the second wall is about six feet from the first one—when I found, instead of lying down, (as they said,) went over the wall, I thought something mysterious, and I stop<lb></lb>ped there to see the end of it—I had not the slightest notion of what they were about, or I would not have gone with them—I walked all the way with them—I merely went to accompany them—I had no object at all—when they went to the green where they were to see their friends, they were tired, and talked of lying down—that did not excite my sus<lb></lb>picion—I wanted to go home—they did go to see their friends, as I under<lb></lb>stood—they parted with me for half an hour, and when they came back, they went to Mr. Long's house—I did not think it right to lie down in a field so late—when they went to the wall, I thought it wrong—they told me to stop on the wall, and watch to see if any body came, but instead of that, I watched them—I had no idea of breaking open a house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Wednesday, the 29th of Oc<lb></lb>tober, I saw Douglas, about six o'clock in the evening—I knew him be<lb></lb>fore—I did not know where he lived at the time, but I knew he was in the habit of coming to his mother's, in Union-court, Orchard-street—he came to me and made a communication about Mr. Long's jobbery—I took him to Richmond on the Saturday following—he pointed out to me where the spoons were thrown over the fence; which I believe was Mr. Deane's garden—I don't know myself whether Deane lives there—I know Mr. Long's house—it is on the left side of the road to Mr. Long's house, and opposite to it—I produce five spoons—there were six, but one is lost—here is one tea-spoon and four dessert-spoons; and I have a broken dessert-spoon—this is the handkerchief they were wrapped in—Mrs. Long de<lb></lb>livered the spoons to me, and this handkerchief with them.</p>

Bryan came to my house backwards and forwards, for twelve months—he lodged then with a young woman, at one of the houses I occupy—I have three or four lodging-houses—on a Tuesday or Wednesday, at the latter end of October, he brought a quantity of tea in a dirty coloured handkerchief—I think it was about the 27th or 28th—I did not exactly notice the day—I will swear it was after the Monday—he only asked me to be kind enough to weigh it for him—I did so—it weighed twelve ounces—he took it out of my house into the house he lodged at, in two parcels—it was in one parcel at the time he brought it—he asked me to divide it into two, which I did.</p>

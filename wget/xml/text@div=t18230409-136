               <p>"Corfield do not kill my father." They then took my pocket book, containing this money, from my coat pocket. I called murder and the watchman came up. The prisoner was one of them. I saw him rifling my pockets; it was a moonlight night, and very near a coffee house, which has a strong light; they turned back, and went down Churchway. I followed but they got off. I told the watchman his name. I knew the prisoner before; he lodged with me in 1821. He was apprehended last Saturday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. There had been a quarrel between you - A. He owed me money for rent; we had a dispute in October, 1821; he broke into my room, and dragged me out of bed, and broke every thing in the room. I indicted him and he gave false bail; I had a Bench warrant against him; I told the watchman he had robbed me. I did not go to his house for him, as I did not know where it was; he keeps two or three places, I went to Phoenix-street with the constable. When he was apprehended I told this story; the Justice ordered him to Clerkenwell; he said the bench warrant was enough. I did not see him after the robbery, till he was apprehended. I was perfectly sober; I did not see him before he struck me; after I received the blow, one of them said;</p>
               <p>"You villain, you have knocked down a child." I am certain it was his voice.</p>

            , JUN. I am thirteen years old. I was going to the grocers with my father, and at the corner of Charlton-street, two men came up to my father and said,</p>
               <p>"What made you knock a child down," and as the words came out of his mouth, he hit him by the side of his head, and knocked him down; I called out,</p>
               <p>"Corfield do not kill my father"; then he said,</p>

               <p>"You rascal, if you make a noise I'll kill you"; the skirts of my fathers coat turned up, as he fell on his face and hands; Corfield felt in his pocket, and took his pocket-book out, and ran away with it. I knew him before; he used to live in our house; I told my father who the man was; he did not know who it was; I did not tell the watchman. I saw him about a mouth after in Wilstead-street, as I was going to school, I was alone and did not call after him, my father told me whenever I saw him again to follow him. I saw him two days after, but was afraid to follow him. I saw him two or three times, but was always alone. The prisoner took the pocket-book, but the other man knocked my father down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did your father tell you that he did not see him - A. Yes; he was stunned for three minutes. I saw him walking up and down Harford-street, but did not know he lived there, till a shoe-boy told me so, and then I told my father; this was before the robbery.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. The prisoner surrendered himself to me on a Bench warrant I had against him for assaulting the prosecutor before this. I took him to Bow-street; we waited two hours at a public-house for the prosecutor to come - he then said he was a rogue and a robber, and was going to say what he had done, but I sent him to the office. This was on the 12th of April; he had given me notice on Thursday that he should be ready to go with me.</p>

            . I live in Harford-street, Somer's-town. The prisoner has lodged a year and a half with me. On the 29th of March, he was not well; he came home in the evening - I cannot say whether the clock had struck ten, but I fetched his candle before the watchman went half-past ten. I was up myself till half-past twelve, it being Easter-eve; he did not go out again. The prosecutor knew where he lived, for he has come and insulted me several times before the robbery, and asked for the prisoner. He did not come after the robbery.</p>

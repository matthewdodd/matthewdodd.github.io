I saw these rings safe about ten o'clock on Friday evening, the 23rd of July; I put them into a tray about nine that night - the tray was in the window; the window had not been opened after that till eleven o'clock in the morning, when the prisoner came in to look at them - I was not in the shop when he came in, but before he left, Etheridge, my young man, was in the shop, and called me in on account of another person coming into the shop; the prisoner was still there, and Etheridge had shown him some rings; the second person asked to look at some gold chains, but bought none; when I came into the shop Etheridge told me to attend to the prisoner with the rings, and he would show the chains - Etheridge then put the rings the prisoner had been looking at into the glass case; the prisoner desired to look at other rings - I showed him a separate tray of diamond rings; he bought nothing - the other party made several equivocal remarks about the chains; we had none to suit him - that drew my attention from the rings to him; they both went away nearly together, but went separate ways, to the best of my recollection; the prisoner bought nothing; immediately that he left I missed a diamond ring, value fifteen guineas - I did not miss the other till the prisoner was brought back; I immediately sent Etheridge to follow him - he was brought back in less than half a minute; I accused him of robbing me of a diamond ring - he denied it, and while an officer was sent for he tried to escape out of the door; Etheridge threw the door too, and the prisoner's shoulder went through the glass - he was not able to get out of the shop; the officer came, searched him, and found 18d. in silver, three duplicates, and 5d. in copper on him - there was no money to pay for valuable rings; before the officer came I saw him take his handkerchief out of his coat pocket, and saw one ring fall from it - I am certain it fell from him; I would not pick it up - it was picked up, and was mine; that had not been in the tray I showed him, but in the former one - the other ring was picked up afterwards in the street, but not in my presence, nor on the same day; I claimed it at Hatton-garden - it had been offered in pledge; the party was detained, and it was advertised - that was the 15l. one; the ring he dropped was worth 4l. 8s. - I have not seen the person who wanted the gold chains since.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I suppose people often come to your shop who do not return? A. Frequently; I do not know what passed before Etheridge called me - I found the prisoner looking at the rings, and the other person asked to see chains as I came into the shop; I had sorted the rings on the Friday evening, between nine and ten o'clock - I was in the shop all the evening; I had no customers after that, nor in the morning till the prisoner came - I think the prisoner went out first, but they left so near together I cannot say; the prisoner went down Ludgate-hill, towards Fleet-market - he desired to see another tray; I cannot say whether he asked for my card, or whether he had one; I do not recollect giving him one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give him a card, and press him to come again, saying you would get such a ring as he required? A. I cannot say - it is very possible; whether the tray of valuable rings was on the counter when he returned I do not recollect - I had missed the valuable one before he returned, but not the other; the tray that was in was put into the glass case before the expensive rings were shown him, and had not been taken out - I missed the diamond ring on replacing them in the tray; that was the last tray - I had no idea the other was stolen till it dropped from him; I know that the prisoner went down Ludgate-hill - I looked particularly at him, he being the one I attended to; I do not recollect having any conversation with my shopman about the prisoner's conduct - I do not recollect his saying it was impossible the prisoner could have taken the low priced ring, as he looked particularly at him from the time he came in; I will not swear that he did or did not say so - I was asked about this at Guildhall, and said I was not aware of it; my shopman was not before the Magistrate - the prisoner complained about that, and I said we could not both leave the shop at the same time; the prisoner did not desire the examination to be postponed till he could hear the shopman's evidence - he was remanded from Saturday till Tuesday, to bring evidence of his respectability, and have Counsel; I heard nothing of the shopman being wanted till Tuesday - he went before the Grand Jury.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Lamb's employ. On Saturday morning, the 24th of July, I saw the prisoner come into the shop - I was alone; he asked to look at some rings - I showed him some; he wanted sporting rings that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160005"></xptr>would spring open to have hair in it - I showed him what rings we had, but we had not one that would exactly suit him; the common ring was in the tray at the time I showed it him; that tray was not in order, or I should have missed it, but the tray Mr. Lamb showed him was perfectly in order - I saw his right hand go to his handkerchief, which was in his hand; he then passed it from one hand to the other, then put his hand into his pocket very quick, but I did not at that time miss any thing; he then asked to look at other rings - I put the first rings into the glass case on the counter, and took out another tray; another person came in, pointed to the window, and asked me to show him some chains - I called Mr. Lamb; the other was very anxious for me to show him the chains while I was attending to the prisoner, but I could not; I called Mr. Lamb, and put the tray of rings down before Mr. Lamb for him to serve the prisoner - it was on the counter, within the prisoner's reach; the other person bought nothing - while I was serving him Mr. Lamb got out the tray of best rings, so that there were two trays on the counter; he turned round to me to ask what priced chains the person wanted and on turning back he missed the valuable ring - they both left the shop almost together; the other one said he wanted a chain at about 10s. - Mr. Lamb said, "You cannot have one at 10s.," and he went out, and the prisoner followed him; Mr. Lamb immediately said "There is a diamond ring gone;" I followed after the prisoner; he was four or five doors off - I tapped him on the shoulder, and told him to step back, for Mr. Lamb wanted to speak to him; he seemed very much confused, but came back, and I kept close to him - I thought he wanted to get his hand into his pocket, but I was so close to him he could not, and when we got to the door he said, "What, into the door, Sir?" I then took hold of him, and pushed him in; Mr. Lamb accused him of stealing a diamond ring - he tried to rush out of the shop; I slammed the door too, and broke the glass with his shoulder - Mr. Lamb seized hold of him then, and said, "Etheridge, there, he has just thrown one down," and I saw the ring on the floor, close to his heels; it could not have dropped from the tray - it had been in the tray I showed him before Mr. Lamb came into the shop- he must have put it into his pocket when he got hold of his handkerchief; when Mr. Lamb said he had thrown one down, I saw his handkerchief in his hand, but had not seen him pull it out; a man at the door asked if I wanted an officer - I said Yes, and he fetched one; I saw him searched - nothing was found on him to purchase a ring with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does Mr. Lamb keep any other shopman? A. No; I am not aware of having told him it was impossible for the prisoner to have stolen a ring - I may have said I looked very sharp after him, for I was rather suspicious of him; I do not think I told Mr. Lamb any thing of the sort - it was stated at Guildhall that I said so; if I did, I must be very much mistaken; I swear the ring which dropped from his pocket was in the tray when I took it out to show him - there were but two of the sort in the tray; to the best of my belief I never said I was quite sure he could not have concealed a ring - I will not swear it - when I went out I found the prisoner two or three doors below; he was walking very fast - I hardly lost sight of him; I was not confused - Mr. Lamb has no partner; the dwelling-house is over the shop, and he lives there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever see the most valuable ring at Hatton-garden? A. It was first brought to our shop - I saw it there; Mr. Lamb went to Hatton-garden, claimed it, and received it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner in charge for stealing some rings; he denied the charge - I searched him in the shop, and found a duplicate of a great coat, pawned for 8s., and something else for 3s.; also a shilling and sixpence, and 5d. in copper - I have kept the ring ever since.</p>
               <p>MR. LAMB. This ring was part of my stock; it has my number and private mark - I am certain I never sold it; I have no partner.</p>

            . This is the ring; I am certain it was in the tray I showed the prisoner - it is marked 4l. 8s.; the other was worth 15l. I believe - it was certainly worth 10l. to any one in the trade.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You cannot say whether it was found on any body who had been in your shop? A. I understand it was found in the street, nearly opposite the door - the intrinsic value of the other is three guineas or 3l. 5s.; we do not all agree in the value of a diamond - the other ring was in the tray when Mr. Lamb took it out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The two witnesses have perjured themselves in various points, and I leave myself entirely to your merciful consideration; my friends, who live in Essex, were here last night, but are obliged to attend in in the country on urgent business - as to saying the witnesses are perjured, that merely alludes to the hearing at Guildhall; I was committed for stealing a ring, value 4l. - Mr. Lamb then said his shopman said it was impossible for me to conceal the ring I was first charged with; the shopman said the other gentleman entered the shop as an accomplice - I knew nothing of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, Deptford, and am a labourer—on 14th September I was in Deptford Broadway, and saw a brown horse trotting along with some boys following it—I stopped it, turned it round, and took it to the corner of the market-place—the boys said it belonged to Blackheath—I waited there till a policeman came along, and he said, "This horse has been to the station-house two or three times; I will not have it there again"—the prisoner was not present then—he came up after the policeman had gone, with two more men, and asked me whose horse it was—I said I did not know, I was trying to find out—he said, "Let me have the horse, I will try and find out"—I let him have it, and he took it away—there was a little bit of string in its mouth, and he led it off by that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there any grass in the Broadway, Deptford? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I cannot say whether the two men who came up with the prisoner said anything; they were talking amongst themselves, and they all went away together over the bridge, towards Blackheath, and then they came back again and went down Chertsea, leading the horse—I have known the prisoner all my life—I never knew him otherwise than a decent, respectable man.</p>

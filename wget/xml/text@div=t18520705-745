                  </hi>. I live in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove. The prisoner came to lodge at my house at the latter part of Feb.—on 12th March another lodger, named Curtis, spoke to me about something he had lost—in consequence of what he said I looked for the prisoner, and found he was gone—the next evening I found a box belonging to George Lenton, who occupied the next room to the prisoner, broken open; the nails had been drawn out—I had seen it safe the night before—I found these pincers and nails on the prisoner's bed—he was gone then, and did not come back—I did not know he was going.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly Inspector of Police, and am now in the service of the Mint authorities—on 22d October I went to 27, Flower-and-Dean Street, Spitalfields, with Inspector Bryant, and two or three other officers—we found the door open, and proceeded to the second floor front room, the door of which was shut—I broke it open with a sledge hammer, and saw Milford sitting by a clear bright fire, in his shirt sleeves, with a plaster of Paris mould in one hand, wrapped in a pad, and a pipkin con<lb></lb>taining molten metal in the other—he placed the pipkin on the stove, flung the mould down and stamped upon it—I pushed him off of it, and he was seized by Sergeant Brannan—he resisted violently, and used every effort to destroy the mould—on his being secured, I picked off the floor frag<lb></lb>ments of a double mould for casting fourpenny-pieces—a portion of lead lodged on the window, which I afterwards picked up; it was hot—on a shelf in the cupboard I found this double mould for sixpences, which was warm (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner Theobald picked up this cup off the table, con<lb></lb>taining sand and water, flung it at my face, and out dropped a large quantity of sixpences and fourpenny-pieces—I caught the cup between my arm and body, and did not let it fall to the ground—the sixpenny and four-penny pieces are here—here are twenty-four, dated 1856, and sixteen of 1823—Dyer was with her back to the door, she threw down a quantity of sixperices and fourpences on the table, which I afterwards picked up (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>), and which were wet with sand and water—it is a very small room, the table was near the fire, and they all sat round it—I told Milford I had received instructions to look after him and endeavour to put a stop to his practice in dealing largely in counterfeit coin—he said, "I have not been long at it, Mr. Brannan; not more than three or four months, indeed, I might say this is my first time"—I found a file on the table with white metal in it's teeth as if recently used; a piece of glass with plaster of Paris adhering to it; some plaister of Paris in powder, and all the neces<lb></lb>sary implements for coining—there was no battery, they colour the coins with a saucer and a wire, which is immersed in a solution of cyanide of silver—we found everything necessary for coining—I gave the coins and moulds to Mr. Webster—I found two genuine sixpences and three or four groats.</p>

I followed Brannan into the room, and saw Milford throw away the mould, and saw the two women sitting at a table scouring sixpences with sand, to rub off the blue and prepare them for silvering—I took Theobald in custody, and took from her right hand these five counterfeit sixpences wet with sand, as were her hands—I said you have been scouring these—she said, "Yes, I suppose I have"—at her feet I found a packet of ten sixpeuces separately wrapped in paper; they were finished and fit for circulation—she asked me to give her her gown, shawl, and bonnet off the bed, which I did—I asked her whether she lived there—she said, "You see I do"—I took her to the station—Dyer was in charge of another officer—they were throwing the things about so that we were obliged to look very closely after them.</p>

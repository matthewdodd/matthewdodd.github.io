               <p>Court. What are you? - I work at sawing sometimes.</p>
               <p>How long have you been out of employ? - A fortnight very near.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Lad-Lane, at the Crown.</p>
               <p>Have you any father or mother living? Yes, in the country.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, I have known him by sight above two years.</p>
               <p>Are you much acquainted with him? - No, only I have drank with him.</p>
               <p>Did he behave in any improper manner at any time, and when? - On the 29th of July, my landlady sent a young man to sleep with me, and she and I quarrelled, I lodged at the George at that time, I told her I would not sleep in the house, and the prisoner was there, and he said, go home along with me Dick, so I will says I, Sweetman.</p>
               <p>What time of night was this? - Between twelve and one, when we went to the prisoner's we went up stairs, and went to bed just after the clock struck one, I went to sleep before the prisoner got into bed, I do not know that I heard him, and about two o'clock I awaked, and his arms were clenched round me, and he had turned me on my face, and he had got his instrument between my thighs, and I twisted myself and made him break his hold, I got my breast on the bedstead, and I took hold of him with my left hand, and gave him two or three good pelts over the head, I laid hold of him by his breast, the fleshy part; then I asked what he thought of himself, and what he deserved, he said, do not tell, do not tell, my dear, do not tell, several times over; then I said, what do you deserve, says I, you take care for the future, never offer any such thing any more to any man, if you do you will get into a hobble: I laid till morning, and he laid on the other side, and never offered anything more.</p>
               <p>Why did not you leave him directly? - I was disposed to go to sleep, and he laid very still afterwards, after I gave him a knock or two.</p>
               <p>How soon did you tell this to any body? - I cannot tell exactly to the day, I told it to a porter that I knew, that I went house with him, and he wanted to serve me and so, and he said it was a nasty affair; I never made any complaint to any Justice till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>How was you found out? - A man, an acquaintance of the prosecutor on the last trial, stopped me, and told me the prisoner was taken up for a crime I was talking of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor and me were both very much in liquor, that is all that I can say.</p>

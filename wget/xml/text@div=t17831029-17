               <p>Were there any particular marks about her? - Yes, she had a cut in her off ear, and a crack in her off foot on the inside, I found her again at Warwick, I have her now.</p>

               <p>I was at Acton at the time, not very well, I got up about seven to fetch the mare from the field; it was a very thick fog, I am very near sighted, and I supposed she was in some part of it where I could not discover her, I traversed the field several times, and at last came to the gate on the further side, which I found had been broke open.</p>
               <p>How was it locked or fastened? - I cannot say; the nails were forced, and the gate was open, it is a gate we never open.</p>

               <p>I live in Warwick, I keep a publick house and am a farmer; on the 4th of October, the prisoner at the bar came to my house and called the hostler to take his horse, he came into the house and had a mug of ale, he drank it, and went up into the town, in about half an hour he returned, he called twice to the hostler, and ordered the mare out, and called for a feed of corn, he said, says he, landlord, I have a useful little mare here, but she will not draw, he asked me if I had ever a one that I could change with him that would draw, I told him I had; I keep several hacks; and there was one that stood in the stable that I chopped with him for the mare; he shifted the saddle and said, will you go and have a shilling's-worth of ale, we went and had some ale, having seen the mare, and finding her better than my horse, I suspected him, I said, I do not think you came honestly by this mare.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the mare better than your horse? - Yes, therefore I was surprized that he should make such a swap as that; he said, it was his father's mare, I said, I am afraid you have stolen this mare; a gentleman farmer came into my house, this gentleman examined him where he came from, he said, from Bucks, he asked him if he knew one Dumper, he said he did, he said, he is a sad fellow; I did not like my customer; he got up pretending to make water, and ran away, says I, go after him, he was gone a long way towards Coventry, I went after him, he got over the grounds that I could not follow him, I rode after him about a mile and half, and I took him, I asked him what he ran away for, says he, do not hurt me, I am guilty; I took him before the Mayor of the town, and he was committed, I asked him going to prison where he got the mare, he said, two of his friends had taken her and brought her to him; I asked him whose mare she was, he said, it was Mr. Hoblar's mare; the Mayor of the Town said, he would write to Sir Sampson Wright, and get to the bottom of it; I said to him, you must be a very great villain, supposing this mare had been found upon me, and I never saw you in my life before, I delivered the mare on Tuesday evening by the orders of Sir Sampson Wright, to young Mr. Hoblar.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hoblar. You received the mare from this witness? - I did, I delivered it to my father.</p>
               <p>And that was your father's mare? - It was.</p>
               <p>When did you last see the mare before you missed her? - I rode her on the Thursday, and had her on Thursday at two o'clock, and missed her on Friday the 3d of October.</p>

               <p>When I was first apprehended the Mayor of the Town said, if I had any companions that helped me to the mare, if I would confess of them and let them be apprehended,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290064"></xptr> he would admit me as an evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hoblar, junior. I have two letters from the Mayor of Warwick, which do not mention any thing of the kind.</p>

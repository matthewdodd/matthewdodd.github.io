                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Hamilton. The prisoner is my brother, and was brother-in-law to the deceased James Simmonds. On the 15th of October my sister Catherine, the deceased's wife, had ill-used my little brother John—the prisoner went up to see the cause of it, and asked her why she had ill-used my little brother—the deceased took it up, and struck my brother—my brother said, as the deceased was an old man he did not wish to strike him, but if he did it again he would—he did strike him again, and my brother in his own defence struck him—they both fell—it was an accidental quarrel—my brother was struck twice</p>

               <p>before he hit the deceased—we did not think he was hurt at the time—there was a clothes-horse in the room, and as he fell the horse fell down—I don't know whether he fell against it—my brother and I came away directly-next morning we heard the deceased was at the hospital—he was sixty-two years old—my sister was twenty-five—they had only been married four months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of James Simmonds—I had beat the little boy in the morning, and the prisoner and the rest came to complain-a quarrel arose between my husband and the prisoner—I did not see my husband strike the prisoner—I don't remember how it be<lb></lb>gan, I was too worried to notice—I only saw them fall over the clothes-horse together—I cannot say which fell undermost—they fell with consider<lb></lb>able weight—there was no reason to suppose my husband was so much hurt at the time—I took him to the doctor—he thought at first one of his teeth was hurt, but it was his jaw-bone broken—they never had words before—it was a quarrel between us all—my husband walked to the hos<lb></lb>pital with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital. I saw the deceased there—the cause of his death was inflammation of the throat and glands—it is impossible to say what caused that—the jaw was frac<lb></lb>tured, and suppuration had taken place, slight inflammation of the jaw—it was erysipelatous inflammation—I have seen that occur without any acci<lb></lb>dent whatever—I could not say that the inflammation in the throat was produced by the accident—I could not trace any connexion between the suppuration around the jaw and the state of the throat—I cannot assign any cause-inflammation came on—the man was old, and not having been able to take any Solid food for sometime, was unable to resist the attack that took place—I cannot say that the broken jaw was the occasion of hit death.</p>

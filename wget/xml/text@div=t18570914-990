                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Stone, a wholesale biscuit baker, of No. 69, Blackman Street, St. George the Martyr. I went to bed on Saturday night, 5th Sept, soon after 12 o'clock—I had locked up the place—the doors were fast—the spoons and tongs were in a cupboard over</p>

I n copper money, and this screwdriver, which I compared with the marks on Mr. Stone's cup<lb></lb>board—it was this that the door was opened with—I found this small screwdriver in the parlour—this Mr. Stone himself identified—a portion of this was broken off in the iron safe—Mr. Stone's premises are about four doors from the corner of Great Suffolk Street—the prisoners were coming in a direction from Mr. Stone's—I saw Williams first—I saw them both come down off the shed.</p>

I am the wife of Spencer Leigh, and am a laundress, at 91, Charles Street, Stepney—on the evening of 6th January I fastened up the house at 9.30—I fastened the window-sash, but I could not positively swear that I bolted the shutters, they were closed to—I heard no noise in the night—at 7.30 in the morning I came down and found the window open, two drawers partly stripped, the cover <hi rend="italic">gone</hi> from the table, and a wire blind from the window—I ran to the station at once—I afterwards looked over my things, and missed the articles now produced in this basket—this wire blind, and a quantity of line.</p>

               <p>about 1 o'clock, I was in Baker Street, Stepney, in a small court there—a man passed me up the court, he saw me, turned round, and said "Look out!" speaking to a companion behind me—I immediately rushed out into Baker Street, and saw the prisoner carrying this basket immediately under a lamp, outside the court—I made a grasp at him with my right hand—he threw the basket on to my feet—I jumped over the basket, with the intention of running after him, but on second thoughts I stopped and picked up the basket, I then ran with the basket under my arm, calling out "Stop thief!" as loud as I possibly could—the prisoner and another ran down Baker Street into Nelson Street—I saw them turn the corner of Nelson Street into Sidney Street—I continued calling "Stop thief!"—as soon as I turned the corner of Sidney Street I heard a voice say "Here he is, I have got him!" and when I got up I saw the prisoner in custody of the witness Chapman—I said "That is the man"—he said "No; I was not carrying the basket; I did not run that way"—he made a desperate struggle to get away, I threw down the basket and held him with both hands—he still struggled—I said "If you don't be quiet I will hit you," and I did hit him across the nose with my left hand; he was then quiet, and with the assistance of two other constables we took him to Arbour Square Station, where he was charged—I lost sight of the men for about half a minute twice daring the time they turned the corner of Baker Street into Nelson Street, and again into Sidney Street—I can distinctly swear the prisoner is the man I saw carrying the basket—at the station the prisoner wished to see the inspector before going into Court—I was present—the prisoner said "I was not carrying the basket; I went over the water to my sister, in Kent Street in the Borough; I left there at 12 o'clock; I walked from there to the George in Commercial Road, there I met two men carrying a basket, who asked me to go back with them, where were they to take the stuff to—I said 'To a house in Baker Street'"—I have since found it was within one door of where they intended to take the property to."</p>

I am a messenger, and live at 80, Rutland Street, Wile End Road—about 1 o'clock on the morning of 7th January I was at the corner of Sidney Street—I heard cries of "Stop thief!"—afterwards I saw two men come running down the street—I heard the cry of "Stop thief!" again—I looked round and saw a policeman's lamp; seeing two men running, I thought all was not right, so I ran across the road, and detained the prisoner until the constable came up—he struggled violently, and struck at the constable—the constable struck him back again.</p>

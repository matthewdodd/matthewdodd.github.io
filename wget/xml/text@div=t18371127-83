I had the care of this coat, it was kept in a box in the livery stables, in Crown-yard, Regent-street—it was left with me on the 8th of November, and I saw it safe on the 13th, from half-past six o'clock to seven o'clock, and I missed it the same day, when the policeman called on me—the prisoner was helping me that afternoon—he worked in the yard—I did not permit him to take the coat—I had the care of it—it was Mr. Isaacs's—he puts up at the stables.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the 13th of November, in Regent-street—the prisoner came out of that yard with a coat on his shoulder—I stopped him and asked him what he was going to do with the coat—he told me it was his own—then he contradicted himself, and said it belonged to another person—I told him I had suspicions of it, and I would take him to the watch-house—he said, "You don't mean that, do you? "—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it down on the pavement, and said, "You b----, carry it yourself."</p>

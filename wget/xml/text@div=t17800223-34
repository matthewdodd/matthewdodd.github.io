               <p>Was that house broke open at any time; - Some people entered into it in the night of the 28th of last month; they entered the house through a garret window; the window was only raised up I believe.</p>
               <p>How late in the evening did you see that window? - I cannot say that I saw it in the evening at all; they came in through an empty house adjoining, and so along the gutter which leads from the leads of the empty house to this garret-window; they broke open several locks of drawers and trunks.</p>
               <p>No part of the house was broke open, only the window was open? - Not that I could see; I discovered it about one in the morning; I was then going to bed. I saw the things taken out of the trunk that belonged to Mr. Guion, and the trunk opened, therefore I knew somebody had been there. On looking farther, I found the other trunks were opened.</p>

               <p>Did you lose any thing of your own? - Yes; some things that were my wife's; a gold watch, and a brilliant diamond hoop ring, and two silver thimbles, as she informs me, I know she had such things, but I cannot say that they were there.</p>

               <p>I belong to Sir John Fielding's office. On the 29th in the morning some of us had an order to go to Andrew's house, concerning another fact. As we were going along Worship-street, at the top of Moorfields, we met the two prisoners, they were walking 30 or 40 yards before us. I saw Andrews give the other a nudge with his elbow for him to make off, upon which Palmer turned out of the footway into the coach-road; I turned out after him and stopped him, and from under Palmer's arm I took this bundle.</p>
               <p>Did Andrews say any thing to him when he touched his elbow? - Not that I heard. Jealous came up and searched Palmer; these things were found upon him. (Some shirts and stockings, and a linen waistcoat were produced in court).</p>
               <p>Guion. These are mine; they are marked with my name.</p>
               <p>To Morant. Who was with you when you took the prisoners? - Jealous, Macmanus, and three more; we found nothing upon Andrews; we took him directly home to his own house, he kept the Rose, a public house in Rose-lane, Spittalfields; in Andrew's bed room, in a chair covered over with a blanket, we found some more linen, which Mr. Jealous has got.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him how he came by them? - He said Palmer left them there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Whether I did not tell him I knew nothing of them; but that I would call my wife and ask her how they came there? - Yes, his wife was called.</p>
               <p>What account did she give when she was called? - That they were left there by Palmer.</p>
               <p>Did you find the watch chain? - No, Jealous found that.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You met these people in Worship-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far is that from Rose-lane? - Pretty near a mile, I believe.</p>
               <p>You was going to Andrew's house, and met them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Palmer you say went into the middle of the street? - Yes, after the other gave him a nudge.</p>
               <p>He did not turn back, did he? - No.</p>
               <p>He was coming towards you? - No; his face was towards us, he was rather going off.</p>
               <p>And these things you found on him were like those you found in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know were Palmer lived? - Palmer, they told us, lodged in Andrew's house; he told us he had left his own house.</p>
               <p>Do you know of your own knowledge whether at that time he lived in Andrew's house or not? - No; only what Andrew's wife said.</p>
               <p>Was that in Palmer's presence? - No.</p>

            . I was along with Morant in Worship-street at the time he stopped Palmer and Andrews; after he had taken that bundle from under Palmer's arm, I then found in Palmer's pocket a chissel and a loaded pistol; in another of his pockets I found a bunch of picklock keys and a tinder box, a steel and flint; in another pocket I found a woman's watch chain. (They were all produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Eleanor Furlong. This is mine.</p>
               <p>Are you certain it is your's? - I am. These same trinkets were to the watch when I saw it that day.</p>
               <p>Did you search Andrews? - Morant searched him, but did not find any thing at all upon him.</p>
               <p>Jealous. I went along with Andrews into his room up stairs; in his own bed room I found these things (produced them). Here is as nearly half as possibly can be; even the ruffles were divided.</p>
               <p>Are they the same quantity of shirts as were found in Palmer's bundle? - There were four shirts, which are the number as were in Palmer's bundle, and there were the same number of ruffles and stocks found upon the chair under a blanket. I asked Andrews how he came by them; he said they did not belong to him, but desired I would call his wife up stairs; she came up. He asked her who had left them there; she said one Palmer left them there.</p>
               <p>(Four shirts, three stocks, and ruffles, and five pair of silk stockings were produced in court and deposed to by Guion.)</p>
               <p>To Morant. What were the stockings which were in Palmer's bundle? - There were no stockings at all in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Jealous. There were four pair taken out of Palmer's pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did not Andrews tell you when you asked him about these things, that they not only were not his, but that he knew nothing about them? - He said he had not seen the man for the space of twenty minutes in his life time.</p>
               <p>He desired you to call up his wife, and said he knew nothing about them? - Yes, he desired his wife to be sent for up.</p>

               <p>Do you know whether Palmer and Andrews were acquainted? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Andrews. Palmer and I have been acquainted a great many years.</p>
               <p>You say you found them in Andrews's bedroom? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was only one bed in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is Andrews a married man? - I always took him to be such.</p>
               <p>Had you ever known any thing of Palmer before that time? - I always took him to be a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you find any pistol or any picklock upon Andrews? - Nothing at all upon him; all was upon Palmer.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did not you say that Andrews told you he had not known him twenty minutes? - Yes; that he had seen him but a very little while before. I do not believe I should have taken Palmer into custody if it had not been for seeing him with Andrews. I had known Palmer before.</p>
               <p>What was his character? - I never heard any thing amiss of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say that before this time you thought Andrews a very honest man? - No, I said that of Palmer.</p>

            's people in the morning of the 29th. We saw the two prisoners coming along; Andrews winked to Palmer to go out of the way; Palmer went into the coach-way. We immediately laid hold of them, and in searching found this dark lantern, some trinkets, and four pair of silk stockings in Palmer's pocket. Jealous came and took hold of Palmer, and Morant and I went on to Andrews's house; when we came there Andrews's wife was in the bar. We went in and searched the bar particularly. Andrews wanted to go up stairs; I said you shall not stir from this place till I go along with you; well, said he, then come up. He stopped a quarter of an hour longer than that I believe, then he said, are you ready to go up stairs now? I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230055"></xptr>said, yes. We went up. On entering the room we found a bundle of loose linen in a chair with a blanket thrown over it, and I believe a woman's petticoat. The first thing I looked at was a shirt. I said, Jealous, here is the same mark on this as those shirts in Palmer's bundle have on them. We found the rest had the same mark. We took Andrews. He begged us to go the back way out of his house, which we did, and then took him to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>How came you to notice the time that it was between nine and ten o'clock? - Just as we came out of the Red-Cow, I heard the watchman go half past nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>On what day of the month was this? - It is a month ago next Friday, I believe.</p>
               <p>Do you know when he was taken up? - No. I did not hear any thing of his being taken up till a fortnight after, and more.</p>
               <p>Can you say now what Friday it was? - The 28th day of the month, I think it was.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was the 28th day of the month? - I cannot say particularly, it was three weeks ago last Friday.</p>
               <p>Are you certain of that? - I think it is.</p>
               <p>Are you certain of it? - I cannot be certain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230057"></xptr>farther than I think it was three weeks last Friday, but did not take any particular marks of the day.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot undertake to swear, whether it was the 28th of January or not, only that it was on a Friday? - Yes, it was on a Friday.</p>
               <p>How far is the Red Cow from Andrews's house? - The Red Cow is in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>How far is that from his house? - Better than a mile I believe.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the watchman cry the hour ten that night? - I did not take particular notice of that; I heard him go past nine, or half after nine, soon after we came out of the Red Cow.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner to Hitch. Is that the man that came home with your master on the Friday night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your master went to bed immediately upon his coming home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And did not go out at all that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Hayward. He did not go out, for we had a pint of half-and-half to drink, and then he was lighted to bed.</p>

               <p>I went to Smithfield, after I had sold my goods off, to sell my horse; that was on Friday. I met Mr. Andrews in Smithfield; he went in with me to a public house; we had some brandy and water after I had sold the horse; coming along, that was between 7 and 8 o'clock, we shook hands with each other; I went towards Cow-Cross. I came strait home. Mr. Silvester was with me; he went with me to my home; I shook hands with Mr. Andrews, and bid him good night. The next morning, being about to take a publick-house, and Andrews owing me a little money, I went up to his house to ask him for it; he said, he could not just at that time let me have any, but if I would wait till his wife got up he would endeavour to get some. I waited till she came down stairs, between seven and eight o'clock; he said, stop, I will go with you; he went up stairs and brought down a bundle; he said, if you will go with me, I will get you some money; he put these things into my hand, and bid me go along and he would follow me. The handkerchief was old, it tore, these things sell out; I said, how can you put such a bundle into my hands? He said, take care of them; carry them a little farther and I will take them of you; I am going to carry them to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230058"></xptr>person they belong to. If they had searched Andrews, at the time they searched me, they must have found the property that belonged to these other things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fish salesman, of Billingsgate Market—on 20th November, between 8 and 9 in the evening, the prisoner came and stood about for a quarter of an hour—he saw me talking to a friend—he bought a box of herrings of me for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and paid me with a half-crown and sixpence—after he left I found the half-crown was bad, and put it in my pocket—there was no other half-crown there—five or ten minutes afterwards he came again, and said, "I think I will have another one"—he took a box</p>

               <p>and gave me another half-crown and a sixpence—I went outside, took hold of him, and said, "You gave me one half-crown, let me have a look at the other one"—I bit it, and gave them both to the officer—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I changed a sovereign in Billingsgate market that morning, and bought ten dozen haddocks—I received this half-crown in change.</p>

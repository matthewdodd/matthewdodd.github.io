               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Taylor; on the night of the robbery, I was in the house when the three men came in.</p>
               <p>Do you know them again? - I know one of them.</p>
               <p>Which is that? - Wood; some time after, one of them went out of the tap room; then after that I went to the door, and I saw three men come out, one of whom had a bundle.</p>
               <p>What did you go out of the door for? - For the air; it was a very hot night; the maid was at the door, and she ran in and came out again in a great hurry, and ran down the court after them into the Strand; when I came up to her she was staggering, and I secured Wood; I am sure he was one of the men that was in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What distance was you from the door in the court when the man came out? - I suppose about three yards, or thereabouts; I had been standing in the court about eight or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Had you seen you mistress go to the cook's-shop? - No, I do not recollect it; I had seen none of the men; I was standing right before the window, with my back to the window.</p>
               <p>Now, if any body else had been standing at the door and talking together do not you think you should have heard it? - I did not hear any body; the girl was standing there at the same time I was.</p>
               <p>How long might she be standing there? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did the girl when she ran in tell you what she ran in for? - No, she was on the opposite side of the court by the cook's shop.</p>
               <p>I thought you said she was standing by you? - She stood beside me some time; she did not explain why she stood there; then she went to the opposite side in an instant, I saw three men come out, and the man with the bundle went first.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300075"></xptr>Did they run very hard up the court? No, they did not till they got clear of the door, then they ran pretty smartish; Wood was searched in the watch-house, and a pick-lock key was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you leave the three men in the tap room when you went out? - I left two men in the house.</p>
               <p>Did not you see your mistress come out and go to the cook's shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see your mistress go out before you went into the court? - I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>Which went out first, you or the girl? - I went out first I believe.</p>
               <p>Jury. How far had the men got from the house before they ran? - I dare say they were over twenty yards before they made any great run; they walked pretty smartly, but did not run.</p>

               <p>I apprehended Tanner, and found upon him fourteen pick-lock keys; I tried them and this key opens the room door, and locked it again.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I apprehended Lenham; he was very inquisitive to know the business; the next morning taking him up to the Justice's he complained of being hungry and dry, and I gave him some bread and cheese and beer; he asked me if it was Tanner's affair; and here is the arm that was taken off Tanner.</p>
               <p>Sayre. He had a false arm when I took him; I thought it had been a real arm at first.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. Did you see the arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER LENHAM'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>They took me out of an alehouse; they said, they wanted me; they kept me in the watch house all night; in the morning the gentleman gave me a pennyworth of beer and an halfpenny roll; I asked Blacketer, he said, if I tell you, it must be a secret, it is about Tanner and Wood's affair; the maid said, at the office, if I was the person I had a brown coat on, with white metal buttons; I know nothing of the affair; I do not know the house.</p>
               <p>PRISONER TANNER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>They took me to Bow-street; and the woman, the maid, and the man too said, they did not know me, then I was taken to Justice Hyde's, and they said so there; I pulled off my arm, and then the woman said, she believed I was the person by my arm; the woman would swear to any man with one arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wood. I know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Court to Taylor. What is the value of the things that are lost? - I suppose not less than fifty pounds; they did not leave me a second thing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Wood called four witnesses to his character.</p>

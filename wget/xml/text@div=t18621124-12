                  </hi>. I am specially employed by the Mint—I received information which led me to go to 13, Princes-street, Whitechapel, on 27th October—I found the street-door open, proceeded to the first-floor front room, the door of which was broken open by Inspector Brannan and Serjeant Elliott—I rushed in and saw the three prisoners sitting by a clear fire—they all sat close to a table, and Brown was in his shirt-sleeves, with a pipkin in his hand, which he placed on the table—he rushed towards the officers to prevent their getting near the table—he was seized and secured—Caroline Bower then picked up the pipkin and placed it in the fender-—Salter had something in her hand, which she wrapped up in this canvass cloth, and placed it on the bed—Serjeant Leather seized her, pulled her towards the bed, and said, "There is something hot here"—I opened it—it contained a perfect mould for casting sixpences, which was hot—I then went towards the fire, and inside the fender I found this pipkin containing a small portion of white metal, hot, and a <hi rend="italic">get</hi>, which I believe was that of a sixpence, also hot—the get is the refused metal poured into the mould in its state of fusion, it is the overplus—close to it I found a warm sixpence, bearing the same date as the mould, and on a shelf in the cupboard, near where Salter sat, I found six counterfeit sixpences bearing the same date—there was also a glass with plaster of Paris adhering to it, and a cloth pad which was warm, two pieces of a new metal spoon, a cup and saucer, and some sand and water—Samuel Bower then said, "I do not live in this room, I live in the next"—I said, "We shall see presently, do not be violent"—he was very violent—I went to the next room, and Fife brought him in, and under the grate Fife found these fragments of a mould (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found a file with white metal in its teeth—Salter was brought into the room, and she said, "Mr. Brannan, I was making the last time you came; but so help me God, I was not making this time"—I said, "Why you have not been long out"—she said "It was six months on Tuesday"—I said, "I regret to find that you have mixed with your old associates again," and then she made the observation I have mentioned—I believe the two Bowers to be man and wife—I saw one of the witnesses to the marriage, and I have got the certi<lb></lb>ficate here.</p>

                  </hi>. These articles are all used in making counterfeit coin—here is a perfect mould for sixpences of 1831—these sixpences are all counterfeit, and all made from this mould—here is a pipkin to melt the metal in, and plaster of Paris, and a glass—spoons are melted when they cannot get pewter pots—this file is to remove any imperfections where the get is broken off, and here is sand for scouring them—this wire and plate are used as a battery—the mould for shillings has been used, and a mould for sixpences was thrown into the fire, so they must have been working.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Samuel Bower's Defence.</hi> I was in my room with my wife, and the young man in the adjoining room called out, "Samuel, do you mind coming in and having some tea with us?" I went in, and my wife followed me, leaving our room door open. Having my coat and cap on, I took them off and threw them on the bed, and took a seat at the table, where the things were set for tea. The young man who was with Salter went down stairs, saying he must go to a shop and pay what he owed. Hearing somebody come up, I went to open the door, thinking it was him, and the officers came in upon me. I am innocent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Salter's Defence.</hi> On Friday morning, about 11 o'clock, the young man brought up his things and commenced making; he continued till Monday afternoon, when he said that he was going down stairs to get half a gallon of beer, and pay a debt that he owed, and he appears to have given Mr. Brannan information that it was us. The things were found in my room, but I am not guilty of making them.</p>

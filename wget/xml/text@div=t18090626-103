            , esq. to be left at the coach office Lynn, with a ticket attached to it of the charge of five shillings and eight-pence; that is carriage five shillings and two-pence, and porterage six-pence; and the direction says</p>
               <p>"by the Newcastle coach, to the Angel Inn, St. Martins-le-grand, London". This was brought to me by Satchell; I paid Satchell the five shillings and eight-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the way in which parcels are brought to you daily - A. It is the usual custom of business, where parcels go through London, to pay the carriage of the coach that comes to London; then we charge the parcel in the country that carriage and our carriage. As soon as Satchell had left the office, I opened the parcel, and found nothing else than two sheets of brown paper covered with cartridge paper; as soon as I found the parcel contained nothing but two sheets of brown paper, I sent my porter up the yard to bring Satchell back, he did so. On Satchell's return, he laid the five shillings and eight-pence down; I said you are a pretty fellow, Satchell put the money in his pocket again by my desire. I sent for Sapwell the constable. Satchell, and Sapwell, and I, went to the Magpie, in Newgate-street. I went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you wait before you saw the defendant - A. I waited I suppose twenty minutes, and then I left Satchell and Sapwell; having to go to Somerset-house upon some business, I left the Magpie about one o'clock, and returned about two o'clock. Wade then was there in company with Satchell and Sapwell; the moment I came in, Sapwell desired me to call a coach, and take the defendant before the lord mayor; I took a coach and took the defendant before the lord mayor. Sapwell informed me on my return, that Satchell had paid the five shillings and eight-pence into the hands of

               <p>Q. What passed when Wade gave it to you - A. He said he had got a couple of parcels, he said take them one for the Gloucester and the other for Lynn; I took them. I had known him three years.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you to do with the money - A. He was to meet me at the same house at twelve o'clock, to receive the money; I asked him where I should see him to give him the money. He was to meet me at the Magpie at twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were you to receive any money for these two parcels, or either of them - A. Yes; five shillings and eight pence, I think; I am sure of five shillings and eight pence for the Lynn. I carried the parcel for Lynn, first to the Bull; I delivered the parcel and received the five shillings and eight pence; I came out of the office, the bookkeeper sent a porter after me to call me back again, I came back, I laid the five shillings and eight pence on the bookkeeper's desk; on the gentlemen saying this is all I have got for my five shillings and eight-pence, he shewing me the parcel. I saw it contained two sheets of brown paper with cartridge paper. I then told him who I had it of, and where I was to meet the person I had it off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then did Sapwell and the bookkeeper go with you to the Magpie - A. Yes. We waited at the Magpie some time, Wade did not come in, we had information that he was at Warwick-lane, we went to Warwick-lane, and there we met him; Mr. Sapwell was on one side of the way and I on the other; I said to him, John, here is your money; I gave him five shillings and eight-pence for the Lynn parcel; he said where is the other, I said you must ask that man for it, pointing to Mr. Sapwell. Mr. Sapwell took the money from him, Mr. Sapwell then took him; he has the other parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he gave you the parcel and you took it, did you believe it to be a parcel going to a gentleman, or did you know it to be those two pieces of paper - A. I knew no more of it than a child unborn. I thought it to be a regular parcel; I knew where he did live, and I had known him three years.</p>

I went there and found Satchell, I went with him to the Magpie in Newgate-street, and afterwards into Warwick-lane; I saw Satchell go up to Wade, I was on one side of the way and he on the other; Satchell spoke to Wade, and gave him this paper into his hand; this paper contains the five shilling and eight-pence. I took Wade by the hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see whether Wade gave him any thing - A. He did not. I came up immediately upon seeing that, and I took the five shillings and eight-pence out of his hand; I asked Wade if he had sent this man to the Bull inn with a parcel, he said he had. I took him in custody; I took him to the Magpie, and from there to the Mansion house. This money has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Satchell give you the other parcel that was to go to Gloucester - A. He did.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 236). On 17th April, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in High-street, Pimlico—I saw Ann Maloney go to the prosecutrix's house, No. 22, and she received a bundle from a female—I followed her, and asked where she had got that bundle—she said she had it from Sloane-street—I asked what it contained—she said some pieces of bread—I felt a piece of soap in it, and not feeling satisfied took her to the station—I there found it contained bread, meat, two eggs, a teacup, and some butter, some dripping, a teacloth, a pinafore, and some soda and soap—I left her ut the station, and returned to the prosecutrix's house, and, in consequence of what 1 stated, the prosecutrix gave Maria Maloney in charge—I told her what she was charged with—she said it was a bad job, and it was the first time—on the way to the station, she asked me</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside at 22, High-street, Pimlico. Maria Maloney was my cook, and had heen so from 6th Feb.—this cloth is the only thing that I know—Maria Maloney had charge of such things as were in this bundle—she had full charge of everything—I had articles of this description in my house—I know this cup; it is an old-fashioned china cup—I have others like it—I had never given authority to Maria to give away broken meat out of my house—I had no other woman-servant, but a little girl fourteen years old—the meat in this bundle was cold boiled beef, and a new loaf the prisoner had cut in two—her wages were 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>

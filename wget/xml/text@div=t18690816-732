                  </hi>. I was in business last year at 30, Hatton Garden, as a French importer and commission agent—in November, 1868, I engaged the prisoner as my traveller, at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week and 2 1/2 per cent commission on the orders he obtained—ho sent in large orders in January, February, and in March, upon which I sent out goods—I had an acceptance falling due on 15th or 18th March, of Messrs. Ay re and Half—the prisoner told me it could not be met, and I was obliged to send the amount myself—the prisoner said, "I have some friends who will oblige me with their signa<lb></lb>ture and a few days afterwards I wrote to him and said that I would make use of them—no name was mentioned—I received from him two</p>

               <p>pieces of paper, which I' signed, but they were so badly drawn that I cancelled them and returned them to the prisoner—I afterwards received these two bills of exchange (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), they are in my writing; they came to me accepted by John Strood and A. Richardson—I had sent them down to him because the others were badly drawn—I had such a customer as Mr. Richardson, of "The Mount, Northampton"—the amount of his account was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I discounted Richardson's bill with Mr. White—I saw the prisoner before I discounted it, and had a conversation with him as to whether Mr. Richardson was likely to buy more goods—I said to the prisoner that as there was a little account between me and Mr. Richardson we might settle it—he said, "It is no use going, Mr. Richardson is in London, and had supper with me at my house last night"—he further said that we might take the little account as balance; in fact, to make him a present of the amount—I was not aware that Richardson had paid the money—I first knew that there was a doubt about Richardson's bill when I had a visit from Mr. Tenpenny—on the Monday after 6th May I had not seen Mr. Richardson up to that time—when the bills were due I communi<lb></lb>cated with Mr. Watts.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 114, (Goldsmith's Row, Hackney Road—I know Philip Payne well; but I do not know what he is—I have seen him in the prisoner's company, and his brother, Joseph Payne, at the Anchor public-house, Goldsmith's Row—Joseph Payne had apparently accepted the bills for Chapman, and felt anxious to get them back—Chapman said that it would not matter, and produced two letters, and said that Payne was perfectly safe, because he was holding these letters, which he drew from his pocket book—he was all right because he had got these written documents from Mr. Nancy—they were handed to me to read—I read them, and should know them again, one in particular—I left them partly at loggerheads, which I presume they have been ever since—I had two other interviews with them; but that was the last—I have been present at perhaps fifty conversations between Payne and Chapman, because I lived next door; but only at three when the bills were referred to—there was only one meeting where they each met together and the bills were mentioned, and that was the one I have mentioned—Mr. Tenpenny was there—the subject of the conversation was that Joseph Payne accepted the bills for Chapman, and felt uneasy, and wanted them back again because they were forgeries—forgery was mentioned, and Chapman produced the letters, and said that he had got them all in the palm of his hand—I had been to Nancy with Mr. Tenpenny, a fortnight before—Chapman sent me</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Oldham's Gardens—in April last I repeatedly called on the prisoner—early in May he requested me to call on Nancy &amp; Co., with Corbett, as to some complaint Mr. Nancy had against him—I understood from the prisoner, at Northampton, that there had been a quarrel between them—after we came away we saw the prisoner, and told him that the prosecutor had said that if he came forward, and assisted him in the accounts, he would not proceed to prosecution—on the evening of that day I went to the prisoner, at his request, and found the two Paynes, the prisoner, and Mr. Corbett in a room; and after some dis<lb></lb>putes between them, the question of the bilk of exchange came up, and the prisoner said that he did not care about Nancy, he had him sufficiently in his power—referring to some bills of exchange which he had furnished to him—shortly after that the younger Payne came to me, and took me with him to the prisoner and the elder Payne, who said that he had accepted the two bills in the prisoner's parlour, at the prisoner's request, and that they were forwarded to the prosecutor—Chapman heard that—Paynes said that the persons had no residences; but I explained to him that it was equally a forgery—we had some more conversation, and I came away—I am not sure whether the names of the acceptors were mentioned—there were three or four bills—Northampton was mentioned—the bills were sent up by the prisoner because they were written so badly; they—were to be written in better style by Payne, who told me, in the prisoner's presence, that he had signed them—other bills were sent for Payne to accept, which were accepted in the prisoner's parlour—I had other conver<lb></lb>stations with the prisoner, In my character of clerk to Mr. Hicks, which I consider were privileged communications, as an attorney.</p>

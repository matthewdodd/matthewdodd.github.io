            . The prisoner used to come in the morning about three months before the letter was sent - he said he knew I had given other boys money, and he would have some, or he would tell my father; I had seen him in Thomas's company - he said he must have a shilling, which I gave him; he had half a crown about the 26th of May, as he said he would tell my father if I did not give it to him; I got it from the cash-box up stairs - he did not see me take it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did you think of your own conduct at the time? A. I thought I was doing very wrong, but it was done through fear.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You said, "Will you have a shilling?" I said, "I will thank any body to give me one;" you went into the bar, brought one out, and gave me 1s. 6d. to buy you some ballads. Witness. No, I did not; he gave me a good many songs once - he gave me a seal once; he received from 25s. to 30s. in all - the seal is worth about 6d.; I never gave him money without his demanding it, and never employed him to bring me things in.</p>

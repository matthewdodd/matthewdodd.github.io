                  </hi>. I am a printer, of 6, Cross Keys Square—when this occurred I was living at Cotterell's Buildings, Bartholomew Close—on 5th July, between one and two in the morning, I was in Golden Lane with my friend George McDougal, and went into the prisoner's house to have a cup of tea or coffee—he met us in the passage; he keeps a lodging-house—he knocked me down, jumped on me, kicked me, and I became in sensible—when I came to myself I was lying in George Yard, about two houses off, and the policeman had come up—there was a light in the passage—there were others behind him, and my friend was behind me—I am posi<lb></lb>tive the prisoner is the man—I was taken to the station, where I was attended by a surgeon, and next morning I was taken before a Magistrate at Clerkenwell and charged with being drunk and incapable—I was dis<lb></lb>charged and sent to the hospital, and am still in the doctor's hands—I am sure I was not drunk, but I was slightly under the effects of drink—when I recovered I missed my purse and five or six shillings and my guard, but not my watch.</p>

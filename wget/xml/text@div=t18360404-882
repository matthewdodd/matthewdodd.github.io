                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and carry on business at No, 11, Taberna<lb></lb>ele-walk. Finsbury, Last Tuesday night, the 5th of April, between the hours of ten and eleven o'clock, I had been at Green which on business, and was going home—I was sober—I was going through Kent-street in the Borough, and two men came and pinioned me, one on each side—my two hands were kept down so that I could not help myself—I had a person named England in my company, who had walked all the way from Green wich with me—I never saw her before—my arms were pinioned by two men—there were three altogether; and while the others pinioned me, the third man, who was the prisoner, drew my watch from my pocket—I saw him do it, and saw him with it in his hand afterwards—I had not power to resist at the moment—it was taken by force—as soon as the two that held me let me go, I jumped forward, and seized the chain of my watch—the watch was then in the prisoner's hand—I attempted, as far as I could, to get posses<lb></lb>sion of the watch—when I was holding the chain in my hand, the prisoner struck me on the chest—I seized him with my left hand—he struggled to extricate himself, and get the watch; and he and I both fell in the kennel, and there we rolled both in the mud, before I could get at liberty, and get the watch from him—in the mean time the female called the police; but in the first instance when the prisoner drew the watch from my pocket. I cried out that I was robbed—while we were down rolling in the kennel, he stuck, me, and I struck him to extricate myself—I got up, and kept hold of the chain, and got the watch from him—the policeman came up—I told him I was robbed, and gave him the watch—the prisoner never got away—he was never out of my sight—the other two men ran away—I could not swear to them—they kept back, I could not see their faces.</p>

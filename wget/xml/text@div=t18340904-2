In July last, I was at Brentford, going home from hay-making - I was in company with the two prisoners at Brentford - it was about nine weeks ago - I never saw them before that night - this happened about three miles from Brentford - I do not know the time of day or night, or what month it was - I went into a public-house to get a pint of beer, and the prisoners were there - I do not know the sign of the house - it was in the evening, about six or seven o'clock - I was drinking with the prisoners for three quarters of an hour - I was then going with they to hay-making to a fresh place in the parish of Ealing - we went together about three miles, and then we all laid down together upon a cock of hay - I laid there about a quarter of an hour, then took up my basket, and away I went - the prisoners remained on the haycock a little while, and in about ten minutes they came after me - one caught hold of my mouth, and the other took out my purse, and away they ran.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep on your legs, or were you down? A. I was down - one of the men pushed me into the hedge - I cannot tell which of them - I was pushed into the hedge before the hand was put on my mouth - I was not struck by any body - they got hold of me, pushed me into the hedge, and one held my mouth fast - there was no ditch there - I cannot say who it was pushed me down - it was one of these men - I lost 18s. in a purse which was in my right hand breeches pocket - I do not know who took it - when the men got the purse, they ran away and left me - I had my purse in my pocket at the public-house, and took it out to pay for the beer, and opened it, so that the money might be seen - the prisoners were there when I paid for the beer - I paid one shilling for it - I was sober when I laid down on the cock of hay - I am sure the prisoners are the men who were with me on the haycock.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you sure it was either of the prisoners who pushed you on the hedge bank? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. As you say you are sure it was one of them, why cannot you tell us which it was- what time was it? A. About nine o'clock - it was not dark, it was dusk - these are the two men - I had only been drinking in one public-house that night - I had nothing but beer - I had no gin - I believe I had nothing but beer, but I cannot be sure - I had some gin before I went with them, but not at that place - I was only at one public-house with them - I had been to two public-house that night - I cannot tell how much gin I had at the first, I forget - I was no more drunk than I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not with a woman of the town, as well as drinking gin? A. Yes; but not along with they - before I came to the prisoners, I had been drinking gin with a woman of the town - I cannot tell how much I drank - I was with her for half an hour - I was not drinking gin all that time - I had some beer first, then had some gin, and then met these men - the woman drank beer and gin with me - I might have had a couple of glasses of gin, not three or four - I will not swear I had not four glasses of gin - I took my purse out to pay for the gin, and put it in again - there was nothing the matter with it till I met with these men - after meeting with them, we had three or four pots of beer- three or four drank of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to the public-house at Brentford, and met the men, did you go to any particular place, and was caught coming out? A. Yes, it was the King's Arms- I do not know the Drum.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not go to another public-house after leaving the King's Arms? A. Yes; when I met these men, I cannot say I did go to the Drum, and I will not swear I did not - the woman did not swear at me and say I had given her 1s. too little, nor ask me for more money - I gave her 1s. - before I met her I had about 20s. in my purse - I cannot tell justly - she did not require me with an oath to give her more money - after I left her, she came back to the public-house along with these men, and asked me to treat her to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you pay for drink? A. We were drinking all three together - I cannot tell justly what I paid for it - we went off to go to work together - I fell asleep in the King's Arms, public-house - I never minded whether the woman was in the room at that time - I cannot swear whether she was or not - I paid for nothing more after I awoke.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never took your purse out after you went to sleep? A. No; I have not seen my purse since that night - I drank about three pots of beer before I went to lie down on the haycock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then had you four pots at one public-house, and three at another, before you went to lay down on the haycock? A. I can take my oath I was as sober as I am now, when I laid down on the haycock with the men - I forget how much beer I had, and how much I paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever put your hand on your purse after you went to sleep in the public-house, till you went to lie down on the haycock? A. No; I had no occasion to feel for my purse after I went to sleep at the first public-house - these men paid for a pot of beer - I do not know about paying for any beer after I left the woman - I paid the shilling before I went to sleep.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you pay any money in the second public-house you went to? A. Yes; I paid for a pot or two of beer - that was in the public-house that I was in after I was with the woman - I did not pay any money away after I had been asleep, and was with the woman - I paid for a pot or two of beer at the second public-house, where I was with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did the woman go with you to the second public-house? A. No. After leaving her, and awaking from my sleep, I paid for some beer at the other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040005"></xptr>public-house, and took out my purse, but not at the house I was at with her.</p>

            . I am a publican, living at Brentford. On Wednesday, the 2nd of July, the prosecutor came into my house in company with the two prisoners - they called for a pot of beer, which I took in, and the prosecutor paid for it - they drank together - I gave him change out of a shilling - I do not remember what he took it from - the prisoners were sitting close to him at the time - they remained together while they drank the pot of beer - I saw them go away, all three together, about a quarter after seven, or between seven and eight o'clock - when they went from my house, they were all three quite sober - I did not see the prosecutor at all intoxicated - I am sure the prisoners are the men - I have seen them at my house often before, and they always behaved well there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the sign of your house? A. The Drum. I am certain it was not near nine o'clock when they left the house - my house is about a mile from Ealing - whether the prosecutor had a purse at my house, I know nothing about - no woman came with him - I have known the prisoners four or five months - I have only kept the house about ten months - I only know them by coming to my house for beer.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoners on Pinner Race-course, by the order of my sergeant, on the 10th of July. They were not both together, but both were taken on the course that day - I found eightpence-halfpenny on one, and a few buttons on the other - I took them from the course to the cage, and did not on the road tell them what it was for - they asked me, and when we got about a mile and a half off the course I told them I apprehended them for highway robbery - they said, "Oh, we are innocent of that, at any rate;" and one said, "So help me God, Tom, if I had met you on the course, I should have asked you to drink, for I am innocent of any thing of the kind."</p>

            . I saw the prisoners and prosecutor in Hanger-lane, near the high road, about a quarter before nine o'clock. I knew the prisoners very well before, and I am sure I saw them and the prosecutor together, walking along - nobody else was with them - they were going towards Hanger-lane, from Ealing, about a mile and a half from the Drum public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first hear you were to be brought here as a witness? A. When I went to Clerkenwell. The policeman told me I should have to go up when these men were tried - that was about six weeks ago - I went before the magistrate - he took my deposition - I went before the Grand Jury - I was not before the magistrate at Brentford, or any where else - the policeman found me at my house - another policeman told him I had seen them, and I had a subpoena - he gave me nothing with it.</p>

            . I know the prisoners and prosecutor. I saw them walking along, as I was going home, on the first Wednesday in July, about half-past eight o'clock - I saw them in Brentford-fields - there were no haycocks there - it was a ploughed field - they were going towards Ealing - I am sure they are the men - there was nobody with them- there were two men at the bottom of the field, earthing potatoes - they were about twenty yards off - the prisoners and prosecutor were walking on towards Ealing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When were you first asked about this? A. I was asked about it by the policeman about six weeks ago - I live at Brentford - Tame lives at Ealing, and so does the policeman - it was about three weeks after the occurrence - I have seen the prisoners before, but not the prosecutor.(The prisoners made no defence.)</p>

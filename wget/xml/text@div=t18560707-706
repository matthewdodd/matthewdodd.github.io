                  </hi>. I live in Hopkins-street, Golden-square, and am a tailor. On 6th July, about 3 o'clock, I met the prisoner in Church-lane, 8st Giles's; I went with him to a gin shop—I went afterwards and had some oysters—I came back to the same public house, and it was closed—he then took me up a small street, and put his arm round my neck, across my throat—it nearly cost me my life—I had not breath to call out; I tried, and could not—he pressed my throat violently—while he was holding me in that way, a man and a woman came up and took all my money—I had a sovereign in my trowsers' pocket, and two halfcrowns and a shilling—I had the money safe when I parted with my friends, before I saw the prisoner—I had taken my money out when I paid for the gin; I think the prisoner had seen it—the man and woman went off the prisoner let loose my throat, and came down the street—I could not see whether he walked or ran, my sight was bad by his strangling me—I lost sight of him—I got sight of him again—he was standing in an archway—I did not see how he got into the archway.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell the Magistrate, "The prisoner let me go, and walked away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might have said that—I could not say whether he walked or ran, I was so exhausted—I felt him let go—when I recovered I went down to the street—I think they call it Church-lane or George-street—I am a stranger in that neighbourhood—I am a native of Ireland, but I came from Manchester, and was living at No. 10, Hopkins-street—when I saw the prisoner again he was standing in a doorway, and another man with him—I called a constable, and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You went and had some gin; was it me who handed you the gin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I paid for it—I had a female with me—I came in con<lb></lb>tact with a girl—I had no words about who would have the money first—I paid for the gin—I did not go with the girl to a brothel; we went and sat on some steps in George-street—I told the girl to go back to the same place, and I would give her another glass of gin—she went away, and I sup<lb></lb>pose she told you to come to me—we went and had oysters, and returned to have another glass of gin, and the place was closed—it was about five minutes after you choked me that I gave you in custody—I did not find you in quite the same place where we had the gin—I should say it was twenty yards off higher up, towards Oxford-street—I was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, E</hi> 162). I was on duty in Church-lane at 3 o'clock last Sunday morning—the prosecutor gave the prisoner into my charge in a doorway—he said, in the prisoner's presence, that he put his</p>

               <p>arm round his neck and nearly choked him, and a man and woman came and robbed him at the same time—the prosecutor and prisoner were both sober—it was daylight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What part did you take me in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Walsh's-court Church-lane, thirty or forty yards from George-street—when the inspector asked the prosecutor what money he had, he said a sovereign, two half-crowns, and a sixpence, and the second time he said a sovereign, two half-crowns, and a shilling.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN TOOHEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make two statements about your money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made a mistake; I said it was a sixpence instead of a shil<lb></lb>ling—I thought I had changed the shilling, but I had coppers to pay for the oysters without changing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor was totally drunk when he came to me, and he had two glasses of gin afterwards; it is hardly likely that a man, after such a robbery, should go and stand close to him; he came to me and had some gin; he then went and had some oyters; he came back and said, "Which is the way to Well-street?" I directed him; he went away, and shortly after he returned and stood by the side of me for a few minutes, and the officer came and he gave me into custody; except that I served him with the gin, I never was in his company.</p>

I am an ironmonger—I have a warehouse at 6, Fuller-street, Bethnal-green—on the morning of 18th November, my attention was called to the warehouse having been broken into, and twenty boxes of tin missing—I should say the boxes produced are mine—there is no private mark upon them—the marks correspond with those I lost—we only missed eleven boxes at first; we afterwards missed nine from another pile—the boxes have not been opened—there are 112 sheets of tin in each box—the weight is 1 cwt. and 1 qr.—they are perfectly new—on discovering my loss, I sent my foreman to inform the police, and sent a shopman round to some of the dealers and consumer—I myself went down to the prisoner's, he sting a neighbour of mine—he is a tin-plate worker, and employs men to work under him—he works up such plates as these—I told him I had come to inform him that my warehouse had been broken open in the night, and that I had lost eleven boxes of tin-plate, Llandore, 20 by 14, one cross—I told him I thought it was very likely he might have them offered to him for sale, and asked if they were offered to him, whether he would gain all the information he could respeeting them, and let me know—he said he would—this was about 9 o'clock—he did not say a word to me about having received any tin-plate of any kind—in consequence of information, I went again the same afternoon, About 4 o'clock, with the constable Deeble—I waited outside while Deeble went in—after he had been in about ten minutes, he came to the door and beckoned to me to come to him—he told me to fetch Inspector Broad—I went and fetched him—Broad went in and left me outside—in about ten minutes Deeble brought the prisoner out and I went into the house—Broad got some tin-plates out of a hole, and asked if they were my property—I said, "No, they are not the size"—he then got some out of a corner of the shop, and said, "Are these yours?"—I said, "These are the size and sort; I cannot swear they are my property"—he said, "But Mr. Quail says they are yours"—Quail was not there then—I saw some there which resembled mine—they afterwards took me into a back warehouse, and there I saw ten boxes, two of which are here—they were standing in the warehouse with the marks turned to the wall—this is one of the sheets of tin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—each box cost me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the White Horse, Poplar. On the morning of 29th Dec., about eleven o'clock, I heard my barman call out—there was a dispute between him and the prisoner—he told me, in the prisoner's presence, that the prisoner had a glass of rum, which he called for, and was going away without paying for it—I said, "Never mind, come in, and I will speak to him"—he was standing on the threshold of the door—I said, "Come, my man, you must pay for this glass of rum before you go?"—I put my hand on his shoulder, took him by the collar, and said, "You must not play any tricks here, mine is a respectable house"—he wanted to make off—I said, "No, you can't go till you pay for it"—he being a taller man than me, I did not use any rash language, as I thought I might get a blow on my head—I got hold of his collar, and heard my daughter call out, "Oh, God, father, he has a sword in his hand!"—the moment the word "sword" was out of her mouth, I felt a wound on my thing—I drew back as quick as possible, and then saw the dagger—I looked for a poker to defend myself—there was none there—I found a small child's chair in the bar-parlour—I took it up, met the</p>

               <p>prisoner as he was coming at me, and thrust it in his face—my barman, running from the bar at the same time, took the sword from him, with a great deal of struggling—I said, "For God's sake, break it in two!"—he did so—it was the handle and sword-part of a sword-stick—I am quite sure I offered him no serious violence till I felt the prick of the sword—there was a little blood issuing from the wound—it was a very serious one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Hodges's barman. The prisoner came there on the morning of the 29th, and called for twopenny-worth of rum, and half a pint of beer—a man came in just after him—I am quite sure the prisoner ordered it—a lad, who was assisting in the bar, drew the rum, and gave it to the prisoner—he drank out of his beer, and the other man drank of the rum, and went straight out—the prisoner staid there, finished drinking his beer, and I asked him for the money—he walked towards the door a little way, then turned round, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> down a penny—that was sufficient to pay for the beer without the rum—(the other man did not order anything—the prisoner asked him what he would take)—I ran round the bar, stopped him, and said, "You must not go without paying for the rum"—he went close up to the door—the lad who was assisting went and asked him for the money—he put his hand in his pocket, pretending to pull out some money, and then went outside the door—my master came down, and the boy said the man had had twopenny-worth of rum, and half a pint of beer, and had not paid for it—master tapped him on the shoulder, and said, "Come in, old fellow, you must not go without paying for the rum as well as the beer"—he came inside, and said something to the effect that he did not intend to pay—he was standing up in the corner, and all the time my master was looking at him he was drawing this instrument steadily out—I believe my master had caught him by the collar, and said, "You shall not go until you have paid"—he attempted to go, and when he found my master would not let him, he drew this instrument out, threw the stick down in the corner, then pulled it up as high as he could, made a thrust forward, and pricked Mr. Hodges in the thigh—I took it from him, and broke it—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

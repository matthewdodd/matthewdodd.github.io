I missed six bundles of calf-skins from a gateway there—I had landed them on 28th Oct.—there was this tally with them; I swear to it—the prisoner had been employed on the quay, but not lately—I had seen him there several days, and ordered him away—I believe this to be one of the bundles of skins—they were in the care of Joseph Barber.</p>

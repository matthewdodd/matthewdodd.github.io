That he heard the Deceased say, G - Damn ye, Wilson, I won't be affronted: By G - I'll lose my Life first. My Dear Tothill, (says the Prisoner) sure you are but in Jest. No, G - D - ye, an't, reply'd the Deceased. Well but, says the other, let us drink our Punch out before we quarrel. - Come - to your Health! - Do you drink it with all your Heart? says Tothill. Yes, return'd the Prisoner. Why then, says the Deceased, here's to your Health. When they had emptied the Bowl, he (this Evidence) lighted them into Castle-street, and by the Way he heard the Deceased say to the Prisoner, G - D - ye, what did you affront me so for?

He snew'd them up Stairs; they call'd for New Sherry; he carry'd it: They drank a Boat apiece, and he withdrew. In about five Minutes after, the Prisoner came to the Stairs-Head, and call'd him up again. The Deceased was then lying on the Floor, to whom the Prisoner said, Tothill, was not you the Aggressor? But he made no Answer at that time. A Surgeon was sent for, at whole coming in the Deceased said to the Prisoner, Next time I'll fight you with Pistols.

            , the Tavern Boy, deposed, that going to kindle a Fire in the Room where those two Gentlemen were, the Deceased kick'd him out, and told him they did not want any Fire. He was afterwards sent for a Surgeon, and when he came back he heard the Deceased say, I was the Aggressor; I drew first; and if I die, 'tis my own Fault. Mr. Wilky the Surgeon depos'd, that about 11 at Night, he was call'd to the Deceased, whom he found on the Floor, and the Prisoner supporting him in his Arms. After the Deceased was dress'd, he said, I desire you would all take Notice; I was the Aggressor; I drew first, and it is my own Fault. The Constable offering to take hold of the Prisoner, the Deceased rose up, and made a Pass at the Constable with his Sword. The Wound that the Deceased had then received was mortal, and he died in about twenty Hours after. Mr. Larouche in Round-Court, with whom the Deceased lodged, depos'd, that about Midnight the Deceased was brought home in a Chair, very drunk, and dangerously wounded. The next day in the Afternoon, he asked him if he and the Prisoner were sober when they went to the Tavern together? No, said the Deceased, but we were sober when we first met at the Coffee-house; - We went from thence to the Tavern on purpose to fight; - I believe we were both in Fault; - I believe I drew first.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his Defence said, that when they came from the Coffee-house, the Deceased desired him to go to the Three Tuns, where he said he had appointed to meet a Gentleman. He went with him; but finding nobody there, he drank once, and was for going away; but the Deceased drew upon him, and bid him go to Hell. He retreated, and in so doing stumbled over some Faggots that lay in the Room. The Deceased follow'd him, and put him under a Necessity of using his Sword in his own Defence. Mr. Hains depos'd, that he was in Company with Brigadier Wilson (the Prisoner) in an open Room at Sturges's Coffee-house, where they had a Pint of Rum made into Punch. When they had drank it, they came down Stair, and were going out together: But the Deceased, who sate below, call'd out, Mr. Wilson, come and drink with me; pray stay and drink with me; and repeating his Entreaties several times, the Prisoner at last went to him. They then appear'd to be very good Friends, and to this Evidence left them. He farther depos'd, that he had known the Prisoner five Years, and always found him good-natur'd and peaceable even in his Drink, and so far from being quarrelsome himself, that he was remarkably diligent in reconciling Differences among others. Mr. Thornton the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172502240004"></xptr> Apothecary depos'd, that being sent for to the Deceased about 11 at Night, he heard him say, Die or Live, 'tis my own Fault; I drew first and forced him to it: The Brigadier drew in his own Defence and therefore I desire you all to take Notice of what I have said. This was wrote down, and read over to the Deceased he said it was right, and pray'd all that were present to sign it; which they did, and he acknowledg'd the same the next Day: It was produced in Court, and confirmed by the Subscribers. Major Wright, Capt. Batson, Capt Moreton, and Capt. Parker, gave the Prisoner the Character of a Man of an even Temper, never known to be passionate; and that contary-wise, the Deceased was very apt to be quarrelsome in his Drink. Many others were ready to appear in his Favour; but the Court thought it needless. The Jury found it <rs id="t17250224-23-verdict126" type="verdictDescription">

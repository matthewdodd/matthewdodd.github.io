               <p>Did you feel him do it? - Yes, my lord; my watch hung to my pocket; the hook hung to the top of my pocket, and the watch was in the inside of my pocket; he then ran up Abchurch-lane, I put my hand to my side, and called out stop thief, he was taken immediately; the gentleman is in court that picked up the watch, he threw it out of his hand, I did not see him drop it, nor the gentleman pick it up; I came up soon after.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>I understand it was done all in a hurry, he put his hand round your neck, and snatched the watch immediately? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I live housekeeper with Mr. Blackburn, surveyor and architect in St. Olave's Church-yard.</p>
               <p>This watch was within your pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nobody could see it? - No.</p>
               <p>I suppose he asked you to drink a glass of wine? - I do not recollect he did.</p>
               <p>But you walked peaceably together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>He did not mistake you for another person? - I believe not; he did not behave any thing amiss.</p>
               <p>No rudeness at all? - Only going to salute me.</p>
               <p>That was not very rude you know; and so then, without any other conversation, or any thing particular, all at once he seized this watch from you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did he know you had a watch there? I found his hand at my side.</p>
               <p>What, tickling of you? - I cried out as soon as he snatched my watch.</p>
               <p>Did not you make a stop, and let him go on? - It was just about the time I bid him go about his business.</p>
               <p>There was no rudeness, nor no struggling, nor no kissing before? - No, Sir; only he wanted to salute me.</p>
               <p>These men that stopped him, were they following on or meeting yot? - I do not know; they both live in the Borough, I did not know them then.</p>
               <p>You knew them immediately, did not you? - I did not know them before.</p>
               <p>Was the watch fastened by a new string? - Not very new; an old string,</p>
               <p>Perhaps it was broke? - Not till it was snatched from my side.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is it a new string or an old one, it is a very material point in this case?</p>
               <p>Court. It is a very old one, and very much worn.</p>

               <p>Did it appear to you as if he was endeavouring to take any thing from your pocket, or as if it was a piece of indecent familiarity? - I thought he was going to put his hand in my pocket, to take something.</p>
               <p>What reason had you from his former behaviour or appearance, to suppose that he meant to take something out of your pocket? I thought his hand being in my pocket, he meant to take something out.</p>
               <p>Court. He put his hand round you to kiss you at the same time? - Yes, my Lord.</p>

               <p>On Sunday evening, about eight, I was coming along Cannon-street, at the corner of Abchurch-lane, I was going on from London stone side, I was going to London bridge, this Mrs. Battell and the prisoner at the bar were standing at the corner, when I came up they were pretty close together.</p>
               <p>Jury. You are sure of their standing still, were they in conversation, or what? - I had not time to observe; before I got across the street, I saw the prisoner running up the lane, I saw Mrs. Battell feeling at her side, and she cried stop thief, he has stole my watch; I ran directly after him up the lane, and before I came within two yards of him, he threw the watch away with his left hand, I saw him do it, I am sure of it, it was a moon-light night; I immediately secured him, I took hold of his left collar, and another gentleman came up, and secured him at the right collar; I picked-up the watch, it was on the left hand side of the street, I desired the other gentleman to take care of it and of him; about ten minutes the prosecutrix came up, there was a croud round, so that I did not perceive her before; the body of the watch was one way, and the case flew on the flag stones; the prisoner begged not to be used ill, we took him to the Compter; he said he did not take the watch, it might stick to him, he could not help it; I saw him actually throw the watch away; I never saw the prosecutrix before.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>I live in the Borough, I am shopman to a haberdasher; I knew her the next day to be the same person that lost the watch, did not know her before; (produces the watch) the watch was not broke.</p>
               <p>Court. The watch has had more falls than one.</p>
               <p>This young woman did not come up for ten minutes, it is not ten minutes walk, is it? - Just as people can walk.</p>
               <p>You may be a very pert servant, but you are a very bad witness, be a little decent; I do you mean to say she was ten minutes before she came up? - She had her pattens on, I do not know the other witness, I perceived no struggling between them, they were talking.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher at Dockhead, I never saw the prosecutrix nor the last witness before; I was coming along Cannon-street, opposite Abchurch-lane, I saw the prisoner come round her, breast to breast, I thought he wanted to salute her; when I first observed them, they were on the turn, near the corner, I was on the other side, he was some length of time about what I thought he was doing; I saw his body agitated greatly, and move several times, that made me take particular notice of him; I made a full stop, and looked at them, I thought they seemed to be rather familiar, I observed a twisting of their bodies; I suppose they might remain so a minute, I did not hear a word said by either of them; he quitted her, and ran up Abchurch-lane, I observed her then put her hand to her right side, and she said stop thief, I have lost my watch; I ran after him, and caught him more than half way up; just as I was going to lay hold of him I saw the watch falling, it seemed as if it came from his left side, and to be thrown rather than to fall, I did not take any particular motion of his hand, I was too nigh for that; I did not see Roberts pick up the watch, I held the prisoner the while, I think he said he did not rob her; Mrs. Battell came up just as the watch was picked up.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090067"></xptr>Jury. How came it, as the prisoner is a pretty stout man, that you ran faster than him, did any thing impede him in his running? - I do not know, I ran faster than him, and I can run faster than you, he had a great coat on, perhaps that might impede him.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Suppose this watch stuck to any part of him, he moved his arms you know when he run, a man does not run with his arms in his pocket, therefore it might have gone off in an a slant direction; you do not mean to say that you saw him throw it? - No, sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>Whether it was brushed off by his cloaths, or stuck to his arm, it would have followed that direction? - It might so.</p>
               <p>It must you know? -</p>
               <p>Court. You said that from what you saw, when you first saw them together; the idea that you formed at that time, was, that they were familiar together? - I thought so, then, but as soon as he left her, I gave up my former suspicion immediately, then I thought what it was.</p>
               <p>Jury. The bruises on the inside and outside cases answer?</p>
               <p>Court. Nearly; one does, and another does not; that would be very likely to happen when the case fell off.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Battle called, proves the watch, is positive it is her's; it has been in her father's family almost a hundred years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I am innocent of the affair, I leave it entirely to my counsel.</p>

On the 31st of December the prisoner came to my billiard-rooms at nearly twelve o'clock at night—he followed a gentleman in who was in the habit of fre<lb></lb>quenting my rooms—I do not know whether he came in his company—he followed him in at the same time, into the private room—he played at cards, and continued playing till about three in the morning—I believe he was a loser—he was at one time a winner, and after that he continued to lose—Isaw him produce what appeared to be country bank-notes—other persons were playing in the room at the same time, but I did not see any other person produce any country bank-notes—in the course of the even<lb></lb>ing I supplied the prisoner with 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., part in gold, part in Bank of England notes, and part in his own country notes that I had received—I had re<lb></lb>ceived them at the table in the course of the play—they had passed from hand to hand round the table—I was playing with the rest—none of the country notes had been received before the prisoner came in—I am positive of that—I had seen about nine or ten country bank notes produced by the prisoner, and paid away in playing—when I lent him the 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he gave me an "I O U," and gave me his address at Wright's hotel in the Strand—Idid not lend it him all at once, but in different portions—he continued to play—I am not positive whether he won or lost after that—I should say he lost—I cannot say—I continued to play after he left—after he had left I cashed, I think, nine 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. country bank notes for a gentleman who had been playing'with the prisoner—I kept them until the next morning, and then gave to my wife five of them, which were payable in the City, for the purpose of getting them cashed—in consequence of a letter, which I received between eleven and twelve that same day, I went into the City, to Messrs. Glynn and Halifax, the bankers, and was by them referred to Messrs. Bush and Masters, the attorneys, where I found my wife had been detained—I did not know of her being detained till I got there—in the evening of that day I received the letter now produced—it was brought by a waiter or porter from Fricour's hotel, in St. Martin's-lane—I then went with Forrester, the officer, to Fricour's hotel, found the prisoner there, and he was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Addressed to "Mr. Cook."</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir,—I am this morning distracted; nor do I wonder at it, after the transaction that occurred last night; for I know the figure I must cut in your eyes, and I upbraid myself for a want of courage to meet you, from inability to take up the notes before I left London; and the reason is, I was yesterday induced to make several purchases, and pay two or three accounts that I was not called on to pay for the present. I have been thinking that I might be able to raise or borrow the money in London, but on further consideration, I find it is impossible; but what I propose to do is, to give you my bill, at thirty-one days, for the entire amount of what I lost last night, and you may rely on its being regularly met when at matu<lb></lb>rity. I got the notes from an old school-fellow, in payment of a bet he lost to me at a race in Ireland; and I was yesterday congratulating myself on my good fortune in having met him; but how soon our joy is often turned to sorrow! When I reached my lodging after I left you, to my sur<lb></lb>prise, I got his letter, cautioning me against using the notes; and he says they are not forgeries, as they are not signed in the name of the managers, nor do they bear dates or numbers of the notes of any similar amount, but that they are the first proofs of the engraver's plates before delivery to the banks. How this is I cannot pretend to say. I can get the money the instant I reach Ireland, but not sooner, as my writing home would alarm my friends, and prevent their remitting it to me. My address is,' Castle-grove,</p>

               <p>County Louth.' Please give the bearer a written answer to this, as I do not wish him to know any thing of the transaction. Should this pro<lb></lb>posal meet your approbation, I will give you my bill to-night, as I am anxious to go home to-morrow. I remain, dear Sir, in haste, your obe<lb></lb>dient servant,"<hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD MOORE</hi>."</p>
               <p>"P.S. Before I conclude, I must say, that your liberality or kindness to me cannot fail to act but as the strongest incentive to every thing that is fair and honourable. I was staying at Wright's Hotel, but have since left it. However, that is my address."<hi rend="largeCaps">R. M</hi>."</p>
               <p>"Let me know the amount of notes I lost. I think it is 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which, with the 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I lost to you, would make 98<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all."</p>

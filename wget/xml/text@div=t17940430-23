I followed him down stairs, and I heard him force the bolt of the bar window, and shove it up, and I heard him open the till, and heard him put his hand in and take some halfpence; and I heard the halfpence rattle as he put them in his pocket, and he went to do it a second time, and I went and opened a door and catched him, he was not in the bar, he was outside with the window up; I saw him take the halfpence out of the till and put them into his coat pocket, a shortish coat he had on. I told him I had catched him at it, and he never answered me, he came into the tap room, and I called my husband, and before my husband came down stairs he went out of the street door and pulled the door after him, and he went on the parade, and my husband went to him. He took a bottle of rum out of the bar, and a glass, and an ale pint, and put it down on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the till? - Yes, it was wide open, and some halfpence gone. There were a quantity of halfpence in it, I did not count what was left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Foundling Hospital, in the parish of St. Pancras, Middlesex. On the 21st of December the prisoner came to my office, which is at the Hospital, in Guildford-street, and brought me a letter, which I produce—he put it into my hand—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To M. Lievesley, Esq., Foundling Hospital, London.—Ashley-park, Surrey, Dec. 21st, 1841.—Sir, I have been made acquainted with the rules and particulars relating to the Foundling Hospital. It is my intention, with Lady Fletcher, and also the wish of my daughters, Misses Jane and Harriet, to subscribe the sum of two guineas per annum towards the support of this deserving asylum. Having occasion to send my steward to London, I have directed him to wait on you, who will pay you the amount of eight guineas, and receive the receipt.—<hi rend="smallCaps">H. W. FLETCHER</hi>.—"On the back of this letter was an order as follows:—"Messrs. Robarts and Co., Pay M. Lievesley, Esq. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—<hi rend="smallCaps">H. W. FLETCHER</hi>."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> After reading the letter, I asked the prisoner whether Sir H. Fletcher was a Cumberland man, having known him formerly—he said, "Oh, no; you are mistaken, it is Sir H. W. Fletcher, of Ashley-park, Surrey"—I asked his name—he said, "Faulkener," and I believe he said he was his steward—I asked him in what way the Foundling Hospital was brought to the notice of Sir H. Fletcher—he said the Mangles' family, and I think he said Lord Lilford had dined with him the preceding week, and the conversation turned on the Foundling—I gave him some papers re<lb></lb>specting the charity, and a letter of acknowledgment, with a receipt—he was then about going out of the room, and said, "There is a balance"—I had forgotton the cheque being for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the corporate</p>

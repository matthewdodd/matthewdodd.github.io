            . I am a beadle - on the 25th of January, I followed the prisoner from Mr. Franks, to a coffee-roaster's in Thames-street, with the bag - he came out again with a smaller bag on his shoulder, which he carried to Mr. Lys's shop, a hair-dresser in Cousin-lane - he left the bag in the shop, and went away - I did not stop him, but went into the shop, and got the bag, which has 37lbs of coffee in it.</p>

            . I live in Cousin-lane - I have known the prisoner two years - on the 25th of January he came to my shop and brought this bag - I did not know what it contained, but he desired me to let him leave it till John called for it - he did not give any reason for leaving it - I live nearly a quarter of a mile from Thames-street - the officer came in and asked for the bag - I said, if he would give his name and address, he should have it - he took the same bag away which the prisoner left.</p>
               <p>MR. FRANKS. We have such bags as this small bag - the bulk of the coffee was the same as this in this bag - the prisoner had before been a very steady youth - I believe he has been the dupe of our carman.</p>

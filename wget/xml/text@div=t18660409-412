                  </hi>. My real name is Kochkowski—I am a commission agent, and have known the prisoner eight or ten years—I saw him five years ago—he came to me four weeks before Christmas—I have received a letter from, and I wrote him a letter, after which he came—this is the note I received by post—I learned from him that he had sent it—I said, "You say in your letter you have some great business with me, I wish to know what business it is"—(<hi rend="italic">Translating</hi>"Dear Brother—I have very important business with you; be so kind as to let me know which day; I am engaged till 8 o'clock in the evening, therefore, perhaps, it may be convenient for you to appoint a time. My best wishes—Yours, Vincent Jankowski."—I wrote him an answer—he is a Pole, as I am—it was at my house, 79, St. Paul's-road, he came to see me—I asked him what business he had for me?—he said, "Well, you will think it very strange I have come to you on such a business as this, but at the same time it is nothing serious"—I asked him what business he had with me—after a short time he told me he had some Polish bonds and Russian bank-notes to dispose of—I said, "What are they?"—he said they were siezed at the Polish rebellion—I asked him what the price would be for them—he said, "Well, it is no use to say anything until I bring you a sample," and promised to call in three days with it—after three days he came to my house and showed me six 25-rouble notes,</p>

               <p>and gave them me as a sample—I said, "I cannot say anything until I make inquiries what they are"—I told him to call in two days, and I would let him know—I asked him the price of the Russian notes—he said, "8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece,"—he left them with me—a rouble is about half-a-crown, or.2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in English money—I made inquiries—he came to me again, and I told him they were not genuine—I said, "Have you heard of the last affair which happened lately?" because this was on the 18th, when some people were convicted here—I had the papers in my hand—I said, "It is a dangerous thing"—he said, "No matter; it is no sin with the Russian Government, because they have robbed and killed their countrymen, besides, I am getting old, and have a large family to support, and you can make a nice little money and start in business"—after more persuasion I said I would see what I could do.</p>

               <p>now, but I will call at your place in the evening,"—he said he would bring me the notes in the evening, or else he would walk up and down Lorrimer<lb></lb>square—that is close to my house—I went to meet Felsenhardt, and he told me he should not be able to take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, he would take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I went home, called at my place, and afterwards went to Lorrimer-square, and told the prisoner that the man was only going to take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—he pulled out a bundle of notes from his sleeve, and was going to count me out twenty-four for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "The man has no time, be quick! give me the notes and I will bring you back the money or the notes; there is no time to count, the man does not want to wait, he is in a hurry,"—as I was going along counting twenty-four I was arrested and taken to the station—I left the prisoner in Lorrimer square—I was arrested about 100 yards from Lorrimer-square—the prisoner was brought to the station about an hour and a half afterwards—when he came in he said in Polish, "For God's sake, I have some papers in my pocket"—Inspector Thompson asked me in English what I was saying to him—I said, "He has told me he has some papers in his pocket,"—the prisoner and I were put in cells next each other—we were near enough to enable us to talk—there are little holes and open<lb></lb>ings—I was in great distress, and he said, "Koche, we had better hang ourselves"—I said, "I won't do that; I have a family to bring up"—he said, "You had better say you received them from Felsenhardt,"—Felsenhardt had not been taken into custody then—I said, "I won't do that, because I have stated the truth already"—on the second occasion, we were in the cells again, he told me he was sure to get free, and if he came out he would provide for my wife and children, and after I came out, if I would be convicted, he would make me a well-off man—that was all that passed, but in goal he always cautioned me not to say anything, because I should spoil my name—in the yard, when walking round, he always made signs with his fingers not to say a word, but he said something in Polish—he can speak English—I have known him eight or ten years in this country.</p>

               <p>commission on them, but I did not get paid—I did not sell any for Mr. Zaba, but I brought him customers—he sold about 30, 000 roubles' worth of bonds—I then complained that I had not got my commission—I do not know whether these bonds came from Paris—I have been selling them, but am sure I do not know, I would tell everything if I did—no commission was agreed on between us as to what I was to get; but he said if he got half of the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which Zaba was going to give, he would pay me part of it—I did not know whether I was to get a fourth of the commission, but a part of the proceeds—it was not a commission on the sale—Zaba was to pay 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Commis<lb></lb>sion—he was to have half; I, a portion of his half—he did not show me any of these Polish bonds, because I did not care much for them—I knew they were unsaleable, but I was willing enough to deal in them with Mr. Zaba, because a man asked once for them—I mean to say that after the first inter<lb></lb>view they were not referred to till five or six days before my arrest, because when I had not got him any money he suggested these things—I did not see the bonds then—I gave two of the 6-rouble notes to Felsenhardt, and I had sent others home to Poland before—I was asked before the Magistrate who I sent them to—I declined to answer—I still decline to answer—I tried to sell the 120 that he gave me in two packets to different people—I do not think I am compelled to say who—if you wish to know I will tell you—I did not refuse to tell before.

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the statement was inadmissible, because, although it was not made by the prisoner, it affected him, and was obtained from Koche under a promise of advantage, and was therefore likely to be false</hi>.</p>

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Go on. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "I found a customer, and it was arranged that Jankowski should call at my house and bring notes—I had the customer in attendance, and went to my house and inquired if the prisoner had called—my wife said he had not—I then went to Lorrimer-square, where I saw Jankowski—I told him I had a customer close by, that he would only take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and not 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of notes—he said he had brought forty-six notes with him, and that I had better take the lot, as he did not like to have any about him—I took all he gave me, and went with them to Felsenhardt—Jankowski was to wait in Lorrimer-square until I came back with the money"—that is all—this was in Janhouski's presence—he made no remark—I do not think Koche said anything more as to whether it was true or not—he said, "That is all I know of the matter, and Jankowski was to give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for effecting the sale of those notes—Jankowski was present within a yard of him, but made no remark.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say, "I said this because I did not want any mistake to arise, nothing was said about repeating it, Koche said it was quite true, I was only to get 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for selling the papers for Jankowski," is that true, or is it false? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not false—if I did not say so before it might have been an omission of mine at the police-court—I omitted other matters there—if it is not in the depositions, it must have been omitted—Mr. Cotterell, the prisoner's</p>

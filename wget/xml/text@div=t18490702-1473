                  </hi>. I am the wife of Solomon Aarons, of Sloane-street, Chelsea—the prisoner was in my service, and was taken in custody last Saturday three weeks—she said she came from Captain Mowbray's, and I had her character from there, but I have since found she lived at another place between—her boxes were searched in a hurry, and nothing was found there—she was taken into custody, and they were searched again, and this silver toothpick of my husband's (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found wrapped up in paper—I know this snuff-box, by its peculiar make and by a dent—some cigan were missing, and a new servant was discharged on suspicion—I never sus-pected the prisoner—I said to her, "What do you think, Catherine has taken your master's snuff-box, as well as the cigars?—she said, "What a wicked person she must be, if I had taken anything of that kind 1 should be dis-covered immediately, I should tremble so"—it was kept in the same drawer with the cigars.</p>

On the 29th of October, in the evening, I had been to put my master's horse up and Graves called at the shop; my master was ill in bed at the time; in consequence of what Graves said, I gave him a bag of my master's, which I got out of the shop - I then went back for my jacket, and followed him to Mr. Freeman's stable, in Wells-mews, where Sir George Alderson keeps his horses, and Graves gave me the corn in the same bag which I had given him; it was then about half past seven o'clock in the evening - I did not see the corn but it appeared to be corn - there might be about three pecks; I took it home and put it into master's back kitchen - I saw no more of it - I had no conversation with my master about it.

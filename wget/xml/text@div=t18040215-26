               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there? - A. Yes; and another woman; they sat alongside of me, in the same box; I staid there about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any discourse with her? - A. We drank out the one pot of beer; she asked me what I had got in my pocket; there was another man there that called her sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she sit next to you? - A.She did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to ask what you had got in your pocket? - A. I cannot tell; one of the men said, can you give me change for a seven-shilling piece; I said I would if I had it; I looked at my money, and saw I had not silver enough; when I put the pot to my head to drink, I perceived her hand in my pocket; I turned round and seized her; I told her she had took my money away; then she knocked me down, and the other woman gave me a smack of the face, and before I got up they ran away; they had taken my feather out of my hat;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150021"></xptr>I ran after her, and with assistance I got her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before? - A. I have seen her once before, as I was coming that way from the barracks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I was quite sober; I had not drank above two pints the whole day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your handkerchief and money again? - A. No, I did not, nor my feather; I went back to the house to enquire if they had found the feather; these two men that were sitting with them threatened me, so I left the house; when I went up to the Office, she knocked me down before the Magistrate, for which he ordered her to go backwards.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman; the last witness met me at nine o'clock in the evening of the 25th; he told me he had been robbed; I took charge of the woman at the Maidenhead, Dyot-street, St. Giles's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I do not know any thing about the money; I was at the bar drinking a glass of gin, and saw this man and a woman quarrel with one another; that woman knocked this man down, and the woman went out, and this man went out after the woman, and as I was at the bar, he gave charge of me instead of the woman; he took me to the watch-house; I thought he would not come the next day; he went next morning to the Justice; he knocked me down, and said he lost his feather; I never knew any thing about the money or the man in my life.</p>

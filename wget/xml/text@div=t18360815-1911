                  </hi>. I am a hosier, and live in Wood-street, Cheap<lb></lb>side. We deal in stocks and a variety of other things—we make stocks—the prisoner came into our employ about the 7th or 9th of last April—he was warehouseman to attend to the manufacture of stocks—his wife was employed in making stocks—he had been in the trade before; there was a stipulation made that he was not to sell stocks, or do any business of that kind, except on my account—he had a few stock-grounds and about half a dozen stocks, I told him I would take them of him, which I did, and paid him for them—I have got the invoice that he made of them—I</p>

               <p>received some information from Mr. Prior last Thursday week—Mr. Prior has been a customer of mine, but he has not had any thing of me for some time—he requested me to call at his house as he had some goods—I called there the following morning, about nine o'clock and he brought up these four boxes of stocks—none of these have any mark of mine upon them—I believe they are mine—I have no doubt of it—the prisoner was taken into custody on the Monday morning—some of them are lined with buff—we had a special order from one house to make some lined with buff, and we made them—that is very uncommon colour to line them with.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear that he affected to sell you any thing but the materials? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, half a dozen stocks—this is the invoice of it—here charge of work done—I have been in his house—he was not in a consider<lb></lb>able line of business—I have known Mr. Prior about two years, and had a communication with him before he bought these—I requested Mr. Prior to ask the prisoner to abate 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, (because he had at first refused to take them at the price he left them at,) because the prisoner should not take them away again—he had asked a fair price—I did not have the prisoner asked to abate the price that he might appear the thief, but that I might secure the goods—there were about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth altogether Mr. Prior would have put 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into his pocket by the abatement—I had known brought me no connexion—we were not mutually dealing with eminent houses in the city—I deal with Leaf and Co., and so did he—that is an eminent house—I understood you to mean, did he deal with them while he was in my employ—I dealt with them before he came—I do not know that the prisoner ever dealt with Leaf, Smith, and Co., but I believe he did—I deal with J. P. and J. Neville, and I think perhaps the prisoner, did, before he came into our service—I believe he did—I deal with Rawson and Co., and he dealt there—by your question I understood you to mean that Mr. Bishop and I were connected together in dealings with these houses, something amounting to partnership—I deal with two or three other houses with which he dealt before he came to me, but which he cannot deal with now—there is Nevilles and Foster, Samur and Ball, and Morrison—I do with his wife several times since he was taken up—I mentioned to her that I had taken away some things from the house which I believed did not be<lb></lb>long to us—there was a gentleman, named Relf, present at the examina<lb></lb>tion, on my behalf—I believe he is here now—he was not subpœnaed by me—I did not think him of any service—I thought him a man of honesty and truth before the magistrate, and I think so still—we did not differ as to the value of these stocks—there was a part of the goods I thought he could identify, he being the manufacturer of the silk, and he could not—the time at which it was made, according to his account, did not differ from the time I stated by eight or nine months—by three or four—it would not be the slightest inconvenience to me if the prisoner was to set up in business—I should not care about it—my business increased after he came to me—he</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a hosier, and live near Finsbury-square. The prisoner proposed to sell me some stocks several times at different periods, when at Mr. Blenkiron's warehouse—he said he would sell me some odds and ends of his own that he had at home—I said I should buy them if I liked them—they were to be sent to my warehouse—he called last Thurs<lb></lb>day morning, and said the stocks would come in the course of the day, and these four boxes came—they are not what would be called odds and ends—that was the reason of my going to Mr. Blenkiron—I made a communi<lb></lb>cation to him—the prisoner had named a price at first—nine dozen, at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. five dozen, at 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and three dozen, at 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I thought them very cheap—I did not agree to buy them at once—I wanted to see if he would take any less, and in the mean time to see Mr. Blenkiron, conceiv<lb></lb>ing that, such a quantity could not be made out of odds and ends—after that, I saw the prisoner at Mr. Blenkiron's warehouse—he gave me an invoice, and said he should call for the balance—this is it—he said this would he the lowest price—I said "Very well"—nothing further passed about discount—the prices in the invoice are the same as he told me pre<lb></lb>viously—whilst</p>

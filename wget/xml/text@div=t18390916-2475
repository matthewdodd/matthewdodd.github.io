                  </hi>. I am a constable of the West India Docks. On the 22nd of August, Sanns Myers came to pass his luggage—he told me that was his name—the prisoner stood by—after the luggage was exam<lb></lb>ined, I heard Myers say he had lost 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said to the prisoner, "I suspect you"—I then asked him his name, and took it down in the pre<lb></lb>sence of the prisoner—the prisoner said, "I have not got it, you may search me"—I asked the prisoner how much money he had about him—he said three halfpence—I searched him, and on taking off his hat the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. dropped down on the ground—I asked how he accounted for that—he said he took it off the chest on board the <hi rend="italic">Jane,</hi> which was lying in Black Wall basin—Myers said it had been lying on the chest with his jacket over it.</p>

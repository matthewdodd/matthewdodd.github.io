            . I live in Lombard-street. The prisoner was in my service, for one week; on the 5th of September, at ten o'clock, I sent him with a cheque for 3l., to Martin and Stone's; he was to get the money for it; he never returned - I found him again on the 14th of September; he had been in the habit of coming to my house every morning, or of sleeping at my house; the cheque has been returned to me as paid.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the prisoner on the 14th of September - Mr. Abitbol was with me - I told him I took him for receiving the money for the cheque; he said he had received two sovereigns, and 20s. in silver, but had not any of it then; he said he was ashamed to come back, for a man had stopped him, whom he owed some money to, and he had paid it to him. The person he paid it to, he said was not in town; the clerk is not here who paid the cheque.</p>

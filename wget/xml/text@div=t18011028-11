             sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. Whitbread and Co. On Saturday, the 17th of October, the prisoner was employed in making a pipe good which communicates with the liquorback, and from the reservoir to the copper in the brewery; about twenty minutes before one, I went into the room where the prisoner was at work; he seemed to be very much flurried, and buttoning his jacket up in great haste; I asked him how he was going on in his business; he turned round towards me, and I saw that he was a little more reconciled; he answered, that he was going on very well; there was a pipe in that hop-lost that the cock was foldered to; I then saw him walk away very much on one side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This man was employed by a master-plumber upon these premises? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore as much work as he had done, Messrs. Whitbread's were to pay for? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any lead was lost, the plumber must stand to the loss? - A. No, Messrs. Whitbread must stand to the loss; when lead comes to our house, if it is a whole sheet of lead, or whatever quantity comes in, I put it into a book, and that lead is paid for by Messrs. Whitbread.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MINTON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Scott. On the 17th of October, I was standing at Mr. Whitbread's gate, in Chiswell-street, I saw the prisoner come out apparently very much swelled in the sides; I laid hold of him, and felt something underneath his waistcoat, and found some lead; I then took him into the accompting-house, I put my hand under his jacket, and found two pieces of pipe; he said it was the first time he had ever done any thing of the kind; I delivered the lead to the officers.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street, (produces the lead;) I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner; I took charge of the prisoner, and Mr. Minton brought the lead to the Office, and delivered it to me; the next day I compared it with the pipe from which it was cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that pipe fixed to the building? - A. It had been; it was cut from another piece of lead that was lying in the store-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that piece from which it was cut fixed to the premises? - A. No, it was loose, but it was a very large piece.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that in the same shape with the piece that you fitted it to? - A. No, this piece is split; it had been cut off with a faw; the faws exactly corresponded.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allen. I went with Ray to compare the lead with the pipe that he was at work upon.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

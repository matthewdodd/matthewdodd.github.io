            . On Thursday, the 28th of July, I took the prisoner into custody. I searched him, and found this knife upon him; the prisoner said, it was his.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my knife, one of the blades is very bad, it will bend any way; that is how I know it to be mine. The prisoner gave me the tin-box back again. This is the tin-box; it belongs to me; I have had it five years. He gave it me before he was taken into custody. A young man that he shewed the notes to, said it was mine. I asked the prisoner if he had any money left; he said, he had three shillings. He told me he picked it up on London-bridge, where I was asleep; he throwed my protection over London-bridge, he kept the notes, and went and bought clothes with it; he told me that before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along to work at four o'clock in the morning to a coal-wharf; at the right hand side of London-bridge, there was one or two notes in a box, and a bit of parchment; I did not know what use the parchment was, I throwed it over the bridge; the notes I looked at. There was no cover to the box.</p>

On Tuesday morning, 12th June, about nine o'clock, I went to 9, Victoria Street, and saw the prisoner Cordery there, the carcase of a sheep, twelve fowls, three ducks, and two live pigeons—I told him he would be charged with stealing sheep and fowls—he said, "It is somebody else as has put me into this"—I took him to the station—Nixon went with us—I then went with Plowman in search of the other prisoners, and saw them in company in Well Street, Hackney—I took Thorb—he had two granite stones in his hand, and when I laid hold of his collar he struck me and threw me over his shoulder, and kicked me—I told him what he was charged with—he said, "I would rather see my brains lying on the pavement than go with you, for I can see what is in front of me"—after a great deal of trouble I took him to the station, but I was obliged to send for assistance, as he was so violent—I found blood on his boots, and on Wiltshire's—I took Thorb's boots off—there were spots of blood on each of them—I took them to the gardens and compared them with the footmarks, and they corresponded—I traced the footmarks of three persons from the field to a pond in the garden—it was a fower garden, fresh dug up—Thorb's boots corresponded with the foot-marks in the fresh mould—I then compared Wiltshire's with one of the foot tracks, and they corresponded—the nails were turned over the toes—there were other footmarks in the garden, and marks of blood through the garden, and up the footpath into the field, and to Victoria Street, No. 9, Cordery's house.</p>

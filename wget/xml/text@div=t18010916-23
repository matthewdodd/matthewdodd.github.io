               <p>JOHN MERRIFIELD sworn. - I am constable of St. Bride's, (produces a cloak, shawl, and handkerchief); a seaman of the name of Coleman gave me charge of the prisoner; I went down to Deptford for him yesterday, and the captain would not let him come; I opened the prisoner's apron, and took these things out of her apron; I have had them ever since.(The property was identified by Mrs. Sullivan).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I asked her to lend me the cloak and shawl; I told her I did not want them just then; she told me where they laid, that I might have them when I wanted them; I went in afterwards, and she was talking with another man, and I went in and took them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Sullivan.) Did you ever, upon your oath, lend her these things? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. You never gave her any authority to take them out of the house? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you ever at any time lend her any other articles? - A. Yes; I once lent her a linen apron; I never knew any harm of her before.</p>

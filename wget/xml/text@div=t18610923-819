                  </hi>. I am a seaman on board the American ship Bosphorus—the prisoner wan also a seaman on board—we arrived off the Commercial Dock on Friday afternoon, 6th September—I went into the forecastle to tat prisoner; the mate having called all hands on deck, there were three men in the forecastle, Callaghan, Galbraith, and the prisoner—I told the prisoner to come out on deck—he said he would not go till I went—upon that I caught him by the collar and tried to poll him out with me—we scuffled and both of as fell; he fell under me—I think I struck him; I did strike him—when I got up the witness said that I was out—I did not feel the cut—the prisoner ran out and I chased him; I jumped on the chest first, and the prisoner tried to run out of the forecastle—the deceased man Dim was coming in at the time—he went to take the knife from the prisoner, who was then standing alongside the forecastle door, and I believe Dixon was stabbed—I did not see anything done by the prisoner—I saw the knife in his hand; I did not see him do anything with it—they were standing face to face—Dixon got hold of the prisoner, I believe, by the arm; the prisoner had his right arm up—it was not more than two or tine seconds at most after seeing him with his arm up so, that I found Dixon was stabbed—he fell; the prisoner ran out and I chased him—I did not see what became of the knife—he ran forward and I believe he dropped the knife forwards, I did not see him—the constable has shown me a knife since—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it, as near as I know; I could not swear to it, is similar to the one I had seen him with before—Dixon died within five minutes at the most—the prisoner and I had had a few words one day during the voyage—that was the second time I had had a quarrel with him—I had had no quarrel with him that day.</p>

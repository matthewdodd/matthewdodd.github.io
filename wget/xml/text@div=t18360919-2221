                  </hi>. I am in the service of Alfred Stanes Pigeon, a distiller, opposite St. George's Church, Borough. The prisoner was his servants—he was in the habit of going up stairs daily to clean knives, forks, boots, and shoes—on the 11th of September I found two small knives concealed under</p>

               <p>the staircase—the prisoner was in the house at the time—he left at eight o'clock—he did not sleep there—after he left I looked, and the knives were gone—on Monday, the 12th, he was watched, and some knives were missed from the number given him to clean—I missed one knife and one fork, and found them in the place where the other two were—we let them remain there till the prisoner went away: at ten minutes after eight o'clock in the evening, he was going out of the house, I stopped him, and told him I thought he had got them on his person—he denied it several times, but at last produced them from his pocket.</p>

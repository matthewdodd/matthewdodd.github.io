            . On the 5th of January, I was coming down <placeName id="t18160214-10-crimeloc59">Gray's-inn-lane</placeName>

Knowing the prisoners perfectly well, I crossed over the way; there was a coach directly opposite Mr. Davis's door; I stood behind that, and watched the prisoners, and I could observe them plainly from that situation; I could see them walking to and fro before the window, and I saw Gilmore put his right hand as if towards the bottom of the glass, and he directed his left hand across the pane; the moment he had done that, I heard something go crack; from the sound, I supposed that he had starred the window; they immediately ran towards Gray's-inn, about twenty yards from the house The coach went on, and I was obliged to change my situation; when I changed my situation. I was still in sight, and view of the prosecution's house. I crossed over the way; I was remaining there when one of the patroles was passing by; I stopped him. The prisoners came back directly after I stopped the patrole; they went to the prosecutor's window, where they had been standing before, and in two or three minutes, I heard the falling of some glass; they immediately ran away, in the same direction as before. When they ran away, I walked by the window, and perceived there was a hole in the window, it appeared big enough to admit a man's hand, and much more. After I had seen that the window was broken, both the prisoners came back; they went to the window, walked by, and looked into the shop; they then turned, and went up to the window which they had broken; then Gilmore put his hand into the window, and pulled out several things, which were white, and which appeared to me to be like stockings; he had an apron on, and he put them underneath it, and I thought, into his breeches; he walked about a yard or two, and then Hall put his hand into the window, and took something out, which he put into his right hand coat pocket. At that moment, the patrole that I had stopped, disturbed them, by going up and putting his hand to the window, and they ran away; I pursued Hall, and caught him within fifty yards of the prosecutor's house, he was running towards Holborn, and the other ran towards Gray's-inn. I directly laid hold of him; he put his hand to his right hand pocket, and I caught hold of it, put my own hand into the pocket, and pulled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140015"></xptr>out this shawl. (producing a shawl.) I then took him over to Mr. Davis's shop, and searched him, and found a note directed to a man at the sign of the Plough, in Fleet-market. Knowing the house perfectly well, after I had lodged him in the watchhouse I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not shew the shawl to Davis before you went to the watchhouse - A. Yes, and he said that was one of the shawls that had been laying in his window. The prisoner Hall was present at the time, and heard what was said. I then proceeded to lock him up in the watchhouse, and Davis then accompanied me to Fleet-market; when I went into the passage of the Plough, I looked over the taproom window, to see who was there, and knowing Gilmore's person well: I saw him sitting at the left hand side of the tap-room, playing at dominos; I then went in, accompanied by Mr. Davis. I walked up towards the fire, and took no notice of any one. I turned round, and  o my surprize, I found him pretending to snore, if he were fast asleep. I found on him  knife. I can positively swear that Gilmore, whom I saw in the Plough, is the same person. I tapped him on the hat, and said I want you, and he said what do you want with me, and jumped over the table, and came out. I took him into custody, and lodged him in the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Gilmore. I wish to know from the witness, why he did not take me when, as he says, he saw me commit the robbery?</p>
               <p>Witness I thought it was my duty to take Hall first as he was the nearest to me; it was perfectly dark, but by the light in Mr. Davis's shop, I had a full view of the prisoners. I had some business to do at the Six Clerks office, and the gentleman that I wanted to see there was gone; the answer that I received was that he had been gone a quarter of an hour; I observed the clock in the hall, it was twenty minutes after six. They were taken before the magistrate.</p>

            . I live in Gray's-inn lane. On the night in question, I remembered Vaughan, the last witness, coming to me, between six and seven, when it was quite dark, and telling me that my window was cut out; I had lighted candles, and ever since a little before five o'clock; Vaughan produced a shawl to me, and I told him I had the follow of it; both these shawls were in the window, they were there at about a quarter of an hour before. When Vaughan told me that my window was broken, I went to see, and it was so. We heard it crack; but thought it was the umbrellas. When I lighted the candles, this window was perfectly sound. I have lost a shawl; but I don't know what the other things were, we had so many trifling things in the window, that I can't tell what we miss; we had stockings, shirts, and waistcoats; but we really don't count them.</p>

               <p>Hall's Defence. I am innocent of the robbery, and I bought the shawl of an officer; as for Gilmore I don't know him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you had not much money? A. I had 25s. or 26s.; I had not paid her any thing - I was to have paid her, and should if she had not gone away - I did not give her my watch; it had no case to it - I was to have given her 1s. and something to drink; I might be a little the worse for drink - I cannot say how much I drank: I might be two hours in the public-house - I had pawned the case of my watch.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner brought this watch on Monday morning, and wanted to pawn it - she said she had found it on London-bridge; I asked where the case was - she said her husband had broken it, and it was gone to be repaired; my lad then put a paper into my hand, that such a watch had been stolen - the prisoner said she would fetch her husband, and ran out; I pursued and took her.</p>

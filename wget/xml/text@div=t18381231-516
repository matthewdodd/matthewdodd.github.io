                  </hi>. I am sixty-five years old, and live in Greenwich poor-house. I was assistant in the helpless men's room—the prisoner was one—on Friday, the 21st of December, he was sitting close against the fire, in the helpless room, and I said to him, "Girling, move away from the fire, are you going to get into the fire?"—he said, "D—your eyes, I will do your business now before Christmas-day, that you shan't eat your Christmas dinner here"—with that he took up the poker, and hit me across the face—I put up my arm to save my face, and received a wound on my arm—it was all one blow—it knocked me down on the bed, about half a yard from the fire-place—the point of the poker went into my arm, and drew blood there—it is not a very deep cut, but my arm has been very bad ever since—I have not been able to do my work as usual—I have had a person to assist me—the blow on my face did not bleed—it is only bruised—the blow took away my senses for about five minutes, to the best of my know<lb></lb>ledge</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183812310097"></xptr>
               <p>—when I recovered, I went down to my masters, and did not see where the prisoner went to—there were other persons in the room at the time, but they were bedridden, helpless men, and were not able to assist me—the witness Thornton was the only person able to assist me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was standing by the fire, toasting some bread, and she told me to move—I said, "You are always <hi rend="italic">bothering</hi> me about being by the fire, I have as much right to be by it as you." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I only asked him to move from the tire—I was not always <hi rend="italic">bothering</hi> him about it—I had no dispute with him that morning, but it is impossible to deal with him, that I candidly say—his language was above every thing—I was obliged to speak to him, or I could not live at all—I have had words with him for these two months—he has been in the habit of using bad language to me and to every body—I used to tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself, and that he was a good-for-nothing, dirty man, for tearing and breaking all the things to pieces—he would threaten to <hi rend="italic">shiver</hi> my head, and I have said; "I am not afraid of you, Girling"—I did not expect he would use such violence to an old woman like me, for I was not in any rage or passion that morning, but he was close to the fire, and an old man, with a paralytic stroke, could not get near it—I wanted to get at a saucepan, and when I asked him to move, he struck me this blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She took the poker up herself to strike me with, and I snatched it out of her hands—I did not take it up at all—in my own defence I gave her a slight touch. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I never struck him in my life, nor offered to strike him—I did not take the poker up at all—it was by the side of the fire-place, and he snatched it up, and struck me directly—I had made no attempt to get the poker.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Greenwich poor-house on the 21st of December—there was, to the best of my recollection, one bed-layer, and a cripple alongside the fire, besides Carey and Girling in the room—Girling was sitting by the fire, as close as could be—Carey came to the fire, and said, "Girling, you had better get right into the fire"—Girling jumped up di<lb></lb>rectly, and said, "D—your eyes, you are going to begin again"—some very low words passed between them, and Carey caught up the poker, and said, "I am not afraid of you, you are not going to frighten me"—they scuffled together, and Carey fell on the bed—I did not see the blow struck, being very near-sighted—she called out, "He has killed me, or murdered me"—I ran down stairs, as fast as I could, for assistance—Carey had threatened Girling with the poker, but did not attempt to strike—I am certain she took up the poker, and the prisoner seized it from her hand—there were high words between them, both before and after he seized the poker, but I cannot say what they were—I have been present many times before when they had words, and have heard the prisoner threaten her many times—I heard him say to her, that he would do her business for her, before Christmas-day—he threatened to scald her one day, with a panikin of boiling water, which he had in his hand, and I thought he would have done it.</p>

               <p>arm bleeding—it seemed a desperate wound—I immediately went up to the room, and found the prisoner sitting before the fire, eating something—I said to him, "How could you use the woman in this manner? you might have killed her"—he was going to tell me a rambling sort of story about how it originated, but I did not listen to it—I sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody—he had been about six or seven weeks in the workhouse—I have at times thought him out of his mind, from his extra<lb></lb>ordinary conduct—wherever I placed him, he was constantly quar<lb></lb>relling with the inmates—I removed him from another part of the house to this, thinking he would be quiet there; but his conduct was just the same—he was quarrelling night and day with any body, whether they gave him offence or not—his conversation is always rational, but his actions are certainly those of a madman—there is nothing besides his quarreling which makes me think him insane—I found it necessary to send for the surgeon, in consequence of his threats, and concealing knives about his person and under his bed, which the inmates told me of—the surgeon exa<lb></lb>mined him, and said he could see nothing in his conduct to warrant him in supposing him insane—I examined Carey's arm—it was quite exposed when she came to me—it appeared a very deep cut, about an inch deep, in a slanting direction—it was in the fleshy part of the arm—I sent her to our surgeon, who lives in the neighbourhood, to have it dressed—he is not here.</p>

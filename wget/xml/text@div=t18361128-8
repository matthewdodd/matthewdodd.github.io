                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Jane Adams, who is a widow, and live at No. 1, George-street, in the parish of St. Giles in the Fields. On the evening of the 21st of November I fastened the house up about a quarter to six o'clock—I fastened the back attic window by a catch in the sash—the things were safe then in the attic—it was quite dark—I heard afterwards of somebody being stopped, and went to the station-house—I went up stairs first, and found two panes broken, and the catch broken—a person could put his hand in, and open the window, but could not get his body into the house, as there were bars—the bed-clothes were gone, which had been on the bed when I fastened the window—they were about a yard from the window—I do not think any body could get their arms through the railing; but a stick has been found—I missed a pair of sheets, a blanket, and a counterpane—these are the articles (<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the evening in question, in consequence of information, I went into some unfinished, houses near the prosecutrix's, and searched several of them—I then got on the parapet-gutter, and saw the prisoner standing in the gutter of the roof of No. 4—he had this property under his feet—I took him into custody—the articles laid loose under his feet, all tumbled together—they were wedged into the gutter as he stood upon them—I asked him what he did there—he gave no answer, and I took him to the station-house.</p>

I went into my back yard about six o'clock in the evening, and saw somebody on the top of the house with a bundle under his arm, walking along the gutter of the parapet of No. 4, which was uninhabited—I gave information to Dodd—I saw the prisoner in custody three or four minutes after, with the articles—I did not notice the man so as to know him again.</p>

I am a silk mercer, living with my partner, at No. 43, St. Paul's-churchyard—Verey has been in our service since Feb.—it was his duty to keep the keys of a safe in the warehouse. On Monday, 17th July, I went to the warehouse; the prisoner was away from his duty, and I could not get to the safe, there being no keys; he did not return—I wont to look for the duplicate key, but could not find it; it should have been in a drawer in my desk—it was subsequently found in the cellar, with the duplicate key which Verey had had—this was not a proper place for it—the bottom of my drawer was taken out; it was in great confusion, and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold which I had had there was gone—I had seen it safe on the Friday previous certainly, if not on the Saturday—it was usual to have a cash box in the safe, but I found it was gone—I cannot of my own knowledge say what was in it—there was another safe, but I could not find the key of it, and was obliged to send for a locksmith to have it opened—these two cash boxes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were both found in the second safe, which we had to force open; in fact, three cash boxes were found there—the contents were not gone—one of them belonged to Mr. Swann—this one ought to have been in the other safe—it belongs to us.</p>

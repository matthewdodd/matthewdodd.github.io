On the 16th of March, 1825, I missed three geldings and a mare in foal; the geldings were all black, and had long tails; the mare had a switch tail; the off hind-fetlock of one gelding was white. I missed them at four o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 16th of March, and searched for them directly; I went on the Friday following, near the Plough, public-house, Mile-end-road, and saw the mare in foal in the stables; the hostler shewed her to me; on the Saturday I found one of the geldings at the King's Arms, at Bow, and on the Monday following I saw the other two in School-house-lane, Ratcliff, in possession of Rayment. I estimate their lowest value at 120l.</p>

            . I am Mr. Batten's servant. I had seen these horses at a quarter to eight o'clock on the night before they were missed - I locked them in the stable - I went next morning at half-past three o'clock, found the lock broken, and missed three geldings and a mare out of five; my master has described them correctly; the lock was broken all to pieces, and the door propped up with a piece of iron, which belonged to master, and that iron was also broken.</p>

            . I live at Lemsford-mills, Hertfordshire, and am a publican. On Tuesday evening, the 15th of March, I saw two men get off the Hitchin coach, and throw down a basket; I heard something rattle in it, like iron - I suppose it was stirrups; one of the men was James Harper, and the prisoner the other - he went by the name of Joseph Ludlow; I knew him before, and am certain he is the man; he had been in my house before that time; they both came to my house about six o'clock in the evening, and waited till about seven - I had some conversation with them - the prisoner joined in it; I am certain he is the man. I saw them leave my house about seven o'clock- they went up the road leading to Batten's; he lives not quite a mile from me. The prisoner carried the basket on his shoulder - I did not see what was in it; they gave my child a halfpenny - it dropped into the basket, and they said, "Don't take it out - we will give him another." I had sold Batten some of these horses; Batten called me up about five o'clock next morning, and on the Friday following I saw his mare in foal, at the Plough, at Mileend, and next morning I saw the little black horse at the King's Head, and in the afternoon I saw the two others at work in a brick field.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. How long have you kept this house? A. Thirty-eight years; I was examined here on Harper's trial; I do not recollect whether I mentioned Ludlow by name; I was not asked - I said Harper came with another man - I told the Magistrate he went by the name of Ludlow. The prisoner had four examinations at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say at the two first examinations that you knew Harper, but could not swear to the other man? A. I did not say I could not swear to him - I was threatened that if I did swear to him they would set fire to my house, or blow my brains out, some time or other. I swore to him at the last examination; I said at the two first that he was the man, but I would not swear to him, not that I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not your words "I believe him to be the man, but cannot swear to him?" A. No: I said he was the man, but I would not swear to him at first, because I was threatened to be shot, or my house to be set on fire. I said all the while I knew the man, for I had known him for many years; I said I would not, not that I could not swear to him - it was because I was threatened. I said nothing about his looking like the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you had seen the man but once, and then but for a short time? A. I did not; I said I had seen him before at my house.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not say you could not, but you would not swear to him? A. Yes; I never had a doubt about him, but I was threatened. I never denied that I knew him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did the prisoner threaten you? A. No; he could not - but several people said if I swore to the man they would set my house on fire, and the first fair they met me at they would blow my brains out. The threat was held out to me before the first examination; I did not mention it till the fourth examination.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Crown, at Holloway. In March, 1825, I was hostler at the King's Head, Kingsland-road; and one morning in March two men came into our stables with three black horses and a black mare, which appeared in foal - I knew one of them - it was the prisoner; I am quite certain he is the man - I knew him by the name of Joseph - he had been there several times before - I have not the least doubt of him; he told me to take care of the horses, to clean them, and give them some food - he did not stay in the yard five minutes - he came again at night with another man; I cannot say whether it was the same man as came with him in the morning, but am sure of the prisoner - he wanted the horses out; I gave them to him; he said he only had a sovereign, and could not pay - I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110008"></xptr>him not to mind, as he was in a hurry, and I had seen him before, it did not matter. Attfield came to our stables, and looked at the horses that day. The tail of the mare was rather shorter than the geldings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You could not tell whether the mare was in foal? A. She appeared so; I was not examined on Harper's trial, but was here at the time, on another trial; there were horses in our stables belonging to the prisoner at other times, but not then. I always took him to be a horse-dealer. I never knew where he lived, he has brought horses to our stables about six times.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. As such, you were perfectly acquainted with his person? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am hostler at the King's Arms, Stratford-on-Bow. On the 17th of March, 1825, three black horses and a black mare in foal were brought there, by two men; I knew Harper, who was one of them - the prisoner looks like the other, but I cannot swear to him; two of the horses remained with me all night; the two men took the others away, and Harper took away the mare in foal next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you recollect it was on the 17th of March? A. It was on a Thursday night; I am sure it was in March; we sometimes have horses to bait and at livery.</p>

            . I am a constable of Worship-street. On the morning of the 17th of March, 1825. (Wednesday) about nine o'clock, I went to the King's Head, in search of some horses, from information, and found six there; my attention was directed to three black geldings and a mare in foal - one of the horses had a white fetlock on the off hind foot; I saw that horse produced by Batten, at Dockray's stables, close to Worship-street office, in March this year. On the 13th of March I apprehended the prisoner, at the Salisbury dairy, New North-road, Islington.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first get information of him? A. About the end of February; Clark did not inform me about him; there is nothing remarkable in a horse having a white fetlock. I was examined on Harper's trial. I had assisted in apprehending four men.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Harper tried more than once? A. Yes - I was only examined on one trial - I am not certain which it was; I think it was for stealing Mr. Maitland's horse; I was a witness on two indictments, but only examined on one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent. I was never in Clark's house in my life.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

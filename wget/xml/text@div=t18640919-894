                  </hi>. I am barman to Henry Waller, a licensed victualler, of 36, Goodge-street—on Tuesday, 16th August, about mid-day, the prisoner came to my master's house—I had seen him occasionally before, as a customer—he had three pennyworth of brandy, and then he asked me to cash this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him if he would put his name on the back of it—he said, "My name is Escott; I live up the street, at No. 91"—he then wrote the name of Escott on it in my presence—I believed the state<lb></lb>ment he made at the time, that he lived at 91—I went to my employer and asked him if I should cash it—he asked me if I knew him—I said, "Yes;" and then he told me to give him the money, which I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you get the money from your master? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I got his permission to cash the cheque—he asked me if I knew the man—I said he had been in occasionally, and that he lived at 91, Charlotte-street—my master is not hero—he gave me the keys to get the money out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the bank of Seale, Low, and Co., 7, Leicester-square—no person named Phillips has an account at our bank—the prisoner had an account at our bank; but I can only tell by the signature—the signature on this cheque is the writing of the same person who had an account with us some years ago—it is drawn in favour of George Arthur, and signed "Phillips and Co."—my impression is, that the name written in the body of the cheque is in the same handwriting as the person who had an account at our bank.</p>

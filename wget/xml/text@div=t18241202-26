            . I gave the watch to Ryley last Thursday night, about eleven o'clock; the prisoner had come to the eating-house where I live, and asked for a basin of soup, and in a few minutes a man joined her, and pulled out some silver, (I believe 15 s.;) he asked her to have the money for the watch; she said she would not take less than 18 s.; she knew he wanted to rob her; she then said to me, "Will you keep this watch for me till the morning." I thought it was not properly come by, and I called in Mr. Ryley.</p>
               <p>JOHN LETT. On Thursday night last, about seven o'clock, I was at the Red Lion, public-house - the prisoner was there, and said she thought she knew me; I got talking with her for some time, and we went on towards my home. I went to a room with her - I had had my watch in my hand just before I went in; she left the room, and said she would come back again in a minute. I put my hand to my fob, and missed my watch; I went out but could not overtake her. I saw her put something into her bosom. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We went into the room together. He gave me his watch to keep till the next night, and said if I would meet him on Westminster-bridge he would give me 5 s.</p>

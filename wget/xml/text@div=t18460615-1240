Gammon and Co., of Birmingham—on, the 8th of Dec., I paid him 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for Gammon and Son, as a balance due for goods received up to that period—he gave me this receipt—on the 17th of Feb. I paid him 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on their account—this is his receipt for that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of a bank at Birmingham. I am acquainted with Mrs. Mary Gammon and her son, and have been so for many years—I was executor under the will of her late husband—she never took any part in the business of the glass-manujkctory at Birmingham—she shares a portion of the profits—it is carried on under the firm of Gammon and Son—the prisoner has been in the employ of the firm eight or nine years—he has resided in London I think the last five or six years—I have been in the habit of corresponding with him—I act for Mrs. Gammon in the business—the management does not rest on me in detail.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the employment of the prisoner altered in 1842? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was—I sent to him in writing the terms under which he was engaged—this is my letter to him.</p>
               <p>This letter contained the following paragraph:—"The agreement is, that you shall be paid a commission of 3 per cent, on the net receipts from orders to the concern, not being from the Birmingham connection, or on account of orders for exportation, unless such orders for exportation were obtained from new customers expressly by you; but from this commission of 3 1/2 per cent. you are subject to a deduction of 3 1/2 per cent. for all bad debts arising to the concern from customers on whose payments you would have had a com<lb></lb>mission, but on the understanding that if your commission does not reach</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184606150028"></xptr>
               <p>300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, that you shall be paid that sum, and that you shall be allowed to draw at that rate till the time of settlement."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> These were the terms on which he was employed from 1842? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was agent in London—I have had frequent communi<lb></lb>cations with him, both verbal and otherwise—he was in the habit of receiving money on account of the firm—it was bis duty on receipt of them to transmit bills direct to Birmingham, and the cash to a banker's in London—he was constantly in the habit of transmitting sums that he so received, with the statement from whom he received them, immediately after the receipt of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here is something said about a settlement in this letter, were you in the habit of settling with the prisoner, as to the amount of commission he was to receive for his orders? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—on the 31st of March this letter—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at it</hi>)—was received in the prisoner's handwriting—it is an account of his claim for service during the past twelve months, and a statement of the monies received in payment of that account—this is dated March 31, 1846—it was my habit to settle with him at that time—he here makes a statement of 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due to him from Gammon and Son—I have never received from him to the credit of Mr. Henry Wildman, 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was his duty to have remitted these sums immediately he received them, and he has not done so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This man had been engaged in some capacity for eight or nine years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it may be more—he was what may be popu<lb></lb>larly termed a traveller—I have no recollection of there having been any negotiation on the subject of a partnership—I do not believe there ever was—he was entitled to a commission on the whole receipts of the concern, with the exception of the Birmingham trade, and that which was the subject of exportation—supposing the general receipts of the concern, except the Birm<lb></lb>ingham trade and the exportation, to amount to 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner was the immediate procurer of only 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would have been entitled to the commission on the whole 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe he has applied for the balance on that return—I am not aware whether he has examined the books, but I know he applied to do so some two years ago, and I distinctly told him that the account as made out, did not show 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year due to him for commission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the general returns, with the exception mentioned, were 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he were to procure 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other turned out to be bad debts, would he be subject to return 3 1/2 per cent.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as he had the profit on one side, he had the loss on the other—we had agreed that his salary should be 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we put on 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more for expenses—I think that would do to cover his expenses—he was latterly out very little—I should think since this agreement, taking the average, he was not out of London one month in the year, or six weeks—he was discharged on the 11th of May—I am not aware whether he had been any part of this year out of London, or how much of last year he was out of London—I do not know whether he was obliged to have a horse and chaise—I have had conversation with him about his expenses—he has been allowed to remain with an arrear unsettled—not his account unsettled, but a balance in his hand, not paid ever since 1842—I should say it was from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you complained to him of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This was a balance of money actually handed to him—we never allowed him to keep money he received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean that the balance he retained, and did not account for, was not money he received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There may have been an instance or two of money he received, but it has always been remonstrated</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184606150029"></xptr>
               <p>against—those were of trifling amount—it waa distinctly stated that if he re<lb></lb>ceived any money which he did not pay over, it would be an offence against us, and any money he wanted, was to be sent him from Birmingham.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have told him he was not to retain monies? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—in every instance where he has attempted to do so I have insisted on that being paid over, and if he wanted money it should be sent him from. Birmingham—he has not put in any claim for money owing to him—he rendered an account, making himself a debtor to the amount of 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was principally a London traveller—the great majority of the accounts were London accounts—the country trade was so little that he was allowed to have t commission on the whole, that there might be no dispute about it.</p>

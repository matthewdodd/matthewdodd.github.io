            What is it a lodging-house? - A. Yes; there are gentlemen boarders there; Dr. Clark keeps it; Mr. Torry's accompting-house is at Dr. Clark's; the prisoner came there about a quarter before eight in the morning, he had a basket, which I saw him put at the foot of the stairs; I saw him look into the accompting-house; I asked him what he wanted; he said, nothing; and directly after I looked round, I missed him; I went into the accompting-house, there I saw him; he had taken the cloth from the chest and opened it; he had an handkerchief-piece, and was putting it in his pocket; I took the piece from him and put it on Mr. Torry's chest again; I asked him what he meddled with Mr. Torry's property for; he said that he sold the same goods, and that he wanted to see what number<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300042"></xptr>they were; I asked him why he did not come when Mr. Torry was in the way, and he would shew him the number; he said, he would not; I acquainted the gentleman when he came; he did not lodge in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. He left the handkerchiefs? - A. Yes; and folded them in the same chest again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the handkerchiefs completely out? - A. He did take them completely out of the chest; he went home, and came the next day as usual to clean his master's boots and shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is his master? - A. Mr. Kenningham.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing to do in this accompting house? - A. No, nothing at all. He came the next day, and went up stairs to clean his master's boots and shoes; the officer was there before him, and as he came down stairs, Mr. Smith took him; he made his escape from them all; they ran after him, and took him in the street again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The woman herself called me to clean the windows, and I desired her to hand me the cloths; she told me to come at five o'clock to clean the windows before the master was up; the windows were so dirty, she said, she was afraid the master would make a noise, she was there herself when the things where taken out of the chest; she said to me, this old b - has got all these things here, and he would hang his father; she helped to move the box herself to clean the windows, she said, for God sake put them away when she was shewing them me.</p>

               <p>JOHN SMITH sworn. - I am an officer, I received information at the Mansion house, that at No. 2, Sion-gardens, there was suspicion of a black man stealing a quantity of handkerchiefs, and that they expected he would come the next day between seven and eight o'clock, as usual; I went to the house, and he was there; I took him into custody; on searching him, I found three duplicates in his pocket, one for eight pieces of handkerchiefs, pledged for 1 l. 12 s. on the 16th of October; I went the same evening to the pawnbroker's; the prisoner confessed to me where he had sold a number of whole pieces of handkerchiefs, and he told me; if Mr. Tory would forgive him, he would make the property good, if he would give him time. I produce the property.</p>
               <p>John Torry. I cannot swear they are mine, they are similar to what I lost. I lost handkerchiefs of that description and quantity; I had no private mark of any kind.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you believe? - A. I believe they are mine, I am perfectly sure I have lost that quantity. I have lost thirty-eight pieces of handkerchiefs, and one piece of muslin.</p>
               <p>

            And this you believe to be part of those thirty-eight pieces? - A. I do; I counted them over, and there were thirty-eight pieces deficient; I really believe they are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing to do for you? - A. He never was employed by me; I never remember having seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these for West-India consumption? - A. Yes; they are not much used at home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When first he took me up, he said, he lost a piece of sprig muslin; when he came before the Lord Mayor, it was plain muslin, then he said, he could swear to it, now, he says, he believes it is his.</p>

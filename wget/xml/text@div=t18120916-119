            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 21st of May, between nine and ten at night, a lodger of mine informed me that somebody was on the top of the house. I went up stairs, and heard somebody running from one house to the other. I directly went to the next house, and the landlord went up stairs with me. He forced the garret door open, and the lead was on the table, and Allen and Moreing were sitting in the room.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160068"></xptr> Allen lived in that room. The prisoners both ran out of the room.</p>

            . I live next door to Mrs. Smith. She came and informed me there was somebody on the top of the house, taking the lead off. I went up stairs, and knocked at the garret door. Nobody answered. I forced the room door open. Allen was with a young woman that lived there. He was sitting on the bed, and Moreing was sitting on the other side of the table, where the lead was.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received information of the robbery. I apprehended the two prisoners on the 9th of July.</p>
               <p>Allen. Mr. Salmon apprehended me for being a deserter. He said, if he could not do for me for a deserter, he would do for me for other things.</p>
               <p>Allen and Moreing's Defence. We beg leave to trouble the court with this written statement, and submit to his lordship, and the gentlemen of the Jury, that we are charged with a robbery. If false witnesses come in a court of justice, who can stand against them. On that day we had been to Bow-fair. We got in company with two girls of the town. We went with them, and laid ourselves down to sleep. Shortly after the door of the room was broken open, which much alarmed us, Allen having been absent from the regiment that day, was fearful of being taken to the guard-room. Finding this was not the case we ran down stairs. The prosecutor and his wife are of the most disgraceful stamp. Smith and his wife keeps a house for the prostitution of women, and Bilby is the same description.</p>

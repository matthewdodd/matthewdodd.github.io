               <p>(The case opened by Mr. Leech.)</p>
               <p>FRANCIS STRANGE sworn.</p>
               <p>From some information I received, I went to Mr. Cleaver Simmons's wharf, on Saturday last, and there I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300045"></xptr>prisoner at the bar, I asked him if he had taken one of our casks instead of an oil cask in a mistake? he said he had taken no cask at all for he had none to take, he went about his business then, and afterwards I called him on one side again, and told him the consequences of it, and that if he did not tell of it he might depend on a prosecution; and then he went over to Kent-street with me and shewed me the Butt on his own premises, it was under a shed in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it opened or concealed? - The yard was concealed, but the shed was open.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you mean? - The yard door was locked.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it a yard in which butts are usually placed? was there any other butts there? - It was in an empty yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the marks on the butt? - There was S. W. and Chiswell-street, London; I know it to be Mr. Whitbread's property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When you first saw the prisoner at Cleaver's, was what you stated to the court all the conversation that passed? Did not he say that he had not an oil cask but he had an empty beer cask? - He did not say so at first, he said he had never a cask at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he went with you to his premises and shewed you this cask? - He did sometime afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. And desired you to take the cask? - He did, and turned it out himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the bar before? - I did not.</p>

               <p>On Friday last I had some beer come in, I went to the door and I saw a man have his hand on the butt, I thought it was one of my own men, but I cannot say it was the prisoner at the bar, it was a man in a white jacket, but I thought it some of our brewers.</p>

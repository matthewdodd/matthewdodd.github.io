                  </hi> I live in Queen's-terrace, St. John's-wood. On 1st of Dec. I went with the prisoner to the Abbey-tavern—we had some gin-and-water—I had a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-note in my pocket, and five or six sovereigns—I stopped there perhaps an hour and a half—the prisoner was with me the whole time, and he only—there was a master-builder in the parlour part of the time, but we sat in separate chairs—I fell asleep for a short period, and when I awoke the prisoner was gone, and my money also—the policeman has got the number of the note, and I knew the number—previous to going to she tavern the prisoner had asked me to advance him sixpence or a shilling—he said he had not had anything to drink for a day or two—I said I was sorry, but if he would accompany me to the Abbey-tavern I would give him some refreshment.</p>

                  </hi> I keep the White Lion in Edgware-road—I know the prisoner—he came to my house on 1st Dec., about five in the evening, and asked for change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he was told he could not be accommodated—he left and returned in about an hour and a half—he went into the front room, remained some time, and fell asleep, leaving a bundle unprotected—the waiter saw it and brought it to the bar—I took possession of it—the prisoner came afterwards to know if it had been delivered over the bar, and it was shown him; he took it and returned into the room—he remained a part of the evening and required a bed—he came to the bar to go to bed—learning he had money I recommended that he should hand me the money before he went to bed—he deposited nine sovereigns with me—he had a new great coat on.</p>

I lost some ribband in several pieces. My daughter was the person that catched her; and she can give a farther account of it.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Pitman, jun. I was gone into the yard about some business, and when I came in I found the prisoner leaning over the counter, close to the glass case. I came behind the counter, and asked her, what she wanted. She said, a half-penny worth of bread. I had some suspicion she had taken something, because I found the glass case not quite shut. I turned her cloak aside to see if I could see the ribband, and she had none. I served her with bread and she went home directly. After that I looked in the glass case, and missed several parcels of ribband. I went over the way but could not find the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Pitman, jun. No; I never saw her before to my knowledge. I went and told a neighbour of it. She had seen her lurking about at the door. In less than half an hour the prisoner came through the court; and the gentlewoman that I had told it to, beckoned to me to go after her. I went and brought her in. I asked her for my ribband and she took it out of her bosom, and laid it on the counter, and own'd she took it. Produc'd in court, and deposed to.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is there of it?</p>
               <p>Pitman, jun. There is about ten yards of it; but I lost a great deal more.</p>

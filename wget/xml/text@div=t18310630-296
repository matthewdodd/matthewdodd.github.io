            . I let the prisoner have the silk, and in consequence of suspicion, I watched him into Mr. Foster's - I then returned, and sent Burton to Mr. Foster's.</p>
               <p>JOHN BURTON. I am in the prosecutors' employ. I went to Foster's, and as I went in I met the prisoner coming out - I followed him to Rathbone-place; he then began running, and went on to Greek-street - I overtook him there, and asked if he had not brought a piece of silk from Mr. Wild's, in Rathbone-place; he said Yes, and he was going to take it to a customer - I went with him; he called in Gower-street, in Bedford-square, and Tavistocksquare - I then said he should not go further till he told me where the customer lived; he said at No. 36, Guildford-street - he went there; the person he inquired for was not at home - he came back to Wild's, in Rathbone-place, and they said they knew nothing of him; he then said a person in a surtout coat, who stood at their door, gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he attempt to run away? A. No.</p>
               <p>ROBERT MILLARD. On the 4th of June the prisoner came into Mr. Foster's with a piece of silk, and said he should want two pieces to match it for Mr. Wild; I gave him a pattern - he went out; Burton came in: I told him what had passed - the prisoner was not in Mr. Foster's service, and was not sent from our shop for the silk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons have you? A. One more shopman.</p>
               <p>ROBERT KNOWLES. I am a Police-constable. On the 4th of June I was fetched to Mr. Wild's - Burton charged the prisoner with taking the roll of silk from Mr. Tavener- he said a young man at Wild's door sent him to Tavener's for it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

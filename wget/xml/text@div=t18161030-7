            . On the night of the 23rd of October, I was standing in my shop, it was about a quarter before nine; I had a light in my shop. I was alarmed by a sudden breaking of my windows; two pairs were broken of my shop window. I went to the door; I saw the prisoner at the bar, I have not the least doubt of his being the man, running across the street; I pursued him; I did not observe him first; I secured him with the assistance of another person, who was in the neighbourhood. After securing him, I brought him back to the shop; while in the shop, a person brought a shoe in, which he picked up in the street; his name is Meridith, and he asked me if it was my property; I said it was. We then, it being near the hour of nine, detained him in the shop until the watch came; then I delivered him up to the watchman. I am sure the panes were not broken before. At the time I took the prisoner, his hands were bleeding very much I believe both of them, but one I am positive of. There was no mark of blood about the window; there is a mark of blood on the shoe.</p>

               <p>Mr. Williams of Council for the Prosecution, opened the case as follows.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, it is a painful circumstance to any person of feeling, who has attended this Court on this sessions, to think of the number of culprits, that are brought here for such a variety of crimes; in the morning we heard of burglaries, of highway robberies, of pocket picking; we are now about to prove a crime, which you have just heard named in the indictment, a crime of a very different, and of a most enormous nature: a crime which has been held by the laws of all civilized countries, justly deserving to be punished with the most extreme rigour. But it would ill become me, Gentlemen of the Jury, who am of Council on the part of a criminal prosecution, and would also be utterly inconsistent with my feelings as a man, to attempt any appeal to yours; I shall therefore barely mention the facts, I am instructed to say, will be proved in evidence before you, for it is from them alone you must decide.</p>
               <p>The prosecutrix is stated to me to be a girl of about fifteen years of age, a poor, country, fatherless child, who was left with nine more to be maintained by a poor widow in Hertfordshire, and one Skelton a coachmaker, who married an aunt of this woman's, merely out of charity, sent for this girl, and recommended her as a <rs id="t17840225-19-viclabel107" type="occupation">servant maid to the Hospital for Inoculation for the Small Pox</rs>

The girl as soon as she could get away, came directly to her mistress, Mrs Connolly, who, one would suppose, would have been irritated at the thoughts of such a thing being committed on a poor fatherless child, but instead of that she says to her,</p>
               <p>"Well Betty,</p>
               <p>"if Mr. Longlegs (meaning the prisoner)</p>
               <p>"has got you withchild, he will be a rare<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250052"></xptr> " father to it, for he is worth a good deal</p>
               <p>"of money, and you need not be afraid." The girl then fell a crying and wanted to go home, but her mistress sent her to bed: in the morning the girl wanted to go home, but however soon after Mrs. Skelton came to the house, and the girl told him the whole story, and he upon hearing it thought it his duty to bring this prosecution forward. Gentlemen, it is proper for me to inform you that you will find one material piece of evidence wanting on the part of the prosecution, and of which we are deprived by an accident; it is the evidence of a Mr. Hall, a surgeon, who examined the girl; he had the misfortune on Friday last to fall down in Chancery-lane, and hurt his leg; upon this event I meant to have moved the Court to have put off the trial, but Mr. Skelton, who prosecutes only for the sake of publick justice, said he could not afford to put it off. Gentlemen, these are the facts which I am instructed to lay before you, and which will be proved in evidence. I am well aware that prosecutions of this nature are, with great propriety, very cautiously attended to by Courts of criminal jurisdiction, as they are prosecutions which may be very easily made, and which are very hard to be defended: but however, gentlemen, when you see this poor girl, and hear her give her evidence, you will be able to judge whether a rape has or has not been actually committed by the prisoner: if it has been committed, the offence is certainly, as a great man has said, a very detestable one; if the crime has not been committed, if this is a mere trick, a mere conspiracy, to bring an innocent man to this bar, you will then acquit the prisoner, and I am sure he is extremely fortunate, in having such respectable gentlemen as you, to decide on his life.</p>

               <p>Relate to the Court what happened to you? - On Thursday the 15th of January last my master ordered me to take a pot of beer to Mr. Costello.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I took it to his shop, and he bid me set it down on the compter.</p>
               <p>Court. Where does the prisoner live? - In Monmouth-street.</p>
               <p>What is his business? - A saleman; I set the beer on the compter, and coming out again, he caught hold of my arm, and doubled me neck and heels together.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not understand that doubling neck and heels together? - He put my head to my legs, and took and carried me neck and heels together.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tie you neck and heels? - No, he did not tie me, but he held my head and my heels together, that I should not proceed to call out.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in the house at that time? - There was nobody in the parlour, nor yet in the shop.</p>
               <p>You saw no person in the house? - No, then he took me into the parlour, and locked the parlour door; he then downed me on the bed, which was in the parlour, and I got up again; then he forced my legs open with violence, and entered my body with violence; after he had his will of me, he wanted me to lay hold of his private parts, and he would not let me go till some time after? then our man came to the door and asked whether Betty was there, he asked what Betty, and the man said Betty that lives at Mr. Connolly's, and he said she has been gone half an hour, and he stood doubling his fist at me, and swearing in such a manner that I durst not halloo out.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there afterwards? - Then he swore God damn me for a bitch, he would ravish me, he would ravish me.</p>
               <p>Where did you go afterwards? - I went home to my mistress.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250053"></xptr>Did you say any thing to her? - No, she began to hall jeers at me, so I did not think it was fit to tell her.</p>
               <p>How soon did he let you out? - In about half an hour; I did not say any thing to my mistress, because she said, Betty, never mind it, never look down, if long legs has got you with child; but cast yourself up, and make yourself as brisk as you can, I will be bound he will be a good father to it; this was as soon as ever I got into the house.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards was it before you saw your aunt? - On the Friday night the day after.</p>
               <p>Did you complain to her of this outrage? - Yes, my mistress took my aunt into the bar, and said, Mrs. Skelton, here is a very bad accident happened to Betty.</p>
               <p>Court. Then your mistress first told your aunt of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Say what you said yourself to your aunt? - I told my aunt the first beginning of it, and every thing; she came to me and insisted on my telling her, and I told her how Mr. Castello used me, and every thing about it; she went home directly to my uncle, and I saw my uncle, and I told him the same.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner at the bar afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you accuse him before any person? - My mistress fetched him and I face to face, and I told him it was so, and he denied it.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said he never meddled with me.</p>
               <p>Court. You say this happened on the Thursday night? - Yes, between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>You say you came home in a quarter of an hour after, and you never mentioned it till the Friday, at what hour on the Friday did you mention it? - About six in the evening.</p>
               <p>From the night preceding, when you returned home, till six o'clock the next evening, was you confined in the house of Mr. Connolly? - My mistress made me go to bed.</p>
               <p>But when you got up in the morning, had you not free liberty to go to your uncle and aunt? - I got my hat and cloak on, and my mistress would not let me go, but said she would send for my aunt.</p>
               <p>At what time did you make an attempt to go? - About twelve.</p>
               <p>Court. You might have gone before that, and it was natural that you should have given the earliest intelligence to those persons that you thought your relations and friends, you should have gone immediately; how came you to debate on this matter for such a length of time, was you ballancing in your mind whether you should make any complaint or no? - My mistress would not let me go.</p>
               <p>That was at twelve o'clock, but previous to that you was at liberty to go, and especially when your mistress treated you in the manner you have represented, and laughed at you; I should have gone to my friends, to my uncle and my aunt; but the manner in which you have described this thing is not sufficiently explained to the Jury; you must be more explicit; you have said that he forced open your legs with violence, and entered your body with violence, but you should describe the manner of it, because if there was not compleat carnal knowledge, the prisoner cannot be convicted of this offence; he might enter your body with violence, and yet not have carnal knowledge of you? - He had knowledge of me.</p>
               <p>You must speak particularly.</p>

               <p>Then at that time you had never told either your mistress or your master any thing of this transaction? - No.</p>
               <p>How came your mistress then to prevent your going out? - She said I should not go for she would send for my aunt.</p>
               <p>For what? - To tell her.</p>
               <p>Tell her what? - What had happened to me.</p>
               <p>Why you had not told her? - No.</p>
               <p>Had Mr. Castello been there? - No.</p>
               <p>You had not told either your master or your mistress, then how could she send for your aunt to tell her? - She did.</p>
               <p>She did not know of it you know my dear? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Nobody else could tell her? - No.</p>
               <p>Then she did not know of it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you never told any body of it till six o'clock on the Friday evening? - No, then I told my mistress and my aunt together.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250055"></xptr>Did you do your work and go about house as usual? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have told this gentleman that he threw you with violence, and forced your legs open with violence; do you remember, when you was asked that question before the Justice, your saying no; when the Justice asked you whether he threw you down with violence, and you made any resistance, you said no, no? - I made as much resistance as ever I could.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a plain question that the gentlemen puts to you; while you was before the magistrate, did not he ask you whether the man, charged by you with this offence, had thrown you down with violence, and whether you had made all the resistance you could and you answered no; recollect now, did you say no, to the Justice, or yes? - I did not know what resistance was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You know what resistance is now - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who told you that you must say now it was done with violence? - Nobody told me.</p>
               <p>How did you hear it? - I heard somebody say so.</p>
               <p>Now pray who was that somebody? - A woman going by.</p>
               <p>What did that good woman say to you? - She was talking about resistance.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - As I was going by some woman was telling another woman what resistance, meant.</p>
               <p>So two women were talking together about resistance, and there you learned what resistance meant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you did say, before the Justice, that you did not resist; you answered no, when the question was put to you there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, I understand, is a man of some property, is not he? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Some of your friends have made enquiries about that? - No, none of my friends that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did you understand likewise, that this house of his he lets out in lodgings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now when you said there was nobody in the shop and in the parlour, do you mean to tell my Lord that there was nobody else in that house, either above stairs or below? - I did not know there was any body.</p>
               <p>Then you only meant to say that there was nobody in the front shop, and in the back shop, which he occupied? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by being doubled together neck and heels? - He put my head and my heels together.</p>
               <p>What so? (doubling up his brief.) - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he laid you on the bed, there he left you, and you staid, I hope, till he shut the door? - No, I got up again.</p>
               <p>Did you call out? - No, I called once, and nobody came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Did not this hurt you, being doubled? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Very much? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And yet you did not scream out then? - I could not scream out, he laid his hands so upon me.</p>
               <p>Why you know he doubled you like this sheet of paper, and carried you ill, and you never cried out? - I could not.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell Barnet your fellow servant of this? - No, Sir, I did not, I want to see some of my friends to tell them first.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Grant my young woman? - He is a lodger of my master's.</p>
               <p>Who is he, he is a good likely young man, is not he? - He is a sailor.</p>
               <p>You and he are acquainted I understand? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know him? - No other than giving him a candle to go to bed by; I know nothing of him no otherwise.</p>
               <p>How otherwise do you mean that you you might know him? - I never had nothing to say to him, nor he to me.</p>
               <p>Never? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>No conversation? - No.</p>
               <p>No acquaintance, no connections at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And even to him you did not tell this? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250056"></xptr>Why, I thought he was a bit of a sweetheart of yours? - No, Sir, he is not, nor ever was.</p>
               <p>What did they say to you, when you returned home, after you had carried the beer? - They asked me why Mr. Castello kept me there; I did not tell them any thing farther.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams. When you was examined before the Justice, what did you say? - I told the Justice the same as I told you now.</p>
               <p>Did you say to the Justice, that he forcibly, and against your will lay with you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. It will appear by the deposition what she said there.</p>
               <p>Court. Your master's house was a publick house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you returned, about half an hour after nine o'clock, were there no persons drinking in the house? - Yes, there were five or six.</p>

               <p>When did this girl go to Mr. Connolly's service? - I cannot say, but the rash act was committed the 15th of January.</p>
               <p>She was there about ten days before that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see her after the 15th? - I saw her on the Friday about six o'clock, as that happened on the Thursday; I went to carry her some things, and when I came to the bar her mistress desired me to walk in, and her mistress s aid, ere is a terrible thing happened, says she, to Betty; says I, what; says she, it is a man has ravished her, one of our customers; I said, can I see her; and she said, if you will stop a little I will go into the kitchen along with you; I went to her, and she was crying bitterly at the sink, washing the dishes, and I desired her to tell me the truth; whether the man had laid with her, or whether he had not, and she said, yes, he had; and I made her answer, then you stay here, I will go and send your uncle, and her mistress desired me not to go home and tell my husband; for the man had money and he would maintain the child and her too, if in case she had one, and it was pity to take a man up to lose his life; I went home and my husband was not come home, I sent for him, and told him, and he went to her master's; I did not go with him.</p>
               <p>Court. What way of life are you in? - My husband is a coachmaker.</p>

               <p>It is not many minutes walk, I believe? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the girl complain that she could not come before to you? - Yes, she said her mistress would not let her come, but said she would send for me, but she did not.</p>
               <p>She said, he was a man worth money, able to pay for this or any thing else? - Yes, and that it was a pity to hang him.</p>
               <p>How came you not to take your niece home with you? - I thought it was better to my husband for her.</p>
               <p>You thought your niece full as safe at Connolly's as with you? - I thought I could form run home for my husband.</p>
               <p>You might walk it in a couple of minutes I believe? - Yes, in three minutes.</p>

               <p>What is the prisoner's character? - A very honest industrious man.</p>

               <p>I dare say you are a very industrious woman; you do not sit with your hands before you; therefore it is possible, I should suppose, that any noise might happen below, and you being busy above, might not hear it? - I was very ill of a cold.</p>
               <p>Where did it affect you? - I was bad all over.</p>

               <p>Do you know what hour this was? - No farther than I heard, I went to bed at twelve o'clock; my husband did not come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250058"></xptr> home before twelve, and I was too ill to do any thing.</p>
               <p>How did you amuse yourself? - I generally have a book, I might be reading, I generally do read when I have nothing else to do.</p>
               <p>You are a very good woman, I am sure, but it is possible this might happen and you not hear it? - He could not even laugh loud but I must hear him, the stairs are so low, and it is a thin partition, and if she had made any noise I could have heard it.</p>
               <p>You live in the fore room, one pair of stairs, and this is the back parlour, how high is this room? - No higher than the common rooms, they are but new built houses.</p>
               <p>But you was reading you say? - I was certainly the stiller for that.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, might not she have cried out or made a noise without your hearing? - No, Sir, I do swear, that nobody could scream out, or if they had even knocked against the wainscot, but I could have heard them, and I must have heard her, being so still as I was by myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Supposing a woman had screamed out violently once only? - If any body was to make any noise at all, or to call Mr. Castello, I must hear it.</p>
               <p>Was you in your room from nine till half after that evening? - I was.</p>
               <p>And if any scream had happened of this kind, you must have known it? - I must.</p>

               <p>Is your apartment directly under the shop and parlour of Castello's? - Directly under the shop, there is just a little wainscot between us.</p>
               <p>Can you hear what passes in Castello's room above you? - If they speak loud, I can hear every thing, or even if he moves a chair, or the least thing in the world in comparison.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect a young woman coming there with beer that night? - I recollect somebody coming, but whether it was a woman or a man I do not know.</p>
               <p>What did you hear pass? - I heard a person say beer, then the door was shut, and I heard no more.</p>
               <p>Could you have heard if there had been any noise? - Oh! Gentlemen, if any child had cried the least in the world I must have heard it, for our apartment is so low that a man can scarce stand upright in it; I heard somebody say beer, and I heard no more that night; I heard Mr. Connolly's man come and say is Betty here, and I heard Mr. Castello make answer and say what Betty; and he said did not she bring a pot of beer; and Castello said she had been gone half an hour; that was a good while afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams. How did you know it was Mr. Connolly's man? - By his voice, because he comes so often into the house.</p>

               <p>Do you owe him any rent? - A quarter.</p>

               <p>There he lays? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You live under the shop and not under the parlour? - One apartment is so near the other, that we can hear.</p>
               <p>You said there was hut just a little wainscot between you? - Our place is so low.</p>
               <p>Court. What time do the salesmen in Monmouth-street shut up their shops? - About eight.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Sylvester.</p>
               <p>I am landlord of the Fountain in Monmouth-street; this young woman was a servant of mine; I remember her going with a pot of beer the 15th of January; when she came back I was in the cellar, and she came down stairs to me, and had a pint pot to the best of my memory in her hand, and I asked her, Betty, says I, where have you been; she said, at Mr. Castello's; says I, why do you stay so at Mr. Castello's when it is the hurry of our business; Sir, says she, you will not blame me when I tell you; says I, then tell me directly; then she told me that Mr. Castello had her by the hand and would not let her go; then I asked her, had he any thing further to do with you; and she said, no, indeed, Sir, nothing else.</p>
               <p>You supped together that night? - Yes, Sir, all four of us.</p>
               <p>How was she at supper? - She sat at supper, and was as merry that night as ever she had been since she was at my house, and my wife in a joking way said, Betty, says she, suppose we drink a good health to young Castello, if you have got one to night; no, indeed, Madam, says she, there was nothing of that kind; and the next morning she said never a word, nor until her aunt came at night; she had her breakfast along with us all the same, took no notice, nor no complaint of any kind how-somever.</p>
               <p>How did she behave herself during the few days she was in your service? - Her aunt knows very well, the Sunday before I sent her out with a pint of beer and a pipe to a neighbour, and she staid away half an hour; some of it was spilt, and she was very much in liquor when she took up the pot; and on the Monday following she could not see one thing, nor we could not get her to do any thing.</p>
               <p>Had you giving her warning? - Yes, I told the aunt she would not do for me, and her aunt said let her stay till she gets a service.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams. How came it into your head to ask her that other question,</p>
               <p>"Had he any thing further to do with you?" - Because she staid a time, and I should not have wished that any thing should have happened.</p>
               <p>Why did you think of that particularly? - It happened to come into my head.</p>
               <p>First of all hear my question, and then give me an answer; what induced you particularly to ask her that question,</p>
               <p>"Had he any thing further to do with you?" - Because she staid so long out of my sight, I did not know what might happen.</p>
               <p>You may think it a very jocose thing to hurt a young girl, did you say, let us drink to young Castello? - I did it to find whether any thing had been done.</p>
               <p>Is that the way of behaving to a young girl that you are afraid is injured? - That is the way I spoke.</p>
               <p>Court. I thought it was your wife that spoke it? - My wife spoke it too.</p>
               <p>Who is Castello? - The prisoner in the bar.</p>
               <p>How far does he live off? - Not a great way.</p>
               <p>How long has he been your customer? - As long as I have had the house, like another customer.</p>
               <p>In what capacity was this girl? - A servant.</p>
               <p>She was not hired to go out with porter? - To take out beer if required.</p>
               <p>You take your oath of that? - Yes.</p>

            ? - He is a servant and soldier, he takes out beer or any thing else; we all take out beer.</p>
               <p>What was the reason that this girl went this night particularly to Castello's? - Because we were all busy; Barnet was drawing beer at the same time.</p>
               <p>Did you ever send her to Castello's house before? - I suppose she had been there, I hired her to do my business, and that is my business to serve my beer, or any thing else that is wanted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What is the character of Mr. Castello? - He is a very honest young fellow, as ever was in the world, and that there is plenty in Court will say.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Connolly, I was examined before the Grand Jury for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>You know that young woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know Grant? - Very well.</p>
               <p>He is a seaman, is not he? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Lodges in your master's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is he and Betty acquainted at all? - Yes, Sir, they were acquainted.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - Why they were acquainted so far, that I used to go up stairs to fetch the candlesticks, and I went up stairs one night, and I catched him and she on the bed, and he atop of her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I believe my Lord I need not call any more witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. It seems to me that this case, if it stood on the evidence of the prosecutrix herself, is not sufficiently proved; but I am not at all averse to summing up the evidence, if the Jury desire it.</p>
               <p>Jury. We need not trouble your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Court. Indeed Gentlemen, there is not the least foundation for this prosecution, for it is not supported by the evidence even of the woman herself: I have seen her deposition, which could not be given as evidence here, because nobody was here to prove it, but she gives a very different account of the transaction now to what she did then. This is a cooked up story, calculated to extort money from the prisoner, who is represented to be a man in circumstances of ability; for it is impossible that a woman, who as she now represents it herself, had opportunities of informing numbers of people of a transaction of this kind, should make no complaint either to her master or her mistress, or Barnet, or any of the customers, any of whom would have taken the part of an innocent woman; she was entirely a free agent in crossing the streets, and all that evening, and the next morning; and she had only three minutes walk to communicate the whole to her uncle and aunt: therefore in my apprehension there is not the least foundation for the prosecution; and when you consider the evidence of the lodgers in the house, in such a situation that they must have heard that cry, which she only mentions to have made once, although she might have made cries perpetually; she might have alarmed people that passed in the street, and certainly the people over head would have heard, but yet these people underneath and above heard no cry, but one of them heard her cry beer, and heard Barnet come after her, and when she heard the voice of her fellow servant, would not it have been natural to have called to him; if she had not consented, she certainly might have made it known: I think there is not the least foundation for this prosecution, nor could it be supported in point of law, for she has not given that testimony that I should think would be sufficient to make it appear that he had carnal knowledge of her body.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Islington. At a quarter-past four o'clock in the morning of the 13th of September, I met the prisoner in the back road with this piece of timber under his arm - I said, "Mate, what is this?" he dropped it, and offered me 1s. 6d. to let him go, but I would not; he was then within a few hundred yards of the prosecutor's.</p>

            , JUN. This was my father's property; his name is Richard. I had seen it safe in the brick field, but I cannot say when; the prisoner had been in our employ three years, but when we found he was a returned transport we discharged him, and since he has been in our employ we have lost twenty-two planks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took this bit of plank by order of the foreman to lay over a dirty ditch, for some of my children to get a penny if they could; the foreman said I might have it if I brought it back at night.</p>

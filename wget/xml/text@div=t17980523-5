               <p>Q. Were the prosecutors, at that time, removing any olives from the quays? - A. Yes. When I met the prisoner, he had a half-barrel of olives; he was resting his half-barrel upon the Custom-house window; he was as far as I could see him; I was behind all the rest of the men walking in rotation.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men were there? - A. Four, with chests of oil.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you from him? - A. Not a hundred yards</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day-light? - A. It was the middle of the day, or thereabouts.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230007"></xptr>Q. Are you perfectly sure it was the prisoner that you saw? - A. Yes; a man that I did not know was lifting a half-barrel of olives from the Custom-house window on to the prisoner's back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same half-barrel that you had seen before? - A. Yes; I told him if he did not take the olives up in a better manner he would not carry many more olives from the quays; he had his hat in one hand, and appeared to be in a great sweat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any particular observations made use of to the prisoner? - A. No, not particularly; he said, he would get on as well as he could, and see if he could not carry it to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you ever know the prisoner at the bar before this transaction? - A. No; I have not been used to work on the quays.</p>
               <p>Q. He seemed to have a half-barrel of olives that he said he was taking to the warehouse-what warehouse do you suppose he was going to take them to? -(Mr. Alley objected to the question).</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did any thing pass to induce you to understand what warehouse he was going to take it to? - A. Messrs. Alwin's and Chapman's.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it day-light? - A. Yes; it was before four o'clock, within twenty yards from the Custom-house quays, in Thames-street; he had a half-barrel of olives upon his left shoulder, and his hat in his right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation take place between you and him? - A. No; I heard a man behind me speak to him, but I cannot tell what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner was employed by your master that day? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the 6th of March? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him afterwards? - A. On the 8th of April; when he was apprehended, the prisoner said, well, if I must go to Mr. Alwin's and Chapman's, I will go; I do not recollect any thing else that he said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He might be employed by the prosecutors for any thing you know to the contrary? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect, after the prisoner was apprehended, having any conversation with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hold out any inducement to him to confess himself guilty, or any threat? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What was communicated to you by the prisoner was communicated by you to the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And was not that taken down in writing? - I cannot say whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that or not form a part of the examination? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it did not? - A. It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to the conversation you are about to relate, what did you say to the prisoner at the bar? - A. He said he was brought up by one of the people, he did not know what for. I asked the man in the interim, whether he had been for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hear that? - A. It is most likely he must.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp contended that desiring an officer to be sent for, ought to be consirued into a threat, and that therefore evidence ought not to be given of what was said by the prisoner after.</p>
               <p>Court. Merely sending for a constable is a regular part of the business, and if that was to be the case, no conversation, after a prosecution was commenced, could be given in evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Was any body present at the time of the conversation but you and the prisoner? - A. Yes, Mr. Prandit, the warehouseman.</p>
               <p>Q. Now relate the conversation? - A. He said, he could not tell what it could be for, unless it was for a half barrel of olives he took from the Custom quay, put into a cart, and then upon his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other olives upon the Custom-house quay at that time, but your own? - A. No other in the river.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else to you? - A. He said, when he had it on his back, he attempted to proceed to our warehouse, he was stopped in Thames-street by some carts, and was under the necessity of going up one of the lanes, he thought, Harp-lane, and in coming across one of the cross lanes, he met with an accident, the barrel sell from his back, and being a poor man, and fearful of the damage, he ran away and left it; and he repeated it over several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of the olives you had lost afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge whether the prisoner at the bar was employed by you? - A. Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Has Mr. Johnson any partner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prisoner was employed by any body else under you, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot undertake to swear, of your own knowledge, that you have had any loss? - A. The quantity was landed right with the lighter bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the lighter bill here? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230009"></xptr>Mr. Alley. Q. (To Prandit.) Do you know, of your own knowledge, that there was any loss? - A. Yes, half a barrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner employed for your master that day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What other warehousemen have you? - A. White and Hull.</p>
               <p>Q. And White is not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you will not undertake to swear that White did not employ the prisoner that very day for that very business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Was it your business, or White's, to employ the men? - A. Mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who had known him upwards of twenty years, and gave him a good character. <rs id="t17980523-5-verdict25" type="verdictDescription">

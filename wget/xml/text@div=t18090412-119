On the 16th of March, about three o'clock in the afternoon, we all went together from my house over London bridge, within half a mile of the turnpike, to go by the waggon; we lost one another on the road; the prisoner had the bundle, she said she would go and look for Mrs. Patterson; she never returned. We had to come home again through the loss of our bundle. I found the prisoner about ten o'clock at night in Rosemary-lane; she told me she was knocked down and robbed of the bundle.</p>

            . I was going down to Portsmouth to see my husband, with Mrs. Butler; we gave our bundle containing all the things mentioned in the indictment to Mrs. Thompson to carry. When we came to London Bridge. I left Mrs. Butler; I asked them to stop at the church, I went to buy a bottle, and when I came back, I did not see either of them. I went on the road, thinking I should overtake the waggon, thinking they had got in; I overtook the waggon, they said there was no such person in the waggon. I came home, I did not see the prisoner till I heard she was in Whitechapel watchhouse; I knew her a great many years, I never knew any harm of her. The shawl that was found on her neck, had every appearance of one I put into the bundle, but I cannot swear to it.</p>

On Saturday, the 2d of February, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner applied to me for a horse and chaise, to go to Hounslow; I saw him myself - he himself wrote down "Clark, Medway-street, Horseferry-road," as where the horse and chaise were to be taken; I gave the direction up at Bow-street, and have not seen it since; my brother was present: I asked 14s. for the day - he said it was too much, and he paid my brother 13s. before he got into it; he was to return at seven o'clock that evening; I am sure he said it was to go to Hounslow, and I made out the ticket accordingly. He did not return the horse and chaise. We went to Bow-street, and found him there, in Brown's custody, that evening - I am sure he is the man; he was quite a stranger - I never saw him before. The horse was worth 14l.</p>

I am certain he said his name was Clark. I saw the same horse and gig at Bow-street that evening.</p>

            . I am a green-grocer, and live on Highgate-hill. On Saturday, the 2d of February, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the Red Lion public-house, Highgate, and bought this horse of him there; I did not buy the chaise; he asked 50s. for the horse; I said was that the lowest - he said I might have it for two guineas, and I gave him that sum; I asked his name - he said Mr. Clark; he then said, "Here is the set of harness you may buy;" I said I did not want it, but asked what he wanted for it - he said he would take 10s.; I suspected he had come by it improperly - I took him to Bow-street; the same horse was taken there; I sent for Brown; Eastwood came and claimed it - the prisoner was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I drove up to the door; he said,"Do you want to sell your horse?" I said, in a joke,"What do you mean to give me for it?" he said 2l., and, being rather in liquor, I took the 2l.; he then said, "What will you take for the harness?" I said 10s. - he offered me 5s.; I have friends, but did not wish to let them know of it.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Meredith: On Monday the 3d of March, I went to identify a pair of boots at the prisoner's lodgings in Bethlem-court; he was in our service at the time he was taken up; I found a pair of boots unfinished, with my mark upon them, and I brought them away with me; I found them in a corner of the room by the bed-side; they had never been sold from our house; I put my mark upon them before they were manufactured; they are an article that we do not fell, they are manufactured for the West-India trade, they were made in January last; on the 18th of January, when we took stock, these boots were taken up stairs, with other goods of a like description, there might be four or five dozen, I missed only this pair; this pair had a particular mark upon them, a double ten, because the men should not be deceived, they being awkward sized legs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.These boots were found when the prisoner was not present, but in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a common lodging-house, is it not? - A. Not that I know of; there is another person lodges in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you had not put a double ten upon a pair of boots within a month before? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>JAMES CORNWALL sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Meredith: I recollect seeing this pair of boots previous to the 18th of January, they were carried up stairs; and I can take my oath that I never sold them out of the shop. (The boots produced.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. These are old boots, I see? - A. Yes; they were new when they went out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have observed these boots if you had seen him with them on? - A. I never saw him with a pair of boots on in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was at work at your house every day in the week days? - A. Yes; but he might walk in them on Sundays.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose, that in ten days they could have been worn down in that manner? - A. I think they might; he was three days gone down to Gravesend.</p>
               <p>Mr. Meredith. These boots are my property; I know them by my man's mark inside; they are made for a particular trade; and in two days they might have been in the state in which they now are; they are made very flight for that trade.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the charge; I never saw the boots to my knowledge; I had opportunities if I had wished to steal from Mr. Meredith, he has trusted me with large parcels, and with money to his banker's. <rs id="t18000402-92-verdict506" type="verdictDescription">

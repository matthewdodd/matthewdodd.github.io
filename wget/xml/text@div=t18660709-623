                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live at 131, Pownall Road, Dalston—the prisoner is a cousin of my wife's—I had a daughter, Mary Ann—she was about two years and three or four weeks old—on 30th May I saw the child in the morning, and saw her again at dinner time—when I came back in the evening the child was missing, and, from some informa<lb></lb>tion, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, No. 3, Baldwin Court—I went down the court with the prisoner—the child was then in the front room on the bed, and was given to her out of the window by some one—she was in the court along with me and the policeman—it was a small four-roomed house—I took the child from the prisoner and said, "That is my child." She said, "No, it is not, it is mine"—I then gave her in charge to the police—before I gave her in charge she said, "That is my nephew." I said, "It is not your nephew; you know very well it is not a boy at all"—when I found the child she was dressed in a little red flannel frock, she had no stays on, and white socks and low shoes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I was at home all day on Wednesday, 30th May—the prisoner came to my house—she is my cousin—I had not seen her since I had been married, which is just turned three years—she came about four o'clock in the afternoon—my little girl was at home playing at ball with me—she took the little child up, scarcely spoke to me, and kissed it, and that is all—she afterwards said she wanted to go as far as the Triangle, at Hackney, to see her husband's sister, might she take the baby with her for half an hour?—I said "Yes," and I dressed it and let it go—it had a black velvet hat and scarlet feather, a white cape, a little pink cotton dress, white socks, and strap shoes, black; it had stays on—this is the frock and socks (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and these are the things found on the child when it was found and brought back—they were different from what she was dressed in before—they are not mine—there is a little red flannel frock—it had no drawers on when it went away, and it had drawers on when it came back; it had no stays on, and some shoes which were inferior to those that she had on—the shoes and socks are very different from what I sent her out in, but the little frock there is no difference in—take the whole things together, I think they are about the same in value—she came home in the same hat that she went away in, and the same cape—I saw the child again on the Saturday—I had given information in the meantime.</p>

               <p>They are, I believe, quite new—the shoes the child had on when she went away were not new, but they were a better article—I don't know whether this red frock is new—the prisoner was on very friendly terms with me, and I was very pleased to see her—I would not have let the child go away with her for two or three days, because I had not seen her for such a time—I did not kiss her when she went away—she told me to kiss my baby—I did not invite her to come again—I thought she was going to bring my baby back.</p>

                  </hi> (193 N). I was on duty at the Kingsland Road police-station on 2nd June—the prosecutor came in and gave in a description of a child of his that he said had been stolen—I had the prisoner in custody the same morning for breaking some windows—she had a baby in her arms at that time which answered the description given by the pro<lb></lb>secutor—the prisoner was asked by the sergeant the same evening whose child this was, and she said it was hers, and it sucked at the breast—in consequence of the description, I was sent with the prosecutor in search of the prisoner and the child—I went to a place called the "London Apprentice" public-house, in Old Street Road—I found the prisoner there and asked her where the child was—she said, "I am going to fetch the child"—I got into a cab with her, and told the cabman to drive to No. 3, Baldwin Court, Baldwin Street, St. Luke's—I saw the child there, it was apparently on a bed—it was put through the window—the prosecutor said, "This is my child"—the prisoner said, "This is my child"—he then gave her into custody for stealing the child—we got into the cab—the prisoner said to the prosecutor, "Give me the child"—he immediately gave her the child, and she carried it on her knee to the station—it might be a mile or rather better from the prosecutor's house to where we found the child.</p>

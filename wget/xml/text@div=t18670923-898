                  </hi>. I carry on business at 67, Houndsditch, as a wholesale stationer—on the 31st July the prisoner came to my warehouse and said he was going to open a shop, and wished us to supply him with goods—I sent Messer to take the orders from him—I afterwards supplied him with goods amounting to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and sent an invoice with them—I went to see him myself two days previously, and he then told me that he would purchase the goods for ready money—he held some situation besides keeping the shop—I recommended him to some of my neighbours—he said he would pay cash—I did not have any reference—when I sent the goods he did not pay for them directly, and I sent a man down to fetch them, and he came back with a cheque—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is payable to Messrs. Somers and Co., signed M. Seckel—I looked at that cheque, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of looking at it I went to Portland Place, Clapton, the same even<lb></lb>ing, to the address he had given me—it was after dark and the shop was shut—he was out when I got there and I waited his return—when I saw him I said that I did not believe the cheque was good for anything, and I required cash or my goods back—he said the cheque would be paid at Tavistock, or at Robarts's—he said he had a good account there—I saw five cases in the shop, I had supplied him with eight—he said he had sold three</p>

I am in the employment of Mr. Somens—I was sent to Portland Place, North Clapton, with some parcels—I did not find any one there, so did not leave the parcels—I went again on 3rd of Angnst—it was a shop newly fitted up—I was there in the day, but it was not opened—I left the goods with the prisoner and he gave me this cheque—I did not see him write it—he did not make any observation to me, but I said, "You have forgotten to take the discount off"—he said he would take it off some other bill—this is the bill that I took with me—I went back to my master and showed him the cheque, and went back to the prisoner's place in the evening, but he was not there—he came up shortly after on a cab—I believed the cheque to be a good one—I delivered eight cases in all—when I went back I only saw five—three were gone.</p>

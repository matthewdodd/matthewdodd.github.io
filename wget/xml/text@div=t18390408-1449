                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward William Locker; he is one of the Commissioners of Greenwich Hospital. On the 31st of December the prisoner called at my house—she was quite a stran<lb></lb>ger—she stated that her husband was transported, and she was very anxious to join him—that a ship was lying at Gravesend, and her children were on board, and she was very anxious to raise money to go there—she showed me this card, which she said had been given her by the owners of the ship, and it was to sail very shortly—seeing the card I believed her story, and gave her a crown and some trifling articles—she did not give me the card, bat laid it down and forgot it—I found it after she left.</p>

               <p>would put it at one-half of that, and she should go in a cabin by herself and her two children for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave her this card—she said she would go and get the money, that she had got 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the hand of a friend in the City, and she would bring me that in the course of a quarter of an hour—I told her the vessel would sail in a few days, and it was then lying in the London Docks—I did not see her again—her children were never on board the vessel to my knowledge—the next I heard of her was by a letter from Mrs. Locker inclosing this card, which I had given the prisoner—the ship was at Gravesend one day, on her passage.</p>

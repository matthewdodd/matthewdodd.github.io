            . I keep the George, at Stratford. On the morning of Tuesday, the 12th of March, I saw the prisoner at my house; he came about half after ten, alone; in about half an hour, he was joined by another person; that other person brought a bundle; they breakfasted, and staid at my house two or three hours. I did not see them leave my house. When they went; they left the bundle to be taken care of; I did not see them go, but I missed them. They came again in the evening; the bundle was left in the room where we have each parcels; they asked me in the evening if there was any conveyance to town, and they went to London at about nine o'clock, by a return post chaise belonging to the Three Nunns at Aldgate. The prisoner at the bar had been to my house at different times before; I have seen him dealing at my house several times.</p>

            . I rent the tap at the Three Nunns. On the night of the 12th of March, the prisoner and another man came there in a return post chaise belonging to our house; it was about ten o'clock when they came. The prisoner at the bar delivered a parcel into my care, and asked me to take care of it for him; he did not say until when. After that, they both went away in company together. In consequence of a suspicion I entertained, I sent for a constable. The prisoner returned in about half an hour, and I had got the constable in the house. I asked the prisoner whether he was going to take the parcel away? he said, yes, he was, and he made towards the door of the room where the parcel was, and seeing the constable there, he immediately turned back, and went out of the house, and the constable followed him, and took him in the yard, and brought him back into the house.</p>

            . I am an officer of Aldgate, and I was sent for by the last witness, between ten and eleven on the night of the 12th of March; I was in the house when the prisoner came in the second time, and the moment he clapped his eye on me, he turned about, and went off; I knew he knew my person very well. I asked him if the property was his? he said, it was not; that he had accompanied a man from Startford, and that the man had begged him to have the parcel taken care of for him; he mentioned the name of Lynch. I took him into custody; and the next day, I found out that the prosecutors had lost such articles as the parcel contained.</p>

            . I look at this property; it consists of all the things that we missed; it is the properly of my employers.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Thursday morning, about half past nine, I got my goods, consisting of jewellery articles, ready, and went out as far as Whitechapel, to look out for the Coggeshall and Chelorsford coach, to go down the road as far as Stratford. I walked from the turnpike to Mr. Moss's house, and then I called for a glass of rum and water. I took out my goods, and there was a man came in with a bag, and sat himself down by me; he asked me where my goods were made? I told him they were made in London, and I told him I was going to London in the course of the evening, and he said, he would go with me. I went out about my business after that, and returned again in the evening; this man was there then. I stopped a return post chaise, and he and I got into it together, and went to the Three Nunns at Aldgate; I went in there, with a man, and called for a glass of rum and water. This man asked me if I would have the goodness to ask the landlord to take care of the bag for him, and the landlord said he would. I told the man he would find it as safe as in his own house the next morning. After I had returned back, and drank my rum and water, I was going back from the tap-room to the coffee-room, when Mr. Ray came and caught hold of me, and asked me was that parcel mine? I said no, it was not; it belonged to a man who had come to Town with me in a returned post chaise. He asked me if I knew what were the contents of the bag? and I told him, I knew no more than the child unborn.</p>

            . I live in Golden-lane, near Barbican, No. 135. I have kept a house there for twenty-one years. I know the prisoner at the bar; he had lodged in my first floor three or four months, and lived there on the 11th and 12th of March, I always examined the house before I went to bed at night, and none of my lodgers are suffered to keep late hours. I am confident that the prisoner was at home before ten and eleven o'clock that night, of the 11th of March. Mr. Griffiths was with him. The latest hour I saw him at home was before ele<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030043"></xptr>ven o'clock, and I am sure he was not out after that; because I always fasten my door at eleven o'clock, and don't suffer any one to go out; if he went out after that, I must have heard him. I let Mr. Griffiths out myself; he is a jeweller, in Blacklow-street, and makes the seals for the watches.</p>

            . I know the prisoner at the bar, and slept in his house, on the night of the 11th of March. I had lately come to town, and my mother had no room for me. I was there the whole of the afternoon. I don't know whether I drank tea there or not. I saw Mr. Griffiths there, and he went away about eleven o'clock. I did not sleep in the same appartment with Mr. Phillips and his wife. Mr. Phillips and his wife went to bed a few minutes after eleven o'clock. I got up about seven o'clock in the morning; and went into their room for my bonnet; and awoke Mr. Phillips, who was then in bed. I went to my mother's, and returned about half palf eight o'clock, and saw Mr. Griffiths at Mr. Phillip's then cleaning some seals and a chain. I can't say what Phillips was doing; but I think he was near the fire side; I think he had dressed himself to go out, but I am not possitive. Griffiths went away rather after nine. After Griffiths went away, Phillips got his goods ready, and put them into his pocket and went out.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM GRIFFITHS. I am a jeweller I saw the prisoner at his lodgings, on the night of the 11th of March; I went there in consequence of his being in debt with me three shilling and six-pence. I believe it had turned ten in the evening when I went. I staid there nearly an hour; I did not return until the following morning. The prisoner came to me at my residence about half past seven o'clock, and staid with me some minutes; he begged of me to clean up some metallic chains and seals for him, and I told him I could not as I had not the materials, namely, rouge and leather. He then said, if you will come home to my place, I will furnish you with the materials. He then went away and I followed him; it was past eight o'clock when I got to his place; that I am certain of. I cleaned the articles, and as I was going back home, it was five minutes after nine by the brewhouse clock, and that is all I know.</p>

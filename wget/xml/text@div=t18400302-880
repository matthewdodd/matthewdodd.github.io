Between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of the 20th of February, I was walking along Pull Mall—I observed the prisoner and his companion following me—when I got to Waterloo-place, the prisoner took up the tail of my coat twice, and he came on my heels—he stopped back a little while, and then he and his companion followed me again—the prisoner took the handkerchief out of my pocket—I turned and collared him—he gave it to his companion who went away with it—I am quite sure I saw the handkerchief in the pri<lb></lb>soner's hand, and be passed it to his companion—it was like my handker<lb></lb>chief, and it was mine—the prisoner was not a yard from we when I turned and collared him.</p>

I carry on business as a salt and stone merchant, at No. 8 Wharf, Paddington—the prisoner has been in my service about four years as clerk and collector—my son manages my business—it was the prisoner's duty to collect moneys and account to me at once—I have a customer named Phillipson—this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the prisoner's writing; it is for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the signature, "John Moore," is also his writing, and also the endorsement, "John Moore," on this cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never gave him authority to endorse cheques for me; he had never done so before that I know of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 51, East India Road—on Sunday night, 26th February last, about 6.30, I was called to see the prisoner's wife, at 10, Pigot Street, Limehouse—that was the first time I had seen her—I examined her—she complained of great thirst, and in the chamber<lb></lb>pot I found seven clots of arterial blood—I asked if she had a cough—she said "No"—I listened to the chest, and found the sound so obscure that I really could not determine what was the matter with her—I said</p>

               <p>"Have you nothing else to tell me?" for I was really going away without knowing what was the matter with her—she said "Yes; I know I shall die; will you see me righted?"—she then made a statement.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was leaving the room, after I had done what I thought requisite, under the impression that she was dying, but to provide remedies with a hope to save her—I could not say how soon she would die—it was not my impression that she would die that night—nothing was sent for to me, for her, afterwards—I advised them to get the parish doctor—I never saw her again before her death—I was asked for a sleeping-draught that night, but I said it would kill her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my husband, at 58, Francis Street, Limehouse—I knew the deceased two years—she was the prisoner's wife—I saw her several times before her death—Saturday, 11th February, was the first, when she came to my house after the ill-usage that caused her death—the prisoner came in while she was there—he asked her for the money he had given her, and he struck her in the face with his fist—she made no reply—she cried, and fainted away—the blow made a very bad mark on her face, and it was there when she was dead—I told him the money was in the vase on the chimney-piece, at their lodging; she had told me where she left it—he then went away, and in about three-quarters of an hour she went to Mrs. Payers, at 10, Pigot Street, where she remained till she died—I went there to see her several times—I saw her on Monday night, the 27th, as she died on the next morning—a lady came into the room while I was there—I had some conversation with her about her state—she told me she feared she could not live—she had frequently told me before how she was ill-used, and she told me she did not think she could live, she felt so ill—she told me that several times in the previous week, that the doctor did not give her any hopes—I took the prisoner into her room about 8 o'clock on the Sunday evening previous to her death—she was in bed—she said to him "You villain! you have killed me at last"—he cried, and was going to leave the room—I asked bun to come back and remain with her, as I thought she was dying; and I put a chair by the bedside, and asked him to sit there, and I left the room, and left them together—I did not hear him speak while I was in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw her on the Monday, the next day—she did not ask me to go to Dr. Giles—I heard her say that she should like to see Dr. Giles, and she was going to ask Mrs. McKenzie to fetch him to cure her; that she should like to live a little longer; she should like to see another doctor—that was on the Friday night—Dr. Nightingale had been attending her—she asked me what I thought of her—I told her I thought she was dying—that was on the Friday—she did not say much on the Monday night—she could scarcely breathe then—she asked me to come next morning at 7 o'clock, to see her, and she was dead then—she frequently told me she could not live, after the ill-usage she received from her husband—she always complained of his ill-usage—she told me, on the Monday night, that Dr. Giles was going to send her a sleeping draught, as she had had no sleep for many nights—she said she had no hope; she thought she was dying, and she feared she should not live till the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Mrs. Desmond during her illness—I was with her on Monday evening, the 27th February—I was there on the Sunday evening, when Dr. Giles was there—after he left, she asked if I thought she would get better; that was about 9 o'clock—I said no doubt she would—I did think so, I never thought it was death—I stopped with her till 10 o'clock—I did not see the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She did not tell me she feared she should not live till morning—I did not hear her say anything of the kind—I thought she was very bad—she said she had caught a very bad cold—I was present all the time Dr. Giles was there; he came about 9 o'clock—I went for him, and he came about five minutes after me—I heard what she said to the doctor—I did not hear her say "I know I shall die; will you see me righted?"—she never said that; it is untrue—she never named it; no such conversation took place—I have known the prisoner about two years—he is no friend of mine; I never spoke much with him—I knew his wife for years—she was no friend of mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. GILES</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I know it was 6.30 on the Sunday evening that I went to see the deceased, because when I left the house, I let my wife out to go to church, and I then went and made up the medicine, and sent it round to the woman; the church bells were ringing when Mrs. Mackensie came to me—to show how little reliance is to be placed upon that witness, she told me that no other doctor had attended her, when she knew Dr. Nightingale had—she was in the room all the time—I remained eight or nine minutes—I have heard the woman Mackenzie's statement, it is untrue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE LUSH</hi>, <hi rend="italic">after hearing this evidence, held that the statement of the deceased was admissible; the expression made we of by her, according to the evidence of</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. GILES</hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). When she said "I know I shall die; will you see me righted?" I made no reply, and she said "This night fortnight, at 1.5 in the morning, my husband threw me down and kicked me, And said he would <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> me out"—she then said to Mrs. Mackenzie "Help me to show my bruises"—Mackenzie lifted the clothes off her leg, and she showed me her thigh—there was a bruise on the lower third, and also one on the buttock; they were large black discolourations—they were of a severe character, and fifty hours after death, when I performed the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, they were still there, which is a very unusual thing—they were caused by some heavy instrument, a kick, or something of that kind;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187104030058"></xptr>
               <p>besides those bruises, there were small green patches, evidently the result of previous injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The witness proceeded to describe the postmortem appearances, and stated that death resulted from valvular disease of the heart, which the violence might possibly have accelerated.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. NIGHTINGALE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">who was also examined, could not say that death was accelerated by violence, the disease being of such a nature that she might have died at any time.</hi>

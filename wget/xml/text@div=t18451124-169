                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Moakes, and live in Duke-street, Westminster-road. On Thursday, the 30th of Oct., between eleven and twelve o'clock, I heard some person walking through the passage of the house—I went into the wash-house at the end of the passage, and observed a pair of scales there belonging to my husband, moving, as if somebody had just touched them—I looked, and missed two weights, which I had seen there not two minutes before—I went into the yard, and heard the creaking of a basket—"I called out to Esther Bradley, who came and opened the privy door, and found the prisoner there—I did not know her—she had no business there—Bradley asked her where the two weights were—she said she knew nothing about them—I have since seen one produced by Ould, which I know to be my husband's—it was in the scales before I missed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge with Mrs. Moakes—she called me—I opened the privy door, and saw the prisoner coming out—I went into the privy, looked down, and saw a weight in the soil—I accused the prisoner of it—she said she knew nothing of it—a policeman was sent for—the prisoner asked me to let her go into the privy again, which I did, and when I went in I saw some bricks had been thrown down—I saw the weight taken out from the soil—this is it.</p>

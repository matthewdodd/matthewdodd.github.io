               <p>Q. You lost some lead from it - A. I did; on the 23d of April the lead was affixed over the garret window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the lead that was taken from the prisoner - A. I did, I saw it at the office in Worship street; a few days afterwards I saw it tried upon the top of the garret window, it corresponded correctly; it appeared to be about half of it. I believe it to be the lead that came off there.</p>

            . You live at Bethnal Green - A. Yes, I had the house in charge, I live next door. On the 23d of April last, about four o'clock in the morning, I heard something fall, as though it came from the top of the house, it fell very heavy. In the morning I found the gate and the door of the house open; I looked at the ground were this fell, there was an impression on the ground. I heard of a man being in custody for stealing of lead; that very morning I sent to Mr. Seabrook to come forward to see if any thing was lost; accordingly it appeared that this lead belonging to the top of the window was gone; I went with the officer and saw the lead fitted; every thing seemed to correspond exactly. There was only half of it.</p>
               <p>- BOOTH. I am a watchman. On the 23d of April, about half past five, I saw the prisoner at the bar just on the other side of the madhouse at Bethnal Green.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he upon him - A He had this lead and a chopper in the sack; I took him to the watchhouse, and afterwards I went back and fetched the lead; I took the lead to the office; I was present when the lead was fitted upon the top of the garret window; it appeared to fit.</p>

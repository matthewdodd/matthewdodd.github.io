               <p>On the 30th of August, between six and seven in the evening, I was below in the kitchen. I came up, and saw the prisoner just going out of the door. I ran after her, and called out Stop thief! and Mrs. Davis stopped her. When she was stopped, she flung my gown in Mrs. Davis's face. Mrs. Davis took it up. I sent for a constable, and gave charge of the prisoner.</p>

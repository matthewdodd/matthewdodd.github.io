On Saturday, the 16th of August, between nine and ten o'clock at night, he went through my shop into the parlour, and staid there about half an hour - I was busy in the shop; it was dark-my candles were lit. In about half an hour he came through the shop and went ou - I noticed his looking very pale-the shop-door was open; I did not speak to him. I keep my notes and money in a trunk in my bed-room, which is on the first-floor, over my parlour. He came from the parlour through the shop; there is a door opens out of my parlour into the passage, and up to the bed-room-there is only a latch to the door; he had nothing about him. He went out between nine and ten o'clock-two of my children were in the parlour with him; one of them is nine, and the other fourteen years old. I saw them both asleep in the parlour while he was there-one of them goes early to market with me. I went up to bed about half-past twelve o'clock, and missed my trunk out of the bedroom. I had seen it safe in the morning - I was at home all day. The trunk was locked, and contained six 1l. notes, thirteen silver tea and salt-spoons, different writings, and linen; I had the key down stairs with me. My bed room door was not locked. I have no lodgers.</p>

Soon afterwards I went up stairs, through the parlour, and as I came down, I found the private street - door open-it is usually shut and chained.

On Sunday morning, the 17th of August, at two o'clock, the prisoner, William Pack (who is a spare watchman on duty also), came and told me his brother had committed a robbery the night before; that he had stolen a portmauteau from behind a post-chaise. I asked him what it contained? he said several notes, silver spoons, napkins, and papers, and that they had bought a watch with the notes at Mr. Lormier's, in Shoreditch; and they had passed the notes in the name of Bailey. He went to his duty, returned at four o'clock, and told me the same story. I asked him if there were any initials on the spoons? he said there was S.H. At five o'clock I came off duty, and told Gibbs of it; we then informed Sorry, the headborough, and all three of us went to Saunders William Pack's master's house, in Gloucester-street, where he lived. This was on Sunday, it was about a quarter after five o'clock. We did not like to alarm the house, and went to

I reprimanded him for having any thing to do with the robbery, and asked him if he knew where his brother stole the things from? he said he did. I said, "then you knew they were stolen from Mrs. Noble's?" he said, Yes. I asked him why he did not immediately return them to her, if he was not a partaker of the guilt? he said, it was at the time of his going on duty, and he could not neglect it to give information. I asked him where the portmanteau was? he said, it was thrown away with the linen, and the papers burnt. I asked him if he knew of it when it was done? he said, Yes. I had him locked up.</p>

He said, he saw three men throw it there, and he picked it up, and brought it to his brother's house in Shoreditch, who was a watchman, and that he and his brother took it to his mother's room, and broke it open. I asked him what it contained? he said, plate and notes. I asked him what he had done with the money? he said, his brother bought a watch at Lormier's, in Shoreditch; after which they went to the Pigeons public-house, and had some drink; and as they returned, his brother asked him for the spoons, and he refused to give them to him. He said he burnt the papers, and the trunk, with the linen, they threw away in Hare-street-fields.</p>

            , about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 17th of August, at Mrs. Noble's house. I found him there, and asked him what he had done with the things which were in the trunk? he said, he picked it up in a field at the bottom of Gloucester-street, and he and his brother opened it at his mother's house. He took the notes and plate out-the other things, he said were cumbersome, and not so easy to be got away, and they were burnt by his brother's advice-the trunk was thrown away in Hare-street - fields, and he bought a watch at Mr. Lormier's, in Shoreditch, with three of the notes, and got tipsey with another 1l. note, at a public-house in Shoreditch. He did not know what became of the rest, for he was very much intoxicated. I asked him where the watch was that he had bought? he said, it was at his master's house, nearly opposite the side of the bed. I went there with him - He pointed out the place - I broke open a board and took it out. He said the plate was at No. 5, Thompson's-court, Half-moon-alley, Bishopsgate. I told him I should go there, and leave him in custody the while; he said it was of no use, it was in such a particular place I could not find it - I took him there; it was at Mrs. Hoiles's house. He took me up to a front room on the first floor - I asked Mrs. Hoiles where it was? she said, "O, my G-d, it is here, I wish I had never known any thing about it." I told Pack to take it out. He took a pair of pincers and broke open a board over the window-ledge, and at the bottom of the window he took up a cloth in which were eleven spoons.</p>

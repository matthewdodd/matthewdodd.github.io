            . I am an officer in the impress service. On the evening of the 3d of November, between seven and eight o'clock, I was going from Tower hill towards St. Catherine's; I heard a noise, and saw the prisoner running from St. Catherine's lane towards me; I supposed him to be a sailor running from some of my men; I stopped him, and he dropped two cheese; as soon as I stopped him I asked several questions; he told me he took them from a boy. I took him to the constable's house; I went with the constable and patrol, and saw him locked up in the cage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. What time of the night was this - A. Between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Q. He may have been running away from your men - A. I thought so; he had not the appearance of a sailor.</p>
               <p>JOHN - I am beadle of the parish. The prisoner was brought to me on the 3d of November by the patrol and the press master.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he - A. Two cheese. I asked him how he came by the cheese; he told me that a boy was running down New street, he dropped two cheese, he took them up, and was following of the boy as there were two men after him.</p>

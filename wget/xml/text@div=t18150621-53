I went to them and told them, they must go away, which they did, into Edgeware road. I saw no more of them until I had to go down John-street, when they were there again; I told them to go away quietly. The prisoner came over and told me I was a d - d old b - r, and asked me what I had to do with him? I told him I wanted him to go along quietly. He asked me did I know who he was, I told him I did not, nor did I care; he said then I shall let you know; he produced a pistol, and laid it across the back of his left hand, it was directed in a right line to me; he snapped it at the upper part of my body; if it had gone off, it could not have missed me; I attempted to secure the prisoner but he snapped the pistol a second time, it shewed fire both times. He then ran away and ran after the man and woman, he was afterwards apprehended in John-street. I am sure the man at the bar is the man who snapped the pistol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner appeared to be quite drunk, he was able to walk, but he staggered very much; he had not been creating any disturbance at the time I spoke to him, and when he first snapped the pistol; at the time he put the pistol up I went over to him to take him by the collar. I had no intention of striking him, I was going to take I him up for the violent name he had called me. saw the flint give fire, and it was not the cracking of the pistol lock.</p>

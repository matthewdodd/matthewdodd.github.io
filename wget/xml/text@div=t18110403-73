On the Monday he came into my service. On Tuesday, when he opened the door, he said that a servant in livery had ordered a gallon of Hollands gin to be sent to Captain Lewis, No. 2, Hollis-street, Cavendish-square, with change for a note, he did not say at that time the sum. I put the gallon of Hollands gin into bottles, and sealed them, put them into a basket. I then gave him change for a two pound note and gave him the liquor to carry The gin came to twenty-eight shillings; I gave him twelve shillings in silver, he went away with it and returned in a quarter of an hour: he said, the captain desired change for a ten pound note, he was going out of town immediately. I gave him six one pound bank notes, a two pound note, and twelve shillings that he had before made up the change for a ten pound note; he went away with the change, and did not return. I communicated it to the officer, and he was apprehended. I enquired at the house and found that no such person as Captain Lewis lived there, he had three weeks before; I went to Houndsditch and enquired for Mr. Mason, I could not find any such person lived there.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner; I told the prosecutor I knew the man. When I apprehended him I introduced the prosecutor, I said to Edwards, do you know that gentleman; he said, no, he did not. I then said, sit, is that the man that you sent as your servant; he said, yes, that is the man, and I give you charge of him. He was searched in my presence, a one-pound note was found upon him, and eight shillings in silver, and two shillings in halfpence. I apprehended him on the same day, about eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the morning a gentleman's servant came to my master's house, he said bless my soul, how late your people lay a bed; he said he wanted a gallon of hollands gin for his master, he could not stop any longer. I was to bring a gallon of hollands gin to Mr. Lewis, No 2, Hollis-street, Cavendish-square, I went with it, my master gave me change for a two pound note; I met the man, he took it; he said he wanted change for a ten pound note. I returned to my master for the change, and the man took it of me; he told me to wait, and he would bring me the ten pound note, and the man not coming I went to the house, they said the captain had left the house a month. I was afraid of going back to my master.</p>

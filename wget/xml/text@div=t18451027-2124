                  </hi>. I live in Tothill-street, Westminster, and am a boot-maker. On the 29tb of Sept. a young man came to my shop, who has since absconded—in consequence of what he said, I took four pairs of Wellington boots to No. 25, James-street, Buckingham-gate—I there saw Edwin Locke—at his request I left the four pairs of boots for an hour—I returned in an hour, and then I had three pairs returned out of the four, and, to the best of my belief, they were returned to me by the same Edwin Locke—I said it was very strange; I wanted the money or the boots—I had merely left the four pairs on trial—they had never asked the price—he said his brother had got them on, and he was just gone to my place to pay me—that was all I could get out of him—I returned, and found he had not been—I went back, and saw James Locke—I never saw Edwin Locke again till I took an officer, and gave him in charge—I and the policeman found the boots in pawn, in Pimlico, for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Maria Locke had not been to my shop at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Walker, a pawnbroker, at Pimlico. This pair of boots were pawned at our shop on the 30th of Sept., for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as it appears by the duplicate, by a female, in the name of Ann Smith—I have seen the female prisoner about three times—I have no recollection of her pawning these—I have no recollection of taking them in—I do not know that the female prisoner has pawned at our shop—I have seen her there.</p>

I went to No. 25, James-street—I saw Edwin Locke—I told him that he and his mother were charged with getting boots under false pretences—he denied all knowledge of ordering the boots, or anything—he said Mr. Gawthorp had never seen him before—it was a large house, but very little furniture in it—there was a large pair of curtains at the window, and, from the appearance of it, any person on the opposite side of the way might take it to be a respectable house—the beds were on the floor, and very little furniture.</p>

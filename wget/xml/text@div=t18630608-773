                  </hi>. I am a consulting surgeon, practising at 16, De Beauvoir-terrace, Kingsland-road—I recollect being called in to see a person who is now dead, of the name of Kendrick—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was a memorandum made at the time, the first time I was called to see Mr. Kendrick—it was 21st August, 1862—I think it was about 7 in the evening that I went—I had been sent for at an earlier period of the day—he was suffering from hemorrhage of the lungs—I saw the prisoner there—I prescribed medicine for Kendrick, and ice to be administered very frequently, with great regularity—I requested that some one should sit up with him during the night—the prisoner came in immediately afterwards—I repeated those directions in his presence.</p>

I reside at 10, Lower Pelham-street, Spital-fields—I am a machinist—I am the widow of William Kendrick, who died on 25th October last—he was a very great sufferer—I recollect his being attended in August by Mr. Foreshaw—he had a bleeding of the lungs—Mr. Foreshaw said that some one must sit up with him the whole of the night, for he was in a dangerous state—I sent for Mr. Everett, and he came and sat up with him—my husband wished some one to sit up with him—we were to apply cold fomentations to his chest, and give him medicines, cold cloths were to be used, not ice—it was to stop the bleeding—I sat up with him also—Mr. Everett remained, and sat up with him the whole of the night—at times he applied the cold fomentations, and at times I applied them—he went away between 7 and 8 in the morning—I am quite certain he did not leave the house between the time Mr. Foreshaw left, and 8 in the morning.</p>

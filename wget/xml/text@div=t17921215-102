            , on the 7th of December, when I came from dinner about two o'clock, I found the prisoner at the bar looking at some shirts in the shop; Mr. Clark is a <rs id="t17921215-102-viclabel569" type="occupation">linen draper</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. I have three small children besides this in my arms; and I am very innocent of it; I went to buy a shirt for my husband, and I had this child in my arms, and I suppose I must have taken it up with the child; I am very innocent, or else I would not have gone into the pork shop.</p>

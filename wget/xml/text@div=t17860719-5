            ; since I came home, I have had a pretty considerable legacy; on the 29th of May as I was coming along just by the New Church in the Strand, I picked up two women, the prisoner was one.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - I was pretty solid.</p>
               <p>But a sailor's pretty solidness we do not understand? - I was capable of remembering what I did; I picked up the prisoner and another woman, and went into Mrs. Flannagan's house in Bridges-street, Covent-Garden, there was a bowl of negus brought up, both the women went up in the room; we continued there about half an hour, I had about eight or nine guineas in my pocket, and I had four bank notes of one hundred pounds each, which I had seen about me three or four hours before; I had been along with some friends, and staid a little too late; I am sure I had them with me when I picked her up; it was in this pocket book, in my side pocket; I had not this coat on; I had my coat buttoned; I got off the chair, took hold of the bowl, and just wetted my lips, and I set down in the chair, and I was no more, I lost myself quite.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive it was intoxicating liquor? - Yes, I did; I awoke in half an hour, and the women were gone, my coat was unbuttoned, my pocket book was taken out, and found on the ground, and my hat taken off the table, the nine guineas and the notes gone; I enquired at the house; I saw these two women about a week after; my wife gave information at the public office on the Wednesday following; I saw them on the Friday at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>What length of time had you of observing them, before you picked them up? - No great length of time; I saw the prisoner, and knew her again; I have no doubt upon it; I was sober enough to see and know the person of the prisoner; I have never recovered any part of my property; two notes were changed in the bank; here is a gentleman that knows how they came into the bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner's counsel. Where had you been drinking? - At Islington; I was pretty solid.</p>
               <p>Had you had no conversation with other people, previous to this? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that at the time you met these people in the Strand, you was not in company with another woman? - Before I saw them, I had no woman.</p>
               <p>At what place were you, when you first came up to them? - At the New Church in the Strand.</p>
               <p>I believe it was at the wall of Somerset-house? - It was near that.</p>



               <p>I believe there are thereabouts some low prostitutes; now, was not you in company at that time with one of those prostitutes?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190009"></xptr> - No further than with the prisoner, and the other woman; I was not picked up by any body before I met those two women.</p>
               <p>Which of the two ladies did you select for your companion? - The prisoner that stands there.</p>
               <p>Are you as sure of that as you are of any thing you have sworn to day? - Yes, Sir, I am.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, will you take upon you to swear, that you did not desire the prisoner to leave the room, and that you was in company with the other woman you picked up? - No, Sir, I did not, I was in company only with this woman; they were both in the room, and this was my companion.</p>
               <p>Were not you behind a hackney coach that night? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Who did you follow? - I followed some gentleman and asked him to stop; he asked me what I wanted; I said, Sir, I have no harm to you, but I have lost some property and I thought it might be in that coach; I understood there were two ladies in the coach; I did not charge these two women at all; upon which the gentleman said, I was going to rob him, and he gave charge of me, and the watchman said, I was so much of a gentleman; as soon as I awoke, I came down stairs, I saw the servant maid and told her, I had lost a large property, she said, she knew nothing at all about it, and she did not know the woman; I saw the prisoner about a week after I was robbed, and I said, do you know me? I shewed her the pocket book, and said, do you know this? and you have the property that was in it; then I threatened to send for a constable, and went out for one; I believe it was twenty minutes before I could get one, it might be half an hour, it might be three hours.</p>
               <p>Was it twenty minutes, or was it three hours? - It was twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to say just now it was three hours?</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now take your choice, which of the two it is, the three hours, or the twenty minutes? - Twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you find these women in the same place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Waiting for you to apprehend them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What account did you give of this property when you arrived at Bow-street, what did you call it? - Four hundred pounds in bank notes.</p>
               <p>Did you describe it in the security it was vested in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What security did you say? - A note on the bank.</p>
               <p>Did not you say at Bow-street that they were Exchequer bills? - I received them from the Exchequer; I will now swear they were bank notes, and it was the prisoner that was with me.</p>
               <p>How come you now, Sir, to swear they were bank notes? - I did not rightly understand them, the Justice proved that they were bank notes; my wife shewed me one of them, one that I happened to lay down, I mislaid it, and they happened to find it; I received them at the Exchequer-office at Westminster.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave Islington? - At seven.</p>
               <p>Can you tell us the places you was at between seven in the evening, and Somerset-house? - Yes, Sir, I found myself in Cheapside.</p>

               <p>What did you do between seven and two? - I went from Islington to the Strand.</p>
               <p>Was you these hours coming from Islington to the Strand? - Not quite so many hours.</p>
               <p>You say you came from Islington at seven, and at two you picked up these girls? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not mislay all the bank notes? - I will not swear that I did mislay them all only one.</p>
               <p>You can swear you did mislay more? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Will you, after having been so drunk, take upon yourself to say you did not mislay any more but that one.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190010"></xptr>Court. Did you know that night that you had four or five? - I knew I had only four; I knew I had left one behind.</p>
               <p>Did not you imagine the next morning when you saw your wife, that they were all five lost? - I did not imagine so.</p>
               <p>You will not tell me I suppose how many women you picked up from seven till two? - None but these two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you give either of these women any money while you was there? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not? - Yes, I gave Hetty

             a guinea; I put the rest in my pocket; I am sure they were left in my pocket when I went to sleep.</p>
               <p>Jury. I want to ask you a question or two, you was at the public house at Islington? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many people were there? - Three or four.</p>
               <p>Friends and acquaintance, or strangers? - There was no acquaintance of mine, I dropped in promiscuously, they seemed to be gentlemen like.</p>
               <p>You left it at seven o'clock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was the next house you went to? - At Cow-cross.</p>
               <p>Drinking there at a public house? - Not in company; the next house was in Cheapside, I drank by myself, then I went to Whitechapel, then I came back to this end of the town; I was with nobody else till I came to the New Church in the Strand.</p>
               <p>When you saw the woman of the house and you produced your pocket book, and said, she must know it, was any person present? - Yes, there was a man.</p>
               <p>Court. You never saw these bank notes from the time you went into the house at Islington? - No, Sir, never after I left the house.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Flannagan; I remember the prosecutor coming to our house with two ladies on the 29th of May.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning might it be? - About two I let them in, I shewed them into the first floor all together.</p>
               <p>Did you carry them any thing to drink? - A bowl of negus.</p>
               <p>Do you know the ladies? - I cannot say I know them, they did not belong to the house, the gentleman brought them in out of the street; I should know them if I was to see them.</p>
               <p>Look about? - There is one of the ladies.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay together? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Did they all continue in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who went away first? - Both the women, about half after two.</p>
               <p>Did the man appear to be drunk or sober? - Rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Was he so drunk as not to know what he was about? - He paid for the negus one shilling; it was a bowl of Madeira negus; he gave me half a guinea, and I gave him change.</p>
               <p>Good negus? - I cannot say; I let the ladies out, I had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Did they tell you whether the man was coming after them? - The man followed them direct; he came in with the women, but he did not come down with them, he stood on the second or third step on the one pair of stairs, they did not take leave of one another; they went out first; he said, he had been robbed in their hearing; after the ladies were gone out, the gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190011"></xptr> followed them; he said, he had lost his property, I asked him what? he said, a brown paper parcel pinned; I did not go up any more that night; I have seen the prisoner, I know nothing of her; I did not know her name; I did not know where she lodged; I saw her again at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard her say any thing about this? - No, I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>You describe his coming down almost instantly after? - Yes, immediately; he came down before I got from the door to the passage; he went out immediately after, as soon as he expressed these words.</p>
               <p>- THACKER sworn.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor sold out a certain quantity of stock in the five per cents, and he bought in Exchequer bills; he went and received the money, I was not with him; I have been since he lost them, and enquired about them; I did not know any thing of them previously.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have the number of the notes in my pocket, which I took down before I lost them.</p>
               <p>Had you made that memorandum before you lost them? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Jury. What time did you see them last? - I did not put down that that my wife had, I had mislaid it before I had taken the number of the others.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Thacker. You went to the bank, and you only say what somebody told you? - No.</p>

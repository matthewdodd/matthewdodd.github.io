                  </hi>. I am a merchant of 90, Cannon Street—the prisoner called on me on Oct. 15, and said that he came on behalf of the Metropolitan Water Supply Association, the object of which was to compel the water companies, by means of action in Parliament, to give to the whole of the metropolis a constant supply of water, and also a better quality of water than they gave before—he produced a petition to Parliament for that object—I looked at it, and found several names of friends—he also pro<lb></lb>duced a book containing a list of subscriptions and donations received, and said that Professor Fawcett and Mr. Forster were going to take it up, and advocate the scheme in the House of Commons—he asked me for a subscrip<lb></lb>tion, and believing his statement I gave him two guineas—I asked for a receipt—he hesitated as first, because he had no forms in his pocket; but be found them, and signed this receipt in my presence: "Metropolitan Water Supply Association. Registered Offices, 3, Little Queen Street, Westminster. London, Oct 15th, 1878. Received of Messrs. Schuster, Son, and Co. two guineas donation. James W. Parker, secretary."</p>

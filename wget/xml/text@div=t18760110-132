                  </hi>. I am a rate collector of 21, Delhi Street, Landport—I am the bother of Frederick Sanders, <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Stoke Newington, and during 1872 I had two or it may be three interviews with the defendant in connection with Mr. Sanders' affairs—I advanced to the defendant 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the purpose of paying a composition to my brother-in-law's creditors and I discounted a bill for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. given by the defendant to my brother-in-law—that bill was dishonoured and noted which came to eighteenpence—it was to be paid at the second advance on the Saturday, but it was not—about 20th April, 1875, the defendant gave me the duplicate of a watch, which was pledged for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave him a receipt—I took it out, and I think I paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for interest—I paid 15 guineas altogether to get it—he did not pay one penny composition to the creditors with the ten guineas, and when I found that out I wrote and threatened him that I should take proceedings for misappropriating the money and I told him so as well—I also wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "F. W. Mophett, Esq. Sir,—I must earnestly request you to send me the amount you agreed to pay after your ex<lb></lb>amination, as you must be aware that money is better to me than the watch and want it pressingly, &amp;c., and I beg you to send me a cheque by Wednesday") I had threatened to summon him for misappropriating the ten guineas and he came to where I live at Stamford Hill and told me he was shortly to be married, and persuaded me not to take proceedings as it would ruin him—he asked me to come next morning, and I did so, and he gave me the ticket of what he said was his late father's watch and worth 50 guineas—I took it out and it was a new watch, worth a little more than half that—the prisoner drew up a receipt for the duplicate—I remember the form of it—it was "35, Moorgate Street, April, 1875" (I won't be certain about the date, but it was about the 20th, within three days either way) "I, A.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601100042"></xptr>
               <p>M. <hi rend="smallCaps">DIXON</hi>, hereby acknowledge that I have this day received from Mr. F. W, Morphett the duplicate of his gold watch and chain as security for the due payment of the sum of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."(some odd shillings which I do not know)" and I undertake not to deal with the said duplicate until after the 25th of June next ensuing. A. M. Dixon"—that was made up of the ten guineas for the composition, the dishonoured bill of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was returned to me, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the noting of the bill, and as he would not allow me to redeem the watch for two months, he allowed me the pawnbroker's interest, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was on blue paper and I rather think it was ruled not quite half a sheet, or it may have been half a sheet—this receipt marked A (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is not what I gave to the defendant—there was not one word in the receipt I gave him about Messrs. Edmunds and Company's claim in com<lb></lb>position 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is utterly impossible that this could be my signature, though it staggered me at first—it is very easy to imitate my writing, be<lb></lb>cause I never take my pen off—I positively swear that it is not my signa<lb></lb>ture, and that there was nothing at all about Messrs. Edmunds and Co.'s claim—I was present at Guildhall when this was produced by the defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The case was before Sir J. C. Lawrence and the charge was in regard to the non-payment of Edmunds' sum of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was no committal for forgery, but we intimated that we should proceed on that charge here—Sir J. C. Lawrence did not send the case for trial for forgery, but he knew we were going to proceed—it was my own act—three or four years ago Mr. Sanders had the smallpox for about eleven months—I cannot tell you more exactly—that was the cause of our liquidation, because his house had been shut up—there was only one liquidation before the one the prisoner had to deal with—the one the prisoner had to deal with was the one caused by the smallpox—the smallpox did not last through both liqui<lb></lb>dations—I was a person claiming on a bill of sale on the second liquidation, or rather I claimed nothing; I gave it up in favour of the general creditors—the Registrar in Bankruptcy did not charge me with a fictitious bill of sale to my knowledge—I know that there was an appeal to the Judge, but not on that ground—I have not got the bill of sale, I believe it was torn up, of course it was <hi rend="italic">given</hi> up—I gave it up, and then I voted by proxy for the liquidation of my brother-in-law at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—that was not objected to on the ground that the bill of sale was an entire myth, it was on account of the bungling of our accountant—I do not know that if I had held the bill of sale as a secured creditor I could not vote, I am not up in these things—I do not know whether my bill of sale was to cover every atom of the stock, I know that for years I have been advancing him money—I do not know whether my bill covered all the stock, but I know it was thoroughly genuine, and that it was my own bill—I know that there were months before the matter was discussed, but 1 do not know that it was not till February, 1875, that the liquidation fell through; I have so much to do with my time and I am a long way off—the defendant gave me this receipt at Guildhall for the ten guineas (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I paid the money to him with my own hand at his office—when I pressed the prisoner to pay the ten guineas he wrote and told me that he was bankrupt, that was his answer—I do not know whether I have got the letter, I have not looked for it—I came up to Lon<lb></lb>don in April, 1875, and saw him at his place—he did not tell me that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was bankrupt and that as he was holding the composition money and the proceeds of the composition order he would give me security for those amounts—I received this bill, dated January 1, from my brother-in-law—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601100043"></xptr>
               <p>got it somewhere between the date of his getting it and it being due, it is impossible for me to say now—it came into my possession, to the best of my belief, some time in February, and I gave cash to my brother-in-law for it—I paid it to a spirit merchant at Southsea, and it was returned to me not many days afterwards—it was brought back directly it was refused; if I look at it I dare say I can tell you(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is a two months' bill on 1st January and would be due on 4th March; I do not think I had it till 5th March; I have held it ever since—I did not come up to London from 5th March till April, and when I came up I did not bring it—the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was part of the bill—I sold the watch and chain in July or August for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a silver watch—I got the watch in July, I believe—having got the pawn ticket as security for the bill, I did not send Mr. Morphett back the bill; it was only for part of it, and I wanted to see whether he would pay me; he was to have the watch back again—I should have sent back the bill when I got the money; I was only taking additional security—I had my brother-in-law's security as well, but ho was very hard up—I have the bill now—the receipt I have describe 1 did not describe what the 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for—the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. interest was not due in April, but it was allowed to me because I was not allowed to take the watch out; that is very simple indeed; your client allowed me the interest in April which the pawnbroker would charge me in the following July—I told Sir J. C. Lawrence that the pounds were seventeen and the shillings I was uncertain of—I said "I gave the defendant a receipt in the following words as far as I recollect—I did not say "I, A. M. Dikon acknowledge as earnest for the payment of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, a gold watch and chain, and I hereby undertake not to deal with the security till 24th June next ensuing"—I recollect the pounds very clearly, that was the most important part—I swear that on 27th April I did not sign my name to this paper—I will swear that this "A. M. Dixon" is not my writing—I swore before Sir J. C. Lawrence that if it was my signature the words describing the amount of Edmunds &amp; Co.'s claim for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and composition 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been put in afterwards, because the resemblance staggered me—I am not aware that I signed my name standing, Mr. Morphett generally offered me a seat—I will not swear that I did or did not sign it standing—he did not in my presence read "Duplicate of my gold chain, &amp;c, that has been given as security to A. M. Dixon, &amp;c., being an amount paid to me <hi rend="italic">in re</hi> Sanders"—he did not write that in my presence—I did not stay five minutes—I wanted to catch my train—this letter is in my writing. (<hi rend="italic">Bead:</hi> "November 12, 1875, signed A. M. Dixon to F. W. Morphett, Esq., Delhi Street, Land-port. Dear Sir,—I shall be in London on Wednesday, the 20th instant, and I shall call at your office at 3 p.m. of that day. I will bring all you require and a form I received from the solicitor, as I will fill that up at your office. I shall also bring the money so that all may be paid if possible at once. If I do not hear from you between this day and the 20th I shall conclude that my appointment will suit you.") This other letter is also in ray writ<lb></lb>ing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "October 21, from A. M. Dixon to F. W. Morpbett. <hi rend="italic">Re</hi> sanders. Sir,—Understanding from Mrs. S. that you wish me to send the amount of bills enclosed for settlement I herewith forward cash per post-office order to pay the same, sending the amount less the discount; I shall be in London on the 14th of next month and will call on you at 3 p.m. that day.")—this other letter without date is also in my writing, I wrote it when I found that I had been humbugged about the watch—I think I had taken it out of pawn and found that it was not what I thought. (<hi rend="italic">This was written</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601100044"></xptr>

                  <hi rend="italic">in pencil as follows:</hi>—"Dear Sir,—I have redeemed the watch, &amp;c, if you want it you must send cash and expenses in three days or it is sold, at the same time I do not think it was your property, it looks like the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. one in thenext window.") I had not then found out the cost of it, I am no judge of a watch—I did not turn it into 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and another watch, for two months afterwards—I had just got it out when that was written—this letter is my brother-in-law's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "118, Stoke Newington, No<lb></lb>vember 13th, 1875, I herewith send you the statement of account as to Edmunds &amp; Son, and unless that amount is at once forwarded I shall act upon the judge's advice, and at once institute criminal proceedings under the fraudulent bailee act; Edmunds debt and costs, including counsels fees, etc., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., my costs, and solicitors fees, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; total 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. This is also an answer to yours just received during the writing of this, your im<lb></lb>mediate attention to this will oblige, yours, &amp;c, H. T. Sanders.") I knew of that letter being written some time afterwards—I did not go to the police-court and get a summons within two or three days after that letter was written, I was in Portsmouth—I afterwards attended at Guidlhall four times—I never said a word about a blue paper receipt till Mr. Wontner put this receipt into my hands, I was asked "Is that your signa<lb></lb>ture?"—I did not look at the contents, and for a moment it staggered me and I said "It is very much like it, but if it is this has been added to it since, and it is the wrong colour—I mean to swear that I mentioned the blue colour, though Mr. Wontner said in his speech that I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not the fact that nothing was said about the blue paper till your sister-in-law, Mrs. Sanders, was examined? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was the first to mention it—when the white paper was shown to me I did not say anything about the colour of the paper, because a paper was handed to me, and I was asked if it was my signature I could not say that it was not until I had read it, and I said "Here is this addition to it, it cannot be, and the colour of the paper I signed was blue," if any paper was put before you and the question was asked "Is that your writing?" you would look at it first; I did not read it through before I said that; I was simply looking at the signature; I did not read it through before I said that the words about Edmunds it Co. were added, but they were close to the signature, and in a different ink; I did read the paper through before it left my hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say that if the signature was yours, the words before the signature about composition had been added? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said it before, not after<lb></lb>wards, I got stronger afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Sir J. C. Lawrence was not asked to commit the prisoner for forgery—I was up from Portsmouth four times, which cost me a good deal of money—I understood that if the charge of forgery was gone into I should have to come two or three times again—it was understood that a bill for forgery would be preferred at these sessions—the liquidation under the prisoner's management was a complete humbug, nothing came of it but chaos—the prisoner made the calculation himself in April, about the interest on the watch when I took it out—the date I was to hold it to without taking it out was I believe June 24th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Frederick Sanders, a tailor, of 1, High Street, Stoke Newington—in the latter part of October, 1874, and early in 1875, I called on the defendant at his office in Newgate Street, about business generally—I called a great many times, and on one occasion I think it was in July, I asked him whether he had paid the Messrs. Edmunds, as he had not sent a receipt—he said "I will show you a paper which will prove it," and he showed me half-sheet of blue paper square, about the size of this sheet before me—he had told me that Mr. Edmunds' name was on it, and I asked him to show it to me—I did not read it all down, I merely looked to see if Mr. Edmunds' name was on it, and it was not—Mr. Dixon's name was on it and Mr. Morphett's, but no other—I said "I don't see Mr. Edmunds' name on that paper, will you be kind enough to show it to me?"—and he snatched it out of my hand and threatened to push me out of the office—I noticed "17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." on it and some odd shillings, which I cannot remember—this receipt now produced is not the one, he put into my hands in July—I am certain it is not—I appeared at Guildhall, as one of the witnesses against the defendant when charged with stealing 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Dixon—while he was under remand he came to our house about 1 o'clock one day—my husband was then ill, and was upstairs lying down—the bolt of the door was down, and the prisoner kicked the door and said "I must come in," rather rough "Mrs. Sanders"—I said "The door is made for rough people"—he said that he wanted to see my husband particularly; I told him that he could not, for he was ill—he said that he wanted Mr. Sanders to go to Southampton to Mr. Dixon, to arrange about the money—I assured him that he could not see Mr. Sanders, and then he said "I would give you 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not to know the colour of the paper."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not been turned out of the place in July, but he threatened to—he did not request me to go, I said that I would go—he got up out of his chair and said that he would turn me out—I do not know that it was in July, but it was the same day that I saw the blue paper—I went there for the receipt for the payment to Edmunds—I do not know that it was a receipt that I saw, I only saw that the two names were on it, and the amount—it was in my shop that he offered me the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mrs. Kent who lives with me was behind—she is an independent person—she is not here, she is too old to come—I have no living soul to confirm his offering me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I cannot bring the old lady, and I cannot bring my child who is only seven years of age—I believe this was on the day before I went to the police-court the second time.</p>

               <p>half an hour on that point—I might have been in the box half an hour on 3rd December, but it was a very short half-hour—I did not say a syllable to Aldenman Lawrence about this man offering me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to conceal evidence, Mr. Pratt is the man that I named it to—I took the County Court summons with me to the prisoner and asked him what I was to do with it—I did not demand the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of him—I do not know of my husband writing and demanding the money and the expenses—I did not have the prisoner as a witness at the County Court—I took the summons and showed him, but did not tell him before—I did not know in July that he had handed over security to my brother in respect of Edmunds' amount; I knew he had handed over the duplicate of a watch and chain, but I did not know what for—I did not get the money from my brother for the composi<lb></lb>tion, Mr. Dixon paid it to Mr. Morphett in my presence—I do not know whether my husband employed a solicitor in his liquidation or whether he employed Mr. Earl of Charles Street, Hatton Garden.</p>

I am a clerk in the Bankruptcy Court—I produce the proceedings in the defendant's bankruptcy—he was made a bankrupt on 12th April—I find here the statement of his accounts filed on 27th April in the usual printed form—I find in Schedule G a de<lb></lb>scription of the property—the heading is "Full statement to nature of property, duplicate of my gold watch and chain pledged at Russell &amp; Co.'s, Fore Street, E.C., for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that has been given as security to Mr. A.

                  </hi>. The letters annexed to the depositions signed and seeming to have been signed by Mr. Dixon have been placed in my hands, and also the paper marked A, the impugned receipt—after care<lb></lb>ful study of the writing 1 say that the receipt was written by the same hand which wrote the letters—I have not the slightest doubt of it; it is freely written, and it is utterly impossible that it could be forged—I have never met with such a thing in thirty years' experience—I think that the signature was put at the same time as the body, and after the words about</p>

               <p>the composition and about Edmunds' debt—the signature is in different ink—the words "Edmunds &amp; Co., composition 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." is in a different coloured ink; that might arise from dipping the pen more freely in the ink—I do not mean that it came from a different bottle, you might have an inkstand with three different colours—there is nothing inconsistent with a man hav<lb></lb>ing put his signature standing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have given evidence at the Old Bailey before and at the New Bailey for thirty years—the case of Davis <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> May on 11th Decem<lb></lb>ber last year was in the Probate Court, "Westminster—they sought in that case to upset a will on the ground that the signature to it was forged—I gave evidence on that occasion from a comparison of that signature with the acknowledged signature of the testator—I swore that it was a forgery and I believe so now—that action was not based upon the evidence of my<lb></lb>self and Mr. Chabot, nothing of the kind—I unhesitatingly swear that it was not—litigation began in 1874 and I was not called till 1875—I heard that the Jury stopped the case when they had heard my evidence, but I was not in Court—they did not want to hear the summing up of the Judge—I was not present when a man named Parsons swore that he saw the testator sign it, that was the day before—Sir James Hannen tried the case—if he said that a more reckless charge of forgery he never heard in his life, that was no fault of mine—he said that it was painful to reflect on the enormous expense gone to, because Mr. Chabot and Mr. Netherclift thought their opinion better than the testimony; that was an unjust speech.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The banker's clerk of the testator said that he would not honour the signature—the case was that the man's health was so impaired that it affected his writing, but the doctor said that it had nothing to do with it—it was an ulcer on the leg—he drew several cheques that day, and they were not forthcoming—there is not the slightest analogy between that case and this—I have not the slightest doubt that this is Dixon's signature—I do not form my opinion upon his evidence—I was not there to hear him say that if it was his signature it had been altered.</p>

                  </hi>. I have had experience in the study of handwriting—I was employed to look at the impugned document, and before I did so 1 warned the prisoner that if I formed an opinion against him I should give evidence against him on his trial—I cautioned him very carefully, and said "I have been before consulted by prisoners and have found against them, and they have had penal servitude, and therefore be careful; I shall not shield you for a moment. I won't be dragged in to shield a man to commit a crime"—he still persisted in submitting the writing to me and said that he was not the least afraid—I went from Mr. Wontner's office to Guildhall, when the document was in the possession of the officer of the Court—I looked at the admitted signature of Dixon, and after a careful,. analysis of document A I said that the "A. M. Dixon "on that was in the same hand that wrote the other—I should like to call attention to a particular point—there is another signature to the depositions and the letter "x" is disjoined from the "o" in Dixon; after forming the "x" the pen has been lifted before forming the "o," but you will find that the up-stroke of the "x" terminates in a little hook—that is a point which would hardly be observed by anybody but an expert—the same hook is in this receipt, but it is done exquisitely—if it had been done by a forger it would have been done more clumsily—I say that in the alleged forgery the up-stroke of the "x" is so beautifully done that none but an expert would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601100048"></xptr>
               <p>notice it, and it would require a skilful hand to do it—I have made several attempts and could not do it—I think there was another signature on the depositions Mr. Wontner showed me. which I have not here—looking at the signature to the letter marked B, at the first moment one misses the dot of the "i" in "Dixon," but on carefully looking it touches the "c" in "etcetera," and it is a dash obliquely, and when I look at the other signa<lb></lb>ture I notice it there also, that is an indication of a natural hand of the person signing; then I say that the whole of the signature is done with some rapidity, the lines are smooth and clear, and it would be impossible for a person to write with rapidity and make a signature so like, and particularly to execute this minute hook, except by natural handwriting—then again there is the flourish underneath the alleged signature which is precisely like the flourish to the letter—all those reasons render it certain that it was written by the same hand; I do not see the slightest difference—the difference in the receipt is attributable to a fresh dip of the pen—the words "Edmunds and Co." and "Composition 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." is a different tone, a different tone of ink—it is—not every one who could write it off to the bottom—a person might write down to "2 months" and then blot it, and then write the rest—if you look at the body of the document you will find that the ink differs in colour—in the body of the document the "6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>" with the "4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." is in regular writing, and it is my opinion that the receipt was written down to "2 months," and then blotted, and then that "Edmunds and Co. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." was put in—I suspect that it was not all written at one writing, and then with the same pen the signature was written—from what I see here it is consistent with the whole being written by Mr. Morphett and then signed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I believe that this was not put in some time afterwards, but that it was done at the same time and not at a very considerable interval—I did not express a different opinion before—I am doubtful whether I have expressed that opinion—a forger generally does try to imitate a sig<lb></lb>nature pretty closely, but I never saw one like this—I have seen some excellent imitations of signatures; I do not know what you call delicate imitations—I have seen very good imitations; but there is always some<lb></lb>thing about them, however well the forms may be imitated, the signatures want spirit—I gave Morphett a caution before the examination at the police-court, before I gave my evidence at Guildhall—I did not say a single word at the police-court about giving him a caution—when I was examined there I was not asked.</p>

It was a trial in which a brother was trying to obtain the cancellation of the probate—eighty signatures and sixty-six initials were produced, and I said that I could not identify the signature of the will with the known signature of the deceased particularly, when a banker's clerk said "I would not have paid a cheque with the same signature as this is to the will, the Judge reproached me <hi rend="italic">for</hi> bringing about all the expenses of the trial; but I was not consulted till six mouths afterwards, and I discouraged the parties right through at the time of my giving evidence—without mentioning names, it was a will made by a solicitor, benefiting himself to the amount of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and his son also, the deceased's brother being altogether excluded, the same attorney who</p>

               <p>made the will and who had the disposal and the management of the pro<lb></lb>perty—the first words of the receipt are "<hi rend="italic">Re Sanders</hi>"—that is precisely the same coloured ink as that below, which is said to be interpolated—the lines tend upwards; that is a peculiarity of Morphett's writing—the line said to be interpolated also tends upwards, and you know it at two or three yards distance from that 'circumstance—I made my comparison in Morphett's absence that I might express an unfettered opinion to Mr. Wontner.</p>

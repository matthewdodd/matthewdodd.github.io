                  </hi>. I am shop-boy in the service of Mr. Davies, a clothier of Eveline-street, Deptford—on Friday evening, 17th February, I was watching a bundle of about a dozen coats which were placed outside the door—about half-past 8, a lady came and said something to me—I looked for the coats, and they were gone—I had seen them safe about two minutes before—I ran down the road about twelve yards, and saw three men standing up against some railings they had some coats with them—the prisoner was one of them—he had two coats, one dark and one light—I asked him where the coats were, and said, "Give them to me"—he said, 'We've got no coats, 'and crossed the road with the other men, and went down on the right hand side—I followed them, and saw the prisoner <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> one coat over a wall, and throw the other one down, which I picked up—the prisoner ran round a turning—one of the other men ran away, and one followed the prisoner—I saw the prisoner brought back by two men, and taken to my master's shop—I afterwards went with the policeman, and saw him pull a coat off the wall where the prisoner threw it—it hung on to the wall.</p>

I live at Albert-street, Deptford, and am a blacksmith I was at my brother's house in Eveline-street, Deptford, on Friday, 17th February—I heard somebody calling out, "Give me my coat or coats"—I could not hear who it was—I went outside my brother's shop, and saw the prisoner walking on the path, and the last witness walking in the road, asking the question—I followed them—they went round a turning—there were two</p>

I am foreman to Mr. James Jackson Davies—on Friday evening, 17th February, about half-past 8, I was in his shop, and heard an alarm outside—I went to the door, and shortly after the prisoner was brought to the shop by a man—the shop-boy was also with him with a light coat on his arm—the prisoner said that he was not the man—that he saw four men outside the door take a bundle of coats, and fall down with them, and that he ran to apprehend them—there were about a dozen coats taken, worth between 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—another coat was afterwards brought by the constable, that was my employer's property, and also the one brought back by the boy—I am quite certain they formed part of the handle that was taken—four out of the dozen have been brought back—these are two of the coats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they have our private mark on them, and the card is pinned on.</p>

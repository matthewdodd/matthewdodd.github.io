On Monday, the day after the robbery was committed, I took two assistants with me in the middle of the night to make a search; I went to a place called Pear-street, adjoining Duck-lane, Westminster, and searched several houses; at last I found the prisoner and another in bed together; he got out of the bed with his breeches on; the other person that was with him was a suspicious character; we took them both into custody; there lay a piece of bacon on the table, which he disowned knowing any thing of.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q.

It is a house where the girls of the town live, and where the woman of the house was in custody at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You found two men in bed together? - A. Yes, up stairs there were other lodgings that were let to two girls; the woman that inhabited that room was sent to Bridewell Precinct.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was taken with that canister in the room, and I have people to come forward that will prove, that I have had that canister a twelvemonth; at the Office they asked them if they could swear to the canister, she said she could; they asked her what marks were on it; she said, no marks at all; they asked her particularly if there was any mark at the bottom; she said she was never so particular as to look; there is a mark and it is stamped; they asked her what tea was in the canister; she said it was full of green tea; when I was taken there were about four ounces of black and green tea; I will call a witness to prove that I have had this canister a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. I shall advise you to let the case stand where it does.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who said they had known him about four or five months, and gave him a good character.</p>

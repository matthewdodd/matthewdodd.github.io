               <p>Mills's defence. This day week we were at a public-house opposite Shadwell Police-office, in company with two other men, and that man came in and said, neither of us were the persons; he went out and returned again, and asked the officers which two men he was to swear to; first they said it was the 4th of April, then they said it was the 2d.</p>
               <p>One witness was called to Mills's character.</p>
               <p>Bevan's defence. I have sent for a couple of gentlemen who are not here. This gentleman and lady came, and said, we were not the men; Mr. Haynes, and the other gentleman, said, they might rely upon it we were the men, and the young woman asked whom she was to swear to, and the officer said, to these two.</p>

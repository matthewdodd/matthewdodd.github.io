He asked me on Thursday for a needle and thread to go up stairs to mend his clothes; his room is next to mine on the first floor. He came down in about ten minutes, stood by the taproom fire about two minutes, and was then going out, but I called him back to get me some sand. He came and took a penny, went out, and never returned - he had given me no notice. As soon as he went out I went up stairs, found my door open, and the box unlocked, with a pick-lock key in it - four watches and fourteen 1 l. notes were gone; I have not seen them since - I had been in the room about two hours before; the box was then under the bed. The doors were all safe just as I had left them. I afterwards found him in Tothil-fields. The bar was never left - nobody could have gone up.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the amount of the bill - A. Thirty pound ten shillings. He promised to come and redeem the bill, bringing me thirty pound ten shillings. He told me that he dealt at the corn market regularly, and that it would be a great conveience to him, as a friend of his who resided at Staines went with him, and they horsed the gig by turns. He said his own gig was nearly worn out, and my gig would suit him very well. I informed him that I should be on that day week at Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this - A. On Thursday, the 1st of July, and that I would leave the bill with my coachman, and begged he would be punctual. I went to Birmingham; upon my return I found the bill was not taken away; I was absent about ten days; not so long. When I returned I found the bill in the hands of my coachman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your master leave the bill in your hands when he went to Birmingham - A. He did. The prisoner did not come on that day week, and take back the bill. After the 21st of August, I went to Staines, and enquired after the prisoner. About a week or a fortnight after the bill became due, I met the prisoner at Kingston; I asked him why he did not come according to his promise, and leave the money for the bill; he said, he supposed master had got the money. I told him he had not; that he had been to Tower-street, that there was no such person as Ferguson there. I asked him where he was to be found, as master would be glad to see him; he said, at Staines. I said, it was wrong; I had been to to Staines, and enquired if Willis was at home; I was informed that he never came there; that he had left there. I then told him it made no odds where he was, my matter would find him; that I had heard he was in the rules of the King's Bench; with that he left me. He went on to town, and I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again - A. No, not after.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, before you parted, did any thing pass respecting any other Tower-street - A. There did; he said, that my master had been to the wrong Tower-street; he should have gone to Tower-street, Westminster-road. That was all that passed between us.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. I suppose your coachman informed you of this interview with the prisoner - A. He did. I went to Tower-street, Westminster-road; it was a very dirty low street. I went to No. 9. I knocked a considerable time, the first time I went, and could make no person hear; the second time I went I saw a woman, who is in court. I did not find a Mr. Ferguson. About the middle of September, I met the prisoner on a hill in the Wandsworth-road, he was riding on horseback; I spoke to him about the bill, and told him I would not be trifled with, I would stick to him like a leaf, and when I got into St. George's Fields, I told him I had got a warrant out against him; he struck me a violent blow on my head, and got away.</p>

             write at different times; the endorsement on the bill is Sweet's writing, I am positive of it, and I am positive this is the bill that Sweet tended it to the prisoner for the purchase of the mare. I am no trade now; I have been a horse-dealer; I have been in the King's Bench about a twelve-month.</p>

            . I am in no business. I am now unfortunately situated in Giltspur-street Compter. I accepted a bill of the name of

            . I lived at that time at No. 9, Tower-street, Westminster-road. Sweet represented himself to be a carcase butcher, in Bristol; I knew him two months previous to my accepting the bill; I owed him the money, and I accepted the bill to pay him; I expected remittances from Scotland. I expected to be able to honour the bill; that is my acceptance on the bill. I have made no acceptances except on that bill. I live here by remittances from Scotland.</p>

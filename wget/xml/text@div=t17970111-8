               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to confess, or worse if he did not? - A. No such thing; I asked him where he got this cloth, he told me he bought it honestly and paid for it, and when he got to the public-house, he said he had found it, I know no more than that, he was taken before the Justice, (produces the property), it has been in my possession ever since.</p>

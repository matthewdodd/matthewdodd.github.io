I am a pawnbroker, at 102, Westminster-bridge-road—on the evening of 25th April, about half-past 9, I was in my shop—I heard a violent noise—a female spoke to me, and I then examined my window, and found it smashed to atoms, and I missed two diamond rings, value 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the window was bent plate glass, a quarter of an inch thick, and would require great violence to break it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am unmarried, and reside at 19, York-road—at half-post 9 on the evening of 25th April, I was passing Mr. Richards' shop, and I saw Fitch and Lane looking very suspiciously in the window—I heard nothing, but on turning round to look again I saw Fitch had broken the window, and he had his hand inside, and I saw the card in his hand as he was taking the rings off—I was the only one on the spot at the time—while I went in to tell Mr. Richards they both ran down the Westminster-road; one on the pavement, and the other in the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, of 12, Crescent, Minories—on Tuesday evening, 24th December, I was near the door of 74, Great Tower Street—my right hand was in my pocket—the prisoner came up, snatched my gold watch and chain, and ran away—I saw him distinctly, it was under a lamp—I turned round to lay hold of him, and was imme<lb></lb>diately knocked down by somebody and kicked—I lost my senses, and when I recovered I was in the custody of an officer.</p>

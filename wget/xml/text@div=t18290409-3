On the morning of the 27th of January I was called up - I had left my house all safe the night before, and went to bed between eight and nine o'clock; I was the only person in the house that night, and slept up stairs - I heard a noise at four o'clock in the morning, it appeared to be below; I struck a light, looked at my watch, and saw it was four o'clock - I opened the window and hallooed, supposing it was somebody stealing the flowers from the garden in the front of the house; I then bolted my bed-room door, and went to bed again, leaving the light burning till I came down at six o'clock -I had the light then; I found my lattice window broken down, and the sash inside the lattice broken, and open - it was a sliding sash; it was broken a man could get in there- my door, which leads to the back kitchen, was wrenched open; the back kitchen-door, which leads into the garden, was broken from within; the iron bar was taken down -16lbs. of pickled pork was taken from the house, out of the pickling pan, which was in the wash-house, where they first broke into - the lattice-window is in the wash-house - the pork had been killed before Christmas - the pig weighed twelve stone, it was for my own use, and worth about 9d. per 1b., such pork as that; I saw some pork again on the Tuesday night, at the Rose and Crown public-house, Enfield-highway - Wilson, the constable, had got it; I have brought a little bit of it here now, the bit that I swore to - Wilson took charge of it; I swore to it before the Magistrate - the constable delivered it to me after the last Session; here is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090005"></xptr>a piece where the leg was cut off - I pickled it myself, and was going to cut this particular notch off, but did not; it is a particular notch which I cut, and I can swear to it by that.</p>

            . I am a constable of Enfield. I searched the prisoner's house on the 27th of January, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; I knew he lived there - he was at home; I found about 16lbs. of pickled pork there, in a clothes chest - I did not examine it then, as I was not looking for pork; it was in a covered pan in the chest - it seemed to be dry; after hearing Mrs. Roberts' house was broken open, I went to the house again with her, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and found only part of the pork in the same chest, rolled up in some clothes - there were only four pieces then; there were several pieces before - they were taken out of the pan and wrapped in some clothes in the same chest; the prisoner was not there then - I took it away; the piece produced is part of what I found there and produced before the Magistrate - I delivered it to the prosecutrix after the last Session; I kept it till then: before I went to the house with her, she said she should know it by a mark, and I found the mark she had described - it was a notch; Castle saw the four pieces before the Justice.</p>

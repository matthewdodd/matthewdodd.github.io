On 4th Oct. the prisoner came into the warehouse, and said he wanted some goods—I had done business with him before for his father, and I concluded it was so now—he had some razors, scissors, and penknives—I gave him the parcel of goods and the invoice in the name of Mr. Reuben, or Mr. J. Reuben, I cannot remember which; it was intended for his father.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Holloway down, Laytonstone, in the parish of Layton. On the 29th of November I had three geese—I found two dead, one on the premises, and one in a field adjoining my house.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 29th of November, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was on my beat at Holloway-down—when I got opposite to the prosecutor's house, I heard a goose make a noise—I came to the gate in front of the house, and saw the prisoner standing close by an out-house—I went to the place where he stood, and found the door of the out-house open, and the prisoner inside—I took him into custody—he had not got any thing—I asked what brought him there—he did not give me any dis<lb></lb>tinct answer—I called at the prosecutor's house, which was about four or five yards off—somebody answered me from the window, and in a little time Mr. Aveline came out, and we took the prisoner to the station—I then came back, searched, and found a dead goose in a field close to the house, about seven or eight yards from where I took the prisoner—I did not find any other goose myself—I searched the prisoner, and found no<lb></lb>thing on him—the neck of the goose I found was broken—I do not know whether it was warm—it was quite flexible.</p>

                  </hi>. Between eleven and twelve o'clock at night I saw the policeman get over the gate—I opened the window, and asked what he wanted—he said there was a man in the out-house—I then went to the back part of the house, opened another window close to the out-house, and there saw the policeman with the prisoner in custody—I went down stairs, opened the door, and admitted him—after the prisoner was taken to the station I went with my son to the out-house, and found a dead goose there —I did not see the goose that was found in the field—I had not locked the out-house that evening, but I saw that all the bolts were secured—there had been three geese there—I found one there still alive.</p>

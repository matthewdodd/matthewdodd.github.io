I am a mineral water maker, of Lloyd's Row, clerkenwell, and have a stable at Garnault Mews—on 3rd April, about 11.15 p.m., I was called up and went to my stable and saw some man putting out some straw which was on fire—the police inspector afterwards examined the premises with me, and I saw him pick up two matches, which I believe had been struck—I received information and gave the prisoner in custody—there had been a fire there in August last, and a. pianoforte placed over my stable was burnt, at which the prisoner had worked for some years—there was a horse in my stable.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Garnault Mews—on 3rd April, about 10.30,1 heard footsteps going towards Mr. Mayor's stable, and in less than four or five minutes I heard footsteps returning, running very fast round the corner of my house—about five or ten minutes after that I heard foot—steps come again towards Mr. Mayor's stable, running very fast, just in the same way—they came back again a third time, walking towards the stable, and in a few minutes returned, running very fast and stumbled near my window and went on again—I spoke to my husband, and then got up and went into the other room, opened the window, looked out and heard a match struck—I then saw a light from the match in Mr. Mayor's stable, but it went out—I called out "Mr. Hicks, is that you?"—he is a horse<lb></lb>keeper—I got no answer—I called several times "Who is there?" What do you want?" but got no answer—I stood at the window ten minutes, and all was quiet—I then heard a match struck again in the stable, and the stable was lit up by it, but it went out—about sis matches were struck,</p>

               <p>one after the other, and then I saw a regular light in the stable which did, not seem to go down, and I saw a man run out, stooping; he ran round a, van with his head very much down—I called to my husband and went downstairs and heard a man putting his horse in—I called out" Young man do come up, some one has set light to the stable and ran away" Stone got a pail of water and put the fire out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Garnault Mews, nearly opposite Mr. Mayor's stable—about 10.30 on this night I saw the prisoner standing in middle of the gateway of the mews, but there is no gate—I looked over his shoulder and saw a piece of paper and some matches in his hand—he went towards Mayor's stable—I then went to my brother's house and knocked at the door, I heald some one running—I did not speak, but stood there and saw the prisoner run by—my brother had gone to bed so I went in doors, and in a few minutes I heard a cry of "Fire"—my husband ran downstairs and I went down and saw the fire in the stable—the prisoner was standing at the top of the mews, looking down to where the fire was, and he got out of the way to let me pass—I caught hold of him and said "You vagabond, what have you been doing of, setting the place on fire again"—he said "I have not done anything; what are you doing of?"—I called my husband, and the prisoner was taken in custody.</p>

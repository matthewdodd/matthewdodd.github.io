                  </hi>. On the 13th of December, 1836, I was in London—and near one of the bridges a man came across the road, and asked me How beasts sold at Smithfield the day before—it was the show at Smithfield the day before—I told him I did not know, for I had not any to sell—(this was not the prisoner)—he said, "I had, but they were sold badly"—he then said, "Do you know much about London?"—I said, "No, not a great deal; I know enough to find where I want to go"—he said, "I never was in London but once before in my life; if you have no objection, I should like to walk with you"—we walked together, till we came to the top of the Haymarket, and near the corner house, called the Black Horse, he said, "Would you like to take a draught of ale?"—this was between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning—we went in and had a pint of ale, and the prisoner then came in—he passed us, went round the table, threw himself back, and threw his umbrella on the table—he was dressed in black—I got up, and said, "We are going"—he said, "Oh, gentlemen, I wish you only had the good luck as I have had"—the other man said, "Oh, How is that"—the prisoner said, "Oh, I have done them! I have done them! I have done them!"—the other man said, "What do you met by doing them?"—"Oh," he said, "look here"—he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out what appeared a handful of notes, and sovereigns mixed with them—he said, "Look here; I have done them"—the other man gave me a <hi rend="italic">jog</hi> of the arm, and said he never saw such a fool in his life; to show his notes—I said, "Well, I am going"—he said, "Oh, let us have his story out"—the prisoner had called for some ale—the other man said, "Don't be in a hurry; How did you do them?"—the prisoner said, "I wish every body was as lucky as I am now; I lived with an uncle and a brother, and they treated me very ill; I left them, and lived some distance from them; after some time I came back, and found my uncle was dead; there was an old woman, named Betty Meachan, and she said, 'Oh Teddy, then, you are back again, why don't you go and take the farm your brother is in?' I said, 'I have no business with it;' she said, 'Yes, it belongs to you;' I said, 'I don't think that;' she said, 'Give me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I will tell you How you can get it;' I went to the lawyer's, and had an agreement drawn up that I would give her 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I got the property; the old woman then told the story How I was to have it, and I said, 'How can that be, when my brother is older than I am?' she said, 'Never mind, your brother was born out of wedlock, and you will gain the property'"—we then came out—the prisoner followed, but before that the man said, "Ayn't there a place called Gardens worth seeing?"—I said, "I suppose you mean the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park"—we agreed to go there—I had occa<lb></lb>sion to call in Old Bond-street, and left my great coat and an umbrella there—I told the gentleman there that two friends were going with me to the Gardens, and I should not be home till night time—I considered them both friends—the prisoner had joined us before I got to Old Bond-street—we walked together, and said very little—when we came to the Regent's Arms, York Terrace, the man I first met proposed to go and have some<lb></lb>thing to drink, and we all went in together—refreshment was called for—I said, "I do not think we can go in without a ticket"—I went to the bar, and asked for one, and they gave me a ticket to go in—we sat, <hi rend="italic">chatting</hi>, nearly an hour, in the tap-room—at last the prisoner showed his notes again—the other one said. "I suppose he thinks nobody has got money but himself"—he pulled out a pocket-book, and said, "I have got two</p>

               <p>£10 notes as well as him; I am not without money"—he said, How careful we ought to be for fear of being robbed about London, and he thought it a good way to mark the notes for fear of being robbed, if we had got any—the prisoner said, "Oh, is that right? well, we had better have them marked"—they accordingly went and got pen and ink brought into the parlour—I had my notes all doubled up close in a little bag inside my shirt next my skin—I pulled them out and a little book to take down the numbers—I had them down by the side of me, and got ready to pull them out, but the prisoner jumped up and stamped on the floor, and said, "Shoot, shoot! if you want to shoot, I have got guns enough at home: I have two or three"—I looked sharp at him—he seemed crazy, and in the mean<lb></lb>time while I was looking, my notes were taken by one of them, and the prisoner went out and the other followed him—I went to take up my notes, but instead of them there was a piece of paper doubled up much about the size of my notes—I saw what was the matter, and ran out directly—the Regent's Arms is nearly a corner house—I asked a man if he had seen any body run out—he said a man in top boots had run across into the New-road as hard as he could run—I could see nothing of him, and thought it best to go down to the Bank, where the notes were payable—I told them what had happened, and asked their advice—they said they would stop them, but I did not know the numbers of the notes—I had drawn them from the bank at Hadley, and they took the numbers down—I went to Marylebone office and told them—they wrote a letter and sent to Suffolk to the bankers to know the numbers—I went about for two days to look for the men, but could not find them—I described the men to the landlord of the house, and a short time ago I had a letter to say the prisoner was in custody—I came to town and saw him at Bow-street office, and am sure he is the same per<lb></lb>son—I will swear to him—if he did not take my notes, he assisted in tak<lb></lb>ing them—he is the man that said, "Shoot, shoot"—I had 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in£5 notes, and I lost them all.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Regent's Arras, York-terrace. On the 13th of December, I recollect the prosecutor and two men coming into the house—it happened to be my birth-day—they went into the parlour and called for refreshment, which was served them, and in a few minutes after the prosecutor came to the bar and asked for a ticket of admission to the Zoological Gardens, which my daughter-in-law gave him—he took it, and Mrs. Tarr said, "You are very late to-day"—they staid for an hour, and then the two men deliberately walked out of the parlour, and along the passage—one stood at the door with a pipe in his mouth till the other came up to him, but he never turned his face to enable me to identify his features—immediately after the prosecutor came to the bar and said he was robbed of his money, and said, "Which way did he go"—we ran out, but they had made their escape—I had not any opportunity of seeing the prisoner to say whether he was the man.</p>

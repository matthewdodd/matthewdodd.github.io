            . I am a harness maker, and soldier in the West London militia; about eight o'clock in the evening, on the 18th of November, I saw the prisoner at the bar in Mr. Gillman's shop Barbican; he had a bag in his hand, he put the bag down on the counter, on some things that were on the counter; I did not know what he put it on, and he had a slate in his hand at the same time; I saw him look round several times, then he pretended to come towards the door, he went and took up this bag; I saw him shuffle something in the bag, and when he came to the door I stopped him; I said to the gentleman in the shop, I believe this man has got something of your property; he took him in the shop, and examined him, and found twelve handkerchiefs upon him.</p>

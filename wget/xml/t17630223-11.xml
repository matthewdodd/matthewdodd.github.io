            . I was coming down Fleet-Market last Tuesday was a fortnight, there a girl picked me up, this was between 12 and 1 at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I was in liquor. She carried me to the prisoner's house, <placeName id="t17630223-11-crimeloc55">the Black Horse in Fleet-lane</placeName>

I told them, I wanted no wine, nor I would have none, nor pay for none: it was in a copper pot.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought it up?</p>
               <p>Marshall. A servant maid: the girl that brought me there, insisted upon my paying for it. I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out 3 s. 2 guineas and 5 d. farthing, I laid down a shilling, and said, I had not got 18 d. The girl that picked me up lent me a sixpence, she laid it down; upon that I gave her a shilling, and put my money in my pocket, and took my hat, and said, I must be gone, I did not like my situation. The girl<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176302230007"></xptr> said, she had something more to say to me, and catched hold of my coat, and put her hand to my pocket, and wanted to force me to stay in the room with her; as soon as I found I could not get shut of her, she forced one of her hands into my pocket: I catched hold of her and said, what do you mean to pick my pocket! she told me she must have another shilling of me: I said she should not, and insisted on going away: she struggled with me a good deal, and as I could not get shut of her, I yielded to give her another shilling I put my hand in my pocket, and took out my money, I gave her another shilling; I then saw the two guineas, and put them in my pocket again; the immediately forced her hand into my pocket, and said, I had stole her ring from her huger, and it was in my pocket, and she would have it out: I immediately called out and made a noise, and she likewise: immediately the girl that brought the wine up entered the room; as soon as that girl came in she seemed frighted; I was a good deal frighted; then in came another woman, a lusty jolly woman, (such as the prisoner) she had a bed-gown on, no hat nor cloak, she asked what was the matter?</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, do you know her?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I am called here upon my oath, but to take an oath that she was the woman, I can not. I think that woman was something younger; with the fright I was pretty well got sober; whoever the woman was, she came round me, and with a saint voice said, Curse you, be quiet! She gave me a slight blow, but did not hurt me; I got from them, but they intangled me at the back part of the door, and threw me on the bed, and the lusty woman held her hand on my mouth, and my hands with the other hand, while the girl that picked me up, took my money out of my pocket, and ran away with it. I had a bundle with me, which I took up, with my hat and wig, which were down in the scuffle; then I came down stairs as fast as I could, but one of the women stopped me on the stairs, and desired I would not run over her, which I apprehended was to give the other time to get away. I saw a man in the house, but I cannot swear to him.</p>

            . I am constable, this was my watch-night. When this person was robbed, he came to the door, and sent a watchman up to the watch-house; I went down with the man he sent, there I saw him standing at the door; he said, are you constable of the night? I said, yes; then he said, I insist upon your breaking this door open. It was not quite clear to me whether I could answer it or not; I knocked at it, and found it fast, it was equal to that of breaking a stone wall. He said, he had never quitted the door, and he believed the two persons that had robbed him were both in the house, and that one of them was a very lusty woman with a pale face. I asked him, in what manner he was robbed? he said, a girl picked him up in Fleet-market, and gave the same account he has here in court; I judged that lusty woman to be the woman of the house, the prisoner. I live in the neighbourhood, and knew her before; it is a bad house, for my watch-night before there was a person robbed in that house of 2 guineas; there is hardly a night but there is robbery or murder cried there. There are about six or eight such houses in that same Fleet-lane.</p>

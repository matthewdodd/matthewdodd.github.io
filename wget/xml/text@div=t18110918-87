            , she is a widow, in the parish of St. John, Wapping.</p>
               <p>Q. She lives in the house does she. - A. She does. On the 27th of July Mr. Baston, a master bricklayer, came to we, I went with him to a shed, I was ordered to search that shed, the prisoner was not there then, and in a heap of lime that was slacked for mortar, I took a lath and turned it up, and found this pocket book, in it were these ten one-pound Bank of England notes, a Canterbury note of one guinea, two five-pound notes and all the rest are one-pound notes, amounting in all to 27 l. I then had a suspicion that the labourer had taken it, I went and took him in custody, I asked him how he came to take this man's money, he said he had a scold of a wife, the devil came over him, and that he had never done such a thing before.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you made this search. - A. About ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor.) You say part of a note was found upon him. - A. No, a part of the property was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who found any thing upon him. - A. Miller.</p>
               <p>MILLER. I was going to search him, he pulled three dollars out of his pocket, two shillings and a penny farthing, he said he got them in change for one of the notes at the cook's shop, he said he had only changed one, there is one missing now, there is only twenty-eight instead of of twenty-nine.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor.) Look at that pocket book do you know it, - A. Yes, it is my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read. - A. No, there are no marks on the notes by which I knew them, I can swear to the pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether there were among your notes any of 5 l. - A. Yes, two, they were country notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the rest. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any Bank of England notes among yours. - A. Yes. I do not know how many.</p>

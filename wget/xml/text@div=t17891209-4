               <p>I am a hackney-coach-man; I was sitting with my horses about half past twelve, and I saw the prosecutrix and two women coming down Berners-street; they were speaking together, but what the words were, I cannot tell; but the prisoner knocked the prosecutrix down; there was another woman with them; the three seemed as if they were in company together: the other woman fell upon the prosecutrix, after the prisoner knocked her down; then whether it was a handkerchief or a cloak, I could not be positive, as I sat on the box, that she took from her; but the prisoner was the woman that dragged it off her neck; and then I called the watchman; I did not go to the watch-house with them.</p>
               <p>Did this happen in Berner-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a moon light night? - No, it was not; I saw by lamp light, and by the watchman's lanthorn, which he held up for the purpose of my being satisfied that that was the woman.</p>
               <p>Is the prosecutrix the woman? - She is.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner do any thing else? - Not besides knocking her down.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner attempt to take any thing else? - No, I cannot say I saw any thing done to the gown.</p>
               <p>Are you sure, by the light of the lanthorn, that was the woman? - Yes, and by the watchman's bringing her back.</p>

               <p>Court to the Coachman. Have you? - This is the first time that I ever was about any such thing, and I hope it will be the last time.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether there is any reward for this prosecution? - I do not know I am sure; I do not know any thing about it; I do not do it for the lucre of gain.</p>
               <p>You have not heard that there is a reward? - I have heard nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Do you know who this prosecutrix is at all? - Her husband has worked for a gentleman that is in the same yard where I have worked this twelvemonth; I saw the woman once before at a neighbour's house.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Have you heard of any reward? - No.</p>

               <p>About twelve o'clock, I came out with two more market women; I bid them good night; I saw several women stand, misfortunate women like that; I know that woman positively well; she has bought fruit of me; seeing her roll over and over in the mud, my heart felt for her, and I took up her two slippers from the mud; and the coachman came up in the mean while; as for touching a thing belonging to her, I never did, but her shoes; them I picked up out of the mud; one I put on her foot up at the heel, and the other I could not get up; she had neither bonnet, nor cloak, nor handkerchief, but was intirely rolled in the mud; at the watch-house, I was searched naked; and the next morning, coming through Soho-square, a gentleman came up to the two watchman, and she being so muddy, says the gentleman, is this the woman that was making such an uproar so long last night, and rolling about in the mud? yes, says one of the watchmen, it is; she was undoubtedly very troublesome there; she was so much in liquor, she lost her shoes going to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Was you in liquor at that time? - No, I was not; she beat and bruised me in that manner.</p>
               <p>Court to Coachman. Was the prosecutrix, the carpenter's wife, at all in liquor? - Not that I discerned at all; the blow she gave her, stunned her; she could not call the watch; she hit her in the face, which knocked her down.</p>
               <p>You say you know the prosecutrix to be the wife of a carpenter? - Yes; she is a very well behaved woman; I never saw her in that line of life; her spouse has worked for Mr. Harefall and Mr. Johnson, for seven years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no witnesses; there was nobody by of my acquaintance; there was some of her acquaintance, that walk about where she does, that were laughing at her at the time; they walk in Adam and Eve-court, where she walks herself.</p>

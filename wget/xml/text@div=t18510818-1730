                  </hi>. I live at 13, Park-terrace, Camden-town, and occupy a part of the house; it is a separate tenement. On 12th Aug., I went down, about half-past 7, and found a number of articles of wearing apparel on the stairs, and the lock of the door unscrewed, and hanging down—I called my brother-in-law and his wife, who were sleeping in the back parlour—we examined further, and missed the clothes produced—I found a piece of wood taken from the back-kitchen window, so that a person could undo the latch, and get in—the doors and windows were all secure when I went to bed, at half-past 11 the night before—this coat is mine, and the shawl is my wife's, and these other articles were all safe the night before—my house is in St. Pancras parish.</p>

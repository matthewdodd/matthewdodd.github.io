John Wilmar thus deposed: I came to London with nine Horses, and sold seven of them, and had all the Money in my Pocket, being betwixt 40 and 50 l. I had been in the Borough, and was going home to my Lodging at the Corner of Hyde-Park: It was then about Eight at Night, and I enquired the Way as I went along; and somewhere about the Strand I met the Prisoner, and she told me, she'd shew me the Way if I'd give her a Pint of Wine; and so we went together to the Tavern, and instead of one Pint we had four or five. About Eleven o'Clock, I was pretty well tired, and so fell asleep. The Drawer awaked me, and made me feel if I had not lost my Money; and when I felt, I miss'd a great Part of it.</p>

About Eight at Night the Prosecutor and Prisoner came to the Bar, and ask'd for a Room. My Master don't allow Women to go up Stairs; but they looking like civil People, I thought there might be no Hurt in it. They call'd for three Pints of Wine; by which time, I saw enough in their Behaviour to convince me that she was a Woman of the Town. The Man grew drowsy. Honest Friend, says I to him, have a Care what you do; and have a Care of your Money, if you have any about you Money! says he, Yes, I have 40 l. and more, and so let us have t'other Pint. They had it, and afterwards call'd for another, which I brought them; but in the interim, I made several Excuses to go into the Room, that she might have as little Opportunity as possible of being too free with either his Person or Pocket. She call'd to pay. The Reckoning was 5 s. 2 d. The Man was asleep; and she gave me 27 s. (a Guinea and Silver.) I thought she had made some mistake, and ask'd her if she knew what she had given me. Pish is the Man a Fool? says she, and wink'd upon me; Don't you know your Business Can't you take the Money and be quiet? I still refused it; and her pressing me to take it, gave me a strong suspicion that she had pick'd the Countryman's Pocket, and so I told her: She grew angry, and would have gone away; but I was resolved to keep her till I had awaked him, and made him examine his Pockets; which, when he had done, he found that she had pretty well emptied'em. I sent a Porter for the Beadle, who carry'd her to the Round-House.</p>
               <p>- Halliwell the Constable thus deposed: I stript her at the Round-House, and search'd her in every Place. Two Crowns were found in her Stockings, two Moidores in her Hands, several Guineas, a Half-Guinea, a Half-Crown, and a Ring with a Stone and six Sparks in her Pocket, and as many other Guineas in her Bosom, as made up 20 l. 13 s.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made her Defence: I met the Prosecutor in the Strand; he took hold of me, and said I should go and take a Glass with him; but I refus'd and got past him, and was in Hopes to have been troubled with him no more; but he turn'd back, and follow'd me to Temple-Bar. At last, with great Importunity, and much against my Will, I went with him to the Tavern, where we had five Pints of Wine. He press'd me to go to his Lodgings at the White House in Piccadilly, and he with him all Night, and from thence with him into the Country; but I told him I was no such Person. My Dear, says he, if you will but go, you shall want for nothing: I have Money enough, and don't value 30 or 40 l. and if you think I won't be as good as my Word, I'll give it you now. And so he pull'd out his money and threw it into my Lap. And I am so far from being guilty of this that. I am now charged with, that I never did an ill thing in my life.</p>
               <p>- Rimmington, a Barber, and his Mother, at the Perriwig in Black-Fryers, thus deposed: We have known the Prisoner ever since she came from Sunderland, which was above twelve Years ago, for she was a Lodger in our House. She has had three Husbands; two of them are dead, and we saw her marry'd to this third, who is now living; he is a Taylor and a Soldier. She has two Children alive: She has been an industrious Wife, and used to assist her Husband in his Business. She always behaved herself civilly; no Company came to her; and she was never out of her Lodging after Ten o'Clock. <rs id="t17250407-16-verdict98" type="verdictDescription">

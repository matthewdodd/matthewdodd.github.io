            . I am an officer. I went to No. 6, Vine-court, on the 14th of January, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, with Freeman, and found the door fast. Freeman went to one door, and I to the other - I asked for admittance, and somebody inside used a bad expression, and refused to admit us. I then broke the door open, and saw Walker; he jumped out of bed, (the door opened into that room) he had his trowsers on. Aldridge sat in a chair, with a child in his arms, and Gibson rushed out at the front door, Freeman stopped him. I searched the place, and found a glass jug on a side-board, in a corner by the fire place, and behind the back of the stove, I found a two crow bars, a box with phosphorus matches, four keys in an unfinished state, but in preparation for cutting to make picklock keys, and some wax, with the impression of a key on it. The rope ladder was under the bed; it would reach to a third floor room. There was a false back made to the table drawer, and the keys were in there.</p>

            Look at the prisoner, do you know his person - A. Yes, I knew him to be the same man, he came with some fringe for a gentlemen; he came to a young man at the back of the counter at work on the hat now in question. The young man went into the further end of the shop, at the back of the house, to make enquiry; he brought some fringe for a gentleman to have at the upper part of the house; he gave the fringe to a young man that was behind the counter; the young man not exactly knowing who it was for, he would go and make enquiries about it; accordingly he went to the back part of the shop with the frings, and left the prisoner at the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you - A. I was in the shop, in a little enclosed place, at a distance from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anybody with the prisoner then in the shop - A. Not anybody. Before the young man returned the prisoner concealed a hat under his coat. I did not see him put the hat under his coat. I observed the prisoner standing by the counter, and a person coming in to speak to him; that person went but immediately after he had whispered something to the prisoner; in about two minutes after that, the prisoner went out, before the young man returned.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe him do anything yourself, did you - A. No, I was at work upon a hat. The prisoner was not in the shop more than five minutes. Upon his going out, I saw something at the back of his coat, which I suspected to be a hat. It was a close coat he had on; he went out with it in that manner. I immediately followed him, laid hold of him, and told him he must come back to the shop with me; he came back; I told him he had got a hat underneath his coat; he denied it; I said, I will take it from you, and on my turning round the hat fell from him. I secured him, and kept him until my master came. This is the hat that fell from him; I delivered it to Foy, the officer.</p>
               <p>MR. LEVIE. I was going up Bond-street when the prisoner came out of the shop; he attracted my attention; I thought he was tipsey; the shopman followed him. I saw something sticking out. The shopman took the prisoner into the shop. I saw the hat sticking out. When the shopman brought him into the shop the hat fell from the prisoner. The prisoner then asked what we detained him for.</p>

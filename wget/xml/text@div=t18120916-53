I lost my handkerchief on the 22nd of July, between eight and nine, I was coming from the Strand, walking on to Temple Bar. I had used it in the Strand.

I turned round, and the person near me said, the man forward has got your handkerchief. I found my handkerchief was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the city when he took your handkerchief - A. No, on the other side Temple Bar. I was coming from Westminster into the city. At the time I was told my handkerchief was gone; was on the Middlesex side of Temple Bar. I followed him and stopped him. That man was the prisoner. I recollected his person, that he had been near me. I asked him for my handkerchief. He said he had not got it. I opened his coat, and took out the handkerchief from under his left arm pit, stuffed in very close. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and gave the handkerchief to the officer. I saw the prisoner pick up something, and when I went home I found three amlets in my pocket. I saw them lay on the ground. They made a noise. The prisoner picked them up, and when I went home I found them in my pocket. I am not conscious how they got in. This is the handkerchief. I have had it ever since. It is worth seven or eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home between eight and nine. I dropped my handkerchief and stooped to pick it up. The amlets were in my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I was moving them to my warehouse, which is also in Ivy Lane, the fruit meters land them - the prisoner is employed by them - Brook's wharf is about twenty yards to the right of Ivy Lane - a person bringing the potatoes had no business there; it is out of the way - I saw the prisoner carrying a sack of potatoes - he shot three sacks at my warehouse - I had bought all that were at the wharf; when I came to Brook's wharf, in about half an hour, I found a sack of potatoes there, in my own sack, this was about 5 o'clock. I am certain they were from the same bulk as what I bought.</p>

            . I am a salesman. I saw the prisoner carrying a sack of potatoes in a contrary direction to Cox's warehouse, he went through the folding gates of Brook's wharf, and put them down by the saw-pit, behind the gate, and came out. I shewed them to Rains, they were of the same bulk as his.</p>

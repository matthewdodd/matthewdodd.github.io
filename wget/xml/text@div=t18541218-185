                  </hi>. I am a gentleman, residing on my means, in Brompton Crescent. On 9th Aug. I was residing there—I was told some<lb></lb>thing by my servant, in consequence of which I left a message at my house, and on the following morning, about 10 o'clock, the prisoner, William Newton, called—he was shown up into the drawing room—I went there, and said, "Mr. William Newton, what is your business with me?"—he said, "I have called on the part of my brother, Mr. Francis Newton"—I said, "Your brother, Mr. Francis Newton, I have never seen; I know nothing about him, and I never have spoken about him. I have of you, and will tell you what I have said, and my author, if you wish it"—he replied, "Oh, that is immaterial, quite immaterial; it is about my brother, Mr. Francis Newton, I have called"—I replied, "I tell you again, your brother, Mr. Francis Newton, I have never seen; I know nothing about him, and I have never spoken about him"—I never had seen him; I never had spoken about him, and I knew nothing about him—he said, "I am sure that Judas, Captain Davilla, has told you something about him"—he said, "What have you said about myself?"—I said, "Mr. William Newton, I bear you no ill will, no malice; you are a young man, which is your only excuse for doing foolish things which subjects you to unpleasantness. You, some evenings back, whilst standing among a group of gentlemen at Mrs. Robin<lb></lb>son's</p>

               <p>party, at the supper table, asked me, across the table, to honour you by taking wine. Do not take that liberty again, for I will not make your acquaintance"—I said, "What I said to Mrs. Robinson came about thus"—I then told him what I had said of himself; in answer to that he said, "I am sure that ruffian, Davilla, has spoken about my brother to you"—I still declared that was not so, and the interview ended, by my saying, "Now, after this plain and full explanation, if you, or your brother, molest me, I will hand you or him over to the police"—he replied, "Is this the way they do things at Paris?"—I have been a resident in France—I rang the bell, and desired him to leave my house—he seemed unwilling to go, and I went down stairs with him, and he left the house in that way—in the afternoon of that same day (10th Aug.) I was out in Brompton, walking by the side of Captain Davilla, who was on horseback—when I got close to the Brompton high road, a step came up from behind me, and a gentleman stopped me, and said, "I presume I have the honour of addressing Mr. Kerr?"—I bowed, and said, "Yes"—he said, "My name is Mr. Frank Newton"—I said, "Mr. Frank Newton, after the explanation I have given your brother, on your part, this morning, I will hold no conversation with you," and I walked on—he came up after me again and stopped me, and said, "You must speak"—I said, "No, I will not; if you have anything to say to me communicate it in writing"—I walked on, and he stopped me a third time, and said, "You must and shall speak to me"—I said, "I have told your brother, and I tell you, that if you molest me, I will hand you over to the police," and I walked on—he walked up after me, and I felt a blow on the back, which struck my shoulder bone, and I turned round and knocked him down—I stooped down to pick him up again, to knock him down again, when a number of persons came up from behind, all strangers to me, and came between us—I held on to his coat, and his coat ripped up to the collar; a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove up immediately, and he stepped into it, and drove away—I saw no more of him that day, and that was the first time I ever saw him—I had seen William Newton, I think, three or four times before—in consequence of this assault, I went that afternoon to Mr. Arnold, at the Westminster police court, and got a summons, which Mr. Arnold said should be issued for that day week—on the following day I was engaged to a party at Beulah Spa, Norwood—they are pleasure gardens—it was the first time I was ever there—my wife was with me, and other ladies and gentlemen were of the party—there were three ladies of my party who went down with me in my carriage—I did not give the <hi rend="italic">pic nic</hi>, I was invited, and at the gardens we joined a larger number of ladies and gentle<lb></lb>men—there was dancing and other amusements there in the course of the day—about 8 o'clock in the evening we sat down to tea—most of the com<lb></lb>pany were at tea—whilst we were at tea I noticed some five or six persons drinking at a table in front of where we were—they were laughing, and appeared to me to be making remarks upon our party—I noticed Mrs. Newton, the prisoner's mother, and a gentleman who has been pointed out to me as her husband, come up, and look about them—I had not seen either of the defend<lb></lb>ants at that time—shortly after, I heard some altercation going on immediately before us, and a gentleman came up to me and said, "Kerr, there is going to be a <hi rend="italic">row"</hi>—I went forward some few yards when I saw Mr. Francis Newton spring forward upon me, and strike me on the shoulder, saying, "As you would give me no explanation yesterday, I come to punish you, sir"—I felt from the blow that the long whip which he had in his hand was loaded—he leaped back, and sprang forward again, and struck me on the</p>

               <p>chest with the loaded whip, the butt end—it was a long whip, and it appeared to be coiled round his wrist, and springy at the end, like a life-preserver; the butt end of it was about three quarters of an inch in size—my impression is, from the dead blow, that it was loaded; it was a heavy, weighty blow—I tried to grapple with him, when I was jostled down the hill from side to side, and separated from all my party; and Mr. Frank Newton kept sparring at me, going back and striking me from time to time, and his brother, Mr. William Newton, struck me with a stick, with a crooked end to it; a bone end, like the handle of a hunting whip, such as we put a thong to, to whip hares up with—as I was being jostled down, these two were striking me on the head, shoulders, and neck, and my hat was knocked off—I succeeded in grasping Mr. Francis Newton, and he fell, and I upon him, and Mrs. Newton came down upon me and pulled me off her son, and with Mr. William Newton and others held me down—she had a parasol in her hand, which she dug into my back and neck, and said, "Give it to the fellow, give it to the fellow, murder him;" that was at the time her sons were striking me in the way I have described—with some difficulty I got up on my knee, and in getting up I received a blow on the top of the skull from Mr. Francis Newton with the butt end of the whip, that I have already described—I exclaimed, "My God, my skull is broken in!"—I reeled back upon Mrs. Newton, and I became dizzy—I grasped hold of William, and he tried to get from me, moving backwards, when he came against a small garden seat, which fell down, and he over it, and I over him—that was after the blow I had received—the blood poured down my face and ears in streams from the blow—I have a recollection of some one saying to me, "I am a surgeon, do not be afraid;" and I then became quite insensible—I was not conscious of anything afterwards—Dr. Christian attended me afterwards, and also Mr. Johnson, of St. George's Hospital—I was confined to my bed from this injury over three weeks; I am not now recovered; I have got a very severe headache now from answering these questions—I cannot sit in a room where there is a fire, for an hour at a time; I am obliged to go into the open air on account of my head—I feel even now very dizzy.</p>

               <p>name to you, nor did she"—she did not assert that she had my authority—she never contradicted me—I judged from Francis Newton coming up to me and striking me, that Mrs. Robinson might have said something or other about him—she said, "If I had not given your name, he would have molested my son, and probably killed or used him as he did you"—when William Newton called on me on the 9th, he did not say that I had accused his brother, Francis, of embezzlement, when he was in the army; I swear that—Mr. William Newton did not say anything to the effect that I had accused his brother of being dismissed the service for embezzlement—I prevented his saying anything about his brother, by immediately saying, "Your brother I have never seen; I know nothing about him, and have never spoken of him; I have of you, and I will tell you what I have said should you wish it"—William did not refer to my having said something about his brother having received money for the purpose of paying the forces under his command and embezzling it—he never used his brother's name except saying, "I have called on the part of my brother, Francis"—I made the conversation very short, as I wished the interview to be over as quickly as possible—I did not for that purpose take him by the collar and turn him out—I considered it very impertinent of a gentleman, when I went into a full and particular explanation, to say to me, "Is that the way they do things in France?" and I rang the bell, and desired a servant to open the door—he did not seem inclined to leave, and I went to him and took him by the collar, and then he went out of the drawing-room door, and went down stairs—I conceive that I acted rightly—he left the house, and I gave him no other explanation than I have mentioned—he did not give me a card—I said to him, "You are a young man, which leads you to do foolish things:" I never was introduced to Mr. William Newton, and when he asked me at the table to take wine, "I did say so—I did not say that it was presumptuous; I said, "Do not do that again"—when I had knocked Francis Newton down, I took hold of him by the coat to pull him up, to knock him down again.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not they favour him so far as to call out against you as a coward, for being down on this man, and striking him when he was down, and tearing his coat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear it—they did not hoot me—I do not think I was on the top of him when they separated us—I stooped down, and he was undermost—the first time I saw Mr. Francis Newton was when he came up to me in the Brompton-road—I said, "I will hold no conver<lb></lb>sation with you; your brother has seen me"—he came up to me a second time, and I said, "If you have any communication to make to me, make it in writing"—he did not ask me to give him some explanation of the charge I had made against him, because he had no opportunity; I would not listen—we were a large party at Beulah Spa—we had dined together before the rencontre, between 4 and 5 o'clock—Mrs. Robinson was one of the party—she invited me to the <hi rend="italic">pic nic</hi>—at the time Mr. Francis Newton came up to me, Mr. Bass came up to me also, and said, "Kerr, there is going to be a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> "—I presume that Mr. Bass is here, because he has been subpoenaed by me, and I see from the papers that he was a witness before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 29, Howland-street, Fitzroy-square; I do not follow any business. I was one of the <hi rend="italic">pic nic</hi> party at Beulah Spa—I do not know either of the prisoners—I saw them there that day—when I first saw them, Francis was under Mr. Kerr—some strangers passed and struck Mr. Kerr on the back, and the prisoner, William, struck him also with a stick—Mr. Kerr then got up, and the crowd ran up towards where we were sitting at first, and they fell over a seat, and Mr. Kerr fell over William Newton, and they got round by me—I was between Mr. Kerr and Francis Newton when the last blow, the fearful blow, was struck—Francis struck that blow, he had got the whip in his hand in this way, and struck him in this way (<hi rend="italic">imitating the action</hi>)—somebody said, "Why do not you take the whip away?"—several persons said that they could not get it away—William Newton then came and stood by his brother, and then they both ran away up the grove, and I followed, with one of the bandsmen—they ran through the entry gate, where there was one of</p>

                  </hi>., M. D. I live at No. 1, Ovington-terrace, Brompton. On 11th Aug., between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, I was called in to attend Mr. Kerr—on the right side of his head I found an open wound about an inch and a half long, and three quarters of an inch wide, running from behind forwards—it was a lacerated wound, the edges were jagged—I ran my probe along the bone, and found that it was denuded—he seemed a little excited, and wanted to talk about the dinner, but nothing more—I attended him for just a month—on the Saturday there was great excitement going on in his brain, and on the Sunday symptoms of compression of the brain began to show themselves; on Monday morning the case became so urgent that I wished for further advice, and Mr. Johnson, of St. George's Hospital, saw him with me, and attended him with me for three weeks longer—on the Monday night Mr. Kerr went into insensibility, and remained so up to Friday night; after that he slowly and gradually recovered—his life was in great danger on the Tuesday, and I was very much alarmed—the symptoms I have described were the consequence of the wound—I have seen him since his return to town, and have advised him but have not prescribed for him—giddiness is one of the symptoms of the injury—he will not recover such a serious injury for one or two years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach builder and job master, living in Russell-mews, Russell square. I cannot say who gave the party, but I was applied to by Dr. Bond, for my four in hand drag, and I drove some of the ladies and gentlemen, who were in company with Mr. Kerr, to Beulah Spa—after they had had tea, I was sitting at a table in the gardens; Dr. Bond and several gentlemen were at the table, and Mr. Kerr's post boy was sitting by the side of me—Mr. Kerr was sitting within two yards of me—several gentlemen were having tea after the ladies had done, about the same distance as you are from me—somebody, I do not know who, came up and spoke to Mr. Kerr, who left the table where he was having tea, and walked down on the grass plot, and met two gentlemen, who were standing just on the brow of the hill—I do not know who they were—some words took place, and they commenced quarrelling and wrestling like—I and the post boy ran up, and just as we got up they had been down once, and had got up again—Mr. Kerr then <hi rend="italic">tackled</hi> one, and the post boy the other—when they com<lb></lb>menced wrangling, Mr. Kerr pushed them off like this, but there was no blow struck—I had not seen a blow struck at all then, but they then com<lb></lb>menced wrestling and fell—I and the post boy then ran up—Mr. Kerr <hi rend="italic">tackled</hi> the big one, and the post boy the little one—Mr. Kerr and Francis Newton commenced fighting the same as the post boy and Mr. William did, only Mr. Francis had got a whip in his hand—the little one fought with his fists, but the other one had the whip—Mr. Kerr fought right and left with the one with the whip in his hand, and on the second round I <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> hold of the post boy, and said, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "D—n you, fight for your own party"—I said, "Let them fight their own games; what has that to do with you or me?"—after I took the post boy away, Mr. Kerr and the little Newton had a scuffle together, and Mr. Kerr knocked him down on the edge of the flower bed, and fell on the top of him—he had had him down about half a minute, <hi rend="italic">a punching of him</hi>, and striking <hi rend="italic">of</hi> him when he was down, holding him with the one hand and giving it to him with the other, when I <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> hold of him, and said, "D—n you, fight fair," and I pulled him off and held him till the other one got up, and recovered himself, and then I let him go again; and after that they had a round, and there was an iron chair, over which they went in the scuffle, and broke the back of it—I did not see where Francis Newton went to after that, for there were so many ladies and gentlemen about there—I should think the chair was five or six yards from them when the struggle first began, and they fought down hill—Mr. Kerr followed, and the Newtons retreated—Francis Newton had a whip, and I saw him strike Mr. Kerr with, it—he could not strike him unless he had it, because Mr. Kerr was so high up—he was on the high ground, and stood a foot and a half higher than the Newtons did.</p>

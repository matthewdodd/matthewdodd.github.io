                  </hi>. I live at Coventry-court, Haymarket. The pri<lb></lb>soner was my fellow-servant—on the 27th of May, at four o'clock in the morning, I went to bed—I left the shawl and veil in the parlour—about nine o'clock in the morning the prisoner came to me—I came down directly afterwards, and found all the drawers open, and my shawl and veil were gone—it was a black shawl, and figured all over—the veil was figured with a border, and was very large.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 17, Middlesex-street, Whitechapel, and am a clothesman—on the 27th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was coming along St. Giles, crying "Clothes," and heard a woman call "Jew"—I turned, and saw the prisoner with a bundle—she took me under an archway, and showed me some articles, and asked a sovereign for them—they were worth about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I offered her 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she would not take it—there were three gowns, a veil, and a shawl—Mr. Lewis, in Coventry-court, where the prisoner lived, was a customer of mine—he keeps a "company house"—I purchase his old clothes—I called on him on Friday morning after, Jacobs came out, and said Mr. Lewis would be down directly—he came down—I asked if he had any thing for me—he said, "No "—we stood talking—he said, "I was robbed some days ago "—he did not tell me of what—I recollected that I saw something on the Wednesday—he told me his servant was gone—I had never seen the servant, but something struck me it was his servant—I asked him if his servant had robbed him—he said the woman had gone away with some things on Wednesday morning—I said, "I saw a woman without a shawl or bonnet on, in St. Giles"—I sometimes go to Mr. Lewis once or twice a month, and sometimes oftener—I buy a good deal of him—he is no relation of mine, nor is Jacobs.</p>

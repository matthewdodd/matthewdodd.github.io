                  </hi>. I live with Mr. John Ballantyne, a hosier and glover, in Bedford-street. On the 4th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw a man resembling the prisoner snatch the articles stated from a block three feet within the shop-door—I cried out, "Hey, stop. and ran to the door, where I saw the prisoner hurrying away—there were no persons passing—he ran as fast as he could—I pursued him through Red Lion-square, and into Leigh-street, continually shouting "Stop thief"—he was there stopped by the policeman—I said he had taken a stock and handkerchief—he said he had only asked the price of the stock.</p>

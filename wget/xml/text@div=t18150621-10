The shop and the house had been fastened up the night previous. I was alarmed by this noise, and immediately got up;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210008"></xptr>I heard some glass fall out of the glass partition; I went down stairs, and found that the shutters had been removed; the window broken, and two pieces of Irish linen, each containing twenty-six yards, were stolen. There are four persons sleep on the same floor. I immediately put on my great coat, and went out at the private door, to see what had been done outside; I there discovered that the bar had been forced up, and the shutters forced down, and this linen taken away. The watchman came immediately, and assisted me in putting up the shutters again. In consequence of some information that I received, that a man was taken to Marlborough-street on suspicion of having stolen some linen, which was found on him; I went there, and identified the property to be mine.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner on the morning of the robbery, about twelve minutes before two, in King-street, Soho, he had a bundle under his arm; there was another person with him. I stopped him, and asked him, what he had got; he replied, nothing belonging to me. I insisted on seeing what it was, and on laying hold of it, he struck me with a stick, and ran away.

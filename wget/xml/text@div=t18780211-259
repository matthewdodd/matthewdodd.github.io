I am the prisoner's wife—in consequence of some differences between us I was living apart from him in January last—on 18th January I was staying with Mrs. Beresford in the East India Road—I saw my husband on that day, when he shot me—I was only just up—I had been ill in bed all day—it was about five in the afternoon—I had sent for him, and some one told me he was waiting to see me—I came up the stairs from the kitchen—I did not see him at all—he stood in the dark in the parlour, there was no light there, only in the hall—Mrs. Beresford followed me upstairs, and I said to her "Where is he, Mrs. Beresford?"—he said "Here I am, my dear"—I said "How can you dear me, when you know you have been unkind to me?"—I don't remember hearing him reply—I saw the flash of fire in my face, and heard the report of a revolver, and I remember nothing more till I saw him with the policeman—I felt no pain—I found my hand was full of blood.</p>

I am the wife of Alfred Beresford, of 146, East India Road—on 18th January Mrs. Potter was staying with me—the prisoner came there about 2 o'clock and asked if I was in—my little girl said yes—he asked if his wife was in, she said she was ill in bed—he came down into the kitchen and said "Is my wife ill?"—I said "Not particularly ill, only she has got a bad headache"—he said he would like her to sign a paper of separation—I said "I will tell her what you say"—he said "All right, I should like to see her, and she can speak for herself"—I said "Certainly, so she can; you can see her, but don't come to-morrow; being Saturday, I shall be busy; come on Monday morning and then you can talk it over"—he then went away—later in the day she sent my little boy to him to tell him not to come—after that, about 5 o'clock, the prisoner came again—I told him that I had told his wife what he had said, and she was annoyed at it—I then went downstairs and told her that her husband was upstairs in the passage—I had left him standing just inside my parlour door; there was a light in the passage, but not in the parlour—his wife came upstairs, I followed her—he said "Hallo, my dear"—she said "Why do you call me your dear when you say that I tell lies?"—he said "You do tell lies, and you always did tell lies"—she said "You say that I told lies while I was in Weymouth; who</p>

I hope that the world won't think that it is through jealousy, but it is the idea of her depriving me of my rights of being with her and my darling boy; God bless his dear little innocent heart, I love him dearly. My dear friends, believe me, I am truly heart-broken, therefore I care not to live. I hope that this will be published directly after I am dead for the sake of justice. I hope and trust that some of my family will take my darling child and bring him up. I should like for my sister to have him. My sister's address is Miss M. Potter, Mr. R. J.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of East India Dock Road—on 18th January I was called to Mrs. Beresford's house—I saw Mrs. Beresford first—I found her suffering from a wound in the left breast—I probed it and extracted a conical cylindrical bullet, which I produce—I next saw Mrs. Potter, she was suffering from two distinct wounds on the right side of the head and one on the left; the two on the right side were caused by one bullet, the entry and aperture of exit communicating by probe right through; the wound on the left side was over the cheek bone, under the eye—I probed that; the probe took a course directly backwards to the root of the left ear, and detected this piece of metal deeply imbedded in the textures—we had to cut down upon it to extract it—it is a similar bullet to the other, but greatly obliterated—I have attended Mrs. Potter ever since—she has been in rather a dangerous con<lb></lb>dition—erysipelas set in—I considered the wounds dangerous wounds—she is still under care—the jaw is rather stiff—she is not able to masti<lb></lb>cate—she was in bed three or four days—I examined Robinson—I found a wound on the left side of his neck immediately below the angle of the jaw—I failed to find that bullet.</p>

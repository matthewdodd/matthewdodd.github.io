                  </hi>. I am an ivory turner. I live in Mansfield-street—on the 6th of Nov. I packed up some boxes in my cart—I went to Bow, and called on Mr. Jones—I had a box safe on my cart when I went into Mr. Jones's, and when I came out it was gone—it contained the articles men<lb></lb>tioned in this indictment—I heard no more of it till I was in Blackfriars-road on the 28th of Nov., and saw some of the articles in a shop window—I made inquiries and went to the police-station, and then to Mr. Collins's—he took me to the prisoner's house in Hackney-road—when we got there Mr. Collins asked if Mr. Bridges was at home—Mrs. Bridges said he was not—he was sent for, and came in a few minutes—Mr. Collins asked the prisoner if he had sold the knitting-cases—he said he had not—the policeman then asked the prisoner if he would produce them—he said, "Yes, and he brought the knitting-cases and squares forwards from the back place (he keeps a broker's shop)—the officer asked him if he could tell him who he bought them of—he said he would tell him in the morning—the officer said, "You must do as Collins has done, or else come with me to the station"—the pri<lb></lb>soner then took us to Petticoat-lane, and from thence to Bell-lane—he asked at a house for Myers—Mrs. Myers said, "Is that you, Mr. Bridges; will you step in?"—he said, "No, I will not, I will call again"—she said Mr. Myers was not in—we walked about for a quarter of an hour—we then went to the house, and sat there till between three and four o'clock in the morning—Myers then came into the room—the prisoner said, "That is Mr. Myers that I bought the goods of'—Myers said, "What do you mean?"—the prisoner said, "The knitting-pins and the chess<lb></lb>men that I bought of you last week"—Myers said, "I do not know you; I do not know what you mean"—he was then questioned by the constable, and asked if he ever had any transaction with the prisoner, and he acknowledged he had sold him some ironmongery goods, and knew him perfectly well—he said he bad had several business transactions with the prisoner—here is some lance-wood pins which I sell at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, and the ivory ones at 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen to my customers—they could not be made fairly and sold under that.</p>

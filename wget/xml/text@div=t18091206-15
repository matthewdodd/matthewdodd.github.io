             was; I said he was at the play: I delivered the message to him that Captain

             desired me, and then lit him into Captain

               <p>Q. When Hoffhold was above stairs did you hear any noise of any kind. - A. I did: it appeared to me like a chair removed from the place and went back again: I went up stairs to the door, he came out of the room with the candle in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular about him. - - A. No, I did not: I went into the room afterwards, at first I did not perceive any thing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mrs. Smith you saw nothing particular at first. A. No, I went into the room, he went with me again, and I asked him if he had prepared every thing ready; he said yes, he had; I asked him if he had any messuage to deliver to him, I would tell him; he said he thought he should not be able to come to-morrow, nor the next day, he might come the next day at night, but, he was not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. During this time did you see any thing particular in him. - A. No, he was in a great hurry to go; he talked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060012"></xptr>all manner of words to me, but I paid no attention to him; I let him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you the medicine for Mr. Hanson, when he came home. - A. He left the medicines in the room. It was a little after ten o'clock when he went away.</p>

               <p>Q. When he came out of the room, did he appear to to you as though he did not know what he was about. - A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he like a man that was stupid drunk. - A. Yes, he was all in confusion.</p>
               <p>. Do you mean that he was agitated, did he appear to shake. - Yes he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he very drunk or was he only flush with liquor. A. Oh! he was only flush with liquor.</p>

            , 30, Fish-street-hill. It is my father's writing. I saw him put that endorsement to that note. The watermark is upside down, which is a circumstance we noticed. From that endorsement alone I can swear to the note.</p>

            . I am one of the police officers at Lambeth-street office. On the 24th of November captain Hanson called on me, he had been robbed. I went with him to the banking house of Prescott and Co-62 in Threadneedle-street. I went there to enquire for the number of the note; I got the number of the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body here from Prescott and Co. - A. No, there is not, I traced the note to the Bank. On the Saturday, I apprehended the prisoner in St. Catharine's, where he seemed to keep medicine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. You did not apprehend him till the Saturday, that was two days after the supposed robbery - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that Mrs. Smith had been him before that - A. No, I did not know that, I never heard of it. I took up the prisoner and brought him before the magistrate; Mr. Smith charged him upon suspicion of committing this robbery in his house; he was committed for re-examination, he was put in the lock-up-room. I do not know what conversation passed between him and Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. The note is supposed to have been lost on the 23d. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was on the morning of the 25th that the prisoner was apprehended - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go by captain Hanson's desire to the prisoner - A. No, I did not, my own inclination led me, when he was locked up; it was after this first examination; I conversed with him outside of the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060013"></xptr>Q. Did you lead him into the conversation of this note by promising him, that if he would confess that Captain 
               <persName id="t18091206-15-person207">Hanson</persName>
             would not prosecute him. - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that before this conversation, Griffiths, the officer, had searched him, and nothing could be found upon him. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then having been searched, and nothing found, you went and promised him, that if he would confess, Captain 
               <persName id="t18091206-15-person208">Hanson</persName>
             would not prosecute him. - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Morris, a pawnbroker in the Minories. I believe the prisoner to be the man whom I took this watch of on the 24th of November: I think when he pledged the watch with me, he had a great coat on; I believe him to be the man; he resembles the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him on pledging the watch. - A. Very little; no more than what was in my business.</p>
               <p>Q. From the conversation that you had with the person who pledged the watch, do you know whether he was an Englishman or a foreigner. - A. I am sure the person that pledged the watch is a foreigner.</p>
               <p>Q. And he pledged the watch that you have in your hand. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. - You had never seen the prisoner before had you. - A. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. - Q. To Mr. Sharp. Look at that watch. - A. This is the same watch that I sold; there are figures of my own upon it, No. 8m&amp;7, on the edge of the case; it is a peculiar watch, and I believe only made by ourselves</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

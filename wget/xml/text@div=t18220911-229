I had five sovereigns in my pantaloons pocket, with fifteen or sixteen shillings in silver; I called Stop thief! I only saw one person; I was knocked down, I do not know who by. I became senseless by the blow, and cannot say whether my pocket-book was taken or not before I was knocked down, but my pockets had not been rifled of my money. When I recovered my senses, I found myself in the hands of the watchmen, and that my money was all gone - it had been loose in my pocket. I had no opportunity of observing the person of the man - the blow was very severe, and I was bruised about the loins, which, I think, must have been from a kick after I was knocked down. I found the prisoner was secured. I saw my pocket-book next morning at the watch-house, with the two Bank-notes and papers in it. I have never heard of the money. When Pincombe came up, I was on the spot where I was knocked down.</p>

            . I am a watchman of White's-yard. About one o'clock in the morning, I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner running down from the end of White's-yard, in a direction from where the cry came; he was alone - there was nobody before him, or near him, when I first caught sight of him. I tried to stop him, but he ran so fast, and with such force, that he broke from my hold. I pursued him. (The spot where I saw him runing was about fifty yards from where I found Curtis.) He was stopped without my losing sight of him, within three or four yards of me. I found Curtis between the corner of White's-yard, and the City of Carlisle, public-house. After taking the prisoner to the watch-house, I came down again on my beat, and found the pocket-book about three o'clock, opposite the Compasses, public-house, within about four yards of where he was stopped; nobody was passing near that spot when the prisoner was running. I gave it to Plunkett, the beadle; and found two notes in it, and papers. I shut it up without examining it.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Coultney, a wheelwright, in Church-lane, Whitechapel. I had been out with a friend on this night, and coming down the street, I saw Pincombe, and soon after I heard the cry. I was standing right opposite the Compasses, in White's-yard, at the time - I turned round, and the prisoner fell into my arms. Pincombe, who was following, came up and secured him. Nobody but the prisoner was near; I saw Curtis three or four minutes after; he was about sixty or seventy yards from where the prisoner was stopped, and appeared hurt a great deal, and said he had been robbed; he had a bruise on the head - it did not bleed. I did not see the pocket book found.</p>

            . I am the watch-house keeper. Greenwood was brought into my custody; he said he knew nothing of it. Pincombe delivered me the pocketbook about three o'clock; it contained letters directed to Cornwall, and other papers, and two one-pound Bank notes; the prosecutor claimed it, and the contents. I searched both the men who were taken, but found nothing particular upon them.</p>

               <p>"Why don't you take off your hat?" I told him if he had asked me civilly I would have taken it off. I had my hand on my pocket-book - a person jostled my hat, I released my hand from my pocket-book to put my hat right, and on returning it I missed my pocket-book; the prisoner was then running away, I pursued and caught him. A person came up, struck me with an umbrella, and said the prisoner was not the person, but that my pocket-book was picked up on the spot I had gone from. It was returned to me before the Magistrate.</p>

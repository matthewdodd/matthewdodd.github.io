I staid there about half an hour. The moment I came out I was collared and pulled down upon my face; they rifled my pockets, and tried to get my watch, and broke the chain. They took two guineas and three 2l. notes from me. I have some recollection of Fowler, but will not say he is one of them - I know nothing of the others. Duncan came out and assisted me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DUNCAN. On the 2d of May I was at the Ship, and saw Mr. Clarke come out. The prisoners, Fowler and Moses, laid hold of him, and threw him down - I went up and endeavoured to take him away from them. I caught Fowler and Moses with their knees upon him, and their hands in his pockets. Fowler cried out, "hit the b-g-r," and struck me and cut my lips open. I will positively swear they are the men - I have seen them before. I saw them again the next day, and went down to Clarke. I went the next night with the officer, saw them there again, and took them all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. They were round the door again the next night when I took them. I am a barber and a weaver - I never heard of a reward.</p>
               <p>Prisoner FOWLER. Q. Did you not say you should have a dozen of us - A. Yes; there were more that I could swear to, but they are gone. I have heard Gardiner talk about a 40l. reward before they were taken; I told him of it. He asked me if I knew any of them, I said I did; he said, if they were cast I should have 40l.; he said it depended upon their being cast.</p>
               <p>RICHARD CAREY. I am a weaver, and live in Holywell-street, Shoreditch. I was at the Ship; I saw Clarke come out - He was pulled down. I saw Fowler with his knee on his back; there were about twenty persons round him; Duncan lifted him up. The next day I went to the Ship, to see if any of them had been taken. I saw Dalton come up, and I told him Fowler was one of them.</p>

I could have taken him, but there was a gang round. In about an hour, Dalton came with Duncomb, and we took Fowler. Duncomb went round, and picked out all the others, singly, and charged two others with another robbery. Carey swore to him for another robbery, and took him for this. I stood inside the door.</p>

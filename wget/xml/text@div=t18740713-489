I am divisional surgeon to the police, and reside at West Ham—on the evening of 10th June, about 7.50, I was called to the police-station and saw the deceased there on a stretcher—I examined him and found that he was dead—I saw no marks—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination next morning about 11 o'clock, but saw no marks—the brain was very much extravasated with blood and congested—the lungs were healthy, the heart flabby and weak, the liver slightly enlarged and, in my opinion, diseased—I do not think that had anything to do with the cause of death—I cannot say what was the cause of death—the state of the brain was consistent with a blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gross-examined.</hi> Death may have arisen from various causes, it might have been from apoplexy, the giving way of the vessels of the brain—the heart was in such a state of disease as to render death likely at any moment, but I should not have expected to find extravasation of blood on the brain from disease of the heart—from the condition of the liver I should think he had been a hard drinker—I saw no signs of a blow either exter<lb></lb>nally or internally, but, unfortunately, I never saw the body afterwards—I was very ill at the time—I would not pledge myself that death resulted from a blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Contentment-place, Turner's-square, Hoxton, and am a tin-plate worker. On the 6th of July I was bathing, and my clothes and boots were by the side—the prisoner came up and said he would wait for us, and then I and another went in—when I came out the prisoner was sitting on the bundle, and he said, "I shall not let you have your bundle till you have wetted your back"—I went in and did it, and then he said "I shall have a bathe, "he pulled off his jacket and waistcoat, and threw them over my boots—he took them up wrapped them up and ran away, and said" there is a man coming"—he ran off, and we ran after him, but could not catch him—I did not see him put the boots into the bundle, but he wrapped the jacket and waistcoat up <hi rend="italic">very</hi> carefully, and then the boots were gone.</p>

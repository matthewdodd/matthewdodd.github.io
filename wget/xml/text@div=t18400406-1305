                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a Thames police officer. I took the prisoner—I asked him how he got the clothes—he said he got them from the washer-woman, and he had done wrong, but was drunk at the time—he said the prosecutor did not allow him to get them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went with him, and left some things of my own to be washed, and when I went for them the washerwoman asked if I would take his things, as we both belonged to one vessel. I took them. I got tipsy, and the vessel he was on board of left the dock that night. I then went on board another vessel, and when I returned I saw the pro<lb></lb>secutor going by in a boat; I hailed him to come and fetch his things. I said I had worn them, as I was short of linen; but I would make him any recompence; he would not take less than half-a-sovereign; that was more than they were worth, and be gave charge of me.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I was employed as a watchman by night, and a labourer by day, at Barr's wharf; it is called Simmons's wharf; Gehan worked with me; we were employed in changing sugar out of cases into puncheons.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were doing that were there any other vessels prepared by Perry? - A. Yes; four puncheons, one tierce, one barrel, and one hogshead; Perry was the foreman of the wharf; I got orders and the worst was put into the puncheons for the merchants, and the best for themselves; they were neither scrapings nor sweepings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In what words was that order given? - A. To fill those casks with the best when a good case came; it was put into place by itself in the fallow warehouse, and instead of putting that into the hogsheads for the merchants, it was put into the puncheons; they would sometimes throw the merchant in an odd shovel full of the best, and take the rest themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. In this way how much was carried away? - A. Four puncheons, one tierce, one barrel, and one hogshead; I helped to roll them down through the master's yard, through the private yard of Mr. Barr's house; it was eight days before we had completed it; I had nothing besides my wages, which was eighteen-pence a day, except I used to get an odd drink of beer.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. Have you any reason upon earth to believe that any more than those two puncheons went to Mr. Wackerbarth's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In the conveyance of the sugar you are now speaking of, did it run at all? - A. Greatly indeed, it run all over the cart, and dripped out as it went along; it was of a very dark-brown colour; it appeared to be dirty; I scraped some of it out of the cart for fear I should have a noise about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been accustomed to convey sugar in carts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see sugar appear like this? - A. I never saw any so bad before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. How were your casks coopered? - A. Very badly coopered.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I am one of the clerks at Barr's-wharf: In consequence of something that Perry and Haynes told me, I went to Mr. Wackerbarth's in the month of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Perry has been convicted, and Haynes has fled? - A. Yes; I went to Mr. Wackerbarth's, he was not at home; I spoke to the clerk first, and then Mr. Wackerbarth came in; I told him I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150049"></xptr>come from Barr's wharf for the payment of two puncheons of sugar; Mr. Wackerbarth applied to his clerk to know what quantity, and what sum; the clerk told him, and then he wrote a check.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that? - A. That is the same check.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did you make out your bill of parcels? - A. Messrs. G. Wackerbarth and Co. to the clerks of Simmons's wharf, two puncheons of sugar; I do not recollect the exact weight, but to the best of my recollection, it was 18 cwt. at 38s. amounting to 34l. 6s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive the cash upon that check? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your share of the plunder? - A. Fifteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you receive from the other house? - A. Haynes received 60l. it was divided between the clerks of Barr's wharf, Haynes, the King's locker, and the coopers.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not servants of the wharf? - A. No; 94l. 6s. was all that I know of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gibbs. Q. When you applied to Mr. Warkerbarth, he applied to his clerk, Mr. Beaumont, who id dead? - A. Yes; he told him the quantity, and the sum.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you know that Mr. Wackerbarth voluntarily produced this check before the Magistrates? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately that it was asked for? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Murphy.) Q. Was there any difference in point of quality between the puncheons that went to Mr. Wackerbarth, and those that went elsewhere? - A. Much on an average, all the best and the brightest.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I am a broker engaged in the sugar business.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of Havannah sugar in the month of July? - A. Havannah sugar in the month of July was worth from 70 to 86s. per cwt. without the duty; I believe the duty is 37s. or therabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Havannah sugar is a particular kind of sugar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are speaking of found, undermaged sugar? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Is Havannah sugar, after it has been damaged by sea-water, distinguishable from sugar of our own colonial produce? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Lord Kenyon. From what I have heard of Hamburgh causes, I believe it does not penetrate very far.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. You have sold some of the Neptune's cargo? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose that which went to Mr. Wackerbarth's to be the best and brightest, what was it worth? - A. The best of it, in the month of July, was worth 86s.</p>
               <p>Q. Which you know, by having sold some? -Yes.</p>
               <p>You sold the damaged sugar which was sent to the merchants? - A. Yes; and that brought from 74 to 88s.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Including the duty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read, as follows:)</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, - I leave my case to my Cousel, and all mintue observations upon the Crown's evidence, as well as that which I shall offer in my defence to your Londship's humane consideration, in stating it ot the Jury hereafter; I have only a few observations to make upon that part of the proof that applies to me, for as to all that part of it which establishes the guilt of the seller, I am not interested in resisting it, and feel as much regret and indignation upon the subject, as can possibly be felt by the Court. The case, as far as I am affected by the evidence, is shortly this: The clerks at the wharfs have been accustomed to receive, as a perquisite, the drainings and sweepings of the sugar, and there is no evidence whatever of any previous knowledge on my part, or of any of my servants, of the condition of this cargo of sugar, or of the frauds practised upon the wharf, regarding it; I was wholly ignorant, until Hort, the witness, came for the money in payment for it; I referred therefore to Mr. Beaumont for the quality and amount of the sugar, which I had neither seen nor contracted for; the bill of parcels was "to the clerks of Simmons; wharf;" and having nothing to conceal, or any management to practice, instead of paying in money which common sense would have dictated, it I had considered the transaction as dishonest, or irregular, I made it payable by a draft upon my banker; and so wholly unconscious was I of guilt or dishonour, that even when the fraud of the seller was detected, and I was before the Magistrates, I spontaneously produced the check, and delivered it into their possession. This is the whole of the transaction which could have been proved by Beaumont, who is since dead; I regret that Divine Providence had deprived me of testimony so important, but I declare most solemnly, in the presence of God, that I had given him no instructions, directly or indirectly, respecting this sugar; that I had no concern in the contract till Hort applied for the money, and no knowledge of any such sugar till I paid for it, when I referred to Beaumont for the price and quantity, and drew the check. This transaction took place in the middle of July, and the sugar, which I never saw, was taken to the scum-house, and worked up in the ordinary course of business; it was not till two months afterwards that the frauds were detected, and it was then im<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150050"></xptr>possible to appeal to the quality. I am not, however, without the means of repelling the evidence of Gehan and Murphy; their account of the sugar is inconsistent with the account given by the carman who carried it, as to the quality and value; and it will appear, by the evidence of several intelligent witnesses who were employed in working it, to be a mixture of sugar, water, and flush, and smelling strongly of far; that it was not worth more than the money given for it; that it failed even in the process of converting it into bastard-sugar, and was only sit to be made into treacle in the scum house; surely this ought to outweigh the evidence of two men who are accomplices in the original guilt. This is all which it is necessary for me to state, to lead your attention to the evidence, as I am affected by it, and I ask no more. I take as strong an interest as any man can do, in the protection of the trade of this great City, from the innumerable frauds it is subject to; and strongly, as I contend my innocence, and feel the humiliation of so public an appearance at this bar, I bear it with chearfulness, when I recollect the advantage that will be derived to the merchants, in exposing the frauds that are practised, and by which many men may be circumstanced, as I am, when even by accident, or misfortune, or, at the very worst, the incaution of his servant, he may be involved in the appearance of guilt. I am far removed, by my situation in life, from the temptation to commit the crime with which I am charged. Had the evidence brought against me been positive and unsuspected, I could not have appealed to situation and character; but, in a case like the present, when guilt is only to be established by inference, I am persuaded the justice of the Court, and even the candour and humanity of the Counsel for the prosecution, will concur in the testimony of the most honorable men well acquainted with trade. I trust, that I shall not only be acquitted by your verdict, but that my character will be delivered from suspicion.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Murphy.) Q. Was there not a great quantity of far in the warehouse? - A. There was some all about.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Was there any in the fallow warehouse? - A. No; there was some at the door over which they were rolled, but to prevent its touching, they put down some of the broken cases to roll it over.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Erskine. I am a wharfinger, and have been fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what is the practice with respect to the drainings of sugar? - A. The sweepings and the drainings of the sugar upon the wharf are allowed to the wharfinger, or any person he shall appoint to sell them, for the purpose of keeping the warehouses clean; that is a resolution of the West-India merchants, and a practice known to all who are interested in the commodity; the wharfinger is to dispose of the sweepings and drainings if he pleases, or he may give them to his clerk in order to keep the warehouses clean; if that was not to be done the warehouses would be knee deep.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner at the bar? - A. I am not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Are these warehouses, which you say but for this would be knee deep, your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the persons employed in them are your servants? - A. They are gangsmen.</p>
               <p>Q. Employed by you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For which you are reimbursed by a small profit from the merchant? - A. No; the gangsmen are appointed by the wharfinger to superintend that part of the business, and they have the porterage.</p>
               <p>Q. Which they have from the merchant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of a wharfinger's clerk's place? - A. I don't know; if it was a considerable matter, I should think the wharfinger would take it himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it understood that the price which the west-India merchant pays to his wharfinger includes an obligation to superintend the business, or is it a sinecure? - A. Certainly to superintend it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a part of the perquisite of sweepings and scrapings, to prevent its being knee deep, to take three parts of a hogshead. - Is that the course of the trade known and approved by the whole body of West-India merchants? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was, the West-India merchants must be the greatest fools that ever lived. - I take it, the scrapings are small quantities of droppings from the bulk of the commodity? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever occur under your eye, as a wharfinger of reputation, as I know you are, to see your labourers taking out the best of the commodity for their own perquisite, and leaving the flush only for the merchant? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a sort of thing which falls within the description of perquisite? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know perquisites to the clerk amount to eight tons and a half of the best and brightest? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If such a thing did occur, should you not think it a most nefarious thing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it frequently happen, in the management of one ship's cargo, that there shall be sent out from your wharf four puncheons, one barrel, one hogshead, and one tierce, as perquisites of sweepings and scrapings? - A. Certainly not; if it had I should have paid for it as a wharfinger.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Q. Though a ship's cargo could not have scrapings to such an amount as these wicked men have taken, might not such a quantity as two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150051"></xptr>puncheons be accumulated, not from one ship's cargo, but from many, so as to be sold as drainings and scrapings? - A. Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, supposing me to be a scum-boiler, and I, not knowing where it came from, might have purchased fairly and honestly to such an amount? - A. Yes, and more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. If it is collected fairly, some today, some to-morrow, some next week, and from different cargoes, will it be all bright, and of the same quality? - A. I know nothing of Havannah sugars.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Havannah sugar so common a commodity in the market, as that in a short space of time it would be probable that sair scrapings and sweepings would amount to two puncheons? - A. It depends upon quantity.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. By management, or rather mismanagement, may not scrapings and sweepings be increased? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Do you mean to say, from the quantity of Havannah sugar imported into this country, which is comparatively small, there would probably be an accumulation of two hogsheads as a perquisite? - A. If the cargo came in damaged, I don't know what it might do, it depends upon the quality of the goods; I have known a hogshead pass the scale that has run a pail-full.</p>
               <p>Q. We know that this is not like the ordinary colonial produce, it can only come here in one of two ways, either as prize, or by misfortune, under the King's key; I ask then, is it likely that such a quantity should be accumulated from any one ship's cargo, to any wharfinger's clerk? - A. It certainly would not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Q. Considering the quantity that might run from damaged sugar, or the scrapings and drainings from damaged sugar, if two puncheons were brought to a scum-boiler by the clerks of a wharf, is it a quantity so unlikely to arise from such a cause that the man must immediately see it was not scrapings and sweepings? - A. No; the quantity is not enormous.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Is it a part of the custom to make no enquiries? - A. I never sold any, and therefore I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this molasses and scrapings worth thirty-eight shillings - upon your oath, is it worth more than fourteen shillings? - A. I can mention one circumstance - last year a hogshead of sugar fell into the water, and was with great difficulty saved; it was taken up upon a tarpaulin, Mr. Wackerbarth bought it, and gave forty shillings for it; it was worth seventy or eighty shillings before it fell into the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity to see how far the water had penetrated? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Thames water is very different from the North Foreland, I fancy, - supposing it to be fair scrapings, reduced to molasses by sea-water, observe, mixed with tar, and running about in the cart, do you mean to represent, that thirty-eight shillings is any thing about the price? - A. I would answer the question if it was in my power, but I really don't know sugars at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. - (To Hort.) Q. Have you, upon any occasion besides this, had dealings with Mr. Wackerbarth for fair scrapings? - A. Yes, drainings and scrapings, two puncheons, he gave me fourteen shillings per hundred weight; it was very dirty, scraped off the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, which was the best of the two? - A. The Havanah sagar,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever before get, for any scrapings, thirty-eight shillings? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. There are two Mr. Wackerbarth's, father and son? - A. Yes; I remember, in July last, Mr. Cleaver's cart coming from simmons's wharf with two puncheons, Mr. Beaumont, the clerk, was there, he is now dead; Mr. Beaumont took the bung out, and looked at them, he put a stick in and examined it all over; some of the stuff worked out upon the floor, it was in a liquid state; I examined it, it contained water, dirt, and sugar, mixed together, and a very strong smell of tar; I sent it to the scum-house.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been employed in this trade? - A. For thirty years; it was more than a fortnight working up in the scum-house; but I took very little notice of it after it first came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. I have got some of this to sell, will you give me thirty-eight shillings for it. - I should drive a hard bargain with you, should not I? - A. At that time it was not worth so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Sweepings and scum is not worth more than fourteen shillings per hundred weight, is it, upon your oath? - A. According to what it is.</p>
               <p>Q. No man ever dreamed of giving twenty shillings? - A. I am no judge of sweepings.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the stuff ordinarily sent to the scum-house bought at so high a price as twenty shillings a hundred weight, upon your oath? - A. According to what it is</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your master int he habit of giving fourteen shillings for it at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of bastard sugars at that time; if they were good bastards, after a fortnights labour, would they not sell at four pounds the hundred weight? - A. Yes; but there is a great deal of waste.</p>

               <p>Q. When it was craned up, did you see what it was? - A. No, not till it came down again; it did not suit to make any thing more of it than molasses, and it was sent down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to work any part of it into bastard sugar? - A. Yes, but it did not succeed; it looked a little better than common scrapings, but it smelt of tar.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was it better? - A. There was a little more sugar in it than there is in the ordinary scrapings; there was no dry sugar in it though at all.</p>

               <p>Lord Kenyon. All the evidence that presses against this gentleman is, that seeing the bill of parcels describing it to be so much the hundred weight, he gave a check upon his banker for the amount; I do not say it is not evidence to have some weight, but it is not that forcible evidence, that if it came without other evidence to support it I should much have pressed upon a Jury. The prosecution is as fit an one as ever was instituted, the safety of the merchants of London seems to me to be involved under the protection which the law holds out to them, by subjecting people who do wrong to prosecutions. I confess it appears to me, that neither the wharfingers, or any body employed for the wharfingers, care one single farthing whether the property is protected or not; instead of protecting it, they hold out hires and temptations to plunder, to those who ought to protect. I put one question to Mr. Ogle, whether management, or rather mismanagement, might not increase the perquisite? Oh, undoubtedly it may. So thus, the very persons who have the care of the property have every temptation, and find it their own interest to neglect their duty to the public, and this the wharfinger ( I don,t know the gentleman, I dare say he is a good man upon the Exchange of London) says, without the least hesitation, as if it was right; I confess I do not think it right, it is shameful, scandalous, and infamous. I could hardly believe there might not be some little exaggeration in the accounts which the West-India merchants have given of the unprotected state in which they are, but I am ready to believe it now up to that extent; I only mention this, because I think the cause is of the very last importance. Upon the question whether the sugar was stolen or not, the Jury, in Surry, have decided; but they have not decided that point so that it might not be enquired into here; and God forbid it should, when another person's guilt, or innocence, is to be enquired of. I certainly agree with the verdict given by the Jury in Surry, but the present enquiry, with respect to the prisoner at the bar, is of a different nature; I was ready to make an observation or two, when the evidence for the prosecution closed, but I reviewed my notes, and put my own judgement, to try it again in my own breast; I thought, upon the whole, it would be fit to go further, and see upon what ground character should put this case, for this is a case in which, of all others, character is the most momentous - in a doubtful case. I was you to shew, that this gentleman was present at the contract which Beaumont made; for though in civil contracts the principal is bound by the act of his agent, yet an agent cannot transfer the criminality of an act so as to make the principal answerable for that criminality if he has no part or share in it. god forbid that any thing I say should reflect upon the character of this gentleman, but it seems to me that the whole evidence resolves itself to this must it be so apparent to this gentleman, as a man of business, that these sugars, or whatever they might be, must be worth so much more than the thirty-eight shillings, that it must carry demonstration home to his mind that they could not have been fairly come by? - I cannot feel my mind verging toward an assent to that proposition.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Certainly every purpose for which this prosecution was instituted, with respect to this gentleman, is already answered; I mean to state in the outset, that his character, up to this time, had been as irreproachable as it could possibly be. The business of to-day, I am perfectly satisfied, must be of some value to the West-India merchants; it will be their own faults if it is not.</p>
               <p>Lord Kenyon. When there is a something in either<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150053"></xptr>scale, and the matter is doubtful, character is to be thrown in; character is then of more use than any quantity of pounds, shillings, and pence, that can be produced against him. I know nothing of the gentleman at the bar, but this I know, if a man of fortune does offend, it is much fitter that he should be picked out as a subject of prosecution, he having no temptation, from the pressure of the times, deserves punishment much more than when the assent to a wicked act is given by a poor person; the example of the punishment of one man of fortune, will do infinitely more good to society, than millions of the poor wretches who are crawling about the streets in wretchedness and beggary. I ought not to conclude without bearing testimony, that this person is not reached by the evidence that has been given, and that his character will, in my opinion, if you find him not guilty, go from hence unstained. <rs id="t18010415-74-verdict418" type="verdictDescription">

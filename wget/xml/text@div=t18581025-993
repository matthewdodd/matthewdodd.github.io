                  </hi>. I live at 37, Rathbone-place, Oxford-street—about 6 o'clock in the evening of 7th October, I was coming home from Harrow races—I was at Stone-bridge, Willesden, at a public-house called the Coach-and-horses—when I was coming out at the door of the public-house I saw the prisoner, his eyes were fixed on my chain—I took all the care I could at the moment, but I could not do so very well—I removed my hand from my pocket, and directly afterwards I heard a loud snap—I had a large silver watch attached to the chain—directly I heard the snap, I looked down, and saw the watch in the prisoner's hand—I then <hi rend="italic">collared</hi> him—I am perfectly sure he is the man—I gave him into custody at once—this was about a quarter before 6—he tried to get away—I had enough to do to keep him for the time—the watch was worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is not here.</p>

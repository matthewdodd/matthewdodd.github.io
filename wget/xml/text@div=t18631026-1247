                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger, at 84, John-street, Hoxton—on 19th October, Smith came to my shop with a white apron on, and represented himself as a coffee-house keeper—he chose a piece of bacon, which weighed 8 1/2 lbs. and 3 lbs. of butter—he requested me to send them home by the boy, and he would return him the money—I sent the boy, who returned soon afterwards, without the money, for some lard—I gave directions to the boy, when I sent him, not to give the goods without the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shop-boy to the prosecutor—on 19th October, I took some bacon and butter from the shop—my master told me not to leave it without the money—I went with the prisoner Smith, to the Rose of Denmark beer-shop in Hoxton; not a great way from my master's shop—Smith asked me which I would have, beer or ale—I said, "Beer"—I had the beer, and he then sent me back after some lard, and said he would pay me when I came back—I left the bacon and butter with him, and went back for the lard—when I came back to the public-house he was gone, and the goods too—I went in search, and saw both the prisoners coming from John-street—they went into the Red Lion public-house—I then lost sight of them, and saw them come out from the Britannia—I saw a constable, and gave them into custody.</p>

About 3 o'clock, on 19th October, from information I received from Edwards, I left Smith standing against the Britannia Theatre, and followed Bowles down to Pimlico-wharf, to a little chandler's shop—I followed him in, and asked the woman whether she knew him—she said, "I do not; he has asked for a person named Murphy"—. I took him in custody, searched him, and found a piece of bacon and butter in his possession—it is not here—the prosecutor saw it before the Magistrate, and identified it—when I told Bowles the charge, he said he had merely done it for a lark.</p>

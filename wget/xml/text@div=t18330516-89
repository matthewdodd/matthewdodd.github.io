               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there not a gate in Warwick-court, and a man to open it? A. Yes, but the man happened to be asleep, for he knew nothing of the transaction when he was asked - I did not see him there - I did not call myself an attorney at the police-office - I said I lived with a gentleman in New-inn; what I stated was read over to me, and I signed it, but it was not read that I was an attorney - when I seized hold of the prisoner he was returning down Warwick-court, and was about the centre of it; the gate is not at the bottom, but forty or fifty yards from Holborn - I should think he was about the centre, and on the shady side of the court, where the lamp does not reflect - there was nobody but me and the prisoner in the court at that time; I met him running - I had spent the evening at a friend's house, and was returning home - I had been at Mr. Harris's public-house, in Houghton-street, Clare-market; I went with a friend, Mr Hawkins; we paid about one shilling for what we had, I will swear eighteen-pence would cover the expenses; we were there two or three hours, but did not sit down at all, we stood talking at the bar all the time - I had not spoken to a female that night, nor been in company with any - I am not in the habit of putting my watch in my pocket, but seeing the prisoner a few paces before me, it struck me his character did not look so well as I could wish, and I put it into my waistcoat pocket as the quickest way to put it away; I had not time to return it to my fob, he was so close to me.</p>

               <p>Q. What was there in his appearance which indicated that his character was bad? A. I thought he was coming too close to me, and facing me too much; he might have passed a little further off - a number of persons collected after the circumstance occurred; I had hold of him at that time - I was in my senses although I had drank a little; no female accosted me.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was in Holborn a little before one o'clock, on the morning of the 10th of May. I turned into Chancery-lane without seeing any body - in about five minutes I returned, and came into Holborn again; I looked towards Warwick-court, and saw three persons together; two or three different people ran, and I ran after them to see what was the matter - I ran over, and Cooper was given into my charge by the prosecutor, for robbing him of his watch; this was a few yards up Warwick-court, I took him in charge - nothing was said to induce him to confess in my hearing; he said something about a woman running up the court and taking the watch, he said the woman had taken the watch; I looked round, and could see no woman in Warwick-court, but several females came up from Holborn, and some men; I took him to the Station-house, and there he acknowledged to me that he had pushed the prosecutor into the kennel - Ashley had been drinking, he walked along behind us very steadily, and did not appear to be drunk; he could walk very steady, he was agitated in mind; the prisoner appeared rather agitated, whether he had been drinking I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You could perceive that the prosecutor had been drinking? A. Yes; I searched the prisoner at the office, and found three keys on him which were delivered up to his employer; they were keys of chambers - he had a few pence in his pocket; he had been seized by the prosecutor when I came up; whether he meant that he had pushed the prosecutor into the kennel before he was seized or afterwards I don't know - I don't recollect ever seeing the prisoner before; I did not know him before,</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the morning of the 10th of May, at half-past three o'clock, I found a watch down in the area of No. 11, Warwick-court, Holborn; it was down at the bottom of the area - the glass was broken, I took it to the station-house, and then to Hatton-garden; the prosecutor identified it, and I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

            . I am a ladies boot and shoemaker, and live in Bishop-court, Chancery-lane. I was in Holborn on the morning of the 10th of May, about one o'clock, and just facing Chancery-lane, I saw Mr. Ashley knocked down by a man who ran up the court facing Chancery-lane, I don't know the name of it; I followed the prisoner when Ashley got up - he ran up the court, and I ran up after him, and when he got to the top, Mr. Ashley collared him and brought him down the court - I did not lose sight of him after I got into the court; I was not at the end of the court when he was, so I lost sight of him there, but after getting into the court, I did not lose sight of him, only when he crossed the pavement to go into the court - the prisoner is the man Ashley collared; when I recovered sight of the person, he was running up the court as fast as he could - I followed him to the station-house, I am certain he is the man I saw Ashley collar - I was on the same side of Holborn as Ashley was knocked down on - there was nobody in the court besides him and Ashley when he ran up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where had you been? A. I was returning from my mother and brothers; I had drank part of a pot or two of beer, but very little - I was on the same side as the man was knocked down, not on the Chancery-lane side, it happened facing the court - Ashley ran up the court before me, I saw him seize the prisoner, who was running as fast as he could; when Ashley seized the prisoner, he was on his return, coming down the court; his back was to me when he ran up the court, but he was seized when he was just returning down the court again, a few yards from the gate, a good deal nearer to the gate than to Holborn; I had been out altogether about four hours; we had had about three pints of beer between us, not at a public-house but at my mother's -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160050"></xptr>after the prisoner was taken, several females came up in Holborn, but not in the court; two men came up when we were at the bottom of the court.</p>

            . I am a member of Lincoln's-inn, and a student-at-law. I live at 3, Raymond's-buildings, where the policeman came to deliver the keys to Mr. Parker; the prisoner has been my servant about two months - I received a very good character with him, which he sustained - Curtis the policeman delivered the keys up to me; I expressed my surprise to him that Cooper should be so accused, upon which the policeman said,"Oh, Sir, we suspect him, we have seen him several times, in not good company." I don't mean to give his exact words, but it was to that effect.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was the other policeman with him? A. Yes; Mr. Parker's chambers are in the same building as mine; the prisoner had Mr. Parker's keys and mine - he slept on the basement story of the house with his wife; Warwick-court was in his way home - I believe the iron gate is shut at nine o'clock; the prisoner must have known it was no thoroughfare.</p>

I have chambers of Mr. Parker in Raymond-buildings - I have known the prisoner for two months, he bore a good character - I was at the chambers when the two policemen came to deliver up the keys, one of them said something - I have a slight scruple on my mind, but am nearly positive that it was Curtis - they were both abreast at the time, they came to deliver the keys, to me thinking they belonged to Mr. Parker - I expressed my surprise at the charge, and said I could not believe it, he was a man of such good character, and I had heard recommendations of him; he gave a very significant shake or shrug, as if to say, you don't know the man as well as I do - I again said, "I will not believe it," and then he said, "He was in rough company enough last night, a comb could not have combed London for worse, if I could have combed all London for it."

               <p>COURT. Q.Before the prosecutor was knocked down, was he talking to a female for some time? A. No, I am confident there was no female near him - I had not observed him above an instant, before he was knocked down.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the two men follow the prisoner and prosecutor into the court or not? A. When we were coming down the court, the prosecutor and prisoner were kicking up a bother, and I think that made the gentlemen come into the court; they came into the court when we were coming down it with the prisoner - I am confident that before the prisoner was seized he was running up the court as hard as he could, and the prosecutor after him - I had seen the man knock the prosecutor down, and directly run up the court - I could not tell whether they had been conversing together.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see them meet? A. I was not taking notice of them until I saw one knock the other down; I cannot be certain that it was the prisoner.</p>

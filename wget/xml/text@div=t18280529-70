The witness called me; I went to the house, but before I got there they were all gone; the witness seemed quite sober, and said he had lost a sovereign and a hat; I afterwards met the prisoner and her mother going along the Back-lane-road; the prosecutor said that was the woman, and gave her in charge; she said she knew nothing about it; I took her to the watch-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 40, Praed-street, and occupy the front kitchen—at ten minutes past 4 on the morning of the 7th April, I found the prisoner in my room, underneath the bed—I felt somebody feeling over my head, and that roused me up—it was not light—I got up, and saw him under the bed, and went up stairs—I saw a constable coming along the street, and I called him—we then searched the house, and found the prisoner in the back coal-cellar—I saw him searched—the pocket-handkerchief produced belongs to me—when I went to bed, it was in my coat-pocket, by the bed<lb></lb>side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not ask me to come down there about a fortnight before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I had seen you previously about the streets, but I never spoke to you.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 149). I was called by the last witness, and I found prisoner concealed in the coal-cellar, behind the door—I took him to the station-house, and searched him—I found a pocket-handkerchief and two keys—I tried the keys at 140, Praed-street; one fitted the street door, and the other the parlour door—the prisoner did not say anything to ac<lb></lb>count for his being there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> One of those keys belongs to my father. I had been away from home for three months, because of my father illusing me. I supported myself in the best way I could. I took out papers for the pro<lb></lb>secutor that he ought to have taken about six weeks ago. He asked me if I had anywhere to lodge; there was another boy with him; he said I had better not come down then, but come some other night. His master will not let the other boy come, and he keep him away. The two work together in the paper shop. The prosecutor has been sent away.</p>

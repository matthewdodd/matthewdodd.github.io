On the 7th of June, at about two o'clock, fifty or more people came to my house armed with bludgeons; Price was the second man who came into my house. I know all the prisoners; I believe Burn was the next; the first who came into the house is not taken up. Thompson came into the house with a bludgeon in his hand; Burn and Price went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Did you see Thompson at the time when you first saw the other two prisoners? - I did not; the mob broke the bar windows, and a little window in the front, frames and all; then they went up stairs and threw some bolsters and chairs out at the window, and a glue pot, which I use sometimes; they broke the glass, frames, and sashes, and all out of that room; then they broke out part of the wainscoting in the two-pair-of-stairs, and all the locks off the doors.</p>
               <p>Did you see any of the prisoners do any thing in the house? - I saw Price and Burn but not Thompson, assisting in breaking the windows and the sash frames. I was up stairs with them; when I came down I saw Thompson in the tap-room; he demanded a glass of some spirits of my wife, but what spirits I cannot tell; she gave him a glass.</p>
               <p>Did he pay for it? - I saw him drink, but I did not see him pay for it.</p>
               <p>How long were the mob in the house? - They continued till between three and four; they came about two.</p>
               <p>Did Thompson appear to be in the company of the others? - I did not see that he was in the company of the other two prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Have you ever said you would make good your loss by rewards? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know all the prisoners before?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280266"></xptr> - I knew Burn very well, I do not know that I saw Price before.</p>
               <p>Did not you know he lived in your neighbourhood? - No; he may have been in my house, but I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Was not you very much frightened? - To be sure I was.</p>
               <p>You only saw him as he passed by you, and you was very much frightened? - I saw him before at Mr. Lynch's, that night at about twelve o'clock. A gentleman desired me to give them a gallon of beer for them not to burn the goods there. I knew him again when he came into my house.</p>
               <p>Might not you be mistaken in the person, when you say you saw him come up the second person? - I was with him in all the rooms of the house; I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Did you first inform against him? - I did not know it till I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the three persons at the bar are the persons of whom you have been speaking? - I am sure.</p>

             I know nothing of. I saw the mob come to Mr. Lynch's, the next door but one; I heard some of them, but I do not know which, say, the next shall be Mr. Bradbury's. I went to Mr. Bradbury's and said, for God's sake! remove what goods you can. I got some acquaintances to help me away with my goods; they had done at about a half after one, then they came to Mr. Bradbury's house; I begged and prayed of them, when they came to Mr. Bradbury's house, and I hung out a blue ribband and told them there was 10 Popery. I brought down a large church-bible I had; I went into the street and held it up and said, This is my religion; here is no Popery; for God's sake do not pull the house down; they made a ring and swore me to my religion; there were pails and barrels full of beer in the street, and they drank very freely; then they went into the house and had liquor at the bar; then a tall lamp-lighter went upon the stairs and said, Blast you, come along, and let us go up stairs and see what is there; the mob followed him. I went up stairs, I suppose I was the third who went up; when they came up the first pair of stairs they saw the bed-steads, the beds were removed. They said Blast their eyes, there is Popery here, else they would not have moved; then they began to break the windows; then they went from the one-pair-of-stairs into the two-pair-of stairs to my room; when they were in my room there was only a case of a chest of drawers left; they went to stamp out the partitions of the case of the chest of drawers; and then they broke the windows and part of the window frames. Price and Burn were into my room and in every room of the house assisting in doing the mischief. I stopped their hands several times and said, they did not know the consequence; they had bludgeons in their hands; there was a door between Mr. Bradbury's lodging room and mine, they burst that open and broke down part of the partition; they they proceeded into the garret; the tall lamp-lighter began breaking the windows in the garret, and then looked out at the window, pulled off his hat, and huzza'd, No Popery! There was a box locked, they broke it open; there was a fiddle in it; there were eight hands, I suppose, in the box at a time. Bradbury took up the fiddle and music books; they broke the garret windows. Then they came down into the club-room, and broke the chairs, and threw the things out of the windows into the street.</p>
               <p>Are you positive to Price and Burn being there? - Yes; they were in the house from the top to the bottom of it. I went away with my wife and children.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You saw the first who went into the house? - No; the first who was on the stairs; I cannot tell who went first into the house.</p>
               <p>Where was Mr. Bradbury when they came into the house? - I do not know; the second time I saw Price was about three or four days after in Clerkenwell Bridewell; they took me to see if I knew him; I described<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280267"></xptr> the colour of his coat and his hair, before I saw him.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect how often you saw him? - Why should I recollect that; can that counsellor prove that he was not there, then I have done. My lord have you done with me?</p>
               <p>Court. Not while the prisoner's counsel has any questions to ask you; you must answer that gentleman.</p>
               <p>Counsel. How long after was it you saw Price in Clerkenwell? - I do not know, it might be two or three days.</p>

               <p>Did you see Thompson do any thing; - He was in the house but I did not see him do any thing; they made Bradbury show his books; after the things were destroyed at Lynch's house they went back again; that was about half after one, and began to throw the furniture out; they left the house at near two o'clock.

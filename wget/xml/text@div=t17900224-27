               <p>I live with Mr. Angle as a servant: I was in Beek-street, on Thursday night, the 28th of January, about a quarter past seven; I saw three men standing; I stood a little while, and saw the curtain in the prisoner's right hand; I never saw him before; I told him he had got my master's curtain, upon which he ran off, and I ran after him; and as he was running, he made a stop, and dropped the curtain in Beek-street; then he ran again, and I followed him till he was taken: soon after the curtain was found in a snuff-shop passage; a woman brought it, and put it into the bar, and away she went directly; it was a red and white curtain; it had figures on it of men, women, and children.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have one thing to ask him, whether he saw me drop the curtain? - I did not: I turned my head, and found it was out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Court to Read. You are very sure he is the man that had the curtain? - Yes, I am.</p>

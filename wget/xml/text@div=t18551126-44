                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live at Bethnal-green. I know the prisoner—I worked with him once—on the night of 5th Nov. I was in the Star and Garter beer shop, Parliament-street, Bethnal-green—there were some others there—I was playing at bagatelle—the prisoner was there, he was not sober—Todd was there a little while before me—he was as sober as I was—the prisoner was standing alongside, looking on—he had a pint of ale and a glass, he brushed the glass down with the tail of his coat—the publican came and said, "Who broke this glass? "—some one said that the prisoner did—he said he would not pay for it, the landlord was going to turn him out, and I got in between them, and prevented him turning him out—I was standing at the bar, talking to a friend, and Todd said to the prisoner, "You have got 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for the glass"—he then walked out at one door, and came in at the other, and the prisoner stabbed him in the back—I saw the knife in his hand—he then went back towards the tap room door—I went to take the knife from him, and he stabbed me in the left shoulder—he stabbed either at me or the next to me, but I caught the stab on my left arm—I was taken to the hospital—the wound is healing, but is not quite healed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Bethnal-green.

Early in the morning of 6th Nov., Bullock was brought to the hospital—he had an incised wound on the left arm, nearly three quarters of an inch long—it was over the large artery, but had not gone deep enough to penetrate it—it was a slight wound.</p>

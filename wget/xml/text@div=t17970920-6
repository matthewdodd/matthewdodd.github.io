               <p>Q. Was the prisoner near his brother? - A. No; he had just been sweeping the shop, and was going with the broom to put it in it's place; when I asked what the parcel was, he was passing by between him and me.</p>

               <p>Q. And in going to put the broom by, he necessarily passed his brother? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.What was said to him to induce him to acknowledge it? - A. Mr. Blamire asked him what the cards were to be done with, and he said they were to be sent to Norwich, to his mother who was a poor washerwoman, with what packs they could make up; he confessed it, and was very sorry for it.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know about those keys? - A. Nothing at all.</p>

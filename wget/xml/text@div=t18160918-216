             in the sum of eleven pounds odd. I know that check; I paid it to Beechey, the prisoner at the bar, when he came for the money; he demanded the money for Davis and Co. I had known him as their servant for many years.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it part of his duty to receive money - A. I believe he was merely as a salesman.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear by your books that he has ever received money while he was there - A. I have known him to call for bills, and I believe I recollect one solitary instance of Mr. Beechey collecting money. It appears by my books that Mr. Fisher was indebte to our house on the day in the indictment in the sum of eleven pounds eight shillings and sevenpence. The prisoner never accounted to me for that sum of money.</p>

            . I belong to this firm. It was never my intention that the prisoner should collect money for the firm since Mr. Munday has been there; Mr. Munday is our present cashier; he came into our service about February. I did not then notify to the prisoner that he was not to collect any more. It was his business to account of an evening for the sum of money he had received in the course of that day.</p>

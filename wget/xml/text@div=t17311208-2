No, Sir, says I, we thank you for your Love, but I don't care to venture on that side of the Water, for fear of meeting with my Mistress; and so we left Jack, and went to a Tavern Door to divide the Money, and there we quarrelled about it; whereof I went to Mrs. Markham some time after , and inform'd her of the whole; and she went to Mrs. Radford's to search for the Goods, but could not find them.

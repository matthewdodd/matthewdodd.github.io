                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant P</hi>), I am stationed at the Carter Street Station, Walworth—I never saw the prisoner before 7th January last; he came to me—I have had under my attention some persons of the name of White and May—on 7th January, the prisoner came to me at the Surrey Sessions, where I was engaged—he then made some communication to me in reference to White and May—about a month afterwards he brought to me Mr. Andrews, the manager of Messrs. Head, and in his presence Mr. Andrews made a communication to me in reference to a block that had been obtained from them by White and May—I had a few words with Mr. Andrews, in the prisoner's presence—I advised him to obtain a warrant against the parties, and unless he did so I could not interfere, and there the matter dropped; I heard nothing more of it till 19th February, except that</p>

               <p>on 17th February I received a letter from Mr. Riley, that was in conse<lb></lb>quence of a communication I had made to him—on 19th February, the prisoner came to me at the Carter Street Police Station—he said "I have seen Mr. Riley, who has got possession of the block, and he is willing to give it up for nothing; he only wants 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the carriage, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or a little more for a new case to put it in as White and May had broke the other one up"—I said "It is very strange they should offer to give it up for nothing"—he said "Yes, they will, for they are frightened of you"—I said "Well, you can tell them to send to the firm if you like; I have nothing more to do with it"—he said "No, they will give it up to you if you will give me a note to take to them"—I gave him an order endorsed on the letter I had received from Mr. Riley; he had a great objection at first to my writing on Mr. Riley's letter, but I said I would do so, and then he would know where it came from—he said "Well, give me the money to give them to pay for the carriage and the box, as Mr. Head is to pay all expenses, and give me a couple of sovereigns for getting it back for them"—I had not anything less than a sovereign, and I gave him that to pay for it and told him to bring me back the change that night—I did not see him that night—he did not say a word to me at that time about having received a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Head, to obtain the block; he did not give me any money—he did not say he had signed my name on a cheque made payable to my order by Mr. Head—I was not aware of it till I saw it on the 24th—on the morning of the 20th, I met him outside the Carter Street Station—I said to him "Where is the change for that sovereign I gave you?"—he said "It is all right, Sergeant, Mr. Riley is going to bring it with the machine on Thursday to the Station at 2 o'clock"—he never told me then that he had signed my name to a cheque, or gave me any money on it—neither block or money turned up—I did not see him again till the 29th, when I met him at the Elephant and Castle, and took him into custody—I said to him "Wilbra<lb></lb>ham, I am going to take you into custody for forging my name on a cheque in the City"—he said "I forged no cheque"—I said "Yes you have, I have seen it"—he said "No I have not"—I then called a constable and sent him to Moor Lane Station—the signature on the back of this cheque is not my writing; I never authorised the prisoner to put my name there.</p>

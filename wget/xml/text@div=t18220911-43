I had known her for about a month; she took in washing - I occasionally assisted her. On the 21st of August, at ten o'clock in the morning, I saw her at her lodging; she had two rooms on the second floor. I saw her in the front room, which was the sitting room - she said she was very poorly, and appeared so; she attributed it to the fatigue of the hot weather, and she had had a quarrel with her landlord. I stopped all day - I washed down stairs in the kitchen. Her daughter Emma brought me a message that her mother was poorly, and wished me to stop, and do as much as I could, and that her mother could not come to help me. About two o'clock, I went up stairs with a pail of water - I sat down half a minute, and heard her call out as if she was ill. She called to her daughter to fetch up Morrison, who lived below - I was then in the front room and she was in the bed room. I thought I heard her scream as if she was sick, and I went into the room where she was - I just opened the door and put my head in for a moment. I thought I heard the cry of an infant, and flew back in a moment - I heard it only once, and being so short a time I might be mistaken, as I never was at the birth of an infant. When I looked into the room she was standing by the side of the bed with one hand on the bed, and the other on the wall. I withdrew; her daughter at this time was gone down for Morrison, who lived below - the prisoner said to me,</p>
               <p>"Go go," as if for assistance, I ran down stairs in haste to get assistance, and by the time I got to the street door, her daughter came and said I need not call anybody - I met Morrison coming up stairs as I went down. I did not fetch assistance. In about an hour and a half her daughter fetched me up stairs, saying her mother wanted to speak to me; I went up to the bed room, she was lying on the bed with her clothes on - nobody else was in the room; I asked how she did - she said she hoped it was safe over; I asked if it was her labour, she said, Yes. I asked her if she did not want a nurse, as I would fetch one if she would let me, and she consented - I could not get the one I intended, but brought the first I met with, who was

When she told me it was her labour, I said that she never told me she was in that way; she said she thought I knew it, and that the people knew it where she lived before.

               <p>"Poor thing, I am afraid not. I am in the habit of dressing young children." She said she wished it was alive, that I might dress hers, as she had looked out the baby clothes yesterday. She was lying on the bed at the time, and the child was lying on the ground in a cloth - it was dead before I got there, but was not quite cold. I fetched Mr. Wakefield, the surgeon. I never attended the birth of a child - I have had children myself. Mrs. Jones said she did not want me any more; she gave me 6 d. I saw no baby linen. I was so flurried, I did not notice what sort of cloth it was in.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Somers Town. I was called in by the witness, Richards. I went into the prisoner's bed room, between three and four o'clock - she was lying on the bed. Nobody else was in the room. She said she had been delivered of a still born child, and that it was by the side of the bed. I took the child up, it was wrapped in a dirty cloth like a towel. I examined it, and found it was dead, and nearly cold. I examined it attentively, and had there been any marks of violence on it, I should have seen it.</p>
               <p>The rest of this gentleman's evidence went to describe the situation of the room, and the child, &amp; c. which it is presumed better to omit. He could not say whether it was born alive, and if it was it might have died in delivery, or from various causes.</p>

I have brought the baby linen; I believe it was in the house at the time. I remember Bird going for assistance. Morrison, before he went into the room, told me to tell her she need not fetch any one. I had fetched him by my mother's orders; I did not see him in the room; I was not there till after the doctor came. Morrison went in; I do not think he stopped more than five minutes. I did not know that there was any baby linen in the house; I do not remember my mother having a child during my father's life. When Morrison came out, he said my mother had had a child; he is a boot and shoemaker; I never knew him practise as a midwife.</p>

            . I have known Mrs. Jones nearly five years. She told me about four months ago that she was in the family way, and engaged me to nurse her; she did not say when she expected to want me, nor desire me to make any preparation. I went to see her about twice after; she still appeared pregnant; the last time I saw her was about a month before she was put to bed. Nothing particular occurred. I told her, when she wanted me, if she sent I would come. I did not make any baby linen. She sent for me on the evening the child was born. I was then living at the Crown and Anchor.</p>
               <p>- PASSMORE. I am an undertaker. Morrison came to me on Thursday morning, the 22d of August; I was from home; he came again in the evening, and found me at home; he said he wanted a box for a still-born child, of which I understood him to say his wife was delivered the day previous; he said he should have been highly gratified if the child had lived. He gave me the length on a string. The box was made and taken home.</p>

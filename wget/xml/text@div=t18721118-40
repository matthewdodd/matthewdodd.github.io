                  </hi>. I live at Abbey Street, Bermondsey, and am a purveyor of cat's meat—on Sunday evening, 3rd November, I was in Lant Street, Southwark, about two or three minutes to 11, returning home—I received a violent blow behind the head—I fell, and, getting up, I caught hold of the male prisoner behind me—I then saw the woman; she bit me in the eye—I had a struggle with the man; I had him with one hand, and protected my watch with the other; his shirt gave way and I fell, and the man and woman hit and kicked me—the man kicked me—I called "Police!" as loud as I could, and they ran away—the police came up, and I gave information and described the man—I had been robbed of a silk pocket-handkerchief which I had safe a few minutes before—I did not notice the woman's face, but I noticed her dress—she had a black shawl, a kind of cinnamon or brown dress, and a print apron—I went to the station and saw the man about twenty minutes after; he was brought in, and I identified him as he came in—I was sent to the hospital, where I was treated by the house-surgeon, and remained there till 1 o'clock the next day—from the hospital I went to the Police Court at Stone's End—I saw the male prisoner amongst about twenty others, and I picked him out—I was bruised all over from the kicks and the hit the woman gave me in the eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was very much alarmed—I have never been served so before—I was obliged to call out, I thought I was going to be killed—it was a little bit dark that night, and it was rather a darkish place—I had only been drinking in a moderate way—I had been into two public-houses, and had a glass of ale in the usual way—I did not have any spirits—I only had a pint and a half of beer the whole day—I had been about with my cat's meat in the morning, and then I went home, and had a cup of tea</p>

               <p>—I am quite sure I did not lose the pocket handkerchief—it was in my left-hand outside pocket—I had never seen either of the prisoners before that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There were lamps about—I should think I was attacked within half-a-dozen yards of a gaslight—I could see the male prisoner, and he is the man—after the remand I received a visit from the woman and three men—she was dressed the same as she was on the Sunday evening—she said "Will you be a little bit lenient with my husband, as we have two children, and if you don't be hard against him we will make a recompense of what little loss was done in the damage?"—I told them of course the ease was not come off, and I had got it to consider; I did not want to be paid for what was done—she said it would not have happened if I had not pushed up against them, and as they had had a little drop to drink, that was how it occurred—I did not push up against them; that I am quite positive about.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 232). I was on duty in Lant Street—I heard a cry of "Police!" and ran up—I saw Cripps doubled up against the wall, crying out "Police!" and groaning—he was crouching down, as if he had received a kick in the stomach—he complained of having been robbed, and gave me a description of the man who had committed it, in consequence of which I apprehended the male prisoner about twenty minutes afterwards—I took him out of a house about 30 yards from where I found Cripps—I believe he lived in the house—I found him behind the door—I saw the female prisoner in the room also—I took the man to the station, and the prosecutor identified him—the prosecutor was taken to the hospital, and on he Monday morning he was taken to the Police Court—the prosecutor was not there when the case came on, and the man was remanded for a week—the prosecutor came in the course of the day—he was then shown the prisoner in the cell, and he picked him out from about twenty others—I saw the female prisoner in the course of the day—she wore a black shawl and a dark dress, and print apron—she was taken into custody on the 11th, the day of the remand.</p>

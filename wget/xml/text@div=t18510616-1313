                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Eaton, of Taylor's-buildings, Bedfordbury. On Monday evening, 19th May, I was standing at the corner of Taylor's-buildings with my baby in my arms talking to Caroline Smith—she was stating that she had been ill-treated on Saturday evening by a person named Gantly—I know Gantly by sight, but do not associate with her—I said to Smith it was a shame to ill-treat her—the prisoner, who I did not know, came up and called me a cow, and said he would serve me the same—I said it was a great pity that there was not a policeman there for his sake—he struck me immediately with his fist in my left eye, and struck my baby out of my arms—I fell down, and be began violently kicking me while I was</p>

               <p>ton the ground, in the month, and on the top lip—I am sure it was a kick and not a blow—my lip has been sewn up—I tried to get np by a post—he dragged me along the ground—the last time he kicked me by the post I be<lb></lb>came insensible—when I came to he was gone—I told a policeman; he ran after him—I saw the prisoner go into a public-house by the corner of a court—the policeman went in, and the prisoner ran out at another door—the policeman ran after him, but could not catch him—I was taken to the hospi<lb></lb>tal, and was confined to my bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Taylor's-buildings. On 19th May, I was talking to Mrs. Eaton about half-past 5 o'clock in the evening—I did not see the prisoner till I heard him speak—I was telling Mrs. Eaton that I was ill-used and bitten by Gantley on Saturday night, and she said what a shame it was to ill-treat me—the prisoner was then by my side, and he said, "You b—y cow, what do you know about it?" and said he would knock her b—y eye out—he then struck her in the eye with his fist—she fell down with the effect of the blow—she had a child in her arms which fell away from her—while she was on the ground he kicked her several times on the head—she bad a bonnet on—I saw him drag her—I did not hear him speak—I saw her try to lay hold of him, but she could not—I went for a policeman—she did not say or do anything to provoke him—her lip was laid open, and there was much blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a laundress, of Dorset-place, Pall-mall. I was going along Bedfordbury on 19th May, and saw Mrs. Eaton at the corner of Taylor's-buildings—I saw the prisoner there—he said he would knock her b—y eye out—I saw him strike her on some part of the head with his double fist—the blow knocked her down, and her child fell from her arms—after the blow, she made a scuffle to try to save herself, but she never struck him—while she was on the ground I saw him strike her with his fist—I did not see him kick her—she got up, and he knocked her down again with his t, and dragged her across the road—I afterwards saw her face; it was very much swollen, and her head too, and she was cut all down the mouth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Charing-cross Hospital. Mrs. Eaton was brought there, with a severe cut on the inside of the upper lip—the outer skin was not cut; the inner skin was—it was not a very deep wound—I recommended her to have it stitched up, but she refused, and went away—she was brought to the hospital again in about a week—she Was then suffering from erysipelas from the wound, and an abscess was formed in the cheek—that proceeded from the blow—erysipelas is a very frequent conse<lb></lb>quence of such a wound—her life was in danger—I took' her into the hos<lb></lb>pital, and she was there about a fortnight—it was such a wound as a blow,</p>

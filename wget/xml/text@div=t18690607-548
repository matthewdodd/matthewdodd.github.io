                  </hi>. I live at 23, Shepperton Cottages, Islington—on the night of the 6th June I went to bed about 10.30—I left my servant to fasten up the house—about 1.30 I heard a noise, got a light, and went down stairs—I found the back-kitchen shutter lying in the room, and the window open—I then went into the back-kitchen and saw someone jump out at the window—I could not say who it was—I only just saw the back of him—I was going to jump out at the window, too—I had the poker in my hand—I saw a man kneeling under the window—I struck him with the poker till it broke—he ran away and got over a wall, and I went in and put my clothes on—I went out into the street and found the prisoner in the custody of a police-man—I had an opportunity of seeing him as I was hitting him with the poker, and I could almost swear the prisoner was the man—there was some white on his coat when he was in custody, and he had been kneeling against a whitewashed-wall.</p>

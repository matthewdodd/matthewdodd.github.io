                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Rice, of 20, Coal-yard, Drury-lane—on the night of 27th November, about 11 or 12 o'clock, I was in bed in my room; we only occupy one room—my husband was asleep on the end of the table—there was a lamp burning in the room—I was awoke out of my sleep and saw a woman leaving the room—I jumped out of bed and stopped her—she was carrying the shawl I have on now, the cloak I have here, and many other articles, in her arms—I caught hold of her; she was just in the act of going out at the door—I took the things from her—she got away, leaving her shawl behind—I did not see her face—the next day I saw the prisoner in the next room to me, in the same house, and showed her the shawl, and I asked her whether it was her shawl—she said, "Yes"—I said, "You are the woman that came into my room last night"—she said, "If I did I was drunk"—the things she was carrying are worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I had locked the room that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did your husband come in after you had locked it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he is not here—he was not in bed that night because he was drunk—I went to bed about ten minutes to 11, and left him sitting up in the room on a chair—I went to sleep immediately—he was fast asleep when I got out of bed—the woman had a lot of things in her arms, not tied in a bundle, but altogether—I know this is the woman by her owning the shawl—she does not live in the house, only a friend of hers, where she is in the habit of visiting—the friend is a married woman; she has lodged in that house for some length of time; I believe on the same floor—I roused my husband up—I had not seen the prisoner before, that I know of—I don't know whether she was in the habit of visiting the house or not—I went to bed about ten minutes to 11, and fastened the door, and I suppose I awoke about 12, or a few minutes after, from 12 to 1; I could not tell exactly.</p>

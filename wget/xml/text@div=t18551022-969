                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to Mrs. Esther Reynolds, who lives at Wanstead. I came to London on the morning of 16th Oct—before I left I had a timepiece safe on the mantelpiece—it belonged to me—when I came back I missed it—I saw it afterwards, in possession of the constable—this is it—I have the key of it in my pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Mrs. Reynolds's. I was in the kitchen about 12 o'clock on the 16th Oct—I heard a noise of some one going out at the back door—I went to look, and saw the prisoner putting something in his coat—I did not know him before—I am sure he is the man—I saw him put something under his coat—I told him to put the clock down—I did not see him with the clock, but I had missed the clock, and I saw him put something under his coat—he did not put it down, but walked out of the gate—I ran down stairs and told the gardener, and he went after him—I know the clock, it is Mrs. Davis's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener at Mrs. Reynolds's. I was called by the last witness—I went after the prisoner, I saw him, and no other man—he was going a fast walking pace—I followed him, and the first bush he came to he went behind it, and deposited something, which I afterwards found was this timepiece—I still followed him through the bushes, till I lost sight of him in the depth of the forest—I met a policeman, and we went together in pursuit of him, and by the description of a boy we found him in the forest—we took him back to Mrs. Reynolds's, and the last wit<lb></lb>ness saw him—I went back to the bush, and found this timepiece.</p>

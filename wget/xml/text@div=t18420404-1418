                  </hi>. I am foreman of the Deptford sawyers. I was going from the City over London-bridge, on the 6th of April, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—there were a good many people assembled there, looking at some exhibition in the street—I was making my way through the crowd, and four or five men came round me—the prisoner, who was one of them, put his hand round me, and at the same moment I felt my watch go from my pocket—I instantly seized the prisoner by the collar, and told him he had stolen my watch—he said, "Let me go, I have not;" and three or four men said, "Let him go" and tried to extricate him from me—I held him as well as I could—he struggled very hard to get from me—I succeeded in getting him into a beer-shop—Price came to the beer-shop, and took the prisoner to the station—I have not seen my watch and chain again—I cannot say exactly the value of it—it cost me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. two or three years ago.</p>

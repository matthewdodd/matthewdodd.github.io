                  </hi>. I am a Portuguese, and am cook and steward of the steam packet <hi rend="italic">Pitchipatan</hi>—on 7th August, about half-past 4 in the afternoon, I was in High-street, Whitechapel, with Laurence Perez—I had a watch in my left-hand waistcoat pocket, with a guard twisted round it—there were two men behind us, one of whom took it out of my pocket and ran across the road—I attempted to follow him, but the prisoner ran at me and held me tight, saying, "What is the matter?"—I asked him to let me go as I wanted to catch that man, but he would not until the man was gone, and then he wanted to run away, but I held him tight by the coat—he struck me three or four times on the face and shoulders—he pulled his coat off as I held it, but I held him by the neck, and gave him in custody.</p>

I am steward of the ship <hi rend="italic">Pitchipatan</hi>—on the after<lb></lb>noon of 2d August, I was in Whitechapel-road with Perira; somebody took his watch and ran away—the prisoner did not want him to be taken, and came up, threw his bundle into the road, and held Perira, who held him by the neck—I got a policeman and gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>about half-past 4, I was watching a crowd in Whitechapel, and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner run across the street—the prosecutor held his arm round the prisoner's neck, and gave him into my custody for stealing his watch—blood was coming out of the prosecutor's mouth, and his back was all dirt where he had been down in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had taken a drop of drink, but I had my senses about me; I saw the prosecutor run out of the crowd, and I ran and said to him, "What is the matter?"—he said, "I have lost my watch;" I said, "Let us go and try to catch him;" we ran across to the pump, side by side, and when he could not find the man he said, "You know something about it;" he took me to the pump; my bundle was snatched from under my arm, and I did turn round savagely and hit him, because I had lost my bundle; I am as innocent as a baby unborn.</p>

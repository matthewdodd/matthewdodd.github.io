                  </hi>. I am a waterproofer, and live at 16, Half-moon-street, Bishopsgate—the prisoner lives in the same house—on Saturday night, 12th February, at nearly 11 o'clock, I was at the Dragon public-house, opposite where I live—two male friends were with me—the prisoner was there, and my wife was in the tap-room with a friend of hers—I was going out, and told my wife to come out, but a little quarrel took place between the prisoner and my wife—I told my wife to come home, and soon afterwards she came out and we both went upstairs—when I was half in my room and half on the landing a scuffle took place on the stairs, and my wife screamed out—I went to her, and received a blow—I became insensible, and recollect no more till I was in the hospital—I saw the prisoner and her sister together, and the prisoner had an instrument in her hand, but what it was I do not know—I cannot be positive which of them struck me—my head bled very much—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I was at the Dragon with Caroline O'Connell—just as I was coming away the prisoner came in; I asked my friend to come home, and the prisoner struck me in the face either with a key or with a crusher which is used for gin—I was going to strike her and her friend, Mrs. McCarthy, caught hold of me and said "Mrs. McCarthy, study the way your are in"—she called me a whore and I called her another, and went up stairs at my own house, but the prisoner and her sister laid hold of me by the hair—I screamed out for assistance and my husband came—the prisoner went and fetched the tongs and hit my husband over the head with them twice or three times—he fell senseless; the prisoner ran into her own place with her sister and put the tables and chairs against the door—they were both holding me till the prisoner went to fetch the tongs, and I saw her return with them, her sister still holding me—Mr. Fowler's assistant came and dressed my husband's head and he was conveyed to the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there a very good light? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, excellent; my door was open and her door was open and there was a light in each—I was quite sober—the sugar crusher hurt me and gave me a black-eye—the meaning of "Study the state you are in," was not that I was tipsy, but that I am in the family way—I did not pull any hair out of the prisoner's sisters head that I know of; I would not do much between the two of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you try to pull some out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I dare say I did—I did not rush into their place—I have heard of the crime of perjury—I did not rush into this woman's room—when they put the tables against the door they were not afraid of me, but they were afraid when they saw my husband covered with blood—she could see my husband fall; he did not fall on the stairs but in his own room inside the threshold—there had been a previous quarrel between us about the middle of the week, there was a row between the children and we had a couple of words—we did not have a couple of blows.</p>

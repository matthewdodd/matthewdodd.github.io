                  </hi>. I am an artist's colour maker, and at this time lived at 127, Ossulton Street, Somer's Town—on 13th December, at a little after eleven, I was going home from the Clerkenwell explosion, and when I got to Weston Street, Bagnigge Wells Road, I saw five or six persons standing, and immediately I had passed I received a violent blow on the back of my head, which knocked my hat over my face, and I fell and hurt my hand—I got up and seized the nearest man to me by one ear and by the collar—the whole gang commenced striking right and left towards me, and knocked me down—I lost 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my trousers pocket, but I cannot say whether it was while I was down or when I was up, also my pocket handkerchief—while I was down I was knocked about, and dragged along the road, and smothered with mud from head to feet—I got up again</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186801060013"></xptr>
               <p>and got hold of the nearest to me, when the prisoner struck or kicked me a terrific blow in the back, which left a bruise on my hip two or three inches long—I saw him do it—I instantly dropped the man I had hold of and fell on my knees, cutting the knees of my trousers open—I ran after the prisoner and captured him, not above the length of this Court off—I was then set upon by the whole lot and knocked down again—I was calling out "Police!" all the time, but nobody came to my assistance—I got up, ran after the prisoner again, caught him, and was taking him to the station when I was assaulted again by the whole gang—he broke away and was stopped by Parritt, a policeman being close on his heels—a comforter which had been round my neck was picked up in the road—I had been ill in bed for a month before this, and had only just returned to work—it preyed very much upon my nervous system, and I feel the effects of it now—I have been under Dr. Renger, of University College Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grainer, of 46, White Lion Street, Penton<lb></lb>ville Hill—on 13th December I was on Pentonville Hill at night, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I ran up the Hill, and saw Butterfield run<lb></lb>ning after the prisoner—he caught him in Cumming Street, and brought him across the road to Weston Street, and when he got ten yards down four or five others were round them, who said, "We will make him leave go"—more than one of them struck him a violent blow—I said, "Keep away from the man, so many of you onto him," but they stuck to him still, and knocked him down, and the prisoner got away—Butterfield got up—he had a white comforter round his neck; they pulled it, and swung him about in the mud—he cried, "Police!" and I saw him knocked down twice and kicked—I ran to Bagnigge Wells Road for a policeman, and saw the prisoner and another of the men run from Weston Street to York Hill—I ran up York Hill, down Pentonville Hill, and up a passage in Win<lb></lb>chester Street, where I caught the prisoner—a constable came up and took him, and the other escaped.</p>

On the night of 13th December I was on duty in Bagnigge Wells Road, saw Parritt, went with him, and saw a lot of people at the corner of Weston Street—Butterfield was hallooing out, "Police!"—I saw the prisoner go from the crowd, climb over some rails, and run across the King's Cross Road, up York Hill, and down Pen<lb></lb>tonville Hill into Winchester Street—Parritt caught him in a court there—I was close by, and took him to the station—the inspector charged him with robbery and assault; he said that he had nothing to do with it—I am sure the prisoner is the man who got over the railings; I never lost sight of him—the prosecutor followed after us: he had had a glass of drink, but he was very much excited and knocked about.</p>

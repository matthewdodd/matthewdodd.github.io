On the 6th of September, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I was in my bar - the prisoner came and asked for a glass of gin - he went into the tap-room; I took it to him; he said,</p>
               <p>"This won't do for me, I want my gin in a measure;" I put it into a measure, and gave it to him, and asked him for the money - he gave me 1 1/2 d.; I said I wanted 2 d.; he said he should give me no more; I insisted on having 2 d., and said I should turn him out if he did not pay me. He was going to sit down; I took and carried him to the outside door; he immediately made a short turn, and snatched at my watch; the ring broke, and he set off with the seal, and I followed and secured him about twenty yards off. He scuffled a good deal - the seal was found just by; he had thrown it into the road while I pursued him.</p>

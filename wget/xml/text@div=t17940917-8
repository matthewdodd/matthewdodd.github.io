I said, no, but I told him I had been at that public house, and I would wish to be accommodated with half a packet of whites, for I was going into the country the next day, and that might be the means perhaps of paying my expences; he asked me then what I wanted? I told him to let me have some six-pences; he said he had none then, but he should have some the next morning, for he should have plenty then, but he had none at that present time; of course the next morning I went, when I came there I asked the landlord whether Mr. Pendegrast was there? he desired me to set down, that he expected Mr. Pendegrast would be there soon, I sat down, and had a pint of ale, during the time I sat there his daughter came, as the landlord told me she was, but she has denied it since; after I had been there some time the landlord told me I might go into the parlour; I did not see Mr. Pendegrast that morning at all, I saw him the same Saturday night at half after eight; I went there again on Saturday evening, and he said, I thought you was gone into the country; no, says I, I thought I might as well have another half packet as not, if you can accommodate me with it, I had had some before that morning of the daughter, as they said, but it will not prove to be so; her name is

               <p>I am an officer, I went with Page, Harper, Ray, and Mr. Harper's son, we went to a public house in St. Giles's, and we waited there all but Page, until Page came back to us, and told us he had bought some whites, and then we went in company together to the Plume of Feathers, in King-street, Seven Dials, a public house, and I says to Page, point out the man; and he pointed the prisoner out, without his hat, from a number that were present, Harper being close along side of me, I said, I have a warrant to take you into custody, I am a king's officer; we took him into custody, and conveyed him to a coach, I did not search him, Harper did.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HARPER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer, I was of this party, in apprehending the man, I did not search him in the house, there were several people in the house, and we were glad to have him out of the house, I did not search him till I got him to prison, there I searched him; when I came to the prison gates, I believe the gates were open, and my son was in the coach with me, he went out of the coach first, and the prisoner at the bar next, there was another prisoner in the coach, a woman, that we took from the same house, and she had a young child, I was careful of getting the poor woman out of the coach, on account of the child, and thereby the man, the prisoner at the bar, was inside of the gates before I was out with the woman, and when I got inside of the gates, I saw the prisoner at the bar shoving his hands behind him, at the same time one of the turnkeys was close to him, I says to the turnkey, what is that fellow a shoving? I says to him, if you do any thing that is wrong I will get you punished for it, as sure as you are born; I then takes the turnkey and prisoner at the bar both into the lodge, to the candle, I laid hold of the turnkey's hand, and in the turnkey's hand were all these shilling and six-pences, seventy-five six-pences, and one shilling; I then searched the prisoner; on his right hand side breeches pocket, there were eighteen or nineteen guineas in gold, I believe, I am not quite sure, and four half guineas, and I think a twenty pounds bank note, and I found about three shilling and six-pence good money in his waistcoat pocket; as I was not searching for good money or bank notes, all the money was put into the hands of the keeper of the prison, by his desire; after my searching him, my son, who is not an officer, was there, and he got these halfpence from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. On the person of this man you did not find even a single piece bad? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the turnkeys of the New Prison; the coach came up to the door, and young Mr. Harper came out and the prisoner, I saw the prisoner go behind the door and put something down, I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170049"></xptr>to him and took something up, and Harper came to take it out of my hand, he put it down behind the door, behind a box; I have never seen it since Harper had it from me in the lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he put it down on the ground? - No, on the table, Harper said, what has he been doing there? I said, he has put down this; he said, give it me; I said, I would not, come to the light and I will give it you; and I went into the lodge and gave it him there.</p>
               <p>Harper. This is the bundle I took from this man's hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to the Turnkey. It was very dark? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him put it down? - I see him put something down.</p>
               <p>Q. And you told the officer immediately of it? - Mr. Harper came in, and I told him what I had got was in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him so directly, remember Harper is in hearing? - He asked me to give it him, and I said, come to the light and I will give it to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect he has been examined before? - Yes, but what I speak is truth.</p>

What sayest thou, Elizabeth Cook, art thou guilty of this Felony or not guilty? Eliz. Cook, Not guilty, Culprit, How wilt then be tried? Cook. By God and my Countrey. Clark, God send you a good Deliverance, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The first Evidence against her, was Mr. Powel the Parson, who being sworn, declared, That he came to London upon some particular affairs, and happened to go into the house to dinner, where the Prisoner was a <rs id="t16931012-70-deflabel279" type="occupation">servant</rs>

The next Witness was the Old Woman that kept the Ordinary; who deposed, That the Parson after he had dined (observing the Features of the Dutchwoman, and indeed she was handsome) was so much smitten with her Beauty, that he was not able to contain himself, but immediately he fell a Courting of her, declaring that there was no Creature in the world that he esteemed more; and truly he followed his business so close, that the match was suddenly made up, and they were married in the House by a Dutchman, who read out of a Dutch Book, after the Dutch fashion. After which the Parson grew inflamed, in Love with his New Bride, saying, My Dear now we are married, we must, to Bed, which they did, and lay two nights together; after which, the Parson, being willing to accommodate his new Wife, and to behave himself like a Gentleman, gave her money to buy her some fine Cloaths, adding these words, My dear, I will never leave you; God Almighty leave me, if ever I leave you. And that when she had bought her Cloaths, he would take her to his Living in the Country, which in reality he never intended. For as soon as he had delighted himself, and took his fill of Love, he began to grow weary of her, and examining his Pockets, his Stock grew low, not of Confidence, but of the Coriander, which put him into a sudden and strange Consternation; but awaking from that drowsy fit, he began to ask for his Money, which was all bestowed before on his dear Mistress: Being in this sorrowful plight, he knew not what to take to; but the next thing the Devil put is his head, was to Indict his Mistress for a Robbery; which he did, to the disgrace of his Person and Character; For the Court told him that his Diocesan should be made acquainted what a fine Clerk he had in his Diocess.

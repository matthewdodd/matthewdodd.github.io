               <p>My Lord, it is very difficult to swear to property in lead pipes, I can only say, about three months before this happened, I had a quantity of lead pipe put in the kitchen for the convenience of lodgers, when I went on the Saturday after the robbery was committed, the pipe was then gone; I cannot swear to the identical pipe.</p>
               <p>Garrett. I saw the pipe entire the day before.</p>

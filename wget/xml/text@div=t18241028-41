            . I am the patrol. I stopped the prisoner about ten o'clock on the evening of the 9th of October, with this copper on his shoulder. I asked him where he was going; he said to Paddington, that he had moved all his things but this copper, and he was carrying it himself, as it was expensive to hire a person to carry it; a woman was with him, carrying his hat - she went away. I took him at the end of Charlton-street; two or three hundred yards from the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was asked by a lady if I saw a person who had been carrying a copper; she said she had given him 1 s. to get some refreshment, and did not know what was become of him; she then asked me if I would carry it; she then spoke to the man who keeps the gate in Judd-street, and he let us through, and then the watchman came and took me.</p>

               <p>Humphreys. It is worth 3 or 4 l. I took her before Justice Welch; there she swore a gentleman gave it her, and sent for a gentleman to give her a character; upon which character he let her go; I kept the stay-hook, and advertised it: on the Wednesday after Mrs. Ward came, and said she had lost one; I told her it was at Justice Welch's; I first shewed her one, to see what she would say; she said that was not her's: then I took her to Justice Welch's: she owned it as soon as it was produced.

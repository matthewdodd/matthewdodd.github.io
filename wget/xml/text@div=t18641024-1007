I have had Mr. Hunt, my family physician, to see me, but feel no better. I beg to say it is bad management of the company's servants to allow a train at full speed to run into us.—Signed, Charles Nash.")—I replied on 10th June by this letter (<hi rend="italic">Read.</hi>—"10th June, 1864.

Nash; he is suffering from a severe concussion of the loins and back, he has a bruise on each leg, which is attended with much pain, an incised wound on the right eyebrow, and another below the left eye; he is much better in body; he is unable to attend to his business.—Alfred Hunt, surgeon.

On 13th Oct., between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to me; he had not been introduced to me personally before, but a letter from my solicitor introduced him to me, and he came with my solicitor—a promissory note was handed to me—I think my solicitor, Mr. Walsh, handed it to me—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor. I know the prisoner; I introduced him to the last witness for the purpose of having this note discounted—I had spoken to Mr. Cooper about it on the prisoner depositing a certain policy of insurance, and knowing his father-in-law by reputation—the prisoner showed me the note, which purported to be signed by William Jones—the note required an alteration, and it was made, and it was discounted by Mr. Cooper.</p>

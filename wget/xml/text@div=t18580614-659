                  </hi>. I am butler to Lord Foley. His Christian names are Thomas Henry—he lives at No. 26, Grosvenor Square—I have been nine years in his lordship's service—the prisoner Whetstone was in his service, as steward's room boy—the plate was kept in a strong closet, in the pantry, under the charge of Tomkins, the under butler—the plate closet had an old lock to it, not a patent lock, and there was three keys; one was kept by his lordship, one by me, and one by the under butler—when his lordship left town, on 27th March, the under butler asked leave to go into the country, on his own business, and I gave my key to him to seal up, in a paper parcel, to deliver to me, which was done, and I locked up that paper parcel, sealed with his seal, in my desk—that parcel contained his key and mine—I after<lb></lb>wards saw that parcel opened by our under butler, in my room, and the two keys were then in it—the seal was unbroken, until the under butler opened it—the family left town on 27th March; at that time I had in my possession the sealed parcel—Whetstone had received notice to leave on 24th March, for his general bad conduct—the male servants then left in town, were, her lady<lb></lb>ship's footman, James Suthers, William Cork, the hall porter, and Colonel Foley's servant, Henry Burbidge—the family left on 14th April, and it was between 9 and 10 o'clock that morning that the sealed parcel was opened, as I have described—shortly after it bad been opened, Tomkins came back from the strong room, and made a communication to me, in consequence of which, I went into the plate room, and found a considerable quantity of pro<lb></lb>perty gone, about 4,500 ounces in weight—amongst it was a silver gilt dessert service, and two glass claret jugs, silver gilt mounted—there were, also, some tops, belonging to some scent bottles, of Colonel St. George Foley's dressing case; they had been in the strong closet—when the femily were at home, Whetstone slept in the pantry; that is a room out of which the strong room opens—Tomkins, the under butler, also slept in that room, when he was</p>

On 3d April, about half past 9 or twenty minutes to 10 o'clock in the evening, I was passing through Grosvenor Square, and saw two men standing at the area gate of Lord Foley's house, one was talking quite loud, and the other was not; they were in the street, with their backs quite close to the gate; they were looking in the direction in which I was coming—I could not see the other one answer; I looked then to see who it was that he was talking to, and there was a man down the area steps answering him—I know one of them, they told me his name was Cherry; he is the fourth prisoner, the other I have not seen—I believe Whetstone to be the man who was in the area, I could not see that he had any hat or cap on—he was about four steps down; it turns round a little, and it was in the bend.</p>

               <p>Friday my husband told our butler that I had seen some men outside, and it was then he said that his wife had seen some, and requested the police to come to me—I had not been talking about the matter and comparing notes; I never conversed with any one about it, only my husband—I did not take notice what the men were saying; I thought they were gentlemen's servants talking to the other—I did not walk on as fast as I could, because, seeing them stand with their backs to the area gate, I thought it was remarkable, and turned my head, and one of them smiled at me, and that made me notice them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lady's maid in Lord Foley's establishment. I remember, when the family went out of town, going to the steward's room for some sherry; I cannot say exactly the day, but it would be either Mon<lb></lb>day, 29th March, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, 1st April, I cannot say which—the steward's room is the nearest to the area door; the pantry is opposite the back stairs; the door of it is on the same side of the passage as the steward's room, and a little further off—as I came from the steward's room, Puzey passed me when I was at the door towards the area—at this time repairs were going on in the house, but it was the workmen's dinner hour—I had seen several workmen in the house in the course of the morning—in oming from the pantry towards the area, you pass by the steward's room door (<hi rend="italic">A plan was litre produced</hi>)—at this time all the servants were at dinner—when Puzey passed me, I saw Whetstone standing at the pantry door—Puzey went out at the area door; I saw him open it and go out—I saw Puzey again in the house about Monday, 5th, or Tuesday, 6th April; he was then in the same passage, between the pantry and the steward's room—he had a parcel under his left arm; the outside of it was black glazed calico; it was about the size of six small silver dishes, if they were made in a parcel; I saw him go out of the area with it—Whetstone was at that time standing</p>

               <p>at the pantry door; he saw me pass the man, and he went into the pantry, and pushed the door to—on Wednesday evening, 7th April, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I was going up stairs, and saw Cherry and Whetstone coming down stairs; they passed me on the stairs—I speak quite positively to Cherry, because there was a gas light just where he stopped to make way for me to pass; these were the stairs which lead from the entrance hall—if anybody had come in at the main entrance, they would come down those stairs—the back stairs lead to the servants' offices, to the passage—the pantry is opposite the back stairs.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see Puzey in custody at the station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not state at the first moment that he was the man—I wished to see him again—the inspector did not then say to him "Good morning, <hi rend="italic">Tom,"</hi> I am quite sure of that; at least I did not hear him—the servants are not frequently in the habit of seeing visitors; they do occasionally—I do not know whether about this time there were many parties who came to see the servants; I remember who was in the house during the absence of Lord Foley—there were repairs going on in the house and outside, to a considerable extent, at that time—a great many workmen were employed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>without a coat, but it was his face I looked at—the same observation applies to when I saw him at Lord Foley's house—he is the man I met on the stairs, he wore dark clothes then—I was going up the stairs and he was coming down—it did not take a minute, he just stood aside and I passed him—I had never seen him before—there was a great deal of whitewash on. the stairs and dirt in the passage, I had my dress raised to escape it, and the man smiled just when I met him, and I thought that was why he smiled—I was going up quite quietly.</p>

About the beginning of April I was going to a stand at Winchester Row, and when I was waiting to get on the Tank, three men and a woman came to me—Winchester Bow is at the corner of the Marylebone Road—I know two of them, Pickett and Pazey—I heard the men call out "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, here is a cab, let us have this one"—I do not know which one it was, I did not take particular notice—they ordered me to North Audley Street, and I drove them all four there, except one, who I dropped at this end of Oxford Street and North Audley Street—I cannot tell who that was; it was not Puzey, he did not get out—I then drove the rest of them to North Audley Street.</p>

               <p>10 o'clock at night, I was crossing Grosvenor Square and was hailed by two men and a woman; Puzey was one of the men and Pickett was the woman—they were standing by the enclosure railings of the square, near a house, which I have since ascertained is Lord Foley's—I pulled, up, and they put some parcels in which they had at their feet; I cannot tell which of them had the parcels, the parcels were on the pavement at the time—Puzey put a parcel in first, I did not take particular notice of it, it was about the size of my hat; I do not know whether it was round, I did not take particular notice; it was covered over with some loose sort of article—I was going to get down to assist in putting the parcels in, and Puzey requested me not to get down—Pickett got into the cab, Puzey then put in the other parcel and got in himself—the parcels appeared heavy—they told me to drive to Goswell Street Road and make haste, and they would give me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more than my fare—when I got into Hanover Square, they requested me again to make haste, offering me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and something to drink if I would go faster—when I got into Theobald's Road, they requested me again to go faster—we ultimately got to a public house in Goswell Road, and they ordered me to drive to a public house opposite; I do not know the name of it—then Pickett and the short man got out, and Puzey last—he ordered Pickett and the short man to go in and get me something to drink; he waited outside—we went and had something, and as we were having it, I looked through the door and saw Puzey taking the largest parcel of the two out of the cab—it appeared heavy because he was like cuddling it, in a manner of speaking; he could not get it out with one hand—I went out then and shut the door after him, and he went down the street towards the City Road with the parcel—I stayed there about eleven minutes, when Puzey returned, and Pickett and the short man then came out of the public house, and Puzey took a parcel out then—when the other parcel was being taken out, the woman said, "Mind how you take it out, if the glass should break"—that was all she said—Puzey then told me to drive to the Ashby Castle, and wait till he came; that is close to Northampton Square—I did so with Pickett and the short man, and waited at Northampton Square about eighteen minutes—Puzey then came back, and asked me what my fare was—I told him I would leave it to him; so he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that was more than my fare, as he had promised me—there was some conversation among them ultimately about sleeping at some one's house, but I do not remember what female's name they said—they all three went away together—it was about a quarter to 11 o'clock when I left them, as near as I can judge—I should say it would take about twenty minutes to drive back to the neighbourhood of Grosvenor Square, at the pace they went at first.</p>

               <p>De Puzey and Whetstone in custody—I had a note from Superintendent Ham<lb></lb>mant telling me to come at half-past 9 o'clock on Sunday morning—I had given a description before I saw any one, I did it on the Friday—I believe it was 11th May when I first saw Partridge, I saw him among five or six men at the Vine Street station—I was at the police station three or four times since that, I have not been examined every time, but I have been there—I have not been examined above two or three times; I was made to attend in case I should be wanted—I mean to say that when I was examined I gave the same description before Inspector Hammant that I have told you—I noticed that when Partridge spoke he drew his mouth up, that was a peculi<lb></lb>arity he had.</p>

On the night before the family came home, on 13th April, I saw Tomkins, the under butler, leave the house about half past 7 o'clock at night—about 8 o'clock, or a little after, Whetstone came down stairs, and went into the pantry once or twice; he went then towards the area door, and I opened the area door—I do not know whether he actually went out; I was fully employed, and did not take any notice.</p>

On 13th April, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening, I was in Brook Street, and two men hailed me—I had a fare inside, who I set down in Grosvenor Square, and then returned to the two men in Brook Street—I should know one of them; it is the one who has the plaster on his face (Puzey); he had a bundle as big as a hat, or a little bigger perhaps; it was covered over with what looked to me like green baize, similar to that on the table—I cannot swear to the other man; he was about the height of Partridge—they got into the cab, and I drove them to the corner of Stafford Street and Mary-le-bonne Road; they got out there; Puzey took the bundle, and went up Stafford Street with it; the other man went the other way—when I stopped, one of them said, "Come round the corner, and I will pay you;" that was into Mary-le-bonne Road again—I was paid my fare, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., when I got round the corner, and lost sight of both of them.</p>

I have been expecting you some time;" that was <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Puzey—I heard more speaking after that—on the following morning, I was at the kitchen window, and saw a cab at the door; Puzey went to it, and his sister, and another person with a carpet bag and another parcel—at the Police Court, I at first thought the other was Cherry; it was a man with broad shoulders, and I believe him to be the man—the cab drove off with them and the bag and parcel.</p>

When Tomkins was out of town, I slept in the pantry—on 9th April, I went to the theatre half past 6 o'clock, and returned at half past 1 o'clock; Whetstone was in bed when I came home; after the robbery was discovered, there was a con<lb></lb>versation in the servant's hall, and Whetstone said, in a sort of sneering manner, "That was too cleverly done, they will never find that out; when I lived at Mr. Sidney Herbert's, there was a robbery there, and they never found that out, and if they did not find that out, I am sure they cannot find this out"—he did not at that time say what the robbery was at Sidney Herbert's, but he had previously said that it was jewellery.</p>

On Thursday afternoon, 13th April, about 5 o'clock, Benjamin came, and said that he called for an assay of a bar of metal which he had left to be assayed—I referred him to another assistant; we bought the bar of him, and our cashier paid him the money; I only know that from a memorandum—it was 40 ozs., 10 dwts, at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce, which would be 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., less 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the assay—this is the memorandum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—; it was not made at the time; it is copied from our assay book—there would be a portion of gold in it to bring it up to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ounce, about one dwt. in the pound; that is the usual proportion of silver gilt articles—I told him he would get it at the other counter; and, while they were making out the assay, he came back to me, and said, "Here are two pieces of silver I may as well sell you"—I do not remember whether the assay was handed to him at all—we are generally supposed to give it to the purchaser—he produced these two tops from a dressing case discoloured in this manner (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—; I took up the larger one and touched it with a file, to ascertain that it was silver, before purchasing it—Benjamin had this one in his hand on the other side of the counter, filing it over the top where the crest is—I said, "These have a crest on them;" he said, "Yes, they have been in a fire"—I said, "Yes, I can see that, it is all right"—I was filing on the side, not on the top where the crest is—they have been in some fire—I offered him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce for them; they were weighed, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I gave them to Bull the policeman—I gave information myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think your judgment is perfectly incorrect, and in order to test your judgment the jury must look at it, and they will perceive that by filing the centre the crest would be more brought to view; perhaps you never noticed that the crest by filing becomes more visible to the naked eye? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Possibly it does—I left the articles just as they were—inquiries were made of us two days</p>

I was with Thornton when Ben<lb></lb>jamin was taken; he was asked for his address, and gave me this card—(<hi rend="italic">This was Benjamin's card, stating him to be an importer and dealer in cane, at No. 21, Great Dover Street</hi>)—I went to No. 21, Great Dover Street, and found this bar of silver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) weighing 62 ozs.; I showed it to Benjamin at the station, and he said to Thornton, "You recollect, Mr. Thornton, how I told you I got these things."</p>

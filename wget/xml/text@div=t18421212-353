On the 10th of Dec., about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock, I was on duty in Welbeck-street—I saw Parker coming along Great Marylebone-street, from Mr. Sharp's shop, carrying a tray on his shoulder, with part of a neck and a shoulder of mutton in it—I, watched him down Welbeck-street, till he came to the Edin<lb></lb>burgh Castle, at the corner of Little Welbeck-street—he stood there about a minute, and looked around as if expecting some one—then went into the house—I pulled my armlet off, went and sat down on the left side, at the length of a settle from Parker—about ten minutes after Durham came in and sat down between me and Parker—they whispered together, but I could not tear what they said—I heard Parker say 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they left the room in a minute or two—they had an opportunity of seeing me—I followed them out immediately into the passage leading to the side-door—I saw Parker in the act of removing the shoulder of mutton from his own tray to Durham's tray, who was carrying an empty tray—Parker saw me, and withdrew the shoulder from Durham's tray to his own—I passed out, and said, "Good morning, butchers"—I passed to the right, as if going towards Wimpole-street—they followed and went up Little Welbeck-street—they went to the left—I turned to the right, and I looked through some iron railings—they looked round as if looking whether I was watching them—I saw Parker take the shoulder from</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Sharp, of High-street, Marylebone. On the morning of the 10th of December Ovenden made a communication to me—Parker came in shortly after, and was taken—I asked him if he had not been into a public-house—he said he had—I followed him to the station, and was showed a shoulder of mutton, the property of my master—I know it by the score on the back of the shoulder—I compared it with the mutton in the shop, and am sure it is my master's—Parker had not been ordered to take out any shoulder of mutton that day—Durham had been in Mr. Sharp's employ.</p>

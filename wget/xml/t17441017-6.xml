We were afraid to break open the door, for some persons in Field's house held candles out of the window and showed cutlasses to us in order to terrify us, and threw brickbats and glass bottles at us (as I imagine) and other things that they could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170006"></xptr> find. Then the mob began to rise upon us; there were but three or four of them at first, and one of them in particular came behind me and shoved me, in order to shove me down. I said, Who are you that offers to shove any body here; I took hold of him and said, Let us see who you are. I spoke to the Constable and he took charge of him, but the mob afterwards increased so great, that the Constable was obliged to let him go. - They call him Lippy, he has a hare lip.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you to Field's?</p>
               <p>Forfar. There were Mr. Blewmire , Mr. Montgomery, myself, and three more.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after?</p>
               <p>Forfar . After the mob had increased so much and were so outragious, the Constable and his assistants went away, and left only Mr. Montgomery and myself. He was cut down the coat, and went under a shell belonging to the next house to shelter himself; seeing none but him I was willing to get away as well as I could: them one of the fellows presented a musket to me, and said he would shoot me. I said, Take care what you do, for if you miss me I will not miss you; then I pulled out a pistol and presented it at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you presented your pistol before?</p>
               <p>Forfar. I had not, I had it in my breast; when I saw that Mr. Montgomery was attacked, I endeavoured to defend him as well as I could, (and he told me he was hard attacked) but he got into a house and so escaped from them: then seeing all my friends gone, I made the best of my way to Cow-Cross; when I came just by the White-Lion in Clerkenwell, Wells cut me on the top of the head with a cutlass and desperately wounded me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he assault you for?</p>
               <p>Forfar. I don't know for what: after Wells had wounded me, the whole mob got about me, knocked me down, cut me in several places, and stabbed me in the shoulder, my coat was cut in several places. I was very saint with the great loss of blood, and was carried home for dead.</p>

               <p>Wells. Do you know me?</p>
               <p>Blakeman. Yes, you live in Black-Boy-Alley , you come by our door every day, with a gang of gamblers and pickpockets, and such as they call street robbers.</p>
               <p>Wells. Did I ever rob you?</p>

               <p>Wells. I never carried a knife, much less a hanger.</p>
               <p>Watson. When I was taken up and carried to Clerkenwell Bridewell, the Prosecutor said he could not swear to one or another, and there being some people that had got money, he would not appear against them. But as we are poor fellows, and have no body to appear for us, he swore against us.</p>
               <p>The Prosecutor was asked whether this was true, but he absolutely denied it.</p>

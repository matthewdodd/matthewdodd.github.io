I had two sovereigns, 13s., and some halfpence in the desk, which was locked, and in the counting-house; it must have been taken between eleven o'clock on Tuesday night and seven on Wednesday morning, when I found the desk had been broken open with a poker, which lay by the side - the persons had forced back a sliding window; there were a great many pigs in the yard into which the counting-house window looks - I knew the prisoner very well, and had suspicion of him; I ordered our foreman to go about Paddington, and see if he was sporting about with any money - the prisoner knew the premises very well.</p>

            . I am horse-keeper to the prosecutor. On the Tuesday night the dog barked, and awoke me - I got up to look at the pigs, and saw the prisoner lying between the wall and the pigs; he had no right there - he was not at work for master at that time.</p>

            . On Wednesday morning, the 19th of May, I was going to work - I met the prisoner, who asked if I would have something to drink; I said I would, and he went to a crater at the corner of Green-street, North-road, and took out two sovereigns - he said,"See me pick money out of dirt;" we then went to the corner of James-street, met Kirkbam, and I left them together.</p>
               <p>PHILIP WEBSTER. I am an officer. I was at Haltongreen fair on the 20th, and took the prisoner on this charge - he said he knew nothing of it; I asked how he came by the new clothes which he had on - he said he had bought them with some money he had saved up.</p>

            . On Wednesday morning, at half-past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner - he brought me a shirt to wash; he put his hand into his pocket, and gave me a shilling - I walked with him to the wharf, and he gave me 2d. to get a glass of gin; between the 2d. were two shillings, and in his other hand I saw a sovereign and some silver - the shirt he gave me to wash was all over soil.</p>

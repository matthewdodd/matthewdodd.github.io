                  </hi>. I live at Highbury House, Holloway, and carry on there the business of a draper—Mrs. Maria Soames, of 27, Alfred-street, Bedford-square, was my half-sister—she was a widow—she died on 18th October, 1856—I last saw her alive on Friday the 17th, the day before her death—I had also seen her on the Wednesday before; that would be the 15th—I saw her that day at my house between 2 and 3 in the after<lb></lb>noon—she had come from her home to me.</p>

               <p>—somewhere about half an hour after that she died—the appeared to be in violent agony up to the time of her death—she was complaining of the pain in the chest up to the last—a friend of mine, named Miss Rowe, resided in the other house, No. 13, but took her meals in No. 27—she came in just about the time my mother died—she was there at the last, just when my mother was dying—I cannot recollect whether I left her in the room with the prisoner after my mother was dead. Soon after the funeral the prisoner told me that my mother had borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of her—I was surprised at it—I do not know what I said—I had never heard during my mother's lifetime of her borrowing any money of the prisoner—the prisoner produced a paper to me, either at the time or soon after—she said my mother had written it—I read it—I suppose it must have been thrown away; I have not got it—I do not know what became of it—I received it from the prisoner—it is not above a year and a half I think since I saw it—I do not think it can exist now, for I have looked through all my papers—it was in my mother's hand<lb></lb>writing; I am quite sure of that—there was on it "I promise to pay the holder or bearer the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on demand," and in my mother's name, "A. M. Soames"—I cannot recollect whether there was any date to it, or any stamp—I ultimately paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner—I paid her partly in cash, and she worked the rest out in rent—my uncle gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the money to pay her—I did not show the paper to my uncle—I cannot exactly say what income my mother had about that time—from what I reckoned up, as well could, it must have been about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with what she got from uncle, in<lb></lb>cluding the legacy; that is as well as I can recollect or reckon now—my mother paid her bills regularly—at the time of her death there were a few bills left, for I should think about five or six weeks—my mother once said to me that her money affairs gave her a great deal of trouble, that was all—that was some short time before her death; not very long—I did not know of her having lent the prisoner money at any time—I had never heard any<lb></lb>thing about my mother's going to be married again.</p>

               <p>had been sleeping there for six weeks previous—I was carrying on no business in particular then—I did do something at 27, but my place there was let to others; my rooms that I had there were let to two gentlemen—my business was dressmaking during the six years that I lodged at Mrs. Soames—I took work in—am I obliged to tell you how much I paid per week for my Iodg<lb></lb>ing?—my room that I occupied at 27 was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I only had one room in that house; that was a bedroom—I had two rooms in the other house, for which I paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was on very friendly terms with Mrs. Soames—I was in the habit of being with her—I knew the prisoner from the time that she came and lodged at Mrs. Soames—I very frequently saw her in company with Mrs. Soames—I was not so often in company with the pri<lb></lb>soner—Mrs. Soames used to tell me nearly everything, up to within six weeks of her death nearly—for six weeks before her death she was not so confiden<lb></lb>tial as she had been before—the prisoner and I never had any reason to dis<lb></lb>agree at all during the time she was there—I can't say that we were on particularly friendly terms; as other lodgers, no more—we were not particu<lb></lb>larly intimate—I very often went into the kitchen which Mrs. Soames used to occupy; daily—I did not always find the prisoner there; I did sometimes; not so very often; not daily—I carried on the dressmaking business at 27—I know Mrs. Hawkeshead—during Mrs. Soames illness Mrs. Hawkeshead was more constantly there than any other person, with the exception of the prisoner—I only saw Mrs. Soames once when she was ill, and that was the first morning that she was ill, the Thursday morning—I did not see her again until just before she died—when Mrs. Soames and I were together we were often in the habit of talking a great deal—it was about breakfast time on the Thursday that I ascertained that Mrs. Soames was ill—I should say about 9 or 10 o'clock, or it might be a little later or earlier—I can't say exactly how long I was with Mrs. Soames on the Thursday morning; per<lb></lb>haps about half an hour—I am not positive; it might have been half an hour or a little more or less; I can't say—it was in the course of the day that saw the prisoner again—about mid-day—I should say, to the best of my knowledge, it was about mid-day that she told me I had better not go again into Mrs. Soames' room—I cannot tell when the medicine came—I never saw it only in the prisoner's room that time—that was on the evening of Thursday or Friday; I am not certain of the day—I know that Mrs. Soames was ill only Thursday and Friday—I cannot tell you whether the prisoner called me into her room, or whether I went in of my own accord, on the evening that I saw the medicine there—there were more there than my<lb></lb>self—there was another gentleman there—his name is Necker, a German; not the husband of Mrs. Naacke, who has been examined to-day; a stranger to that gentleman; his name is Naacke, the other gentleman's name is Necker—I first spoke to the prisoner about the medicine—I did not par<lb></lb>ticularly notice the colour of the medicine in the large bottle—I could not swear to the colour—I left the room soon after the conversation took place about the medicine; I can't state the exact time—when I left the room, perhaps I did not go to my own room; I might have gone down stair; I am not certain—I left the prisoner in the room when I left it—I did not see the prisoner lock the door, because there was another gentle<lb></lb>man and herself in the room—I did not feel annoyed at the prisoner's telling me that I could not give the medicine to Mrs. Soames—I thought I was old enough to give it, that was all—she had never been ill before, so that I had had no reason to attend her—she did not have any billions attack that I ever attended her for—I remember her being a little poorly sometimes—I</p>

I am the wife of Benjamin Matthews, of 42, Amwell-street, Pentonville, grocer and oilman—I should have known Mrs. Soames twenty years by this time—at the time of her death I had known her sixteen years—I was on very intimate terms, indeed, with her; her health was particularly good—in consequence of a letter, I went to her house on the Saturday after her death; I saw the prisoner there then, but had no conversation with her—I went again on the Sunday, I saw the prisoner then, and she had a conversation with me respecting my deceased friend, over her body—she took me up to see the deceased, herself; she had the key of her room in her pocket—I was very much surprised at the appearance of my friend; her hands were clenched and her face was dread<lb></lb>fully distorted—I said to the prisoner, "Her's must have been a bad death"—and she shook her head and said, "Poor dear, poor dear, ah! you don't know all"—I said, "Not know all, not know all; what do you mean?"—she said, "Ah, poor dear, you don't know all, did you know she was going to be married?"—I said, "Married, certainly not"—I said, "Do her daughters know it or her brother, Mr. Barnes," I believe I said—she said, "Oh, no, it is a profound secret from all"—she said, "If it was not for that I think we should have her with us now"—I said, "What do you mean?"—she said, "The day after you were here (which was on the Tuesday), she went out to see the man she was going to be married to, and she found it very different to what he had represented"—I think she told me that she went in an omnibus up by the Angel, somewhere, to see this man, and it was finding out the altered circumstances of this man that had caused her grief and brought on the bile—she said, "She was in the habit of having her letters directed to me, under cover, so that her daughters should not know anything about it"—she said, "The man was always borrowing money, and there will be another letter to-morrow, and you will see it will be the old story, wanting to borrow money; he will be sure to want to borrow more money"—I said, "More money, I don't understand"—she said, "It is very shocking, is it not?"—I asked if she knew whether Mrs. Soames had lent</p>

               <p>the man much—I forget the exact sum she said, but she told me she believed it was very considerable; but the letter would be sure to be to borrow more money, as usual—she said that Mrs. Soames had wanted to borrow money of her, and I think she told me that she had lent Mrs. Soames 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and would have lent her more if she had had it—she said, "Poor dear, I would have lent her anything if I had had it; I had such love for her"—I do not recollect any more of the conversation that we had just then, in the room—she told me she believed Mrs. Soames had made this man's acquaintance in going up to see her brother, somewhere at Islington; that it was a very wretched place that he lived in, and he had got a lot of children—the prisoner told me that she knew the man quite well; that she had seen Mrs. Soames meet him; I think: she said she had been with Mrs. Soames to meet him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear her say anything, during this conversation, about brandy and water? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she told me that Mrs. Soames, from meeting this man, and from the upset, had caused her to have the bile, and she was taken ill in her room after drinking a little brandy and water—I then went down to tea with the daughters and some friends there—she afterwards brought in a little bottle and made a great mystery of it, and would not allow it to come near the light, and said there was some conspiracy against the house—I knew Mrs. Soames in her lifetime very intimately—I was there on the Tuesday before she was taken ill; I had never heard her, at any time, say anything about getting married, or about any one writing to her, or borrowing money—a short time before her death she came to my house on her road to her brother's, very much distressed, after there had been a robbery in her house of a lot of silver—she was quite well then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a person dies of choleraic diarrhoea, would there be imflammation of the peritoneum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not see that there is any necessity for that—I don't see that that should follow—the peritoneum is one of the coverings of the stomach and bowels generally; I believe there are three; you may call it the serous membrane of the outer covering of the bowels, and the inward lining of the abdomen—I call it the third covering—I believe it is generally called the outward lining of the bowels and the inward lining of the abdomen—to the best of my belief, that is the fact; it is a scientific fact.</p>

I am a doctor of medicine, and professor of medical jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital—I have for the last thirty years directed my attention particularly to cases of poisoning—I have studied and written on the subject—after five years' interment, I believe there would be no possibility of discovering a vegetable irritant in the body—supposing the death to have occurred on the Saturday morning, and an examination of</p>

               <p>the stomach to take place on the following Wednesday, if a vegetable poison had been taken in a flned state, and there had been violent vomiting and purging, I should not expect, even if it were easy to discover it, that there would be a trace—I have been in Court and heard the evidence which has been given in this case—violent vomiting and purging, with pain in the bowels and stomach, are symptoms of English cholera—retching is an occa<lb></lb>sional, but not a very common, symptom—vomiting and purging are common, and pain in the bowels and stomach, which is relieved after the act of vomiting—I have not, in my experience, known of a case of a healthy person dying of English Cholers within fifty-two hours of the commencement of the attack—I cannot call to my mind that I ever heard or read of such a case—if English cholera is induced by taking unwholesome food, then one of two things would happen: either it might, after some days, lead to death by gastritis, in<lb></lb>flammation of the stomach: or, the noxious matter would be speedily ejected by vomiting and purging, and the person would recover—it would lead to gas<lb></lb>tritis, and death after several days—the more common case is that the noxious matter in a healthy person is very speedily thrown off by vomiting and purging, and then the person would recover—that has been my experience with regard to unwholesome food—the persons have generally recovered—there has been violent purging and vomiting, and they have got well—in a case of gastritis, terminating fatally, there would not be vomiting or purging—at the moment gastritis is set up there may be slight vomiting, but those symptoms disappear when gastritis or enteritis is set up—constipation is one of the marked symptoms of gastritis, and would certainly occur before death, if death ensued from gastritis or peritonitis—in peritonitis, constipation is a marked symptom, and in gastritis also—I may mention, as a reason, that nature requires repose for recovery, and there is a want of action in all the parts, to allow the restoration of health—violent pain in the chest is not a symptom of English cholera—I have heard mentioned by Dr. Whidborne the medicine which he prescribed in this case—the effect of that medicine in a case of English cholera, if administered simply by itself, would be to act as a kind of sedative to allay the irritability of the stomach, and to lead to a cessation of the violent symptoms, supposing it depended upon natural disease—supposing a person to be suffering from natural diseass, of the character of English cholera, I should not expect to find increased severity in the symptoms, after the administration of such a medicine—I think it was a very proper medicine to administer, to allay the symptoms—an increase in the strength of that medicine would have a tendency to arrest the vomiting and purging—I have not known a case of death taking place, from natural disease, under such circumstances as I have heard described—I am acquainted with the action of colchicum and other vegetable irritants—the effect of the administration of doses of colchicum, is to produce a sense of fullness and heat in the throat, and violent pain in the stomach; bursing pain it is sometimes described—that is the effect of repeated doses, or one dose—I do not mean doses in the degree in which they are medicinally given; I mean larger doses—repeated, or in one large dose, it would produce nausea in the throat, burning sensation, severe griping pain in the stomach, vomit<lb></lb>ing, with violent retching, and copious purging of a watery liquid—thirst is also a symptom, and great restlessness, with great depression of strength—in most cases of irritant poisoning, there is great anxiety expressed in the countenance—in such a case the symptoms would progress in severity; that is the general course—nothing relieves them—such a medicine as that men<lb></lb>tioned by Dr. Whidborne would, as a sedative, tend to relieve the progress</p>

               <p>of the symptoms of an irritant poison—I do not think it would suffice to relieve them; but it would have a tendency to do so—the only relief to be experienced in such a case, is by the elimination of the poison from the body—the amount of relief would depend upon the quantity of the poison that had been administered; with a small dose the medicine might do good, with a large dose it would not.</p>

               <p>issues from the body—there is only a half state of consciousness, and the discharge by vomiting and purging is a sort of whitish fluid, like rice-water—it is impossible to mistake it for English cholera.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long after a person is attacked by Asiatic cholera, do these symptoms exhibit themselves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the case of a friend of mine, who died from it, they came on in seven or eight hours; he was dead in about nine hours, from a state of perfect health—the cases of cholera which occurred in this metropolis in 1854 and 1855, were a carious mixture—there was a com<lb></lb>bination of the Asiatic form of the disease with the ordinary English cholera, in which the English cholera appeared to be rendered much more malignant than usual; in the beginning of the attack the evacuations were paler, and then they gradually became like the evacuations in the malignant Asiatic form—a medical man is at once informed of it, by its being epidemic<lb></lb>vomiting, purging, retching, thirst, pain in the bowels and stomach, would be the symptoms of English cholera—they would also be the symptoms of the combined form of cholera—it would commence in that form—the disease is epidemic when it is so severe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there not instances occurring monthly in the registrar's reports, of such deaths, when the disease was not, by medical men, thought to be epidemic, <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I place no confidence in them—many of those cases thus registered, I have found to be cases of poisoning—I know there are such cases registered, but they are not carefully done; they are not carefully recorded—I have in my mind at least six cases which have been registered as death from cholera, which have been from poison—when cholera is not epidemic, and where death is registered as death from cholera, I should immediately suspect poisoning—I would not say that my general belief would be that the death resulted from poison—I should require an analysis before I gave an opinion; but, at least in eight cases which I know have been registered as death from cholera, upon exhuming the bodies they have turned out to be from irritant poison; therefore, I say, I place no confidence in these isolated cases thus reported—when a person is attacked with combined or English cholera, it is not usual for them to suffer pain up to the moment of death—there are long intermissions—if death results from the administration of vegetable poison, the patient generally suffers from pain until the time of death—that is generally the result of vegetable irritant poison, if it is not expelled from the body—if the poison had been absorbed into the blood, it is not probable that the person, although of a healthy constitution, would get better—the poison might enter the blood in from half an hour to an hour, or even a shorter time than that according to the state of the stomach—if poison be eliminated from the body, no traces of it are found in a post mortem examination—if absorbed into the blood, it would depend upon the nature of the poison whether traces of it would be found upon a post mortem examination—the poison suggested to me, colchicum, would not—I believe it never has been found in the blood—I have said that a person suffering from the disease, the symptoms of which would induce a doctor to believe was cholera, and taking the medicine which Dr. Whidborne gave, I should expect to be relieved—there are certainly some cases which are not readily treated by medicine; but the general principle is, that medicine of that kind administered in ordinary cholera gives relief—I have heard of cases of cholera in which, although medicine be administered, relief did not ensue—it is the case in epidemic cholera, that, although persons take the proper remedies, they do not get better, but continue to get worse—that is a fact in all cases of disease—there are some diseases that do not yield to remedies—I have known persons</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220103"></xptr>
               <p>who have taken irritant poison, complain of pain in the chest—I think it in often referable to the action of the poison on the throat in swallowing—a burning sensation in the gullet has been one of the symptoms—if a person, suffering under cholera, vomits severely, and continues vomiting for two days, that might bring on pain in the chest; but I gather, that pain in the chest was an early symptom in this case—in oases that I have seen, or am ac<lb></lb>quainted with, I have generally referred it to the action of the poison on the throat—it might be muscular pain, resulting from the constant vomiting—I have not attended many persons for cholera—I have not practised for some years; but I have seen many such cases—for many years I have confined my professional practice to the subject of poisoning, to jurisprudential matters—the experiments I have made have chiefly been on dead bodies—I have, within the last few years, been called in to attend cases of poisoning by arsenic, and opium, and cases of that description—I have not seen many cases of cholera since I have ceased to practice—I have only occasionally practised within the last fifteen years or so—I have within that period been often called in to attend living persons who have been poisoned; I can't say in how many cases, they have been chiefly cases of poisoning by arsenic, and cases of suspected poisoning, chiefly by arsenic, and opium—I have not, within the last fifteen years been called upon to attend a person who had taken colchicum—a person may die from having partaken of diseased food, with all the symptoms exhibited by a person who had taken poison—it may produce the effect of irritant poison; in fact, it is an irritant poison—in such a case, I would not say that all the characteristics of poison would be exhibited—the principal characteristics would be exhibited; vomiting purging, and pain—death has taken place from the administration of one dose of colchicum in as early as seven hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do the symptoms exhibited by a person who has taken poison, show themselves very shortly after the poison has been taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends upon the nature of the poison—colchicum has shown its action in from a few minutes to half an hour, or an hour—if colchicum be eliminated from the body, it might be contained in the early part of the vomiting; that which is first thrown off—it would depend upon whether or not it got into the blood; if it got into the blood none would be found in the vomit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If colchicum had been taken, and all the symptoms were exhibited by the person who took it, which you have heard detailed here, could any tract whatever of the colchicum be found in the body on the Wednesday after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Taking what I have heard of the incessant vomiting, retching, and purging, and assuming that it was taken in a fluid state, if taken at all, I do not believe any trace would have remained, even if the body had been examined at the time of death, or soon after—I believe, from the retching, that the stomach was quite cleared out of everything—colchicum, in destroy<lb></lb>ing life in the same doses, has, in the case of persons taking it at the same time, left in one case a reddish appearance of the bowels, and in the other case no appearance at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have, in answer to my learned friend, spoken of a combined form of cholera, in which certain symptoms are similar to those of what is commonly called English cholera? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it commences in that Way—before that combined form assumes a fatal character, there is a change in the symptoms; the evacuations, instead of being bilious, become wholly altered in character, and it ultimately assumes the form of malignant cholera—in the case of a person suffering from English cholera, when sedative medicines are administered, there are intermissions of pain—assuming that</p>

               <p>some irritant matter had been swallowed, I should attribute it to an effect upon the throat—supposing diseased food had been eaten, such medicines as those that have been spoken of, would not have effect until the diseased matter had been thrown off—if death resulted from the diseased matter, I should expect to find some of that diseased matter in the subject, in severe gastritis, and inflamation of the stomach and bowels—if the matter is not thrown off from the body, it produces severe inflammation, and death in consequence—if diseased food was such as to act as an irritant poison, and cause death, I should expect to find similar symptoms in the persons who shared that food.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would a vegetable irritant poison, such as colchicum, produce the same, and as speedy effect, if administered in solid food, as it would when administered in a fluid state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not more speedily when given in a fluid state, and upon an empty stomach—if there was food in the stomach it might delay its operation.</p>

My father keeps the City of Hereford, Cleveland Street—on 21ST November, about 6 o'clock, the prisoner came in, and a man who had a French accent joined her inside—she came in again about 9 o'clock, had something to drink and paid for it, she then threw down a medal, saying, "Change me this"—I told her it was bad, she said it had been given to her by the Frenchman who was in the house with her at 6 o'clock, and that he had a purse full of them—she took up the medal and walked out, she was brought back by a constable about 9.30—the medal was similar to this produced, but I only saw the head.</p>

I am barman to Mr. Finch, at the Globe, Upper Marylebone Street—on 21ST November I served the prisoner with a glass of ale, she put down a coin and asked for change for a sovereign—I heard by the sound that it was bad, and took no notice, I did not examine it farther—she put it in her pocket and afterwards threw it down again and said, "Give me change for a sovereign"—I also heard her say to Mr. Robinson, "Change me a sovereign"—I spoke to him.</p>

I am manager to Mr. Finch—on 21ST November the prisoner came in and asked for change for a sovereign—she gave me this Hanoverian coin, I was rather busy, went to the back, got the change and put it in front of her—I saw her counting it, and then found it was a medal—I spoke to Mr. Finch, who went outside and afterwards gave him the coin, this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Globe—it would take five or six minutes to go from there to the City of Hereford—on 21ST November Robinson spoke to me, and I saw the prisoner there—I went out after her and stopped her, and said, "I believe you had change for a sovereign at this house a few months ago," she said, "Yes"—I said, "I will trouble you to step inside, as I shall be obliged to give you in charge"—while she was wait<lb></lb>ing for the constable to arrive, she said that she had already passed one over the way, and that a gentleman gave them to her—she did not say a French gentleman—Robinson gave me this medal—I gave it to the constable—it was marked at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Mr. Wiggins's, at Hoxton; my husband and I have apartments in the house, and I assist in the business. On 5th Oct. the prisoner came, about half past 6 o'clock in the evening—a young man was with her—they called for a pint of the best ale—the prisoner put down half a crown—I put it into the till, and gave her 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I am quite confident that when I put that half crown into the till there was no other half crown there—Mr. Wiggins was in front of the counter, and he came round, and I heard him sound some coin, but I had then left the bar—the prisoner was then gone; she only stayed about three minutes after she got the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had not left the bar five minutes when Mr. Wiggins called my attention to a half crown he had in his hand—he marked it, and kept it apart till he gave it to the policeman—on 22nd Oct. I was coming down stairs, and saw the prisoner leaving the bar—my sister, Sarah Evans, was attending to the business—I spoke to Mr. Wiggins, who was in the bar, and my sister passed a shilling to me—I broke it, and I kept it till it was given to the policeman—on 3rd Nov. my sister came to me up stairs, and told me something—in consequence of that I went down—a female was just going out of the door; I did not see her face, only her back—Mr. Wiggins went after that person—my sister had at that time a shilling in her hand; she gave it to me, and I bent it—it was kept with the others till it was given</p>

I put the half crown into the till; I am quite sure there was no other half crown there—I saw there was some sixpences and shillings there; not more than 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not turn them over, but I am sure there was no half crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sister of the last witness; I sometimes assist at Mr. Wiggins's. I was there on 22nd Oct.—I remember seeing the prisoner come in—I served her—she gave me a shilling—I put it on a slate book in the till; that kept it apart from other shillings in the till—the slate book is about three quarters of an inch thick, and I put the shilling on that—just at that time my sister came down stairs; she said something to me about the woman—in consequence of what she said, I looked for the shilling; I found it on the slate book, just as I left it—I am sure that I took from the till the same shilling that I put there—I gave it to my sister; I saw her bite it—on 3rd Nov. I was attending in the bar—the prisoner came again, and asked for a glass of the best ale—she gave me a shilling in payment—I remembered her as the person who had been there before, and in conesquence of that I handed the shilling to Mr. Wiggins—he said, That will do"—I told him I did not like the sound of it—the prisoner heard that, and, she said, I can give you another, Miss, if you don't like that"—I gave her the change, and put the shilling on one side of the till—there were other shillings in the till, but I put that shilling separate from them, because I knew the prisoner was the woman that came before—I went and spoke to my sister—she came down, and just saw the prisoner going out.</p>

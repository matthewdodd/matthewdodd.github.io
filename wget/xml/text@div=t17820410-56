               <p>On the 25th of March I met the prisoner with this piece, between six and seven, in Whitehart-yard, I saw the beef and a hook sticking in it, I thought it was stolen, I asked him where he got it, he said, if I had any demands on it to take it, he threw it down, I went to lay hold of him, he struck me, he got away, I called stop thief, and he was laid hold of before he was out of my sight; I carried the beef to Mr. Lingard's house, they said they had just lost it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lingard. The beef the young man brought to my house is the piece I lost, the hook was in it, it is remarkable, I remembered it, I could swear to the beef, I cut it myself.</p>

               <p>That evening I came from Westminster-market; I had been down to Fleet-market, the King's-head, and spoke to a person to get me into work, I saw somewhat lay along against a door, I stopped to see what it was, seeing no person near it I took it up, and found it to be a large piece of beef with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100081"></xptr> a hook in it, the gentleman at the bar stopped me as I was coming along with it, and asked where I had got it, I dropped it, and he said he would not be content with that, he would stop me and carry me before a magistrate, I said, I would not go, if it belonged to him he was very welcome to have it, I was rather in liquor, I did not wish to be detained, I am a taylor, and I live in Westminster, in Angel-court, I did not expect my trial to come on now, and I have no witnesses.</p>

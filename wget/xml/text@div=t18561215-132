                  </hi>. I am clerk to a solicitor, and reside in Chester-place, Belgrave-road, Pimlico. Last Saturday night I was return<lb></lb>ing home about ten minutes after 10 o'clock—the prisoner came up to me at the corner of Tachbrook-street—she said, "Where are you going?"—I said, "Home"—I had a large parcel in one hand and an umbrella in the other—she said, would I give her something to drink—I said, that I did not mind—we went to a public house and had half a pint of beer—we were not in more than a minute or two—when I came out I saw two men on the opposite side of the way talking to each other—I said to the prisoner, "There are two suspicious characters, I will be off"—I was going towards home, in the Belgrave-road, and it was not a moment before a man put his hand in my neck, and I saw his hand in my waiscoat pocket, where I had two half crowns and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I had a purse in my trowsers pocket—while the man had his hand in my waistcoat pocket, I called out loudly, and put my hand to my trowsers pocket—the prisoner had got her hand in my pocket, and the purse in her hand—I got the purse out of her hand when she had got her hand just outside the pocket, and I held her till a policeman came—one of the men went one way, and the other another—I had pre<lb></lb>viously noticed them—I missed the'two half crowns directly—I am quite certain they were in the waistcoat pocket that the man put his hand in—my coat had been buttoned up—this is it—it was torn, struggling with the prisoner and one of the men—I was not tipsy at all.</p>

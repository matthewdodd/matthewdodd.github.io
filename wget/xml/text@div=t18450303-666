                  </hi>. I am servant to Susan Hobbs, who is single, and Hves at Mr. Corsten's, in Heyday-street, Berkeley-square. In January I heard the step of a man going down into the water-closet—the chamber-pot is the property of Susan Hobbs, and is china—I missed it from the water-closet several days after I had heard the steps of the man—it was kept in the water-closet, exposed to view, and, I understand, is a valuable one—I did not miss it before, as I believe it was never used by the family.</p>

I am a baker, and live in Ryder's-court, Leicester-square—the prisoner was in my employ—he absconded, and I went to various customers whom he used to serve—I went to Mrs. Elliott's, and they told me the bill which I presented had been paid to the man—I called on Mrs. Barnes, and she said I had not deducted the half-crown which she had paid on account—this is the bill she gave me, and here is "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid off it" on—I could not swear that this is the prisoner's handwriting—it was his duty to give me the money the day he received it, and these two sums he never gave me.</p>

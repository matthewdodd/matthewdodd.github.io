               <p>Mr. James, Prisoner's Council. This was just when the play was over, Sir? - About half an hour after the play.</p>
               <p>There were several persons run? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you observe whether there were not several persons there before you came to the spot? - I was intercepted by those men, there was no mob at all.</p>
               <p>Were there not several persons on that spot before that time? - There was no croud I am positive.</p>
               <p>But there were several persons? - Not so much as to hinder my going along.</p>
               <p>But there were several people? - There might, but I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Did you observe at what place the centinal was posted? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you observe there was a centinel? - I did, I went close by him when I came out, but at the time I lost my watch, I do not know where he was.</p>
               <p>Did you see the watch go when it went from you? - No.</p>
               <p>You said just now, you was kicked by somebody who was his comrade? - They were the same people that surrounded me, they followed me out.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the person that kicked you in company with the prisoner? - The men that came round me at the time, were the same men that followed me out, they were behind me all the way to Covent Garden; I suppose them to be the same from hearing them behind me, for no other reason.</p>

               <p>Upon the 14th of December, the prosecutor gave information of his being robbed, I apprehended the prisoner along with Macmanus, and Morant, we went to his lodgings, and upon him we found some duplicates of a coat and hat.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. I submit to your Lordship there is no evidence against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Why so.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. Then I submit there is no evidence to support this indictment, this is an indictment for a highway robbery, and it is of the essence of that crime, that it must be done forcibly and violently, either an actual violent assault and taking of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120055"></xptr> property, or else an open plain direct taking of the property; had this been an indictment for stealing privately from the person, it might have been relevant, but here is no proof of force, nor of open direct taking the property; but that there was an attack in a croud, where it was natural there should be a pushing.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is for the Jury to consider, with what view he made that push at him, which Chiswick swears to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for sometime and returned with a verdict.</p>

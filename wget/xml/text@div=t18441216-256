The prisoner was in my service—I hired a room for him at Mr. Paley's, to work in at my business, and as my servant—I supplied him with tools of my own to work with—this fusee-engine, this depth-tool, and this notching-tool are mine, and were given him to work with—I afterwards went to Mr. Paley's in consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion, and did not find the prisoner or my tools.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Kirkwood, a pawnbroker. I have produced these tools—they were pledged on the 11th of Nov. by the prisoner—I have known him eleven months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I own to pledging these tools, but not with any intention of robbing Mr. Collingridge of them; I had work about, which would have got them out, and which is now left unfinished; I told Mr. Col<lb></lb>lingridge repeatedly that I had pledged them, and it made me very uneasy; I could not bear to see him, or go to the shop; I was out along with a young man, who told me they were going to play a game of skittles for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I, like a stupid, said, "I have got some money coming to me in a day or two; I don't think Mr. Collingridge will mind; I will pledge these, and get them out to-morrow morning, or next day, if you will let me have the money;" I lost every farthing; it was a trap laid for me; I took the things to the engine-turner's, and they kept them longer than I expected; Mr. Collingridge came into the shop, and asked me where the tools were; I said it was all right; he went directly to the pawnbrokers,</p>

               <p>and found the tools there; that was a fortnight after I had left Mr. Col<lb></lb>lingridge; he only employed me for about a week; the other work was all on my own account; I promised to get them out when the work was done; this engine-tool belonged to Mr. Darby, who I lived with fouryears; Mr. Collingridge was certainly very kind to me, and took me in when I was in distress; I know it was very bad of me to do what I have done, but I had no intention of robbing him.</p>

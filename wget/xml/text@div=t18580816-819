                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, residing at Greens-end, Woolwich—on Tuesday night, 29th June, I shut up the shop myself at a quarter past 9 o'clock—I saw the shutters and bar safe at 12, when I went to bed—the police-constable, Wells, called me down stairs at a quarter to 3 in the morning—on going outside the window, I found the iron bar forced away, and two of the shutters taken down from the front: the bar was forced out in the centre, and turned round in the joint; the end was twisted a little, and it had torn the wood away at the further end.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at William-street, Woolwich—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 30th June, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I had occasion to pass the corner of Greens-end three or four times; when I first passed I saw two young men, and as I approached towards the corner of the opposite side of the way, I saw them walking as it were from the window of the last witness's house to the next house—I had no suspicion that anything was wrong at that time—I will not swear that the prisoners are the men I first saw—I had occasion to turn back again in the course of a very little time, and I still found them by Dix's store—I went away and returned again, when they were still there—when I came back the last time, I heard a foot coming as hard as it could run—I thought it was rather strange, and, as soon as I got round the bow, a young man pulled up all of a titter and walked by very quick; and as soon as he had got by me, he started off like a shot—as soon as I turned round again I heard another foot; he acted much on the same principle—by the time I arrived at the house I saw the officer—I told him two men had gone a-head, and I told him the direction—the prisoners are the men who passed me; I am sure of it because we came face to face—after a little looking at them at the station-house, I was perfectly satisfied they were the men.</p>

I was on duty at Greens-end on the morning of 30th June, at a quarter to 3 o'clock—I saw the prisoners there—Phillips came to the corner close to me and gave a whistle—I thought something was wrong, as I saw them close to the window—as soon as they saw me they both ran away together—I sprung my rattle and followed them, when I met the last witness who told me in which direction they were gone—I ran on and caught sight of them again—I am quite sure they are the men I first saw—when I heard the whistle I was only about three or four yards off—I examined the window of Mr. Miners', and saw that the bar had been forced out of the socket, and some of the shutters were down—it seemed as if something had been put in behind the bar to press it out, as it had sprung—a small piece of wood was forced out from the post where the end of the bar was let in—the shutters were all right when I passed the house 5 minutes before—I had seen Phillips close to the spot at about 11 o'clock the night before.</p>

On Wednesday morning, 30th June, I was on duty in Church-street, Woolwich, about three quarters of a mile from Greens-end—I saw the prisoner Phillips, at 20 minutes past 3, sitting down outside a door-way—as soon as I made towards him he got up and gave a call—he came along with his hands in his coat pockets, and appeared to be intoxicated—I turned round and took no notice of him—he passed me in the direction of the London-road—I remained there till half-past 3, when the sergeant came up with another constable—I afterwards took them into custody—I told them there had been a shutter bar taken down in Greens-end—they both said they knew nothing, about it, they had just come from Chatham.</p>

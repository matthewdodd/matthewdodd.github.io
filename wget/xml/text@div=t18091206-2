On the 6th of February last I retired to rest about eleven o'clock at night, and as I supposed about two or three o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise, I attributed it, however, to some company going away from the next house; it did not induce me to arise.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of - A. Myself and wife, and I think at that time there were three maid servants sleeping in the house, and the children.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what state your house was in when you went to bed, as to its fastenings - A. I did not particularly examine it that night, I remained till about seven o'clock in the morning, when one of my servants knocked at my door, and informed me that the house had been robbed; I immediately went down stairs, I found the kitchen in disorder, the drawers of the dresser being open.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose then it was quite light - A. It was then quite day light, and the door on the side of the house, leading out into the yard, was open; I concluded they went out that way; there was no marks of violence there. I missed several things, a great coat, half a dozen pair of boots, and two gowns belonging to my wife, a wine strainer and some silver spoons; I had a servant of the name of Ive, she informed me that she had lost a considerable quantity of wearing apparel. Upon this; after I had dressed myself, I went into the fore court, where I discovered a small iron bar which goes across the outside of the laundry window was forced away, it had been fastened on by screws, it appeared to have been wrenched off; I rather suppose that the inside shutter had been neglected to be fastened, besides that there were two little mortise bolts which fastened the window down at the bottom; I apprehended the bolts had not been properly put in; and when this little bar was moved, which was the centre bar of three bars, the window would open, and that is the way they easily could enter. The cross bar was in the center of the two others, and I think there was room enough for a man to go through between the two others. The laundry communicates to the kitchen and the lower part of the house, the laundry was in the front, and the kitchen at the back of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard the noise in the night what quarter of the house did that noise seem to you to come from - A. I awoke in the night; it was not sufficient for me to tell where it was; the impression on my mind was that it was a step of a carriage being put down. On the top of the kitchen stairs there is a door always fastened every night by an iron bar, that prevented their getting up stairs. With regard to the property being stolen, I have seen some of it since.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 6th of February what time did you go to bed - A.About half past ten or eleven; before I went to bed I fastened the outer doors, and the door in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the lower windows of the house, did you look at them - A.The shutter on the inside of this window was not fast, owing to the iron bar being lost; I cannot say whether the window was bolted down or not; I saw all the cross bars safe in the course of the day, and all the lower windows in the rest of the house were fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the door of the yard was fastened when you went to bed - A. Yes; I looked at it the last thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning - A.About seven o'clock; Mary Hatfield, the house maid, was up first.</p>
               <p>Q. You got up at seven, it was light then - A. No; it was getting light; I was just coming down, the house maid came up to me and said there had been thieves in the house. When I went down stairs I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060004"></xptr>found this door open, I missed two gowns, a yellow one and a dark one, and I lost several caps, and other things; I left them on the over night on the dresser in the kitchen; my master's coat was hanging on the kitchen door; and six or seven pair of boots were behind the door. I saw the middle bar of the laundry window wrenched off; it was left hanging at one end.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Ray, of No. 344, Strand—on the evening of the 26th of Feb. I saw the prisoners, in company with three others, between eleven and twelve at night, at the corner of Mr. Weston'a shop, at the corner of Parker-street and Little Queen-street; the door is in Queen-street—I believe it to be Ryan who I saw go round the corner—in a few minutes he returned with something to the others, and di<lb></lb>rectly he came back they all scampered past me, and said, "Make haste, or we shall be caught"—they ran down Cross-lane and stopped there—I am sure Bryan was one of the party—they then went into Charles-street, and stopped at a door—as soon as they saw me come they made a noise in the passage, and all five of them ran into a house and up stairs—a policeman came—I told him—he got a light, went up stairs, and brought the two prisoners down, who I recognized to have been with the other three.</p>

I received information, and went with Fitzpatrick to a house in Charles-street between eleven and twelve on Sunday, the 26th of Feb., and apprehended the two prisoners in the first floor back room, one in each bed—when they saw me they seemed very much confused—I desired them to get up, that they had stolen some cigars—they denied all knowledge of it—on searching the room I found a small box, containing eight cheroots, and about eight loose ones—on looking out of window I saw this box lying bottom upwards, and soome loose cheroots round it—I did not find any more boys in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. What money had you about you? - A. I had three half-guineas, a guinea and some silver; I believe a half-crown, some shillings and some sixpences; the officer had the money that was picked up given to him; I had not a farthing remaining in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon before had you seen your money? - A. I paid three hundred and twenty pounds into my banker's, Child's, not half an hour before I went, and when I got to the theatre, I very incautiously pulled out my money and looked at it at the door, and I apprehend the prisoner saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted none of this money had any marks by which you should know it again? - A. No, I believe it to be mine only from the sum, three half-guineas I know I had, and a guinea.</p>

             sworn. - I am a manufacturer of Derbyshire spar; I was going into Drury-lane theatre about six o'clock, the entrance to the pit door was extremely crowded; I observed Mr. Williams in company with two ladies, the ladies were a little before Mr. Williams; Mr. Williams was on my left hand, I was close to the wall on the right hand, the prisoner was exactly between us; Mr. Williams, the prisoner, and myself, were endeavouring to keep the crowd behind us from pressing upon the ladies; in the course of a few seconds, Mr. Williams put his hand down to his right-hand breeches-pocket, and exclaimed, my God, I have had my pocket picked, several people heard him besides myself; I told him, I had seen a little gentleman that was between us in a brown coat, go back; in consequence of this, we left the crowd and pursued him, several people, at the same time, crying out, he is there, he is there; upon going from the pit door, I observed the prisoner about the middle of the colonade, Mr. Williams was a few yards before me; the prisoner turned the corner of the colonade, I was then about six yards from the prisoner, he looked round, and at the moment that Mr. Williams was going to seize him, at that instant, I saw him drop out of his hand some money; Mr. Williams immediately seized him, he then took up half-a-guinea and put it into my hand; I searched among the dirt, and took up two half-guineas and some silver; while I was doing this, the prisoner was put into the possession of, I believe, two constables; we took him to a public-house in Bow-street; I had not the money out of my hand till I gave it into the hands of the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. That money that you had in your hand was a guinea, was it not? - A. The half-guinea that Mr. Williams picked up, two half-guineas that I picked up, and a friend of mine picked up a guinea, and put it into my hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you take up any silver? - A. I did, but I cannot say what.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. The prisoner was walking at the time you saw him, and he dropped some money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then I take it for granted you will not do more than the prosecuter has done, you will not swear to the money? - A. No, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see him do any thing with his feet? - A. No.</p>

               <p>JOHN VAUGHAN sworn. - I am a manufacturer of Derbyshire spat; I happened to be going through Russel-street, I saw a crowd collected, I immediately looked into it, and saw the prisoner at the bar in custody of two officers; I rushed in amongst them, and enquired what was the matter, Mr. Cooper was then in the act of picking up money from the mud; I assisted him in that, and I picked up a guinea, what other money he picked up I am not certain, but I believe a sixpence, and a half-guinea; the prisoner was then taken to the public-house, in Bow-street.</p>

               <p>- THOMPSON sworn. - On Thursday the 1st of May, about ten minutes before six, I was on duty at Drury-lane theatre; I was standing at the pit door, the people were going in very fast; I saw a man pushing out from the house, towards the street, which I believe was the prisoner at the bar; he turned to the right and went towards Drury-lane; soon after, I saw other persons follow him, Mr. Williams was one of them; he asked if I was an officer, and ordered me to take the prisoner into custody, which I did; I immediately searched him, I found in his pocket a handkerchief, a pair of gloves, and some shillings, which the magistrate ordered me to return him, I then took him to the Brown-bear; Mr. Williams and Mr. Cooper soon after came to the Brown-bear, and Mr. Cooper delivered to me a guinea, three half-guineas, a half-crown piece, one shilling and two sixpences. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I was going to Drury-lane theatre, and was violently crushed, in consequence of which I drew back, and standing against the farther end of the colonade, Mr. Williams came up and charged me with picking his pocket, says I, sir, I believe you are mistaken, says he, why, here is my money, catching me by the collar; says I, it cannot be my money, and how it came here I do not know; says he, you are endeavouring to hide it, says he, what are you stirring your foot at; says I, sir, I see something lye there, and I suppose you would stir your foot to see what it was; Mr. Cooper came up at the time, and caught me by the collar, and likewise picked up some money; I was given in charge to Mr. Beresford, the officer, and taken to the Brown-hear; that is all I know about the mat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280023"></xptr>ter; I positively deny any thing of the charge alledged against me; I am entirely innocent, and in your hands I trust my cause.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

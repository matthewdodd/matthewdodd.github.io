On Tuesday morning, 3d May, about a quarter-past 2 o'clock, I was in Attwood's-lane, Kensington, and heard a noise, as of glass breaking—I then heard footsteps, and saw the prisoners come out of a field into the lane—I stopped them, and asked what they were doing—Uppell said, "What odds is that to you?"—I was in plain clothes—Uppell had a bag on his back—I asked him what he had got; he refused to tell me—I told him that I would know—he asked me what I was; I told him I was a police-constable—he asked me where my authority was; I showed him my card, but he was not satisfied—I told him I should take him to the station—he said that if he went there he should be locked up, and refused to go—this was right under a gas-lamp—Watson stood at his side facing me—Uppell said, "Will you take a cab to go to the station?"—I said, "No, it is only three minutes' walk"—he wanted Watson to go with him, but Watson said, "I shall stop here till you come back"—I asked him what he had got in the bag—he said, "Some old plate"—I asked him where he got it—he said that some gentleman gave it to him down the road—I asked him where the gentleman lived—he said, "I do not know"—I said I should take him to the station—he refused to go, and asked me if I would allow him to speak to his friend for a moment—I said "Yes," and as he was speaking to him be put his hand into his pocket and pulled out this card-case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with cards in it, and passed it to the other prisoner—I took it from him, upon which Uppell struck me on the mouth, took me by the hair of my head, and dashed my head against the post of a fence—I sprang my rattle, and Seymour, another constable, came and assisted me—I took Uppell to the station, and found some other property on him—he was taken before a Magistrate, and remanded—after that, on the 5th, I was at the House of Detention, and Watson came there to see Uppell—I knew him as soon as he put his head inside the door—I spoke to Sergeant Clark, and took Watson in custody—Hereford-square is forty or fifty yards from where I saw the prisoners, and they were coming from the square—Watson escaped over the fence, and went towards Hereford square again.</p>

               <p>the conversation was four or five minutes taking place—Watson was dressed as he is now, and had a sort of <hi rend="italic">Billy-cock</hi> hat, which concealed part of his face—Watson was taker, in custody as soon as he had seen Uppell in the prison—he asked at first for Uppell before I identified him; I heard him ask before I thought he was the man—he was about ten minutes with Uppell, and when he came out I told the sergeant to take him—I have been eleven months in the police—I have never had a case of identity before.</p>

On the 2nd of June the prisoner Larner came into the yard about four o'clock, and asked me if any thing had come—I said, "Yes"—he went up the yard to the dwelling-house, and on the ground floor of the house there was some clover and straw—that was what I meant—it had recently come to the premises—I afterwards saw Larner moving the straw, and saw two or three trusses of the clover at the street-door—I told him he should put that in the passage, and he said, "Yes"—I then went away—he put it out at the street-door—I thought it had no business there, and told him to put it in the passage, which was within the house—Larner worked on the premises—he was in master's employ—he was putting the clover a little to rights, to clear it away to cut it—he was employed to cut it, but did not cut any—he put it out into the street—I did not know there was any intention of it being taken away—there was not much room on the ground floor to cut it.</p>

I apprehended Dimock in the prosecutor's shop—I had seen him at the Bull public-house, where he brought in two trusses of clover—I said nothing to him then, but when the second truss was brought, I followed them—the other prisoner helped him in with it, and held the public-house door open for him—I followed them, and saw them go into the prosecutor's house, which is about 200 yards off—I knocked at the door, and asked if Mr. Saunders was at home—he came down stairs, and I asked him if he had given these men orders to move his clover hay—he said he did not know he had any men on the premises—the prisoners said they had not taken any hay into the Bull—I have the hay on my premises at home.</p>

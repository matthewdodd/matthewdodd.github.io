On the 5th of June, I sent my apprentice to the prisoner's house to buy a last; he came back and gave me information - I sent my second apprentice to see if it was true; he came back and fetched me - I found six lasts, which I told the prisoner were mine; he said,"If they are take them," but his wife would not allow me without a search-warrant - I went away, and was obliged to attend the Westminster Sessions, and could not go till the Friday; I went to him again on the Saturday, with an officer, but while I was away, on the Friday, one pair of lasts were sent to my house - when I got to the prisoner's house, I found the lasts in the yard, and he said he could bring a man whom he bought them of; the officer told him to fetch him, which he did - we asked him if he had sold the prisoner any lasts; he said Yes, hundreds, and he could swear to every last he sold him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What took you to the Westminster Sessions? A. I went to give a man a character - he told me that Lawrence had sold him hundreds of lasts; there was no mark on these, but there is an old one here I know, which I would not take a hundred new ones for.</p>
               <p>HART LEVY. I am apprentice to Mr. Myers. On the 5th of June, I went to buy a last, and found some of my master's there - I saw one pair lying on the shelf, and went and told my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have been in that shop often, buying things? A. Yes; I have told him I came from Mr. Myers - I bought one pair for three half-pence.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with a warrant to the prisoner's house; Myers asked where the two pairs of lasts were - he took me to the back yard, and showed them to me, quite away from the others; he said he bought them of Lawrence, who had sold him a great many - his wife went and fetched Lawrence; I would not let him see the lasts, till we got before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>GEORGE LAWRENCE. I have sold a great many lasts to the prisoner, but I never sold him these - he keeps a grinder's shop; he sells a great many lasts - I would not give more than 6d. for these; I should not wonder if there were half a cart load of lasts in his shop.</p>

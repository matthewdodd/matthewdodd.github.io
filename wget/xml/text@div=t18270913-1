On the 12th of July, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, as I was in the field adjoining my house, I heard the bolt of one of the doors of the house creak, and went round to see who was there, as I knew nobody was at home - my daughter had gone out. I saw the prisoner come away from the house, with a bundle under his arm; he came away from the house - I did not see him come out of the door: he was about twenty yards from the house when I first saw him. I asked him what he had got there - he said what he had got was his own: I told him I knew the handkerchief the bundle was tied up in; he then made his escape into the road, with the bundle: I went up to him - he asked if it was my property; I told him it was- he pulled out part of one of the gowns, and asked me if I knew that; he gave the bundle a shove towards me, and said, "Take it, and say nothing about it;" I took the bundle, and he took to his heels and ran - I ran after him, hallooing Stop thief! some hay-makers in the field stopped him in my sight; I am sure he is the man - he was never out of my sight. I found in the bundle two gowns, a shirt, and a handkerchief; I gave them to the constable; my daughter had gone out of the house after me. I had left it about nine o'clock in the morning, and had not been home afterwards. I went back to the house, and found one of the ground-floor windows open, and the other half open; there was room for any body to get in: I heard the door open as he came out. I fetched my daughter, who had gone out after me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not come back, and bring you the bundle? A. As soon as I took it you ran.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not come back out of my, way to give you the bundle? A. No, you was going that way - you stopped when I met you; I was in the yard, and you was going along the road - you did not come back to me; I did not see you before you came from the house with the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. After you went to look for your daughter, did not you see a man, and ask him if he was the person who had been with me? A. No; I never said I saw a man running and asked why he ran, and that he said because he heard a cry of Stop thief!</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter-in-law. On the 12th of July I went out about ten o'clock, leaving nobody in the house. When I left the house the windows were both nailed down; I bolted all the doors - I went out at the front door, which I locked, and took the key with me- I was fetched back by my father, and found one window partly open, and the other quite so; he had got into the wash-house, and broke the middle door open. I lost two gowns, a shirt, and a handkerchief, which I had seen safe in the drawers that day.</p>

            . I am a constable. I produce two gowns, a shirt, and a handkerchief, which were brought to my house with the prisoner, by* the prosecutor and some haymakers - I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are the things in the same state as when you received them? A. Yes; they are the same things - the gown has not been washed; nothing has been done to them: they have not been out of my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear the prosecutor say he saw a man running, and asked if he knew any thing of the robbery? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Three days before I met this man I was in Oxford-street, and met one Milton, a Devonshire man - he asked where I came from: I told him: he asked if I knew one Milton; I said Yes - he said he was his father, and asked me to go and drink some beer; we went to Hyde-park, and had the beer, opposite Tyburn-gate; he said, "How are you off for blunt?" I said I was rather short: he said he had some money coming to him, if I would go with him to-morrow, a few shillings might be of service to me. We went round to several houses; he came out of a house, and said he had received 1s. 6d., and was to call again on Thursday; he then asked me to go to his lodgings, where he had left some clothes; I went: he said, "I am going across to this house, where I lodge, for my things - you wait there till I come back;" I waited a considerable time, and then went up; the gate was open: I turned to my right, into the little garden - he came out with the bundle, and said, "These are my clothes - I wish you would take them - I will overtake you - I am going a little way;" and as I came out across the yard, this man called to me, and said, "Halloo! what have you there?" I said, "Nothing belonging to you I believe;" he said, "I wish you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130004"></xptr>would bring it back and let me see;" I went back to him, about the length of this Court, and said, "Look at it, and see if this is any thing of your's; take it;" he opened the handkerchief, and said, "Here are some things I can swear to;" I said, "Take hold of them;" he directly called Stop thief; I acknowledge that I ran then, and was surrounded in less than five minutes; he says he saw me coming out of the house.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Edgeware-road—the prisoner was in my service for seven weeks—I engaged her to attende on my wife, who has been confined to her bed nine months; but she did every thing I required of her—I discharged her for something, and when she left she took away a bundle—after she was gone I missed some aprons and towels, and a great quantity of articles—she came back about one o'clock with a man, and demanded her wages—I asked him who he was—he said he was nothing to her, but he had known her—and from seeing a man of that description come with her, I questioned her if she had any thing of mine—I had before that found some butter in a drawer in the kitchen, mixed with some kitchen fat or dripping, which had been melted down it was an open drawer—I asked her how she came by that—she said she got it out of some empty tubs which were in the yard—I put empty tubs out in the yard, but they are always scraped and weighed before the tub leaves the shop, as we are allowed a weight for the tub, and weigh it to see that the allowance is right—the tubs are all thoroughly cleared before they leave the shop—I asked if she had got the key of her box—she said she had not, she had left it behind her—I said I insisted on seeing her box open—she became agitated, and at last produced the key from her basket; and in the box which she had not removed I found a clothes-brush with my name on it—I gave her into custody—I afterwards went and examined the linen, and found I had lost nearly every thing I had got—I returned to the station-house, and searched the box again, in the presence of the police<lb></lb>man—I found four of my aporns, which had been altered, and made into female's aprons—my sister-in-law had mended them the week before, and can prove they are mine—my wife had made them, but she is too ill to attend—the prisoner said she intended to have sold the butter on Monday for kitchen stuff—I have missed a great quantity of butter—I asked her if she had over sold butter before—she said, "Yes, three or four timer"—butter that is unfit for use is always sold in the shop as scrapings—I did not allow her to sell kitchen stuff—the aprons are worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I have examined them, and found there where four pairs of strings have been taken off—they are made of linen.</p>

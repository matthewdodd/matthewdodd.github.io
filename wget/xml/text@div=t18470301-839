I was in company with another policeman, about five o'clock in the evening of the 14th of Jan., in Old Kent-road—I saw the two prisoners together—I followed them till about half-past six o'clock—they passed and re-passed several shops—I saw them come to Mr. Lake's, a furniture-dealers, by the Bricklayers' Arms—they passed and re-passed—they were still together—I then saw an arm reach down two chairs, which were resting on a couch parlty inside—Smith, the officer, ran across the road, and the prisoner, Wilson, ran towards me—I caught him in my arms, and he fell under the belly of a horse—he had nothing with him—he began to kick me over the legs and thighs—I saw that he ran from Mr. Lake's shop—I charged him with stealing two chairs—he made no reply—I then asked if he understood what I said—he said he did not understand it at all.</p>

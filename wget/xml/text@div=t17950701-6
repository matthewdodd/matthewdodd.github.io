            Where did she sit down? - In the tap room; and the pot was standing on the table; while she was sitting I missed it, and as she went out I followed her, and about three doors off I tapped her over the shoulder, and told her I should be glad to speak to her, I thought she had got some of my property about her; and she went to take the pot out of her pocket, I laid hold of her hand and stopped her from taking it out of her pocket; I told her the constable should take it out. I sent for a constable, and he took it out of her pocket in my house, in my presence.(The pot produced.) This is the pot that was taken out of her pocket, it was marked directly afterwards; here is the mark on it now.</p>

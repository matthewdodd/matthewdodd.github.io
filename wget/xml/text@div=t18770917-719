                  </hi>. I have been book-keeper to Mr. Hall, the prosecutor, nearly six years—I produce his day-book and ledger—the prisoner has dealt with Mr. Hall since 18th July, 1871—on 26th May, 1874, the prisoner gave me this acceptance for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is his writing; it is entered to the prisoner's account as a payment on 26th May in the ledger—it next appears in the books on 29th September, 1874, when it was dishonoured—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is the delivery-book, by which I find that seven hides were received by the prisoner on 17th August, price 42<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on 18th August, five hides and six dozen of straps 167. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and on 25th August, five brown hides and five enamel hides 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they are all signed by Todd—on 28th August, here is "J.

Acting on Mr. Hall's instructions I drafted out this bill of exchange produced—this is his signature as the drawer, and Todd's as acceptor—the bills when I received them were generally paid into the banking account—this bill was paid in with three or four others—I afterwards received it back from the bank dishonoured—it came by post—it was drawn on 7th December, the letter contained nothing but the bill—after that further goods were supplied to Todd—I never knew of an execu<lb></lb>tion being put into Mr. Hall's house.</p>

I am the prosecutor, and am a leather dealer at 29, Langham Road, Bermondsey—I think the first business transaction I had with the prisoner was on 18th July, 1871—I used to sell him enamel hides and straps—he generallj' paid once a week in cash; that continued for a time and afterwards I gave him credit—he gave me this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for goods supplied to him—I do not know whether it was met; I left everything to my book-keeper—I applied to Todd for the amount due to me in September, 1874, 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had a long talk with him respect<lb></lb>ing what he owed—he said he could not do anything for me at present as his landlord had been so kind to him as to let him come back to that place, that he must pay him first, but he would do something for me—I said I must have a bill or money, I must have it somehow or other; he would not give me a bill then—I subsequently received this letter from him, it is in</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If I had said such a thing it would have been a sad mis<lb></lb>take—I was in the service of a gentleman named Matthews, of 87 and 88, Great Russell Street, Berraondsey, before I went into business for myself—I left his service six years ago, I should think; I cannot tell you whether it was about November, 1870—I gave him notice because he ran from his word which he had promised me, that was the only cause that I know of my leaving, that I swear—I do not remember anything about six hides delivered to Warne—I used to have a delivery-book when in his service, a receipt-book with the goods in it—Mr. Matthews did not discharge me, decidedly not, I swear that—I saw that one of my receipt-books had a page torn out, that was shortly before I left the service, when I was pressing Mr. Matthews to carry out his agreement; he showed me the leaf, but what has that to do with me—he had several interviews with me on the matter, and we went to find it out, even to the printer, who made the book—Mr. Matthews made some remarks, but I cannot say that he complained, what nonsense?—Mr. Matthews complained that I had not accounted for six hides, which were delivered to Warne, and I went, I should think, twenty times to Warne to settle it, and got a paper from Mr. Warne to prove that the hides were never delivered to him—Air. Matthews did not point out to me a piece of the leaf remaining in this book—I cannot say whether this is the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); I cannot say from the entries, as there were so, many of these books in use when I was there; I should not like to swear this is the book this is the first I have heard of it since I left Mr. Matthews, and I thought it was cleared up—I told Mr. Matthews that the hides had been delivered to Warne—Mr. Matthews never discharged me; I know he is here—I fancy I took the bill for 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Mr. Todd when I went to see him after re<lb></lb>ceiving the letter, and f left him the memorandum—I went to see him, I believe, in November about the small bill of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd which had been over<lb></lb>due some months—I will swear to anything I know—I may have asked him to pay the bill of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we say always that we must have some money—I</p>

               <p>to get Mr. Matthews to take up the bill, nothing of the kind—I had never heard of it before—I do not remember hearing it at the police-court—Mogg did not tell me that he had endeavoured to sell the bill to Matthews for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not tell me that he had told Matthews that it was an accom<lb></lb>modation bill, but the third party could recover upon it—I think the only conversation I heard about the bill was that Matthews was there one day, and they took up this bill in the way of a joke and some remark passed about accommodation, and then Mr. Mogg said "Oh, I know better than that," because he audited my books and collected my debts—Mogg never bought any of my bills—Mogg said something to me about Mr. Matthews saying "Oh, it is only accommodation"—I do not know how long that was after the became due—it is no use to ask me questions like that—I think the conversation was at the time I mentioned, I paid a visit into Mr. Todd.</p>

"I understood that you would send for it"—I said "Not likely, it would never pay me to send here every week for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., you must send it to my office?"—he said "I will do so"—I then replied "There are three instalments due now, will you pay me those?"—he replied "I cannot"—I said "Will you pay any of them?—he said "I have just been across the water and have laid out all my money"—I said "I cannot take that excuse, besides there is your acceptance what are you going to do about that?"—he replied "When I accepted the bill, Mr. Hall gave me the undertaking, if I could not meet it he would take it up"—I said "Well he has taken it up, and here it is (<hi rend="italic">showing it him</hi>), and you must make some arrangement about its pay<lb></lb>ment?"—he said "Well, I cannot pay more than 1 am paying"—I said "As a matter of fact you are paying nothing, but if you were to keep up your engagement, it would be three years at this rate before that bill would get paid, that won't do!"—he replied "I cannot do impossibilities"—I said "I don't suppose you can, but—you must make some better offer then that?"—after considering a minute he said "Well, look up on Saturday, and see me on Saturday and I will pay you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then, and I will see what arrange<lb></lb>ment I can make about the bill"—I said "Very well, I will call up between 1 and 2 o'clock"—I called at his place of business about 1 o'clock on Satur<lb></lb>day; he was not there, I waited there three hours for him, but he did not come back, and I left my card with one of the men—on the following Mon<lb></lb>day, 26th April, he sent me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., reducing the amount to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I called about three weeks afterwards and Mr. Todd had then gone away and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew that this action was proceeding against Mr. Todd in the Civil Court, and that while it was proceeding, and before Mr. Todd's costs were paid, a summons was taken out at the police-court against him—I was present at the pulice-court on the first hearing, and saw Mr. Fulton there—I instructed the solicitors in regard to the civil proceedings; the same solicitors are acting in the criminal proceedings—at the first hear<lb></lb>ing at the police-court Mr. Fulton objected that the summons could not be gone into while the civil action was pending—it was after that that the solicitors paid Mr. Todd's costs, and discontinued the action—I have never seen Mr. Matthews about the bill—I have seen Mr. Matthews, and con<lb></lb>versed with him about the bill, about a fortnight after the writ was issued—I never had a conversation with Mr. Matthews about the bill before the civil proceedings commenced—I saw Mr. Matthews scores of times after the bill was in my hands, before the civil proceedings were issued—I col<lb></lb>lected Mr. Matthews' accounts, or attend to any bankruptcy matters for him—Mr. Matthews said he knew it was an accommodation bill—he did not use the words "It is worthless"—he said Mr. Hall would not dare go into Court with it because it was an accommodation bill—I did not offer to sell the bill at all—I have had other bills of Mr. Hall's left in my hands for eighteen months at the time; I have several at this time in my office—I believe it was taken down in ray depositions that Todd said he would pay me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and he would see what he could do about the bill—they were read over to me—I cannot say whether anything was read over to me about what he said about seeing about the bill—I have not a copy of the depositions.</p>

                  </hi>. In 1874 I was in Mr. Todd's employ—on one occasion I was instructed to communicate with Mr. Hall about some bides he had left and did so—the hides were afterwards taken away, I believe, by Mr. Hall in a van—I recollect a conversation about the charges for some hides—Mr. Todd complained to Mr. Hall of the excessive charge and said he could not carry on business if he paid such a heavy price for his goods—Mr. Hall said he was obliged to charge heavily for being behind hand; I do not exactly remember the words—I told Mr. Hall from what I understood of the price of hide I thought it was a very excessive charge—I have heard Mr. Todd complain to Mr. Hall on more than one occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know just a little about hides, but not so far as to constitute me a judge of their value—the price would depend upon the quality—I think the conversation I have spoken of was in July, 1874—after the hides were taken away others were supplied by Mr. Hall, but in the meantime Mr. Todd purchased one at Mr. Franklyn's to go on with—I do not know whether they were supplied at the same price—prices varied according to the size—I do not think complaints of overcharges were made so much after that.</p>

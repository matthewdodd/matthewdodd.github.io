               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know his person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him on the 10th of November last? - A. Yes, between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask if it was quite dark? - A. It was quite dark; I was at work in the shop, and I heard some noise above at the shop-window; I listened to hear what it was about, and I heard some lads say, you shove the glass in, and I will take the things out.</p>
               <p>Q. What glass did you conceive them to be speaking of? - A. The glass of the shop-window; I came up stairs, and saw a piece of glass shoved in, and nobody near the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any breaking of glass? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the pane of glass any time before? - A. I saw it at dusk, about five o'clock; it was unbroken then.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very clear about that? - A. Yes; I went down stairs again, and then heard somebody come again; I went up stairs again, and perceived a hand in at a pane of glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a man's hand? - A. No, it was a boy's hand; it was that very lad's hand; I immediately went out-side the door, and saw him with his hand still inside the glass; as soon as he took some things out he saw me, and ran away, and as he ran he threw some things into the kennel.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him do that? - A. Yes; I then caught him, and brought him back to the shop; I went with him again to where he threw the things away, and made him pick them up; he gave them into my hand, and I took him back to the shop; I then went for a constable; he was searched; the glass was cut with a diamond, and some things taken out a week before; it was the same pane of glass; it had been made fast again with putty.</p>
               <p>Q. The putty was removed, and then the glass shoved in? - A. Yes; the constable found upon him a tea-ladle, which we had lost the week before.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the things found upon him? - A. Only a tea-ladle.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that was picked up? - A. Six gilt pins; the constable has them.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it at the top of the pane, or the bottom? - A. At the top.</p>

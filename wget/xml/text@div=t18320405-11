On Friday evening, the 30th of March, about seven o'clock, I saw a man, in company with another, looking through the window; I believe it was the prisoner Whitehall who was looking, and on being observed by me, they both walked away - Whitehall shortly returned, and a person came into the shop; in consequence of what he said, our young man went out in pursuit - he returned without seeing anybody; I examined the window, and missed a gold neck-chain which I had seen the day before hanging in the window - 
I had not noticed it that day; I found the corner of a square of glass, about the centre of the window, which was cracked before, was pushed in - the putty must have been loosened by some instrument and the piece pushed in or broken; I saw the piece laying inside - it had fallen on some seals and cracked; the space was sufficiently large to admit two fingers - I had observed the window that afternoon about five o'clock; the piece was not out then - ours is a double window; Farrant, the officer, came on the Monday, and produced a gold neck 
chain, which I knew to be ours.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You believe Whitehall to be the man who looked in at the window? A. Yes, the alarm was given about five minutes past seven o'clock; I had been in the shop for a quarter of an hour, but heard nothing to attract my attention - I heard no glass fall: it was fastened with very old putty, and was very firm - ours is a noisy neighbourhood; a great many carriages pass.</p>

            . I manage the business of my father, who is a gold refiner, in Princes-street, Leicester-square. On Friday, the 30th of March, a young man came to our shop- I cannot form a judgment of who he was; he came within a few minutes of half-past seven o'clock, and produced a gold neck-chain - I did not buy it then; he came a second time, and 1 weighed it - it was 2 ozs. 6 grs.; I bought it of him at 50s. an ounce, which is the value of the gold - it came to 5l. 1s.; that is the value, independent of the fashion and make; he was alone - I paid him a 5l. bank note and a shilling; I should know the note again - it was No. 26,908, dated the 17th of February; Farrant, the officer, came into my shop in less than two minutes after the transaction, and immediately went out after the man - he came again, and I delivered him the chain.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On Friday afternoon, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw both the prisoners in company together in Princes-street, Leicester-square, walking up and down the street several times; and suspecting, I watched them - I observed Whitehall cross the road towards Smart's shop; I did not see him go in, but lost sight of him for a few minutes - he returned to Rogers; they then walked up the street together several times, then came and stood in front of Smart's shop, on the opposite side, for a minute or two; I then saw Whitehall cross the road and go into Smart's shop - Rogers remained on the opposite side; Whitehall came out in a few minutes, and joined Rogers again - they both went up Princes-street; I then went into Smart's, and made inquiry, then went after them, and watched them into a public-house at the corner of Compton-street, and went for assistance - when I returned they had just gone out into Wardour-street, where I saw them both in company; they turned round, saw me, and separated - I secured Whitehall, and gave him into custody, then went in pursuit of Rogers, and took him in Pulteney-street; I took them to St. Ann's watch-house, and on searching Whitehall, I found three sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, two shillings, and a knife, which is used for cutting glass - it is cut off sharp at the point; I have found many of them on prisoners who were in the habit of starring the glaze - I went to Smart's in about a quarter of an hour, and got the chain; I went to the public-house I had watched them to, and Ann Glandfield produced a note to me - I took the number of it, and left it in her possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your beat about Princes-street? A. I have no beat; I go where I like in our division -Princes-street is about three quarters of a mile from Beton's house, which is opposite Day and Martin's.</p>

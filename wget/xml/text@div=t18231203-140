            . I am a dress-maker; the prisoner had been out of place three days, and lodged with me. On the 1st of December we had been to a party, and were going home about eleven o'clock, and as we passed the Blue Posts, the two witnesses were at the door; one of them, and I believe both, caught hold of the prisoner and asked her in, to have half a pint of gin; I wished her not to go - she did not at first, but they caught hold of her and forced her in, and used very ill language at the door. The prisoner then called for half a pint of gin - both the witnesses partook of it: they stood outside the bar; and they called for another half-pint - I drank none of it. There was a quarrel in the tap-room; Hall and Probin were very much intoxicated, and could scarcely walk - the prisoner was only a little so. The patrol came in, and turned these three women out of the bar (Hall, Probin, and the prisoner); the prisoner had gone into the bar with them in consequence of the quarrel - they were asked in by the waiter - he officiated as landlord; it was the witness, Richard Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out, what was done? - A. Two men caught hold of the prisoner, and brought her back. I did not go back with her, for the door was shut - I went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you live - A. At No. 20, Lower George-street, Sloane-square; we had been to an Irish club, at a public-house in Brewer-street - it was a dance; a man was going over to Ireland; each person pays a shilling, to help him over; I am an Irishwoman. The prisoner had lived servant with Mrs. Coles, in the neighbourhood. She did not tell me what money she had.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did she not say she only had 18 d. - A. No. She mentioned something about it at the watch-house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030056"></xptr>door. I said I did not think she had much money - I did not know how much she had. She was charged with stealing money.

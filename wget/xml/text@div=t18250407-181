On the 17th of March, about eight o'clock in the morning, I missed a piece of sheet brass from a hole in the shop; I had seen it safe about a fortnight before. While the prisoner was gone to breakfast the foreman told me there was something very mysterious in his conduct, and when he returned I asked him what had become of the sheet brass, which had been in the nail room - he said he had not taken it; I said if he did not produce it I would send for an officer; he then said he would fetch it from the nail room; he attempted to go, and I followed him - when he got about half way, he turned back, and begged I would let him go and fetch it; I told him I knew he had taken it, and I would know where it was: he said he had taken it home: I sent for an officer, and went with him to Callwell-buildings, and in the room where his mother said she lived, we found a rule, a thousand of nails, and two half thousands in the papers, with my private mark on them, in an old tin kettle in the cupboard, and the sheet brass was hid under some old clothes in a beds'ead - he had been with me about a month; I had a good character with him.</p>

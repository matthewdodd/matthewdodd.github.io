            . I am a watchman of St. Giles', and have known the prisoner some time. I saw him on the night in question in George-street, St. Giles', with a livery coat under his right arm; I pursued him, and he ran as fast as he could up George-street; a woman pushed me off the pavement, and said, "Go along Paddy" - the conductor picked up a coat similar to the one I had seen him with, in the direction in which he ran.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ROBERTS. Q. How long have you known him? A. Two years. He was walking fast; the coat had yellow across the cape; he was two or three yards from me - the gas was lighted; I sprang my rattle, and he ran away - it was hanging down under his right arm; I saw his face. I do not know where the coat was picked up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the prisoner by sight? A. Yes - he was then carrying a livery coat. I have seen him frequently at all hours of the night.</p>

            . I am conductor of the patrol. I was coming down George-street - the watchman came from his box and sprung his rattle; I went down Currier-street, and picked up this coat. I did not see the prisoner - I took him on the 13th, in Church-lane, by the watchman's description; I asked if he knew anything about a box coat; he said No - that he had slept that night in Leg-alley, Long-acre.</p>

            . I had been to the Theatre with a friend of mine, and as I was coming up Hampshire-hog-yard I saw a short stout man with a black or a blue coat, knee breeches, and white stocking; he was running, and some others after him - when every one had passed by me I saw this coat laying on the ground; I saw two patrols on the other side of the way, and I called them and gave it to them - they said, "We will find an owner for it."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where had you been? A. To the Theatre, with a young man, who had left me before I saw the coat; I live at No. 17, Church-street, St. Giles'. I think I heard a cry of Stop thief! and a watchman was running after the man, about ten or twelve yards after him. I am a stay-maker, and work for a person in High-street, Mary-le-bone. I did not see the prisoner there - he lives three or four doors from me - I do not know his number - I think it is No. 13 or 14 - I had never spoken to him. - The coat was picked up in Church-street, opposite Hampshire-hog-yard - it was about twenty or thirty yards from his door, perhaps - I think it was Price I called, and gave him the coat. I did not go before the Magistrate.</p>

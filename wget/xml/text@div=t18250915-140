I then took him into the glass room, and said "There is something about you I don't admire - have you any thing in your pockets?" he said No; I said I would see, and I found a wine glass and a foot tumbler, in his left pocket, and a cut pint decanter in his right; he seemed much confused, and said he did not know how they came there. He has certainly borne a good character.</p>

             the prosecutor has two wharfs; I was at one wharf and the other clerk at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120025"></xptr>other; on the 9th of December between the hours of six and seven in the evening as I came in at the gate I saw the two prisoners come out with this sugar.</p>

               <p>What quantity of sugar did you see them coming out with? - Three loaves and one lump.</p>
               <p>It belonged to Mr. Sinclair did it? - He had the charge of it, it was in his possession.</p>
               <p>Did you stop them? - No; I think the first said, as the people would not pay for the sugar they would take it back. I thought they had been on board a ship with the sugar, and that the master not being on board they were carrying it back again; they were stopped with the sugar by Isaacs and Jenkins; I counted the sugar twice over on the wharf and found three loaves and a lump were missing.</p>

C. Aberdeen; there were three loaves and one lump; I knew it had come from Mr. Sinclair's wharf; I went directly to this young gentleman Mr. Sinclair's brother, and told him there was some sugar so marked; they looked in their book and found it entered there.</p>

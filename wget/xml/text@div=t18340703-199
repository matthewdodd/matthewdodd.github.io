            . I am constable of Gosport. About the 6th of June, I saw the cart by the side of the market - I saw a description of it in the Hue-and-cry, and wrote a letter to London - I took the prisoner at the Northumberland Arms - I told him I wanted him respecting a cart that I suspected was stolen - he said if that was all, he bought it and paid for it, and gave 6l. 5s. for it - he said he bought it in London - I do not think he said of whom.</p>

            . I am a corn-dealer, and live at Gosport. I have known the prisoner about three months - he came to Gosport to me on Saturday evening, the 31st of May - he informed me he had left a horse and cart at my stable, and wished me to keep it till he had sold it - on the next morning he showed me the cart - it was the same that Sawyer saw - the prisoner said he had bought it for his son in London; but he had several others, and he should not want it; and he should sell the horse with it in a day or two - he asked me if I would buy it - I said it was too heavy for my work; I would not have it - he then asked me if I would allow my name to be chalked on it to be sold, and to inquire of me - I told him he might if he pleased; and it was put on - I was to ask 10l. for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was nothing like concealment about it? A. No - it was a narrow-wheeled cart.</p>

             (police-constable N 146). I went to Gosport, and took the prisoner - in coming to town he told me he bought the cart at the back of Bedlam; and in another part of the road, he said the bought it at Hoxton - on the 29th of May, when the cart was stolen, I was employed to trace it - I found the track of a wheel in a direction towards the prisoner's house in Hoxton - I have known him for years - I believe he was not there then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not a public road? A. Yes; but it had been newly gravelled - there were other tracks on it.</p>

            . I get my living by putting the penal statutes in force. On the 29th of May, I went into a public-house, near Vauxhall-gate, to have a pint of beer, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning - I saw the prisoner there - I have known him some years - he was sitting at a table with another man - I saw the prisoner give the man six sovereigns, and he went to the bar and came in again and put down two half-crowns on the table- they then shook hands, and the prisoner said, "Now it is my cart" - I saw a piece of paper on the table, and a pen and ink - I should not know the paper again - it was a similar paper to this one - I considered it to be a receipt.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where had you come from that morning? A. From my own house in the Borough - I was going down the Wandsworth-road to look after stage coaches - it was the first public-house on the right after you get through the Vauxhall-gate - there were two or three persons there - I did not see the landlord - I saw a female, whom I took to be the servant - the prisoner with the other men were sitting on the right-hand - I said to him, "Jemmy, there you are" - he said, "Very well" or "All right" - I did not go before the magistrate - the prisoner's son came to me on sunday morning last - I had no one with me at that time- I do not take a witness with me - I am the witness my - self - I was going to look after coaches, or any thing else - I do not know what change the prisoner went for, but he brought in two half-crowns, and put them on the table.</p>
               <p>COURT to R. AYMER. Q. When you saw the cart at Gosport, what name was on it? A."George Porter, Hoxton, Middlesex, No. 2728," was on the plate.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SAWYER. There was no plate on it when I lost it - I had taken my board off to have it fresh painted.</p>

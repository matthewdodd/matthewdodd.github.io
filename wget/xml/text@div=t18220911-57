On the night of the 13th of August I went to bed last, and fastened all the windows and doors; I heard no alarm in the night, but about seven o'clock in the morning the servant called me; I came down and found the back door cut through in three places and the bolts undone; the door was perforated over the bottom and over the top bolt, and a hole large enough to admit a person made in it, and near enough for them to undo the bolt; the door was open; I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth about 2 l.; there was no appearance of candle having been burnt.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You only know them to be his lodgings from something told you - A. The landlord is here; it was in the presence of the Magistrate that he said the property was his.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What he said about the property being his, was before the Magistrate - A. It was; the depositions made were read over to him by the Magistrate's clerk; I heard it read over to him, that he said the goods were his own. (The witness was here dispatched to the office, for the original book in which the examination was taken down, and on returning, his examination was as follows.)

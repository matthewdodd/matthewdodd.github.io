               <p>The indictment was opened by Mr. Chetwood as follows.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, This is an indictment as you have heard against the gentleman at the bar, for wilfully and maliciously firing at Huxley Sandon, Esq; a loaded pistol: Gentlemen there is no attempt on the part of the prosecutor, to carry this further than the facts will go,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080204"></xptr> therefore I shall only say in opening this case to you, that the prosecutor and the prisoner, had been for a long time in habits of friendship, the prisoner always had access to the house of the prosecutor, and they were in great friendship and intimacy; sometime since it was supposed the prisoner was going to France, or Italy, and he went to the house of the prosecutor, and prevailed on the wife of the prosecutor to accompany him to Dover, and accordingly she did accompany him to Dover; the prosecutor enraged and angry at that time, no doubt of it, pursued his wife and his friend to Dover, however they cluded the search, and came back to town: Information was given after several endeavours to find them, that they were at a Bagnio, in Long Acre, the prosecutor and his friends went to search there, they were denied, but the prosecutor and his friends had reason to think that they either were in the house, or coming to the house, as they had been in the house, and were very well known there, the man said at first they were not there, and he did not know them. However from several expressions, the prosecutor and his friends were convinced that they did know the prisoner, and in a little while after they heard the feet of two people walking, as if in great confusion over their heads, and they were then pretty well satisfied, that the prisoner at the bar was in the house, and was in company with Mrs. Sandon, who has been the unfortunate cause of this prosecution; Gentlemen, the prosecutor and his friends went up stairs, there they met a servant, coming out of a room with a candle in her hand, and one of the friends of the prosecutor took a candle from her, and they were going to enter the room, Mr.

             the husband, was going in first, he was willing and desirous to be thoroughly satisfied, whether the prisoner and his wife were there or not, and immediately a pistol was fired by somebody; that it was loaded, was most certain, because the ball passed through a part of his hat, there was no light in the room at the time, but however, he saw by the firing of the pistol, that it was perhaps the prisoner at the bar, he was pretty positive at that time, however, they called fresh assistance and took the prisoner and Mrs. Sandon; the witnesses will inform you, in what situation they found the prisoner at the bar, and how they found Mrs. Sandon, I believe they were both armed at that time, Mrs. Sandon had pistols loaded in her hand, as well as the prisoner; whether or no, the prisoner was the person that fired the pistol at Mr. Sandon, it will be for you to enquire; there is little doubt, I should apprehend, that it will be proved to be him; if you find that he fired the pistol, you will have no difficulty in pronouncing him guilty of shooting, maliciously and feloniously, against Mr. Sandon: Gentlemen, we shall call our witnesses and prove the facts; and if you believe he was the person that fired the pistol at the prosecutor, you will find him guilty.</p>

               <p>Were they armed? - The lady was, but I do not recollect seeing pistols in the Count's hands, I saw pistols in the lady's hands, the lady said she would fire at the first that came in, for she would sooner die than go with them.</p>
               <p>Did the lady mention any names, or had any been mentioned to her? - No Sir, she said she would kill the first that came in, she would fire at the first that came in, for she would sooner die, than go with them.</p>

               <p>When you came out of the room, did you leave any candle in the room? - I brought out the candle, and somebody took the candle, but who it was I cannot say, I did not stop a moment, I was frightened and came down stairs.</p>

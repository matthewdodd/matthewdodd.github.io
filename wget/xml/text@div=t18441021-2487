                  </hi>. I live in Daniel-street, fiethnal-green. About two o'clock in the morning of the 11th of Oct. I was at the Feathers, in Shore-ditch—I left about two in the morning—I then had three half-crowns, one shilling, and a sixpence in my pocket—I went from there two or three yards, and the prisoner came on my right-hand side, put his hand into my pocket, and got the three half-crowns and the shilling—he drew his hand from my pocket, struck me a violent blow, and knocked me down.</p>

I took the prisoner from a descrip<lb></lb>tion of his person, on suspicion of being the person who had robbed the prosecutor—I searched him, and found three half-crowns and a shilling in his shoe—but previous to that I asked him if he had any money, and he said he had not a single farthing—it was about half-past three o'clock in the morning, on the 11th of Oct. that I took him—the prosecutor had complained to another officer, and that officer told me.</p>

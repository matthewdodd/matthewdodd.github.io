             sworn. - On Wednesday, the 10th of April, about eight in the evening, my wife hung out a counterpane on a pulley-line near the window, where I was sitting; she desired me to sit to watch it a little time, as it was a fine moonlight evening; I saw the pole rise the line; the line was fixed to each side of the window; I saw the prisoner in the act of taking the counterpane; I knew his person before; I was not above three yards from his head; I got the patrol to go with me to his house (he lives about three or four doors off), and we took the prisoner to the watch-house that night; in the morning his wife brought the counterpane back to me; this is the counterpane his wife brought back to me, and it is the counterpane he took off the line.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He did not see me do it; I am not the man; I am a poor hard working fellow; I was never in such a place as this before in my born days.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">ANN DOWEL</hi>. I am the wife of John Dowel, he is a grocer in New Brentford. The prisoner came to my service on the 7th of November—about half-past eleven o'clock on Friday, the 11th, I went up into my bed-room, I then had eight sovereigns and a-half in a bag in a drawer, which was safely locked—I went again about half-past five o'clock, the drawer was then open, without the key—it appeared to have been broken open, and two sovereigns were gone—I had been at home all day—I had never been out—I had been in the shop for the last hour—I know she had been up to the room, and I know no one else could have gone up, or I must have heard and seen them—she asked leave to go out at about half-past four o'clock, and returned at a quarter before six o'clock—I charged her with the robbery—she said her mother wished her to go home that night—I got some neighbours in, and one of them asked her about the money—she positively asserted she had not seen it if she were to be struck dead—the policeman came in, and she was perfectly willing to go to the station—I found a sovereign in my bed the next morning—I had been watching her all day—she was all day endeavouring to be up stairs—I called her down once or twice, and then asked her to do some work in the kitchen—when she was gone out, and was longer than she asked for, I went up and missed this money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Lewis Cubitt, who lives at Chelsea. About twenty minutes before six o'clock in the evening of the 4th of June I saw the prisoner get over a wall and building belonging to Thomas Cubitt, which is opposite where I live—the workmen had left about a quarter of an hour—I saw the prisoner come back with a cap in his hand, which he had on his head when he went over—I followed, he saw me, and ran away—I took him, and found in his cap about 1000 nails—he said he picked them up among the rubbish—I said, "What, new nails?"—he said "Yes"—I gave him to a policeman, and went to the building, and saw the nails had been shifted—I found some nails in the premises similar to those found on him—part of them were scattered on the floor—I compared those in his cap with what I found, and they cor<lb></lb>responded—they were Mr. Thomas Cubitt's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of a warehouse at Blackwall, the pro<lb></lb>perty of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. On Friday, 11th May, 100 hogsheads of pale ale were delivered out of the warehouse, some part of it in my presence—I saw some of it delivered into a lighter—Bol-ton had charge of the lighter—they were to be put on board a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Nugget</hi>. bound for Sydney; the casks appeared to be in good condition—Bolton was servant to the lighterman.</p>

Tooth's store to the I barge; I dare say it would take quite that number to roll them—they do not roll a great deal out of them.</p>

Tooth's men have access to the warehouse in which the ale was kept, they work there—I should say from 3,000 to 4,000 casks are kept there—perhaps twenty casks had been lying on the wharf for one night; there might have been fifty, I cannot say; I believe they were not lying there more than one night, I will not swear they had not—all the persons employed about the wharf had then access to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman in the service of the Eastern Counties Railway Company, at the pepper warehouse, Blackwall. On Friday, 11th May, from information I received, I followed a barge laden with hogsheads of ale—Bolton was the lighterman of that barge—I concealed myself in the engine house at the lower wharf, opposite where the barge was lying—I saw Arnall take a bucket from another barge and lot it down into the cabin—I did not see where Bolton was at that time—after it had been down some<lb></lb>time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110027"></xptr>
               <p>Arnall went down—I do not know whether Bolton's barge had any name on it—I had watched that barge—Arnall remained in the cabin a very short time—he then came up, and they drew up the bucket—I could not see whether there was anything in it—he took it to another barge that was lying alongside, and put it down in the cabin—the bucket was open so that any one could see it—there was nothing on it but a piece of rope, by which it was let down into the cabin—I should say it was about a gallon bucket—after a short time the bucket was brought back again, and put down again into the cabin where the ale was; Arnall went down, and in a short time came up again, drew up the bucket again, and took it to the barge that was lying alongside, where he took the first one, and let it down into the cabin—this was from 1 or half past, till 3 o'clock—the second time the bucket was taken I saw Bolton put his head up out of the cabin—after Arnall had disposed of the second bucket I saw him go to another barge, he went down into the cabin and put up a gallon bottle—he put a coat round it, and took it aboard the barge where the ale was—he went down into the cabin, and in a short time it was brought up again—Bolton stood at the top and took it—I could not exactly see from where I stood, who put it up—Arnall took the bottle from the side of the cabin, and went to the barge where he had fetched it from—I could not see Bolton at that time, he was in the cabin—I saw him when the second bucket went down; some minutes elapsed before the bottle went down—Bolton could not have left the cabin without my seeing him—he had not left it between the time the bucket came up the second time and the bottle going down—after the bottle was put down I saw the bucket put down once more—that was by Arnall—it was brought away again—I then went and gave information to Mr. Steele; he was waiting at the stores—I then accompanied him on board the barge, and into the cabin where I had seen the bucket go down—I found nine persons there—that was not in Bolton's barge, but another barge where the ale was taken to—I first went on board Bolton's barge—the barge that the bottle was taken to was Arnall's own barge—I went there and placed Steele against the cabin—I did not go into the cabin then, I went on board the barge where the ale was taken in the buckets—I there found the nine persons—Bolton was there, and Arnall also—I am quite sure that I saw Bolton at the time when the bucket was being let down the second time—Arnall was not on board his own barge when I and Mr. Steele went on board it—I afterwards went on board his barge again; I did not find him there, I found Mr. Steele there, standing at the top of the cabin—I found a gallon bottle of ale in that cabin—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bottle—it is a similar bottle to the one I saw go down into the cabin of Bolton's barge.</p>

                  </hi>, I am foreman to Messrs. Robert and Alfred Tooth, brewers, of No. 14, Mincing-lane. On Friday, 11th May, I saw 100 hogs<lb></lb>heads of ale put on board a lighter; it was Messrs. Tooth's ale, which they were exporting—I saw it put on board the barge from the premises of the Eastern Counties Railway Company—Bolton had charge of the barge when it went out of the wharf—I saw that the hogsheads were in good condition, not leaky; they were filled up, and properly vented—I knew that Duce was watching—he afterwards fetched me, and we went aboard a barge; he told me to stay at the top of the cabin stairs, and see that no one went down or came up; he went elsewhere—he afterwards returned, went into the cabin, and brought up this bottle of ale; I tasted it; it contained Messrs. Tooth's ale—I have got here a sample from the hogsheads—it is the same quality and flavour; it is a peculiar ale—I afterwards went on board the lighter where the 100 hogsheads were—I found one hogshead lying on the top of the barge, which had had a spigot put in the head of it; I took the cask in my hand, and found it had been <hi rend="italic">ullaged</hi> considerably—there was no spile in it when it was sent out—the cask was lying on the deck, on the top of the 100 hogsheads, lying by itself—the spigot was broken off—I examined the other casks on the following day, and found that five had been spiled—I missed altogether fourteen gallons of ale from those five casks.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who is responsible for the ale lost? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Myself; if there is any claim I shall have to pay it—I am employed by Messrs. Tooth, not by the Eastern Counties—I do not know whether I mean to make this ale good; if I am called upon, perhaps I shall make it good—certainly, if I am called upon, I shall; I consider the ale in my custody—I do not mean to make it good to the Railway Company.</p>

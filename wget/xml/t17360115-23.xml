I gave a Pot-full of Sprats to boil, and after they had eaten the Sprats, the young Women wanted a Dram. Jemmy Baily had no Money, nor Dodds neither; so the young Women gave me Three-half-pence to fetch some Gin after our Sprats: but Mrs. Ingram would have no Gin come there, nor let them sing a Song. So Jemmy Baily, and I, and Dodds, and the two young Women, went to a Distiller's and had half a Pint; we paid Three-halfpence,and scor'd the other Three-half pence. We stayed there till 8 or 9 o'Clock; one of the young Women would stay no longer; so Dodds, and Baily, and I, and the other Woman, went to see her Home into Hogg-yard. As we were going to this Place, Jemmy Baily dropped us, and went to the Shovel, and Dodds and I stayed at his Aunt's Door; we talked there about a Quarter of an Hour, and up comes Jemmy Baily; Who's here, says he?

It was a Quarter of an Hour before the Gentlemen came by; they turned up between Nightingal-lane and Ragg Fair. Jemmy Baily followed, and gave the Man in the Red Rug-Coat a Blow; the Man turned and struck at him with his Cane, but the other Man had got Dodd's Hammer from him, and broke his Head with it in two Places. Baily got off with a Hatt, but which of the Gentlemen it belonged to I can't tell, Dodds lost his Hatt and Cap in the Fray. I was afraid Dodds was taken, and went to look for him, I found him all over Gore-Blood, and Hatt, Cap, and Hammer were gone. Jemmy Baily came to us again, and said, If you have lost your Hatt, we have a better in the Room of it. Next Morning Dodds came to me to the Glass-house to desire me to get 2 s. upon the Hatt; we had 2 s. and half a Pint of Gin upon it of Mr. Reynolds; and next Day, Dodds order me to go to Mr. Reynolds and bid him sell the Hatt, and send the rest of the Money.

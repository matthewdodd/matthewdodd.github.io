On Monday, the 22nd of January, I was on duty near the Flower Pot, in Bishopsgate-street, and saw the prisoner with the box on his shoulder, standing against the Flower Pot—I had seen him walking very fast before that, coming from towards leaders hall-street—the prosecutrix is my wife's stister, and had been staying at my apartment—she came up and said, "Henry, this man has got my box"—I took him into custody with the box.</p>

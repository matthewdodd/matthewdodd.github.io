I stopped the prisoner about 200 yards from the prosecutor's—I said, "Excuse me, I am a police-constable; what is this you have in your pocket?"—he said, "Some bristles, they are my own; I purchased them of a person named Andrews, at Kingsland-road"—I asked if there was anybody about there that knew him—he said, "Not nearer than Haggerston church, a mile off"—I said, "Have you any more?"be said, "Yes, plenty at home"—he took me home, and there I found a quantity of bristles, in small packages, about 1 oz. or 2 oz. each—in coming back, I asked him if Mr. Horst knew him—he said no, but he knew Mr. Horst—I asked him if he ever worked for him—he said, "No"—I took him into the shop, and the prosecutor's wife said he worked for them—Mr. Horst came to the station, and identified these bundles that I found at the prisoner's; bouse,</p>

I had been to Mornington-place with my cart, to fetch three boxes for my daughter, who was leaving her place. I was going on gently, and my wife and daughter were sitting in the cart, which has a high tail-board to it. I missed the goods when we got just below the turnpike beyond St. George's Hospital. I knew nothing of their being taken till Mr. Maggs told me of it - it was about eight o'clock at night. I got out of the cart, and ran into Hyde-park, but did not see them, and I got into the cart and waited there - Mr. Maggs returned, and said he had got the man in Park-lane - I turned round and came to the place, and went into the public-house, and there were the three boxes - the prisoner was in custody at a shop, about two doors from the public-house - he was quite a stranger to me - he must have taken them over the tail-board - it had not been taken down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose property were they - A. They all belonged to my daughter; she was in the cart with me.</p>
               <p>The Court ruled that the owner being present, the property should be described as her's, and the prisoner was acquitted.</p>

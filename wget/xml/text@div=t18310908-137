               <p>WILLIAM KIRKETT. I am parish-clerk of Elstow, Bedfordshire - Mr. Benjamin Davis is one of the churchwardens. I went to the church on Sunday, the 31st of July, and the iron chest which contained the registers and the sacramental plate was gone - I acquainted the churchwardens, and a vestry was called; I have since seen part of the plate in possession of Mr. Hatton - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

            . I live in Thames-street, opposite the Old London-bridge; I am a watchmaker, and deal in silver. On the 2nd of August, about six o'clock in the evening, I was in a little room behind the shop; Mrs. Hutton was in the shop, she came and brought me this silver, which she said was offered for sale - I immediately said, "This is stolen silver," and directed her to buy it; I went to a place where I can observe every thing without being noticed, and there I saw the prisoner selling this plate; I took particular notice of her person; her name and direction were asked; she gave her direction, No. 20, Long-lane, Borough; I am not positive whether she gave her name - I sent my female servant out at the private door, to watch where she went - she was gone some time, and from what she said, when she returned, I went after dark to No. 7, Castle-street, Kent-street, Borough, with two Policemen; I knocked at the door, and the prisoner opened it; I gave an agreed signed to the Policemen, and they approached - I challenged her with having been at my house, and given a false address; she said she had never seen me in my life, and I do not think she did see me, but she added that she had not been over the bridge, nor at my house, which I described; I took out the silver, and said to the prisoner, in the Policemen's presence,"Will you say you did not bring this silver to my house today;" she utterly denied all knowledge of it; she was taken into custody; the Policemen went into a back room, which her landlady said she rented, and found a man there, whom they took; I have no doubt this silver is part of a cup and cover.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not tell the landlady that you would transport her? A. I do not remember it- I said the case would transport her; I was about four yards from her in the shop, looking through a hole; my wife bought the plate; she might give her name as Mary Ann Reynolds; I do not recollect; I went to Long-lane, and found it was a false address; I think she did say her name was Reynolds - my wife is not here; I had no conversation with the prisoner in the shop; she told the Magistrate her brother gave it her; I did not know at first sight that this was sacramental plate.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Hatton. He desired me to follow the prisoner; she went to No. 7, Castle-street, Borough; I am quite sure she is the person - she did not knock at the door, it was open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you was in the shop when she first came in? A. Yes - she asked if the gentleman was at home; I went and sent Mrs. Hatton out to her - I remained in the parlour, which is a very little way from the shop; I was within hearing, but did not hear her say her brother gave her the silver - if she had I must have heard it: I might not hear all she said - she gave the name of Ann Reynolds, for it is down in the book; I did not hear this.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went to No. 7, Castle-street, on the 2nd of August - we found the prisoner in the passage; there was a man in the room - the prisoner and the man both said they lived there together; I found a lap-stone there, with marks of silver on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there not shoemaker's tools there? A. Yes - they use a lap-stone; I have heard that the prisoner's brother ran away - he did not live at the house; I have been looking for him.</p>
               <p>MR. HATTON. I gave 4s. an oz. for the silver - it came to 37s. 6d.; I thought at first it was foreign silver, but on looking at it, I saw the Hall mark, and advertised it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see your wife weight it? A. Yes, and she entered it in the book - there were 9 ozs.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police-inspector</hi>). On 13th Oct., about eight o'clock, I saw a bag of sugar on the quay in the London Docks, which had been cut open in two places—it was not full, but the other bags were—some sugar was spilt near there—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Red Port</hi>, which was ten or twelve feet from the bag, and found the prisoners and another in the forecastle—a light was burning, and a bag of white sugar, similar to this, was lying in the locker—Frazer handed me a pillow-case, containing 7lbs. of white sugar—I asked the prisoners if it belonged to them—they said they knew nothing about it—I went to a hammock which Pendrill said was his, and found in it a small box, containing 5lbs. of the same kind of sugar, with "R. P." on the lid—I asked him if it was his-be said, "Yes, those are my initials; I do not know what is in it"—I opened it, and said, "It is sugar"—he said, "1 know nothing about it"—on the locker I found a bag, containing 4 1/2 lbs. of the same kind of sugar—in a bed which Cox said was his, I found a bottle, containing brown sugar, at the bottom, and white sugar, like this, at the top—it weighed 5lbs.—Cox said, "That is mine"—I asked where it came from—he said, "From the quay"—I said, "Where from?"—he said, "From a bag;" that was in Pendrill's hearing—I took Cox to the bag, and said, "This bag is cut"—he said, "Yes, that is it; but I did not cut it"—I took a sample from it, and it corresponded with the sugar found—that in the box was patted down, I think, by a spoon, to make room for some clothes.</p>

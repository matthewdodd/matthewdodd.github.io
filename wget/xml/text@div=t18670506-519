I am a drawing master, of Great Union Street, Borough—one night last month, at twelve o'clock, I was in some street in the Borough—the prisoner and another man came up to me and asked me for some money, as they were poor and had a large family; I took out my purse and gave them 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; they asked me to come on that side, and then knocked me down and robbed me of all my money, about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the</p>

I heard cries of "Police!" and went down King Street, Borough, where I saw the prisoner with his left hand holding the prosecutor's neck, and his right by his side either in his pocket or outside—he was decidedly not helping the prosecutor, but he said he was assisting him up from the ground; the prosecutor said that he had robbed him—one man ran away, but I did not see him begin to run—the prosecutor was quite sober—I searched the place where the scuffle was, and found sixpence on the ground—the prisoner tried to get away from me.</p>

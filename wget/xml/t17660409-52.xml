On the 6th of March the prisoner came to my shop to buy something; I was serving a customer: she came to a box of ribbons: my servant, that was on the other side the counter, came and told me he saw her take two pieces of ribbon out; upon that I believe she suspected he had seen her; she took one piece from under her cloak and laid it down. I took her up stairs, my people all knew her, she had been frequently at my shop for 12 months, almost once a week; I said, I suppose you have robbed me many a time: no, said she, I never did but once before. I charged her with taking a piece; she produced it from out of her pocket, there is 11 yards of it. She went on her knees and begged I would not prosecute her, and in the mean time she put another piece of ribbon, which she had from some other person, under a chair; I did not find that till a day or two after, it had not our mark upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I am a file-cutter; I never knew her bear any bad character in my life; I took my mother home, and hired the prisoner to be my servant; I used to trust her to go to all my customers, sometimes she has brought me three or four guineas at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she servant to you?</p>
               <p>Wilson. She was six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where has she been since she left you? I see she has a child in her arms.</p>
               <p>Wilson. Ever since my mother died I have lived with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What as man and wife?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not marry her, as her character is so good?</p>
               <p>Wilson. It was not in my power then.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I had a great many debts to pay away on my mother's affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it is better to live in that wicked slate, than to live in a marriage slate?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot expect protection from God's providence if you live in such an unlawful manner; this is as much forbid in the word of God as robbery or murder: how can you expect prosperity in living in this way? The best thing you can do is to go and marry her the moment the trial is over. It is very melancholy to see people no way thoughtful in distinguishing virtue from vice; you cannot expect the jury will give credit to one word you say.</p>

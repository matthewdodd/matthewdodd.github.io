               <p>MR. PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOWSE. I am a <rs id="t18250630-119-viclabel602" type="occupation">cowkeeper</rs>

The prisoner was never in partnership with me; he came to live with me. and desired me to take care of his cow while he went into the country, where he said he had a great deal of property; his cow was a black one, with a white face - mine was all black; I never made him a present of it; he did not go into the country, but was taken ill at my house; he assisted in carrying out my milk, and drove my cow round to serve the milk - I used to call the white-faced one his own. On the 5th of May I missed mine, and have not seen it since; he went out in the morning and should return at nine o'clock, but did not; I found him in Rosemary-lane at three o'clock in the afternoon, and asked how he came to take my black cow; he said he had sold her, and got the money in his pocket, and if he had done wrong he must answer for it. I said if he did not return it I must take him before a Magistrate, and he would be transported; he said if he had done wrong he must stand the consequences of it; I applied to the Magistrate, who granted a summons - we went before the Magistrate, who heard a few words, and said he was too busy to attend to it, but if I thought he had stolen it I must go to the sessions, which were on, and indict him - I did so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where did you first become acquainted with him? A. In the King's Bench prison; I did not employ him to carry on my business while I was there - I never borrowed a penny of him, but he borrowed twelve sovereigns of me and some clothes; I never gave him a bill of exchange - I gave Rogers a bill which he now holds, as I owe him 1 l. 5 s. on it; he lent me the money to pay for the two cows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not come forward as the prisoner's friend, and pay for the cows for you? A. No; the prisoner has arrested me, last Wednesday three weeks, for 40 l., but I owe him nothing: Rogers took me out of my bed, and offered to liberate me if I would give up this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sign a written agreement with Rogers or the prisoner? A. I signed a deed on the 4th of May; it was to pay ground rent; Rogers has concealed the cow, for he acknowledged it - the Magistrate did not commit the prisoner.</p>

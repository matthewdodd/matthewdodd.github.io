On the 9th of last month, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was informed that the prisoner had taken a pair of boots away, that hung outside of my shop window. I pursued the prier, and came up to him in Little George-street, in the Minories; he was walking pretty sharp; the man informed me that he put the boots under his smock frock. I seized a boot from under his smock frock; he then drew up, as if he was going to strike me, but ran off; and he either threw another boot from him or dropped it. Several people laid hold of him, but he got from them. I saw him turn round the corner, into Mitre-court. I was anxious to go home; I picked up the boot and went to the shop; I saw the prisoner the next morning at the Mansion-house. I believe he is the person; the boots are worth thirty-shillings.</p>

            . I am constable. I apprehended the prisoner just going in Leadenhall-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mitre-court - A. Yes; I pursued him just to the corner of Mitre-court. I saw Mr. Heath tustling with him in Little George-street; Mr. Heath had taken one boot from him; he got from Mr. Heath, and ran across the way; I pursued him, and never lost sight of him. I then saw him drop or throw one boot away from him in the street. When I laid hold of him, he said nothing; he was quite in confusion; bringing him to the watchhouse, an elderly gentleman said, I saw him cut the boots down with a knife. I searched him at the watchhouse, and found this knife.</p>

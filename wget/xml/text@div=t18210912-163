            . I am constable of the Thames Police. On the 18th of August, about seven o'clock in the morning, I and Wilson were in Nightingale-lane, and saw the male prisoners coming towards us; they turned down Burr-street. Law was carring a sack full of something; Jaggers looked round several times to see if they were watched; he had his own hat on, and another under his jacket; they saw us and rather mended their pace; we lost Laws in Lower East Smithfield. I followed Jaggers, and asked what he had got there, he said only a hat. I turned back and went into a cook-shop there, and found Laws standing up with the sack, which was then empty; it had contained coals: I asked where he brought them from - he said from a coalshed at Wapping<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120091"></xptr>several times; I wished to know what shed; he then said, he brought them from Bryant's, and that they were a few sweepings which he had saved up. Atkinson came into the shop from backward, I asked where the coals were shot, and I think it was her that said they were shot in the kitchen; I went backward and found they were shot down by the copper side; she said the man ran in and ran backward and shot them before she had time to see what they were, and said they were sweepings. I took her word for attending the office, which she did. I went and found Jaggers at work at Bryants, I asked him for Law's hat, he fetched it.</p>

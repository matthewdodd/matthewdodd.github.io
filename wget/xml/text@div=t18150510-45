            . I am shopman to Mr. Conder, No. 8, St. Paul's-church-yard. On the 18th of April last, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going past Mr. Sowerby's shop; I saw the prisoner in the act of standing up inside of the shop, what he was doing, I cannot say; he was a little way<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100033"></xptr>inside the shop; as soon as I advanced to the door, he came out with a pair of breeches under his arm; that made me suspicious; I saw him come out of the shop with the breeches; I did not see him take them. I went in, and informed Mr. Sowerby and the shopman; I told them, I had seen a man going out with a pair of breeches, at that time, I could not tell whether they had sold them or not; that man was the prisoner. My Sowerby sent his shopman; I accompanied him into Finsbury-square; I told the shopman, if he went one way, I would go another. I came back to Mr. Sowerby's again, about three doors off, at a wine-vaults, I found the prisoner standing near the window, with the breeches in his hand; I asked him to come along with me; I took him and the breeches into the shop; he went with me very quietly, he made not the least resistance; the prisoner said, he had taken them from the shop to a young man at the public-house, that he was going to buy them. I left him about ten minutes; I came back again, and found him in custody of the officer.</p>

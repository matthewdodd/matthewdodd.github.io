                  </hi>. I am clerk to Charles Edwin Potter and Co., paper stainers, of Cannon-street. We have a customer of the name of Newman, at Newington-butts; we were in the habit of supplying him with goods upon a written order received from him—I do not know the prisoner—a boy, named Cooper, brought this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on 3rd Dec.—we let the boy have the paper that was ordered, which was forty pieces of paper hanging—I followed the boy out to the bottom of Thames-street, which is 500 or 600 yards from my master's place of business—there the prisoner accosted the boy, and they both went down College-hill—in going down they rested twice, the prisoner taking the bundle from the boy's shoulder—I saw a policeman, and gave them both in charge.</p>

             - A. I observed a little before eleven two men coming from Mr. Benjamin's shop apparently; I saw them with two bundles, and I saw them put them into the coach that was standing in Bentinck street; I saw some men go back again from the coach; I cannot say whether they were the same men or not, I was standing by the passage about five or six yards off; I saw some men go from the coach; I followed them, I saw them go into Mr. Benjamin's shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. How many men - A. Three or four.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. How many did you observe go into the shop - A. I observed three, if not four.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they continue there - A. About the space of a minute. I saw them come out with more things on their back; I followed them up again. I saw them put the things into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. After the things were put in the coach, what became of the men - A. I did not see any of the men go into the coach; as soon as the steps were put up, I went into the house and told some there what I suspected; I came out again with

               <p>Q How was the coach going on when you came out of the public house - A. It was going on a sharp trot; the last witness pointed it out to me; I overtook the coach in about four or five hundred yards; I run after the coach and told him to stop; he did not stop; I ran of the side and took the number; he did not tell us what he suspected, only to run after the coach and take the number, in case any thing might happen; when I spoke to the coachman he whipped his horses and they went the faster; the coach number was 278; my brother was with me, he took the number on the other side. After I got the number I returned home and did not go any farther.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see the face of the coachman - A. I did not; there was only one on the box, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

            . Q. What are you - A. I am a shoemaker. I accompanied the prisoner to the Bull and Gate, I examined the coach that drove in while Mr. Benjamin was there; of which the prisoner was coachman; I found the coat in the box under the seat, there was old harness over it; the coach came into the Bull and Gate between twelve and one.</p>

            ; he had three hearings before the magistrate, and was discharged; - the prisoner was delivered into my care.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing said by the prisoner in the course of that night respecting that coat - A. When I took the charge Mr. Benjamin said he would wish to know where his property was; he said he did not know, neither had the coach been in Marybone parish that day.</p>
               <p>Q. to Richardson, Do you know the face of the person that drove the coach - A. Yes; at the time he drove in at the Bull and Gate it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

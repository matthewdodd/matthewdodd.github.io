On the 28th of May, at eight o'clock, I found the dock gate locked when I went to it, and was going to Gold's house, in Dock-street; I met with a female, who asked if I wanted her; I went home with her - she desired me to sit down; she went out and got a light, and after that I gave her 3s. - she lighted a candle: I cannot say where she brought it from - as soon as I paid her 3s. she went down stairs; three men then came up, and I asked them what business they had with my woman - one of them lifted up the poker, and asked me what business I had there; I said, "Give me my money back, and I will go away directly;" one laid hold of me on one side, and the other on the other, and dragged me out of doors - the prisoner is the man who took my money out of my pocket and put it into his mouth.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he do that? A. When they got me outside the door; he took five shillings and a penny - I took hold of him, and held him till the watchman came up: as soon as I called for the watch the other two ran away - they had laid hold of me by each arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of them a stick? A. No, the prisoner had the fire poker.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in his hand when the watchman came up? A. No, he had left it in the house - I had 9s. when I left my ship; I had spent all but 8s. 1d. when I met the girl.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. Have you more names than one? A. No; the girl addressed me in broken English; I understand a little English - I was not walking with the prisoner when I met the girl; she took me into a room alone with her - she went down, and up came these three men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call out to the prisoner, "See me down stairs - don't let me be thrown down?" A. No, all I said to him was, "Give me my money back, and I am willing to go;" all three of the men laid hold of me, and dragged me down by force.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Essex-street, Whitechapel, on the morning of the 29th of May, and heard a cry of watch - I went up, and saw the prisoner holding the prosecutor by the collar- they were scuffling; I took him: he made resistance, and tried to get away - I heard the footsteps of about two more men, but it is rather a dark place, and I could not see them: I searched the prisoner at the station-house, and found 2s. on him; I could not understand the prosecutor's language, but seeing the prisoner pulling him about I took him - I went up stairs in the house, and saw the girl the prisoner lives with is the girl the prosecutor gave the 3s. to; I took the prosecutor to the room, and there were four girls there - he could not point her out, but he tapped her on the hand, and she immediately gave me the 3s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. About four o'clock; I swear the prisoner was scuffling with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050005"></xptr>prosecutor - it was not so dark but that I could see him; I found no money on the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where did you take me? A. In the court in Essex-street; you did not say "Don't ill-use me, and I will go quietly;" I did not take out my staff at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to IsMAEL. Q. Did you spend any money with the female? A. No - I bought some bread and beer with 1s., but spent nothing with the girl.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent. I lived with my father and mother for upwards of ten or eleven years, and have been in service at a butcher's; I work very hard for my living; and how could a man who knew himself rob such a man as that of so little as 5s.? I worked from morning till night to earn money for my father and mother.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

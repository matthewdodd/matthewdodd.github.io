            . I am an officer. Mr. Collyer desired me to watch his house, and on the 28th of December, about twenty minutes past eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come out with a bundle. I stopped him five doors off, and asked what he had got; he said his dirty linen to be washed; I said if so it was all right - he said he had nothing but what was his own. I took him to the watch-house, and found 3 1/8 lbs. of sugar, and 19 ozs. of coffee in his bundle, which also contained dirty linen. I sent for his master, who said, "What, I have caught you at last, you have been robbing me." He said it was the first time he had taken anything.</p>

In consequence of suspicion, I set the officer to watch. I found the prisoner at the watch-house; he said he had taken the goods out of my shop - that a person he owed money to threatened to summons him, and he took them to pay him with. He was my porter, and boarded in the house, and had 16 l. a year.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You miss no property - A. No. He said it was his first offence, and wished me to forgive him. I did not observe him agitated. He lived four months with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out of place a long time before I went to Mr. Collyer. I owed a man 17 s. 6 d.; he threatened to summons me - I paid him 10 s. out of my wages, and distributed the rest to people I owed it to. He would not wait for the rest.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. Giles's. On the 25th of April last I was sent for to take the prisoner and the prosecutor into custody for going into Mr. Willy's house and not giving any account of themselves The man was very tipsey, the woman was not. On the woman I found seven shillings and two-pence. The watch was found under the woman's arm by the prison keeper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He told me to take care of his watch. I had a friend lived at No. 6, Newtoner's-lane; I made a mistake, and went to the wrong house.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage Mr. Hall's business, 120, Lower Marsh, Lambeth—he carries on business there and in Birmingham, as the Victoria Tea Company—it is the custom at his establishments on the sale of 1/4lb., 1/2lb., or 1/2lb. of tea to deliver a coupon or ticket to the buyer; this is a Alb. ticket, "1/2. The Victoria Tea Company, 120, Lower Marsh, Lambeth"—a number of those tickets entitles the bearer to any articles in the window, such as glass shades, and other things—on Saturday, 4th October, the prisoner came to the counter, and asked me for 1/2lb. of tea, I served him, and gave him a 1/2lb. coupon—he turned to the side counter, and said "How much does that shade go for?"—it covered a stuffed bird—I said "25lb.'—he said "I will have that," and produced these 50 half-pound tioketi—I immediately saw that they were forged, and handed them to my porter, Fish, and said "Just count these carefully, and wrap this up to this gentle<lb></lb>man"—while he did so I spoke to a woman outside, sent for a constable, and gave the prisoner in custody—the "120" on the forged tickets is straight (<hi rend="italic">Roman letters</hi>), and on the genuine ones it is slanting (<hi rend="italic">Italics</hi>), and" the word "The" is smaller in the forged than in the genuine ticket, and the 2 in 1/2 is larger in the forged one—there is also a difference in the card<lb></lb>board on tearing it; the genuiue is brown, and the forged is white—I went with the constable to the prisoner's address, 22 st. Arden Street, Battersea, and saw a woman there, who pointed out a parlour in which on a table were found a quantity of the prisoners cards as a printer at that address—I noticed that the ornaments on the mantelshelf had been recently removed, by dust marks where they had been, and also on the sideboard—I also</p>

               <p>found llb. of tea, marked "Victoria Tea Company, 156, Old Kent Road"—we have another establishment there, and the coupon system is used there—I left it there—we found a printing press in working order, in a cellar, and also this concertina which came from our shop, it has our private mark on it—I do not know when it left our shop—this doll and purse were found upstairs, and these three jugs and this brush in the kitchen—they are the same description of articles as we give away with our tea</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to his house an hour and a half after he was in custody—I have been three years in the company's employ—did not notice the difference in the inside of the cardboard till the clerk at the police-court pointed it out—I had never torn one open for curiosity—the company have I think seven establishments—we have always used this coloured ticket since the Lower Marsh shop has been open—coupons from 156, Old Kent Road are not available at Lower Marsh, if they were we could not keep our stock right, and the addresses on them are different—I cannot say whether the prisoner's wife has not bought tea for some time at our shop—the bird and shade are worth about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it goes for 25lb of tea—the articles are sent from Mr. Hall at Birmingham—we do not sell them for cash.</p>

I am a porter in Mr. Turner's employ, at 130, Lower Marsh—I wait on people who bring coupons in change for articles they require—on Saturday, 4th October, I saw the prisoner come in and hand tickets to the manager, after asking him how many were required for the bird under the shade; I counted them and found they were counterfeit; I tied up the shade and he had it in his hand, when a policeman entered the shop and touched him on the shoulder.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see him when he came into the shop, but when I saw him I recognised him—that was directly I heard he was sus<lb></lb>pected—the transaction with the llb. tickets was two months previously; the tickets are worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on llb. of tea, and the lustres were valued at 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—our tickets might fade—it was a month before I suspected these tickets were forged.</p>

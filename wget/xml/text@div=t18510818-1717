                  </hi>. I carry on business in Brewer-street, Golden-square. I am agent to Mr. Turner—the prisoner applied to me about August, 1850, and I communicated with Mr. Turner—there was a paper executed, and 180 odd pounds was paid to the prisoner—a woman named Lockwood, who was the wife of a man I knew, was placed by Mr. Turner on the prisoner's premises as servant to Mr. Turner, to take care of the furniture for him—after this transaction, I know of an execution being put into the house—after that there was an action tried, I think in Feb. 1851—that was an interpleader-action, and I heard the prisoner examined on the part of the plaintiff—he said he had sold all his interest in the furniture to Mr. Turner—I believe all the evidence was given, and the Jury returned a verdict that the goods were at the time of the seizure the goods of the plaintiff—I cannot say positively whether the prisoner returned to the house—he told me he had taken apartments in Bury-street, St. James's—the furniture was still at 16, King-street, and Mrs. Lockwood had the care of the house—the prisoner did not go to King-street by my sanction, but I knew of his being there subsequently—Sir Thomas Farquhar was the landlord—there had been lodgers in the house—Mrs. Lockwood received the rents, and paid them to me for me to pay the superior landlord—they have not been sufficient to pay the rent due to the landlord—the last time I saw Mrs. Lockwood was on the 7th Aug., between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I have advertised her, and had bills posted for her, but I have not seen her since—she had possession of the original bill of sale—I have not been able to procure that under any circumstances—I believe Mr. Sydney has a copy of it—I know it to be a correct copy—on Friday, 8th Aug. I learned, about half-past four, that ail the furniture had been taken away—I saw Mrs. Lockwood on the 7th, and in the rooms in which I went every thing seemed right—I have since traced the furniture to Mr. Dent—on 8th Aug., every body was gone from the house—I found the prisoner on the following day at Mr. Hird's, in Tottenham-court-road—I said, "This is a pretty piece of business, Mr. Strickland"—he affected not to know me—he looked at me—I said, "My name is Collins; you know me surely"—he said, "I think I have seen you"—I gave him in charge.</p>

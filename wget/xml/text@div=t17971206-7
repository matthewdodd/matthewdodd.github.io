               <p>Court. Q. Do you know upon what occasion she was sent for, or what she came about? - A. No; I do not know any thing about it; she came and knocked at the door, and asked for Mrs. Benson.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the prisoner go by the name of Benson? - A. Yes. I told her she was at home, she went up stairs; Mrs. Benson came down to me in a few minutes after, and said to me, Mrs. Munday, will you do me a favor, to get me half a pint of brandy, and change for a guinea, which I did; when I came back, I opened the door, and let myself in with the key; I came to the foot of the stairs and called, Mrs. Benson, here is the stuff; Mrs. Benson said, I am not ready for you yet, I will call when I want you.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you next observe? - A. I heard a great groaning, and a rattling in the throat, and a scuffling in the room; I went and called my opposite neighbour, of the name of Macdonald; she came back with me, and I called out to know what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the noise continue when you returned? - A. No; the groaning had then ceased.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been absent? - A. As near as I can recollect, about ten minutes; Mrs. Macdonald staid in the house while I went to call Miss Eyles, and she followed me immediately as fast as she could come; we all three went up together, and I insisted upon knowing what was the matter; Mrs. Benson said, nothing at all was the matter, the woman was only in a sit; I still insisted upon knowing what was the matter again, and I would go for a doctor; she said, there was nothing the matter, she was recovering, she was rubbing her by the fire.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the door shut, so as to prevent you from making your own observations? - A. The door was shut, it was locked; but afterwards, in about five or ten minutes, she opened the door a little way, so that I could see only a small part of her face, and the skirt of her gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it open sufficient for you to gain admittance? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner's face and skirt that you saw, or the deceased's? - A. The prisoner's; when she opened the door, she said, you may come in, Mrs. Munday, but nobody else; I was terrified, and flurried, and did not go into the room; I then went out for a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who mentioned your going out for a doctor? - A. Miss Eyles; I then went for a doctor, and left Miss Eyles and Mrs. Macdonald up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you procure a surgeon? - A. He was not at home, he followed me soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the doctor's name? - A. Pearce; when I returned to the house, I saw Mrs. Benson walking about the passage, holding of her singer in my passage, just by my room door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make use of any expression? - A. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else come with the surgeon? - A. Yes, the beadles of the parish, Dunbar and Grey; they came all together, as near as I can tell; I saw the deceased standing in my kitchen, with her head supported by her hand on the table.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did she make use of any expression? - A. When I went in, I asked her if she could speak, or make any motion, when she shook her head, her throat was cut on the right side.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. She did not speak? - A. No; she made a motion with her hand, across her throat, and pointed up stairs, I saw no more; a surgeon came in, a coach was called, and she was taken to the Hospital; Mrs. Macdonald's daughter came in just before she was taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. There were a great many people, I take it for granted, flocking to the house? - A. The whole neighbourhood surrounded my door.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the same instant, when you entered, other people got in to see what passed as well as yourself? - A. There was Mrs. Macdonald, and her daughter, and my relation Miss Eyles, nobody else to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You were extremely flurried from the moment you went out, till the time you came in again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You yourself did not attempt to put any further question to the poor creature in that situation, than asking whether she could speak, and she making that motion, you declined asking any further questions? - A. Yes; I then went into my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Leaving the surgeon and the other people in the kitchen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mrs. Cox was in the habit of visiting Mrs. Phipoe before? - A. She often came to my house, once a week, or once a fortnight, and sometimes twice a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear her speak of Mrs. Phipoe's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060014"></xptr>kindness to her? - A. I knew nothing more of her than letting her in.</p>
               <p>Q. You never perceived any thing like ill-wi between these two persons? - A. I never heard a word of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day that she called, Mrs. Phipoe had not sent for her, by your knowledge, at all? - A Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. She staid some time, and you did not hear any anger? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out, you did not take up many minutes before you returned? - A. Near about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your return, you heard something that appeared like a groan? - A. Yes; a groaning and scuffling in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What flurried you at that time? - A. Hearing the noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask what it was? - A. When I told her I had got the stuff, she said, not ready for it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was but a short time, from the time you went out for Miss Eyles, till you returned? - A.About a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how long was it before Miss Eyles came? - A. Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what passed then, Miss Eyles desired you to go for a surgeon, therefore it could not be very long before the surgeon, and the beadles came? - A. They followed me as soon as they came home; they were not at home.</p>

               <p>Q. Then there had not elapsed, from the first arrival of Mrs. Cox at your house, till the surgeon and headles came, above half an hour? - A. I really think it could not be more, or three quarters at most: but I had no clock. and was very much flurried.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you saw Mrs. Phipoe, she was extremely bloddy? - A. Yes, very bloody, and her singer bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she then complain? - A. Yes, she said, oh my finger.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the deceased, when you came in, after she had got down? - A. The kitchen is just as you enter the house.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner was walking in the passage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing was passing between the deceased and her? - A. No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Mrs. Benson any question upon your coming in? - A. She went up stairs; I was flurried, and went into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. You and the other women were gone out for a surgeon? - A. I went out; they remained in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Phipoe the first person you saw, when you came in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the street door open or shut? - A. I cannot say, but I think Mrs. Macdonald opened the or to me.</p>
               <p>Q.You heard a noise, that seemed to you like a scuffle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And you heard no cry out at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Something that appeared to you like a scuffle, and an, but no cry out? - A. No, none at all.</p>

               <p>Q. How long has Mrs. Benson lodged with you? - A. I think six months or thereabouts, but I did not set down the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time, what was her appearance in your house? - A. She was very well always.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever observe any thing odd about her behaviour? - A. she and I had some words once, about some china plates; she was very hard I thought upon me, as though I had broke them.</p>
               <p>Q. But her disposition in your house was that of a good natured woman? - A. I never saw any thing to the contrary, but those few words.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did she appear to be of a passionate disposition? - A. Rather passionate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to recollect, during the six months she lodged with you, that she was a woman that had her understanding perfectly? - A. Yes.</p>

             M'DONALD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. I live facing Mr. Munday's house, No. 1, Garden-street, St. George's in the East.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, on the 25th of October last, Mrs. Munday's coming to you? - A. I do; I went immediately over with her; I asked her what was the matter, I saw there was some trouble in her countenance; she left me in the passage for some time, whilst she went to fetch Miss Eyles, and a little before Mrs. Munday's return, the first thing I heard was, a heavy groaning, as if some person had been taken very poorly; the next thing I heard was Jesus Christ -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The expression of Jesus Christ, did you know from what person that voice proceeded? - A. I think it must have been from the prisoner; because the other person was not able to speak; on their return, I was just running to the door, we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060015"></xptr>went all three up stairs, I was hindmost, the two women went to the door of the prisoner; Mrs. Munday asked Mrs. Benson what was the matter with the woman, Mrs. Benson made answer, and said, nothing at all, that the woman had been i sit, but was quite recovered; Mrs. Munday said, she would go for a doctor, to which the prisoner answered, you may; Mrs. Munday again insisted upon having the door opened, what was the matter; the door was then opened the prisoner a little way, and the prisoner said, you may come in, Mrs. Munday, no other person has any business here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You say, when Mrs. Munday said she would go for a doctor, the answer of the prisoner was, you may? - A. Yes, as nearly as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. She did open the door immediately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did not I understand you, that the prisoner replied, Mrs. Munday, you may come in, but nobody else has any business here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Was the door opened wide enough for any body to go in? - A. No; the prisoner held the door with her hand; I was so situated I could see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You attempted to open the door? - A. I opened the door; the first thing that occurred to my view, was the prisoner in a very shocking condition, standing before the door, holding up her finger with a white pocket handkerchief all over blood; I said, Oh Lord! Mrs. Benson, what have you been about; she wanted me to come in, and made mention of something about money; and then I ran down stairs calling out murder.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you perceive the deceased? - A. I did, I looked at the deceased; she was between the fire-place and the bed, the bed was pulled down upon the floor; she had one hand under her head bleeding like an ox, and holding her apron with her other hand to the side the would was; every thing was bloody in the room, and the woman especially.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was she sitting upon a chair or upon the ground? - A. Upon the ground; she had an apron holding to the wound, and it looked so ghastly that I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could she speak at that time? - A. No; I said to the prisoner, good God, has the Lord left you; what have you been about, Mrs. Benson, that your passion has over-ruled reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make you any reply? - A. She said, my dear Mrs. M'Donald, look at my finger, see what she has done; I immediately ran down stairs, and left them both in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing further? - A. Not a word, till I went down stairs; before I got half along the passage, Mrs. Munday went out for somebody; I ran straight to shut the door, as I was left in trust of the house; the deceased followed me down stairs, and she took hold of me by the two hands, she was in a shocking condition; Mrs. Benson came down, and I was between the two; the deceased made a noise like t-t-t-t-t, and wanted to go out of the house; Mrs. Benson came beside me. and said, take this woman away; I got her into the passage, whether Mrs. Benson helped me or not I cannot tell, I got her into the kitchen; Mrs. Benson said, come away, Mrs. Cox; no, she says, I will not come up stairs; and then I went house and washed my hands from the blood; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You assisted the deceased in getting her into the kitchen? - A. I did, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner followed her down stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You say, when you opened the door, and was going into the room, the prisoner desired you to come in? - A. She did; and told me to look at her finger, and see what the woman had done to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked the prisoner to help you to assist her, in getting the deceased into the kitchen? - A. Yes; the Lord enabled me some how or other.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What kind of noise was it? - A. It was not a groan; I apprehend she might make a noise as if she was in a sit; Mrs. Munday asked Mrs. Benson what was the matter; she said, there is nothing the matter; Mrs. Cox has had a pain in her stomach, she has been in a fit, but she is recovering very fast.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you examine her hand to see if corresponded with the truth? - A. Yes, I did; she held her hand up, and I saw the first finger of her left hand had been cut off. The prisoner said, that there was some money lying about the room, and I looked for it, and I found, I think, three or four guineas, and there were two notes, a one-pound-note and a two-pound-note, which I found lying upon a trunk.

               <p>Q. When you came to the hospital, were you present when the prisoner was searched? - A. I was not; there was an observation I should have made of searching the prisoner before she went; there were some ladies in the room, and they said they would search the woman, but I don't know if that was done; the prisoner said, I am ready to be searched, if you will, I have got no knife about me.</p>

               <p>Q.Were they near her breast? - A. The upper part of her breast.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Were there any wounds that were likely to endanger her life? - A. I considered the wounds mortal; I conceived that the woman would die in consequence of the injury she had received.</p>
               <p>Q. By what instrument did you conceive those wounds to be made? - A. They appeared to have been made by a sharp cutting instrument.</p>
               <p>Q.Could the deceased speak? - A. She could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060018"></xptr>not speak intelligible, but she was very eager to make signs; I offered her a pen and ink, but she was not able to write; she made a kind of uttering, but not to be understood, and then shut her mouth and threw off a quantity; of air from the wind-pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the prisoner? - A. I did; I examined her hands, she had cut off one of her fingers; at least, one of her fingers was lying upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you collect from the appearance of it, how it could have happened, whether it could have happened by fighting? - A. I conceived it could not, the bone was cut-quite across; I told them I could not conceive it could be cut off by fighting; it was cut strait across, exactly in the kind of way as if you would lay it down upon a block. I sent them to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. In fact, you saw the prisoner had lost a finger? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, of course, there was a quantity of blood proceeded from the wounds? - A. There was a quantity of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. And you observed, likewise, upon the hands of the deceased there were wounds? - A. I saw three or four; the principal wound was here, (pointing to the back of his hand); which seemed to be inflicted with great violence; and if it had been all flesh, I should have conceived the hand must have been cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see the deceased? - A. I saw the woman, the first time, below stairs; at that time there was not a table spoonful of blood, she was without pulse, she had none whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue with her before you left her? - A. I sent her away to the hospital; she left the house prior to my going away; it must have been about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the difficulty of her conveying articulation more difficult the second minute than the first? - A. I was surprised to find a woman, who had lost so much blood, capable of holding up her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. According to the appearance of the wound, the difficulty of conveying an articulate found, would of course have been less a quarter of an hour after the deceased received this wound? - A. It might have been so.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, from the description you have given of the wound, you could not conceive that a person would be able to express herself? - A. There is an operation which we frequently perform, by which to dislodge any thing that may have collected in the throat.</p>
               <p>Q.But did you hear this woman speak any thing? - A.I think the found nearest resemblilng a word, was, look! look! she took a great deal of pains to convince me what instrument it was this woman had used to inflict these wounds, and some of the persons about her asked her whether it was done by a knife; I immediately desired a servant to get some knives, and three or four were brought down, these were produced to the woman, and I understood from her, that these were not the knives; by the noise, she uttered as if the prisoner took it from her pocket and ned it.</p>
               <p>Q.Then to understand you, that she herself was cap answering in that kind of way? - A. Yes.</p>

On Wednesday morning, about eleven o'clock, the deceased called upon me, and found me on the bed, she came up stairs to my apartments; I went down stairs to Mrs. Munday, when I returned, I gave her a guinea, and desired her to get me some brandy; she then shewed me a white dress, which she wished me to purchase; I gave her a guinea for the dress, and she returned me half-a-crown; she asked me if I would sell her some articles I had to dispose of; I said, if she would take the whole, she should have them, that a small sum was not an object, I wanted to make up my rent; afterwards, she asked me about my watch, and ear-rings, and I said, if you will not take the whole, it is not an object to me, I shall not give you the ear-rings nor the watch; upon that the deceased said, I suppose you want to go to London to be Mr. Courtoy's whore again-you lie, says I; to which she says, it is truth, for it was proved at the Old-Bailey, and she said, why did you not go into Devonshire to a convent, upon which nt words ensued; I was standing close to the there was a knife upon the table and she took up a green handled knife, and cut my finger off; I did not know (such was the quickness of the transaction,) what had happened, till I picked my finger off the ground; with this, I snatched something from the table; a little while after, I found myself alone in the room, covered with blood, and on the table I perceived my finger; I had some kind of a recollection, and I went down stairs, there was the deceased sitting on a chair; Mrs. Cox, says I, what made you cut off my finger? my dear, says she, it is what pleased God, and I hope God will forgive me; I looked at her, I saw her bloody, I was conscious it was her that had mangled me in this manner; then somebody about me put some questions to me; then there was a cry out, that I wanted to make my escape; I went up to my room, it was all confusion; they told me, I had murdered the woman; I recollect somebody asked me for notes, but I cannot give an accurate account about it; some woman searched me, and changed my bloody clothes; when I found myself in this situation in the room, the people dressed me, and took me to the hospital, and a little time afterwards, they put a strait waistcoat on me; I enquired repeatedly how the deceased was, and they told me she was quite out of danger, and that she said, if she recovered, she would take care that nobody should hurt me; at four o'clock I was told, there was a gentleman coming to me, a clergyman, and that the commitment was going to be made out, and I was taken up; I was told she was quite out of danger.</p>

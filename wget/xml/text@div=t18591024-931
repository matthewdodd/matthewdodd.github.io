                  </hi>. I am one of the senior clerks in the General-post-office—in consequence of some communication from the Northwestern district office I made up a letter on 4th October, in the presence of Mr. Clare—I knew at that time that the prisoner' was a letter-carrier at that office—I rolled two half-sovereigns in a piece of paper, and secured each end with a wafer, they were the property of the Postmaster-general—Mr. Clare wrote the letter; I enclosed the two half-sovereigns and the letter in an envelope addressed. to Mr. Robert Simms, 4, Harewood-mews, Harewood-place, Oxford-street, London—the envelope was addressed by Mr. Clare—I put a mark on the half-sovereigns before I put them into the paper—after I had done that and fastened up the envelope, I gave it to Mr. Clare to post—(<hi rend="italic">the fragments of a letter were here produced</hi>)—I have examined these frag<lb></lb>ments and am quite sure that they are parts of the letter that I gave to Mr. Clare—on the following morning, about 11 o'clock, I asked the prisoner about the letter—I made a memorandum of what passed—I asked him what time he came on duty this morning; he said, "About 5 minutes to 6;" I said, "What walk were you on?" he said, "The Gloucester-crescent walk;" I said, "Did you assist in dividing the letters fur the Gloucester-crescent walk?" he said "Yes;" I said, "Do you know anything of a money letter addressed to a Mr. Robert Simms, 4, Harewood-mews, Hare<lb></lb>wood-place, Oxford-street, London?" he said that he did not; I asked him if Harewood-mews was in his delivery; he said that it was not; I said, "What should you have done with a letter so addressed, if found with the letters of the Gloucester-crescent walk?" he said he should have put it out with the missorts—I then directed the officer Bingham to search him, and gave him into custody—Harewood-mews would not be on that walk—if such a letter was placed among the Gloucester-crescent walk the prisoner should have placed it among the missorts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of letter-carriers—on 4th October I wrote and directed a letter, addressed to Mr. Robert Simms, Harewood-mews, Harewood-place, Oxford-street—I saw Mr. Gardner enclose two half-sovereigns in it—it was given to me fastened with adhesive gum, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the evening of October 4th—I posted it the following morning, October 5th, about 5 o'clock, in the hole of the letter box at the chief office, St. Martin's-le-grand—notice had been previously given to those in charge at the Northwestern district that such a letter would come—after I had posted the letter on the morning of October 5th I went to the North-western office—I was there about 6 o'clock in the morning—a bag despatched from the chief office would reach the Northwestern district office between half-past 5 and 6 that morning—when I went to the Northwestern district office the prisoner was there, sorting letters at his seat—I saw him at his seat dividing his letters, and whilst dividing them he felt some letters with his thumb in this way (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—he laid several letters on one side of him, and after he had divided the letters for the district he brought those he had laid on one side out from his seat and took them to the sorting-table; whilst sorting those letters he kept feeling them, and appeared a little agitated and as if he was secreting something up his sleeve; he was fingering the letters about in his hand and pushing about his sleeve—I then saw him leave the sorting table and go to the letter-carrier's door and take up a bag that had arrived—he took it with his left hand, keeping his right hand close up with his coat sleeve, under his fingers against his breast—he took the bag with his left hand across the office, and threw it up on the</p>

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of letter-carriers at the Northwestern district—I had a communication from Mr. Clare, in consequence of which I noticed the letters which arrived on 5th October, in the mail bag—among them I noticed a letter addressed to Mr. Robert Simms, 4, Harewood-mews, Harewood-place—when I saw the letter it was signed "unopened"—it ap<lb></lb>peared to contain coin—I felt it for the purpose of ascertaining, in consequence of the information I had received from the head office—Mr. Clare had told me what he had done—the letter was enclosed under cover addressed to me—I put it at the sorting-table where the letters are sorted for the Gloucester-crescent division—the prisoner sorted there himself; he was alone at that table—there were other persons sorting at the adjoining table—I saw him sorting a parcel of letters, among which was this one addressed to Simms—I saw him leave his seat when it was about nearly half-past 6 o'clock—I instructed him to clear the letters round that were for his district—I saw him go to the table where he ought to have taken the missorted letters—he took some letters with him there—this letter containing coin, being missorted, he ought to have brought it to me.</p>

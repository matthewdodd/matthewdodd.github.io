             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you go with Mr. Pilling, any time in November last, to No. 81, Baker-street, Portland-square? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire there for a person of the name of G. H. Morris? - A. I did not go to that street, I went to Mount-street, to a public-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find the defendant at the bar there? - A. He was standing at the door; he took us up stairs to his room; it was the sign of the Compass. I found in his drawers six letters. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present when you searched the drawers and found those letters? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say about the letters? - A. Upon my word I cannot say; he said, he was only agent in the business. There was a ham and a part of a ham found. I took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Did any thing attract your notice going to Bow-street? - A. There was a letter thrown by the prisoner into an area; I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any letter drop into the area or not? - A. I did not, I saw a letter in an area.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you that letter? - A. I have not; Taylor has it.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Bow-street, who was sitting there? - A. Sir William Addington.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180073"></xptr>Q. Do you know whether, in point of fact, any regular examination was taken, and signed by the prisoner? - A. I believe not, I think not; there was an examination taken, but I do not know whether he signed it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, was the prisoner sent away from that office to be examined at any other side? - A. To Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Pilling.) Are those the letters you sent yourself, (the letters produced), in answer to the letters you received? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot prove that the prisoner was the person who sent those letters; you cannot prove them to be the hand-writing of the prisoner, therefore he must be acquitted.</p>

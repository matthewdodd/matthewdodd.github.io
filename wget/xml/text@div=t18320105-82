            . I am a Police-constable. On Thursday, the 29th of December, about eight o'clock at night, I was on duty in Kingsland-road; I saw the prisoner coming from Old-street-road, with a bag on his back; I stopped him, and asked what he had there - he said nails, which he had brought from a job on Finsbury-pavement, and was going to take them home to Austin-street till Monday, and then to take them to his master, Mr. Ogle, at Hackney; I was taking him and the bag to the station-house, but in going along he effected his escape, and was re-taken; I asked him at the station where his master lived, and where the job was; he said, as we had been so obstinate with him, he would answer no more questions; I went the same night, but could not find Mr. Ogle, nor the job on Finsbury-pavement.</p>

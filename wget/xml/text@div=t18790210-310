               <p>Lodge—on Thursday, 12th December, about half-past 4 or 20 minutes to 5, the prisoner rang at the front-door bell, and told me there was a fire in the stable yard; I said "It is impossible, there is no one there"—he said "You had better come and see"—I went as quickly as possible with him through this little gate; the stable door was locked, and the key in the lock out<lb></lb>side; it was not locked—Mr. Campbell does not keep any horses—it is a two-stall, and both stalls were bedded down for friend's horses, and there were two old cane chairs there—I did not notice any smoke before I opened the door—when I did open it there was a quantity of smoke, and the whole straw was in a blaze in both stalls; the prisoner said "Shall I run for the engine?"—I said "Certainly, as quick as you possibly can," and he went off that instant as fast as he could run—the page boy Cooper came and joined me, and I set him to pump water, and shouted for assistance—I used pails of water, and got two of the maids to assist me, and we ultimately put out the fire before the engine came—the straw in both of the stalls was burnt—one of the chairs was scorched a little and the other had just begun to take fire—I should say the engine came in less than a quarter of an hour from the time of the alarm—the prisoner came back with it—after a time I asked the prisoner his name and address—he said "My name is Budge"—Ashby the gardener, who was then present, said "No, Soper, when you worked for my father; four years ago your name was Soper"—he said "No, Budge," but Ashby said Soper was the name—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and told him to come back for a further reward—none of the family were at home, only myself, the page, and four maid servants—the gates leading into the stable yard are kept locked, and they were locked that day—there is no access from the stable to the rear; the only access is by coming into the front court and going through that little gate—I did not observe any other people in the yard—on Monday, 16th December, the prisoner called and said that he had been advised to come, as I had asked him to come, for a further reward—I asked him if he were really at work at Kensington Palace Gardens—he said "No, I have left"—he had told me on the Thursday that he was at work there; he did not say why he had left; he said he was an amateur fireman—I then took him to Mr. Campbell, and he asked what he was doing—he said that he had got an appointment that morning as engine keeper to the Metropolitan Fire Brigade—Mr. Campbell asked him to write his name and address and to call in a week; he then wrote on this piece of paper "George Williams, 10, Stanford Road, Kensington"—Mr. Campbell gave me instructions, in consequence of which I went to the station and saw the inspector—I think the fire must have been burning a very short time before I went into the stable from the fact of the two chairs, which were in the centre of the burning straw, being so little burnt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fireman at the Brompton Station, Trafalgar Square, Chelsea—that is a little over a quarter of a mile from Mr. Perk's, the corn-chandler's, Gloucester Road—on 1st December, 1878, I was on duty, and James W. Wickenden was in charge of the station at 6.28 when the prisoner came in and gave a call—what he said had no relation to the present inquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to this evidence, firstly, because it introduced that which could be made the subject of another indictment; and, secondly, because it was altogether irrelevant to the issue which the Jury was now trying</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that he was entitled to give the evidence as showing a motive on the part of the prisoner—viz., the claiming a reward, and therefore it was admissible to show that the fire in question was not accidental, but in<lb></lb>tentional</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">supported this argument, and cited the cases of Beg. v. Anthony, Central Criminal Court Sessions Paper, vol.</hi> 75, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. 110; <hi rend="italic">Reg. v. Regan</hi>, 4, <hi rend="italic">Cox's Criminal Cases, p</hi>. 335; <hi rend="italic">Reg. v. Gray; Reg. v. Bond, Central Criminal Court Sessions Papers; Reg. v. Francis, vol</hi>. 2, <hi rend="italic">Crown Cases Reserved; and Reg. v. Dossett</hi>, 2, <hi rend="italic">Carrington and Kirwan, p</hi>. 306. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE HAWKINS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">deemed it advisable that this question, which had frequently arisen, should be discussed and settled by the Court of Criminal Appeal. At present the evidence would be admitted, and, if necessary, the point would be reserved</hi>.) He called me to a house on fire in Gloucester Road, South Kensington, but did not state the number—I called Wickenden down.</p>

                  </hi>. On December 1 I was in charge of Brompton fire-station—the prisoner came there at 6.28, and I said "What is the fire?"—he said "I saw the fire coming out of the ground-floor window, it is a large house, I don't know what it is"—I ordered the manual fire-engine, and went with the prisoner to Mr. Perk's warehouse, 117, Gloucester Road—there was a fire there, and I helped to extinguish it, and then returned to the station with the prisoner—I then asked him if he could write, and gave him this paper—"The undersigned has received one shilling for calling attention to a fire, &amp;c. Signed, George Budge, 14, Napper Road, Kensington."</p>

On 2nd December, about 10 p.m., I saw the prisoner in High Street, Kensington, and said "George, you will be detained in reference to the fire at Niddry Lodge, Campden Kill, till I telegraph to Inspector Jones"—he said "I know nothing about it; I have seen Mr. Scott; he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and told me to call again. I went to see if there was any further reward"—he was charged at the station, and said "I am innocent"—I found on him an oil lamp, a pair of socks, a bunch of keys, two stamps, some matches, and a pocket-book.</p>

               <p>immediately, because it rang violently—I was at the bottom of the stairs, and I merely mounted the steps—it would be within a minute—I then went over to the stable with him instantly.</p>

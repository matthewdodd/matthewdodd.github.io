               feloniously receiving sixty-four yards of cotton, knowing it to have been stolen
            </rs>.(The case was opened by Mr. Knowlys.)</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DRAKE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What are you? - A. I am a linen-draper, in Ratcliff-highway: On the 16th of December last, I lost several pieces of striped cotton out of my shop, which I had seen eight or nine minutes before. On the 2d of January, I discovered a part at the shop of Mr Curling, a stop-seller, in Old Gravel-lane, the pieces had my mark, which I put on myself; in consequence of what he told me, he and I went to the shop of Mr. Clarke, where the defendant was introduced to me as the master; Rodgers, the officer, was waiting over the way, I asked the defendant to let me look at some ready made shirts; I found fault with all I saw, and told him I wanted a very narrow stripe; I pressed very hard, and at last the man brought me out a piece of narrow striped cotton not made into shirts; I examined it, and saw my own private mark, the defendant was not then present, but I sent Curling out to bring Rodgers; when he came, I told the shopman I wanted to see Mr. Clarke; he said, my master is below; when I saw him, I said he had got some of my striped cotton, and hoped he would tell me how he came by it; he said he did not know; I asked him what he gave per yard; he hesitated a little while, and said, I believe sixteen-pence, or sixteen-pence halfpenny; I asked him to recollect who he bought them of; he smiled, and said, I must confess I bought them of a Jew; we found several quantities out; the little narrow-stripe cost me two shillings, the others cost me one-and-twenty-pence, or one and twenty-pence-halfpenny; I asked him how they came to be cut into remnants; he said, for the convenience of his customers.</p>

            Yes, and is dead since; during his illness, the defendant managed the business, it is a wholesale warehouse for all sorts of things in a a very large way; I did not know a shop of more respectability.</p>

            Without nesitation? - A. He said, he could not tell exactly how he got it; he rather hesitated at first, but afterwards he said, he believed he bought them of a Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. Do shops of respectability buy pieces of striped cotton of people who go about the street? - A. A shop of this description, I believe, does not, they buy them wholesale, by pieces. I was rather surprised he bought them, and did not know who he bought them of.(

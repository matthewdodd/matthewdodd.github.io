               <p>I am a German, a single man; yesterday week I came from St. Edward's, to look out for a captain, to go home; I am a <rs id="t17921215-13-viclabel69" type="occupation">leather dresser</rs>

               <p>Q. What is the name of the public house? - I don't know the name; it was close by Iron Gate, in <placeName id="t17921215-13-crimeloc70">St. Catherine's-lane</placeName>

I don't like to go over the other side of the water; I am rather late. The prisoner was not the woman that I met; after the woman she told me, she would bring me into a very good house, and a room to myself, where I should not be robbed; I went with the woman, and I came to the house of the woman at the bar; I came and I asked her if I could lodge, she said yes, and what I must pay, she said 2 s. that was not the prisoner that I paid the money to, but the other woman; directly, or a little while after, this here prisoner took a knife and cut down all this side of my breeches, and the other woman took hold of this side, and the prisoner took the money out; I saw the money in her hand. I can say I had 10 Guineas and a half, silver I don't know how much; I saw the gold in the prisoner's hand; after she took the money, she took hold of me and throwed me on a little bed, and struck me on the ground by the temple.</p>
               <p>Q. What did this woman do with these Guineas? - She flung them on the table after they knocked me down. They knocked me down three times, this woman and the other both together; I got up again, and they shared the money between them together.</p>
               <p>Q. After they had taken the 10 Guineas, what became of it? - She gave it to the other girl; I saw her give it; I don't know how much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her give the money to the other? - I did not; I saw it in the prisoner's hand; and I saw them count them on the table, both together.</p>
               <p>Q. After they counted them what did they do? - Then the woman went away and the prisoner took and turned me out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see her after this? - The prisoner stood with me in the room; I could not get in any more, she turned me out.</p>
               <p>Q. Now attend to me; did you go out when she desired you? - And she shut the door behind me. I stood at the door; the watchman came past directly; and I told him I had been robbed; and I told him to get an officer; and the watchman and the officer they did not come; and I staid all night by the door myself; in the morning when it was six o'clock, I sent the watchman again for the officer, and the officer came and took her up out of the room; she was searched, and there was some gold and silver found upon her; then I carried her before a Magistrate, and she was committed. I saw her before the magistrate at the second hearing, at a house close by where they are shut up, before they go in into the Magistrates; and she told me, she would give me 5 Guineas, and I should make it up; so I believe she said, she did not take any more than 7 Guineas and a half; I told her it was 10 Guineas and a half.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time this woman ripped your breeches open, did you see her do it? - I did, she said to the man, that was along with us, that she would pay all, except a bottle of wine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are a german, you tell us? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a long parcel of money this day? - Not this day.</p>
               <p>Q. This day you are speaking of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you in the morning? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you employed in your business that day? - I was going to Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the morning was it you went into the public house? - Between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. From that time till you called the watchman, how many minutes do you think, you was out of a public house; was not you drinking from eleven o'clock in the morning, till eleven at night? - I cannot tell; I went to the captain, and from the captain, I went to look for my other friends, to go along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had you not been drinking the whole day? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hours in the day, had you not been in the constant state of drinking? - I had not drank a glass of liquor in five hours.</p>
               <p>Q. And you mean to tell us seriously you was sober when you set out at Iron-gate? - I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us how much money you had when you went to the captain? - I had 11 Guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did you spend in liquor that day? - I don't know, I paid so much. I paid away 15 s. and I bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150027"></xptr>an handkerchief; I paid 3 s. 6 d. for that; and I had 12 s. in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you in the public house, at Iron-gate, in gold, besides silver? - I had 10 Guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you at the time you counted the money there? - No body there.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your friend the landlord at Iron-gate here? - I don't know the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not brought him as a witness? - I did not ask him for a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Because he would have told us whether you was drunk or sober, when you left the house. Now you watched at this house all night, that you might know it in the morning; did not you go to another house, and insist upon going in, and charge another woman with the robbery? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never charged any other woman with this robbery? - This is the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a different thing, on your oath, that very day did not you go to another house, demand admission, and charge another woman with robbing you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take up no other woman? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the Constable at your desire? - No, he never did at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Bare was the man to whom you applied, and you swear that you was sober when you applied to Bare? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you tell us, that these women knocked you down, and while you lay on the ground, you heard money chinkling on the table? - I saw them when I was up.</p>
               <p>Q. You never attempted to lay hold of it? - I was in danger of my life; I sent on purpose for the money abroad, because I was not able to work.</p>
               <p>Q. When these people were counting the money, you lay on the ground? - They knocked me down, I got up directly after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the other woman went away with this money, and when you was alone with this woman, you was in danger of your life; she is such a great strapper, she could have eat you up; you was left alone with this woman; and then you complained to the watchman that you was robbed in the house; the watchman would not go into the house with you? - The watchman knocked at the door, and she would not open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. So the watchman did not spring his rattle, and call for assistance. I take it for granted you have the watchman here? - I don't know the watchman; I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell Bare about the watchman? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Bare found you at this woman's door? - I sent the watchman at six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You did know then where the watchman was? - I did not go away, for fear she should run away.</p>
               <p>Q. You know where to find the watchman, because you sent him for Bare? - No, I did not send him for Bare; I sent him for an officer; I did not say I don't know the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. A little while ago you said that you did not know the watchman, and yet you took him before the magistrate with you? - Mr. Bare did not tell me I was to bring him here,</p>
               <p>Q. This woman's life is to be forfeited if she is convicted of this you know, and then there would be 40 l. reward in the bargain; that would more then pay you for the 10 Guineas and a half; how came you by so much money as 10 Guineas and a half? - I received it from Messrs. Grosvenors house; my friends sent it over; I have been ill so long I cannot work.</p>

Then I went to No. 1, the next door; and there I went into the room; and there the prosecutor charged the prisoner at the bar; there was no one there but her; she was in bed; I knocked at the door; she got up and let me in; there was no money found on her.</p>

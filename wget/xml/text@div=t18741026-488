                  </hi>. I am a gold beater, at 42, Drury Lane—on 26th August I received this letter on a printed form, "Robert Ber<lb></lb>tram and Co.; Shippers and Merchants, 81, Mark Lane. Please send lowest price for deep, pale, and lemon gold"—I answered that on the 27th by 1,000 pale, arid 1,000 lemon. Should the same be sent we shall then give you a larger order"—on Friday, 28th August, I went to 81, Mark Lane and took with me 1,000 leaves of deep gold, 1,000 lemon, and 1,000 pale; the value was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw two men there, and in consequence of what they said I left the gold—they said I might leave it and call on the Saturday at 12 o'clock and I should receive a cheque—I called on the Saturday at 12 o'clock and saw the same men—I would not be sure whether the prisoner was there then—I did not get the cheque—I was told Mr. Bertram had gone to Tilbury—I asked for the gold—they said "You can't have that for he has taken the gold with him"—when I went in they said "What a pity, he has left the cheque out but has not signed it"—I went twice "on the Monday and I was told they could not see Bertram on Saturday, but would send the cheque at 2 o'clock—on the 31st August I received this letter marked "C" We shall have an answer from our customer on Wednesday next at 12 o'clock, when we doubt not we shall have an order for you, when</p>

               <p>at the same time your account will be ready"—that was given to me on the Wednesday when I went at 12 o'clock—I afterwards received this letter marked "D;" "September 2nd. You may send us 5,000 deep gold at 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per 1,000 by Saturday next, and send invoice for the whole amount at once"—the prisoner was there when I went at 12 o'clock on the Wednesday—I was speaking to the two men about it being a robbery, not being able to get the gold back again—they said it was nothing to do with them, Bertram was out and I must call again—I went again in the afternoon and saw the same two men, but could not get my gold or the money—on 3rd September I received this note from Mr. Robert Bertram, "Mr. Robert Bertram has sot sent your account but will be at the office from 10 to 2 o'clock to see you on Saturday next. You may safely rely upon your account You had better call between 10 and 11 o'clock"—I went on the Saturday and waited from 11 o'clock in the morning till past 2 o'clock—there was a ticket on the door, "Return at half-past 2"—I saw the cabman there who had been cheated the same as I had; he was waiting for his fare—the place was shut up—I went again on the following Monday and found the same ticket on the door—I saw the prisoner when he was taken into custody, and I said I wanted my gold back again, and he said he could not let me have it—he said he did not know anything about Bertram and Co., he knew Smith and Co., and I found they came from Little Britain.</p>

I live at 9, Webb Street, and am a cabman—on 4th September I drove the prisoner from Blackfriars Bridge to the Station Tavern, Walworth Road—he got out of my cab in the Manor Road, Wal-worth—he gave me this card and said "There is my card, call there any time after 11 o'clock to-morrow morning and I will pay you"—I went to 81, Mark Lane, on the following morning, the Saturday—he was not there and the place was shut up—I saw Mr. Wheatley there.</p>

I went with the last two witnesses to 20, Manor Road, Walworth, which is a private house—the prisoner came to the door—I showed him the card and said to the cabman" Is this the man who gave you this card, and did he say "This is my card, call at my office to-morrow and I will pay you'"—the cabman said "Yes, that is the man, and that is what he said"—I told the prisoner I held a warrant for his arrest, and I asked him to come up stairs—I read it to him and he said "My name is not Bertram, it is Eaton"—Mr. Wheatley said "It is very hard I should lose my gold"—the prisoner said "You shall have your gold back again, but I can't give it you"—I took him into custody—I found a number of letters on him addressed to Amos Eaton—he said ho remembered Mr. Wheatley coming to the office 81, Mark Lane one day about some gold, but he had nothing to do with the transaction; he was there at the time with a friend of his named Smith, who kept the office—I asked him where Smith lived—he said he did not know—he said "I went there to see him and he gave me that card, and that is how I came to know where he was"—I said "Did not you know he was there before"—he said "No, I did not"—I have been to the office since—it is closed—that was a few days after I took the prisoner—the name of Bertram was up then.</p>

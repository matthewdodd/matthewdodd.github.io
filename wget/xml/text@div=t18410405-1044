                  </hi>. I am a general hardwareman, and live in Beech-street, Barbican, in the parish of St. Giles Without, Cripplegate. On the evening of the 11th of March, I was in my counting-house at the back</p>

               <p>of my shop, about half-past eight o'clock, and heard glass smash—I immediately ran to the door, and met Mr. Simmonds—he pointed to the prisoner Wilson, who stood about five or six yards off—a policeman came up almost at the same moment, and he was taken into custody—Layton was standing along with him, close by his side—he followed Wilson to the station, and was then taken in consequence of what Mr. Simmonds said—he was searched, but nothing found on him of mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer. I was passing along Beech-street, about half-past eight o'clock, on the evening of the 11th of March—I saw the two prisoners together, coming in an opposite direction to me—Layton came up and <hi rend="italic">poked</hi> his arm through the window, and broke the glass—he did not take any thing out—he went on, and took no notice, but Wilson went up, put his hand into the window, took half-a-dozen spoons out of the window, and put them in his breast—they walked off, and at that moment a policeman happened to turn the corner—I pointed Wilson out the policeman, and to Mr. Aldridge who was at the door—the policeman brought him in.</p>
               <p>

I am a labourer, and live at 47, Grafton Street, Kentish Town—on 16th November I was in Newgate Market quite close to the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner put his left hand in the prosecutor's pocket and take out the watch; he gave it to another man who was along" side of him, and he put his two hands in his pocket and walked off—I went up to the prosecutor and said, "Have you lost anything?"—he put his hand in his pocket, and said, "I hnro lost my watch—I said, "There is the man that has got it"—the prisoner was then ten or twelve yards away—I went and caught hold of him, and a friend went after the other man.</p>

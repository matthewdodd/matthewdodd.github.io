I was on duty on 19th February, in the New Cross Road, Deptford, at about 1.50 a.m.—on passing The Royal Albert, I heard a noise as if money were being taken out of the till or put in in, and I waited a short time and met Howard, with the prisoner coming out of the door—I pushed them both back, and Howard said "All right policeman"—I said "Wait and we will see the landlord"—the prisoner commenced kicking me—I laid hold of one in each hand, and all three went over—after struggling up again we went over a table—the prisoner put his hand under my coat to lay hold of my person—he then made his escape, leaving his necktie and hat behind—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187504050096"></xptr>
               <p>I dragged Howard out of the door, and hallooed "Stop thief!" as I thought one of my mates might be coming down—I took Howard to the station and searched him, and found on him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers, and 4¼<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in farthings—he said the silver money was his, but the copper money was the landlord's—on the occasion in question there was a light in the bar, on, a stand underneath, as if for hot coffee or tea—I don't know which—I turned the light full on their faces—I gave evidence against Howard, at the Police Court—the same as I have given to-day—the prisoner was not before the Court then—while giving evidence I saw Montague in the body of the Court—I knew him directly by his face—he was wearing the same coat as he had on that night—not the same as he is wearing now—I had a good view of him, and I am positive that he is the man—I had not seen him or known him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ordinarily called Lizzie Perriman—I live with the prisoner as his wife at 35, Vance Street—I moved to there on the monday, the 22nd, and the prisoner was taken on the following Saturday—before that I lived at Whittington Road, Peckham—I have lived with</p>

               <p>prisoner for nearly three years—I saw him on the night of the 18th February—we parted about 8 o'clock or a little after—I left him at the top of Walpole Street, and he went to the Fireman's Arms—we previously made an appointment to re-meet at about 11.30—I returned to Walpole Street about that time, but he was not there, and I went to the Fireman's Arms and found him, and we returned home to 9, Whittington Road, arriving there about 12 o'clock—I had done three week's washing, and I went into the back room, and when I returned to the other room about 12.45 the prisoner was in bed, and I slept with him that night—I am certain he did not go out—we got up a little before 9 o'clock—I had given notice to leave that day when I did my washing, and that is the reason I remember the date.</p>

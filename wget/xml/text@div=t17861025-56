            ; I had been a servant to him a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Is he a single man? - No, Sir, a married man.</p>
               <p>How many are there in family? - A wife and three children.</p>
               <p>Have you any lodgers? - One.</p>
               <p>Where was it that this injury was offered to you? - In the fore-garret.</p>
               <p>When was it? - I cannot tell you the day, it was on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - I cannot tell exactly, a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Tell me how it happened, and what he did to you? - He came up stairs at eleven at night, and broke open the door.</p>
               <p>Was the family gone to bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did the wife go to bed? - About half after ten.</p>
               <p>Where did she sleep? - Two pair of stairs lower, in a back room; the lodgers lay in a room under me, they were man and wife.</p>
               <p>Where did this man always use to lay? - With his wife.</p>
               <p>Did you fasten your door of a night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you fasten your door that night? - Yes, double-locked it; I went up when my mistress went to bed.</p>
               <p>Where was your master then? - He was out.</p>
               <p>Did you shut the street door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How got he in? - He let himself in with a key; I had not been long in bed, he immediately broke open the door, I got up in the bed, I did not hear him break the door, he came to the bedside with a candle, and said my mistress wanted me, I told him I was coming directly; and just as I got out of bed, he pushed me backwards and blowed out the candle, and got upon the bed to me directly; he got upon me; the bed was not big enough.</p>
               <p>Did he undress himself? - He had his coat and waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>Any part of his clothes off? - His breeches were off, and his shoes and stockings.</p>
               <p>Where did he pull them off? - He pulled off his shoes and stockings in my mistress's room.</p>
               <p>How do you know? - Because he put them on in the morning when he came down; he had his breeches on when he came up in the room to me.</p>
               <p>Where did he pull them off? - In the room where I was; he got up in the bed and upon me, and put his private parts into mine, and I could not stir nor move, he would not let me, he told me if I made any noise, he would knock my brains out, I went to call out, and he put his hands before my mouth that I might not call out; he laid from eleven till seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did not he pull his coat and waistcoat off in all that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor did not he get into the bed? - No, Sir, the bed was so small he could not do otherwise; the bed is but a side-bed.</p>
               <p>He lay with you from eleven till seven? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he sleep any part of that time? - No, Sir, if he dropped in sleep, when he felt me stir or move he was awake directly, and at seven o'clock he got away; and I came down stairs and told my mistress; I got up directly afterwards; my mistress said she thought he went out of doors, but she could not get up to see, for she was ill in bed, and I could not make any noise at all.</p>
               <p>You certainly could have made a noise when he fell asleep? - If I made a noise he put his hand before my mouth and stopped my breath.</p>
               <p>You do not seem to have tried to make a noise? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. Smith, he continued in this same position from eleven to seven? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Exactly in the same position? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You mean laying upon you with his private parts in yours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He would not let you stir? - No, I offered to stir, he threatened to kill me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250117"></xptr>He was going to sleep till you disturbed him, then he got awake again? - He did not sleep but very little indeed, only little bits.</p>
               <p>But now putting all the little bits together, how many hours do you think he might have slept? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Did this business hurt you at all? - Yes, it hurt me very much.</p>
               <p>And continued to hurt you all the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This bed is very narrow? - It is not above half the width of my coloured apron; he could not lay any otherwise.</p>
               <p>They tell me it is a very ricketty bed too? - Ricketty!</p>
               <p>Aye! makes a noise when you get in and out? - No, it does not.</p>
               <p>You was hardly got into bed? - Yes, I had just dropped to sleep; my door was double-locked with a spring lock, and it was broke open with these two chissels.</p>
               <p>(Produced.)</p>
               <p>The lock was pushed back.</p>
               <p>But you never heard him till he was at your bed-side? - No, Sir, I am very heavy to sleep.</p>
               <p>Did you get any sleep during this night? - No, Sir, I did not go to sleep all night long.</p>
               <p>How high is your bed from the ground? - I never measured it; he had me lengthways upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Why did you not put down your hands and tap for the lodgers? - He had hold of both my hands all the time, and one hand on my mouth.</p>
               <p>Had such a thing never happened to you before? - No, Sir, never in my life.</p>
               <p>That you are sure of; do you remember any thing about a table in a warehouse? - No, Sir, there never was such a thing done before.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath has there never been such a thing done against a table once? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Did he pull off his breeches before he put out the candle? - No, after he put out the candle.</p>
               <p>Did you help him to pull off his breeches? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you did not help him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How did he do it? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did you not go down before he did? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you go for his shoes and stockings? - No, I did not, I went down to do my business, and to tell my mistress; I left him in the work-shop without shoes or stockings.</p>
               <p>Did not your mistress say to you, what have you been laying with your master all night? - No, Sir, she did not.</p>
               <p>Then you never told her that you had not lain with him all night? - No, Sir, I told her immediately of it, when I came down in the morning.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you never tell your mistress that you had never lain with him? - I stand by that.</p>
               <p>What did you say the first thing to your mistress? - I asked her if she did not know whether my master was with me; she said she did not, she said she thought he was out of doors.</p>
               <p>What you said, pray, Madam, do not you know my master has been with me all night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your mistress turned you away, I believe? - No, she did not, my aunt took me away, Mr. Hodge went and made his brags at the public house the next morning, that was the way my aunt knew of it, a man let my aunt know of it.</p>
               <p>How often have you and Mrs. Marshall and her husband talked this over in the course of last week? - I never did talk any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively, that you did not talk it over yesterday what you should say in Court? - Sir, he never did teach me, nor his wife.</p>
               <p>How long was it day-light before this man got up from you? - It was not daylight long.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you when he got up? - No, Sir, only if I would get his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250118"></xptr> shoes and stockings for him, he would go out; I did not go for them.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Merry is the lady that lived in the floor under you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you tap at her door as you went down? - No, I did not tell her till a good bit after.</p>
               <p>When did you tell her? - I told her it before my aunt came.</p>
               <p>So this man as soon as he got his ends of you, lay quiet till the morning? - He would not let me move.</p>
               <p>Did he move himself? - No, he did not from that time till the morning.</p>

               <p>I am aunt to this girl.</p>
               <p>When did you hear this girl's having received any injury by this Hodge? - The next morning a man came and told me to come up to my niece, that Hodge had ruined her; I went directly up stairs, and made the best of my way to the prisoner, where I saw the girl sweeping the shop; I cannot say whether it was ten or eleven in the morning; I went into the parlour to Mrs. Hodge, and Mr. Hodge's father, as I was told, was there; I said it was a very sad affair, and they said a very sad affair indeed; I bid the girl look up her clothes, and come with me; my husband and I took her up before a Magistrate directly, the same day.</p>
               <p>How came you to take her before a Magistrate? - Because she said her master had been the ruin of her, and had been in bed with her; when I came from the office, I came to take her things.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the girl? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Nor look at her linen? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was she never examined by any surgeon? - Not to my knowledge, nor I dare say she was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You thought it was a sad thing that this girl should have these liberties taken with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And therefore you took her away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you how often this sort of thing had happened to her? - I heard nothing but what she said at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing of a table in the workshop? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to the girl before you spoke to the mistress? - I cannot tell what I said to her.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell her she was an impudent hussey, to suffer men to do these things? - I might say, it was a sad thing; I cannot say her answer.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen this bed, where this is supposed to have happened? - I did go up stairs, but I was alarmed; I cannot give you any particular description.</p>
               <p>You are a married woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you think it possible to have lain all night in that situation by the side of her, or in any other way without her consent? - I cannot say; it is a small bed, like a child's bedstead; I did not go close to it.</p>
               <p>How old is this girl? - I cannot be punctual whether she is fifteen or sixteen.</p>
               <p>Is not she nineteen? - I cannot be punctual, I do not think she is so much.</p>

               <p>Court. It is a very brutal thing, for which this fellow deserves to be punished in a way more severe than he has been, or will be; to be sure, taking any method to persuade a girl, his servant, of this age, in his house, under his protection, he having a wife and three children, one cannot presume any thing more brutal and beastly than his conduct; but as to a rape, there is no pretence.</p>

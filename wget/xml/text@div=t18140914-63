On the 20th of July last, I went to my club-feast, on returning from my club-feast, this happened between twelve and one o'clock. My club-feast was at the Horse and Leaping Bar, Whitechapel. I was returning home between twelve and one; the prisoner knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a dark night - A. No, it was not very dark. He passed me twice, and when he came on my right hand side, he knocked me down, and left me bleeding upon the bare stones. I do not know what he knocked me down with; I did not see a stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any wound - A. Yes; on the right side of my head. After he knocked me down, he took my shawl off my neck, he ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner - A. About half an hour afterwards; I saw him in the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing him - A. He passed me twice; I had a full view of his face. I am positive as to his person; he is the man that knocked me down.</p>

            . I was in company with the last witness. I saw her knocked down; I called out stop thief; they pursued him near half an hour, and as soon as I saw him, I knew him; I said, that is the man that took the shawl off her neck; it was light enough to perceive the prisoner, it was a starlight night. I saw the prisoner afterwards in the watchhouse; I knew him again directly.</p>
               <p>THOMAS - . I am a post-boy. In my way home to my wife, in Fashion-street, on this night, I saw two men pass me, I can only swear to one of them, that is the watchman; it was about half past twelve. I saw a man coming before the watchman. I picked up a shawl in my way back. I heard the watchman cry out stop thief; I went back to see if he wanted any assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner taken - A. Yes; I saw the watchman take the prisoner. When the prisoner was taken, he was running as fast as he could; he lost one of his shoes; we went back and found it. The prisoner was running first, and the watchman pursuing him. The prisoner is the man that the watchman took.</p>

The prisoner was coming towards me, I saized him by the breast; he was running as hard as he could run; he tore away from me, and tore my finger-nail. I cried stop thief, pursued him, and took him again at last.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, of 16, Princes Street, Stamford Street, Blackfriars—I knew the prisoners' child, Lois Wagstaff; it was fourteen months old—they lived at ; the male prisoner is a wharf labourer—I have known the prisoners for three years, and the child from its birth; it bad always been very delicate—it had a cough—it had cut its other teeth with a cough, and now it had cut another tooth through its illness with a cough; it cut one through with a fortnight's illness—I saw that it was worse, and we called for "the elders;" that was on the Wednesday, a fortnight after, as the child was taken worse on the Tuesday; it was not well before that, and we had called for them on the Sunday previous—it died on 22nd January—we called for the elders a fortnight before its death; we had it anointed several times during the fortnight—when the elders came they anointed the child's chest, and offered up many prayers to the Lord on behalf of the child; it got a little better for a short time, then it was worse again—we anointed it with oil such as they use in the church—we rubbed over the part where the pain was—I don't know what oil it was; it is what is used in the3, White Horse Yard, Westminster Road church—I believe our brethren pray over it before they use it—my impres<lb></lb>sion was, from my own experience, that the anointing did good—when the child got worse we called in the elders again; it was anointed several times after that—we had two elders from our own church, and two from a church in Essex—there are several churches in Essex—I did not ask them to come, they called to see us—that was done several times; anointing the child, and praying over it—nothing more was done, except nourishment we gave it all the nourishment we could think of, barley water, new milk, port wine, corn flour, and gruel, and we beat up a new-laid egg once for it, and we gave it a little brandy-and-water, very weak—that was the last tiling we gave it before it died; it did not take much; we gave some once before, very weak; that was during the fortnight—the child revived a little after we gave it, we thought it did it good—the mother devoted most of her time to the child during the fortnight—the father was out net work during the day—he was at home in the evening—he attended to it</p>

               <p>when he was at home—he was very kind and affectionate towards it—no doctor was called in—nobody suggested calling in a doctor—we have not done so since we have been living to the Lord—before we were brought into the light of the Gospel we always had a doctor in case of illness—we are not pressed by the church not to call in a doctor, but that is the doctrine that is preached, have faith and trust in God for our body as well as for our soul—the mother holds those opinions also—if I was unwell I should not call in a doctor—I have been ill several times, and I have always called for the elders—I have been severely afflicted with small-pox and different things, but have not had a medical attendant.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Walworth, and am summoning officer to the Coroner—in consequence of hearing of the death of this child, I went on Wednesday afternoon to 3, White Horse Yard, Westminster Road—I there saw the mother, the last witness, and two male persons—I believe the father was not at home—I saw the body of the child—upon examin<lb></lb>ing it I wished to know who the medical man was—I was told that no medical man had seen the child—I said, "The child has been ill more than a fortnight, and not call in a medical man? you are not in a position to have the child buried; if you had called in a medical man there would have been no occasion for my being here"—the mother said no more than that she trusted in the Lord—I then asked her what religion she termed herself—she said they were "Peculiar people"—I said it was a sect I had never heard of, I thought it was very peculiar indeed—I then took the name of the witness, Mrs. Hadley, being present at the death—I wished to know if they had called in any neighbour—they said, "No"—I reported the case to the Coroner, and he gave an order to Mr. Donahoo to open the body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 19, Westminster Bridge Road—the witness, Mrs. Hadley, called upon me for a certificate of the child's death; as I had never seen it, and knew nothing about it, I called at the place, and saw the child dead—I then sent her to the Coroner's officer—I afterwards examined the child—I found no marks of external violence—I opened the chest—I found the child had suffered from acute inflammation of both lungs, on the right side first, then on the left—that on the left side had been going on for about eight or ten days, on the right side perhaps for about five; with that exception, the rest of the body was quite healthy—in all probability the child's life would have been saved if proper remedies had been used at the commencement of the disease—the symptons must have been very urgent, from the extent of the inflammation—any ordinary person must have seen that there was great distress, a good deal of fever, difficulty of breathing, and such like; it would be evident to any ordinary observer; it is a very distressing thing to see a child labouring under such a disease—it ought to have been leeched in the first instance, and small doses of antimony administered—I don't think weak brandy and water would do much harm, certainly no good—port wine would not be proper—I should not administer any stimulant to a child with that state of chest—I complain rather of what was not done; the remedies I speak of ought to have been applied—the oil would do neither good nor harm—in my judgment, if a medical man had been called in tolerably early, in all probability the child's life would have been saved—there was nothing the matter with it but the chest—it could not have coughed very much, there might have been a little cough, but latterly it could not have coughed anything to speak of; the lungs being injected with blood, there would not be air enough to draw out the cough, and there was a good deal of effusion in the pleura—I have known many cases where persons have lost one lung and yet have lived on; they have coughed then, that would be a chronic state—there are some differences between medical men as to the use of phlogistic means; there have been the phlogiston and the antichloristic—one of the most distinguished men in the profession in modern times was considered to have gone too far in the phlogistic line—this case would be accompanied with a good deal of fever—the system of the gentleman referred to was in favour of the administration of brandy, largely, I have read the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi>, and I know it has been supposed by able men that he may have caused a danger to society by making people take more drams than was good—the woman explained that the quantity of brandy she gave was very small, and if that was the case it would not be of much conse<lb></lb>quence—it would be of no moment—inflammation of the lungs is a very serious thing, and very often under the most successful treatment it kills people, in spite of all that can be done—it may sometimes make secret advances, so that persons without skill might not exactly know that the thing was so serious, but I don't think that would be so in this case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mary Wagstaff's Defence</hi>. Respecting the cough, the child had cut six teeth, and with each tooth it had had a cough, and during this illness it had a very bad cough; at times the <hi rend="italic">phlegm</hi> would rise in its throat. Towards the last it coughed very much, not loudly, but very often. We gave it every kind of nourishment we could think of—arrowroot, sago, and different things that I could get, new milk and eggs, and every<lb></lb>thing</p>

               <p>I could possibly get. Since I have been with these people, of course I have held the same views, and I have many times proved the Lord in such cases. I believed that He would do the same now. I did not know that I was breaking the law or going contrary to it. If I have done anything wrong it has been through ignorance, but I am not guilty of causing the child's death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thomas Wagstaff's Defence</hi>. I don't know that I have anything more to say than what my wife has said; I am of the same opinion. I feel sorry if I have done anything contrary to the law. I feel that, as I love the Lord, I must be one to keep the laws of my country, and be a peace-maker instead of a peace-breaker. I should not like to break the law; I want to keep peace with all men. I feel that the Lord has done much for me, if I put my trust in Him, as commanded by His word and teaching—I do not feel that I have done anything wrong. I have been kind to my children, and done all I could for them.</p>

I said, I cannot; put your hands into my pocket and feel, I have no more, I have nothing here but my keys; he said, I live just by, I will show you the shop where I live, go over with me, I will take no advantage of you, but take care what you do; it is only to give you a bill of the shop, that you may not forget where I live; upon that I went over with him to the shop; I said, I don't want to go into the shop, for I was afraid of confederates, as I was all alone; but I went into the shop; he called out to two women that were sitting there, give me a bill of the shop this minute; they gave him one, and he gave it to me, then he asked again if I had no money; I told him, I had not, and then we parted; it was a trimming shop, two doors on the Westminster side of Cragg's court; it is now turned into a milliner's; all those people are gone away. My first idea was to go to my lawyer; I recollected that I had been weak enough to give him money, for before I parted with him, he said, be sure you come, for remember you have given me money; that was the burthen of his song, be sure you come, remember you have given me money. I went part of the way next morning to my attorney, and then upon reflecting how weak I had been, I thought it better to comply with my appointment; accordingly I wrapped up five guineas in a piece of paper; I passed the shop, looked into it, and turned up a little alley; he presently followed me, and I gave him the five guineas. Sir, said I, this is a wretched way of getting money, and I am a wretched fool for giving it you, but as I have been a fool in the first instance, I cannot help it, and I must pay for my folly; he received it with the greatest thanks; he asked for a few shillings to buy a pair of breeches; I gave them to him; he said that he was extremely poor; that he had no manner of living; his creditors were numerous, and he was forced to this. I said, though I have been injured by you, I am sorry to see a poor fellow creature in this way; that was I a great man, I would even compassionate a poor man; he then asked me if I could get him a place. I gave him a false direction, and a fictitious name, and then came away.</p>
               <p>I believe it was a long time before you saw him again? - About seven days after that, as I was going along.</p>

               <p>I do not know that there is any occasion to particularize what passed on the other meeting; at last by advice of your attorney and friends, you apprehended this man? - I got a couple of constables, and apprehended him in Lincoln's-Inn, where I had appointed him to meet me to give him twenty guineas; he was taken to Sir John Fielding's office; I went; I had given in an information at Sir

            's, when you made this charge against him? - He offered to fall down upon his knees, and ask my pardon in the most submissive manner; he said, Sir, I ask your pardon ten thousand times over! I declined accepting any such submission, and was bound over to prosecute.</p>

               <p>The person you met in the park you had never seen before? - Never.</p>
               <p>He was in a very shabby dress? - Yes, in a shabby large great coat.</p>
               <p>Where did you first see him? - By the lamp, just by Carleton house, where he spoke to me; he was just by the first lamp, about one hundred yards from the Mall.</p>
               <p>Were many persons passing by? - There were persons passing by, a few, when first he spoke to me; it was so light that one could discern, but it was not moon-light, nor was it a bad night.</p>
               <p>How far off does the centinel stand? - It was some way before we came to the centinel, and I in the course of conversation inclined down to the left.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030034"></xptr>How far was you from the centinel, when he first laid hold of you? - I dare say farther than the length of this court.</p>
               <p>You did not turn about to go to the centinel at all? - No, for till he seized me, I had no ideal what he meant.</p>
               <p>Then you must have passed some centinel? - I do not, remember we passed any centinel; I believe there is not one between the Spring-garden gate and Carleton house.</p>
               <p>When he laid hold of you, you was within the distance of being heard by the centinel? - I was as much afraid of being heard as he was; when he made use of the word attempt; I was afraid of confederates; I was afraid it was a laid scheme.</p>
               <p>There were no arms produced by the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the fear that you had was that there might be other confederates? - My fear was of my character.</p>
               <p>You thought there might be other people concerned? - I did not know.</p>
               <p>The man did not know where you lived? - No; he told me the last time that he knew where I was to be found, but I do not know that he did; I lived then in Lancaster-court, and I go often down to Westminster, and therefore could not avoid him.</p>
               <p>Going the next day with the five guineas was a voluntary act of your own? - Going with that was in consequence of the advantage I had given him, by giving him the first money, because I thought to have got rid of him by that.</p>
               <p>But you might have called out? - I was afraid of confederates.</p>
               <p>But the soldier, the centinel, could not be a confederate? - I feared, that if I had called out he might have confederates, who might accuse me to the soldiers.</p>

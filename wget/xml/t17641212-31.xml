               <p>The goods mentioned were put into a case entered at the Custom-house, for Hamburgh, and delivered to the proper officers on the keys, on the 6th of November, and put down on some trunks: the prisoner was seen to have hold of a bag, and shake it, which appeared to have this case in it; but no account could be given who put it in the bag, and the prisoner did not attempt to take it away.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, said, he was just come up on a furlough from Tilbury fort, having lately come from the West Indies; and landed out of a Gravesendboat, and was going along the key: that he never saw the box or bag till before my Lord Mayor: that he was asking his way to Tower-Hill, to receive his prize-money for taking Martinica, when they took him: that he had been twenty-six years and four months in the King's service.</p>

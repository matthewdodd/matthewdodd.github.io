Kent came up with a Load upon his Back, and Bird with two long Pieces rolled up under his Arm, which seemed to me to be Cloth, and Kent put the Goods into a Closet in his Room: Seeing this, I had a Suspicion they had been a robbing: They went out again, and I followed them: They went to the Prosecutor's House: The Prisoner at the Bar went into the Cellar, and Kent stood at the Top of the Stairs, receiving the Goods from the Prisoner, and putting them into a Bag. Says I, what do you do here? Says Kent, Damn you, as you are come, take this up, and carry it away; and I being in Liquor, fell down before I had got a Stones-throw. When I came to Ken t's House, I fell down upon the Stairs, with a Load upon my Back. When I came up Stairs, the Goods were all in the Middle of the Room; then they took the Goods up again, and went away: When we got to Grub-street, says Kent, Pritchet, you may go back again now. Said I, you may as well let me see where the Goods go now. No, by G - d, says he, you shall not. When I came back again, the Goods were all gone. Says Kent to me,

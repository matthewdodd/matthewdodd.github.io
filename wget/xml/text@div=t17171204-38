The Prosecutor and his Wife depos'd, The Prisoner had liv'd with them as a Servant about a Quarter of a Year; during which Time she behav'd herself very diligently, which engag'd them so much, that she coming to them so bare in Cloaths they were asham'd to send her out of an Errand, they therefore let her have Money before-hand to buy her a Gown and Petticoat; and also a Demand being made upon her, and a Menace of Arresting her for 30 s.(which she said was for curing her of the King's-Evil, which which they suppos'd to be true; but were since inform'd it was more her own Evil than the King's, in that she was flux'd for it at Kingsland) they offer'd her the Money to pay the Demand, to make her easy. But it happen'd on the Time before-mention'd, that he and his Wife went out about 7 a-Clock in the Morning to take leave of some Friends that were going into the Country, leaving only her and a Child at Home; that returning about an Hour after, they found not the Prisoner at Home, but suspected nothing. Supposing she might have gone out upon some necessary Occasion or other; till expecting her some considerable Time, the Prosecutor's Wife went up, and trying the Hasp of the Trunk in which the Money was, found it, as she thought, fast, and so search'd no farther; But she not returning in the Afternoon, the Prosecutor went up and examin'd, and found the Hasp had been unnail'd, and hung on again with a Nail or two of a Coach, and opening the Trunk, found the Money and Rings were taken away; that thereupon he went in quest of her, but could not hear of her for some considerable Time. Till at last, being directed to enquire for her at one Mr. Lloyd's, a Whitechappel-Cours Officer, near Ratoliff-Highway. Upon his going thither, he saw the Prisoner's Gown and Petticoat on Lloyd's Maid's Back, and was inform'd that the Prisoner went for Lloyd's Sister, and there was directed by Lloyd to Poplar, where he found she had taken a House, and furnish'd it with good Goods, all new, the Pewter,&amp;c. of which were mark'd with the Prisoner's Name, which, he said, must be bought with his Money, in that she had not a Shilling in the World when she came to live with him; that then he apprehended her. Another Evidence depos'd, That after she was apprehended she told him, that she was sorry she had done the Fact; and when he press'd her to make her Master what Restitution she could, she said she had but one Farthing left, but in Newgate would make a Confession to the Prosecutor's Hearts Content; and desir'd she might be sent to Newgate rather than the Gatehouse, because she had some Accomplices, and there were Persons that were endeavouring to apprehend them, and, she said, if she were sent to the Gatehouse, they would apprehend that her Master would make use of her as an Evidence against them, and so would be the inore shy; but if she were sent to Newgate would think themselves more out of danger, and would appear more publickly. But, notwithstanding, she deny'd it all upon her Trial, only that she said she chose rather to go Newgate than the Gatehouse, because it stood more convenient for her Friends to come to her. The Court, asking her, Why she went away in that manner? She answer'd, Because she was afraid of being Arrested; and as for the Goods, she said they were another Person's. The Fact was very plain, and accordingly the Jury brought her in <rs id="t17171204-38-verdict197" type="verdictDescription">

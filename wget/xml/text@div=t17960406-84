No such conversation passed; there was not a word of the kind mentioned to him; when we first took him, he said, there were two square piano-fortes taken from Mr. Longman and Broderip's, one he had sold to Mr. Walker, of Hackney, and the other to Mr. Cooke of Cooke's-court, Lincoln's-inn-fields; Mr. Davies, and Peach, and I, went with him to Hackney, and we saw this instrument that is now here; the prisoner looked at the instrument, and said, that was the instrument that he had stolen out of Mr. Longman's warehouse; this is the instrument, I know it by marking it with my initials.</p>

               <p>Mr. Davies. I was present at Walker's, when Peach and Mr. Holland were there; I heard the confession that the prisoner made; this is the instrument that he confessed he had stolen from Mr. Longman's; I put my name in it at the time.</p>

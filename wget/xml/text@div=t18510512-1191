                  </hi>. I am independent, and live at Thomas-street, Isling<lb></lb>ton. On Sunday morning, 19th April, about one o'clock, I was in Popham-street, Islington, with Ann Thompson—the prisoner and two others came up and <hi rend="italic">hustled</hi> us—I asked the reason, and the two who have not been taken struck her, and the prisoner knocked me down—I saw some flowers in his coat—I found him on me, and his hand in my left-hand trowsers pocket—we both cried "Police!"—I held the prisoner by the hand, till just as the ser<lb></lb>geant came up, who laid hold of him about ten yards from me—I gave him in charge for an assault with attempt to commit a felony—Ann Thompson said, "That is the man; he has some flowers in his coat"—he threw them away in the constable's face—as we went to the station he struggled violently, and hit and kicked the constable Elson.</p>

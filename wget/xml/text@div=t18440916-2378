On the 10th of Dec. the prisoner came to my omnibus, at New-cross, about eight o'clock, and said he wanted to be put down at Westminster-bridge—he hailed me at a dark part of Westminster-road—on getting down he gave me a half-crown, and asked me for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out—I gave it him—he took it, and was running off very quick—I kept the half-crown in my hand—I bit it, and found it was bad—I stopped the prisoner, and said, "You have given me a bad half-crown"—he said, "I have no more money about me"—I</p>

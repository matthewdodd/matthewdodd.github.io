On the 29th of January, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop - Fisher was serving; I was coming down stairs, and saw him striking at Fisher across the counter - as soon as I got to the bottom of the stairs Fisher cried out, "Stop him;" I went after him, and laid hold of him just outside the door - I brought him back, and went for a watchman, as Fisher said he had stolen some cigars - he denied it; before the constable came I saw him throw ten cigars out of his pocket - he was taken to the watch-house, and three more found on him; he told the constable of the night to put those by themselves, for he could prove where he got them- he said nothing about the ten thrown away; he wished to make me a recompense, which I refused.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask you next day what I had done? A. Yes, and if it could be settled; I said it could not; I never said, "You must come something very handsome."(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

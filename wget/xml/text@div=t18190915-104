I was attacked by a gang of fifty or sixty, armed with bludgeons - they knocked me about very much, and cut me in a great many places in a most shameful manner - in fact I was nearly killed. They took my watch, my hat, and one shoe; my pockets and my fob were cut. I called for assistance, and was pulled into a booth - I can swear the prisoner is one who took an active part in the gang. I had seen him in the fair before; I took particular notice of him then, and saw him come up with the others when they attacked me. I could distinguish no one after they began the attack. I was all over blood. Some of them called out,</p>
               <p>"Murder him!" The prisoner did not take my property, but he was one of the gang. I afterwards went to Bow-street, and saw him come up the steps (not in custody), and gave him in charge, as I recognized him.</p>

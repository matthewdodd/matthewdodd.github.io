                  </hi>. I was married to the prisoner on 26th February, 1872, at the parish church, Marylebone—I knew that he was a married man—he told me that his wife went away four different times and robbed him of what he had, and he said she was not worth living with—he told me that the last time she went away was five years next Christmas—that would be two years before I married him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He never deceived me in any way—he works for me and I work for him—I don't intend to desert him—he has been a good husband—we got married at the parish church—I am a Roman Catholic—we did not go to our own chapel, because it would take too much time going and coming, and that is the truth.</p>

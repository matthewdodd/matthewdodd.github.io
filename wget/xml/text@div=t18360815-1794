                  </hi>. I am cook to Nathaniel Garland, Esq., who occupies the dwelling-house, No. 5, Upper Berkeley-street. At the latter end of June or beginning of July, my master lent me a watch for the use of the kitchen—on Tuesday, the 5th of July, it was hanging on a hook in the kitchen-shelf, two shelves above the dresser, not so much as a yard and a half high—it was a gold watch, but the outside was a green case—it was very old fashioned—between ten and half-past ten o'clock that morning, I had been cleaning my kitchen, and went from the kitchen to the back part of the premises, and when I came in, I saw the prisoner in the middle of the kitchen—he was a stranger to me—I asked him what he wanted—he said, "Are there any orders for the green-grocer?"—I said, "You do not come from our green-grocer's"as I knew their people, they had served us for upwards of six months—he made no answer, but ran out of the door very much confused, and ran up the area steps—I turned my head, and missed the watch instantly—I ran after him—he slammed the area-gate in my face as I was going to take him—when I got to the top of the steps, to open the gate, I saw him turn the corner by the public-house, and saw no more of him—I gave a description of him, and he was taken a few days after—I am quite sure he is the same</p>

               <p>person—I had never seen him before—master values the watch at five guineas, but I do not understand these sort of things—my master is not here—the watch has not been found.</p>

DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think I understood you to say the person who came in was pursued by you till he got round the corner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I then lost sight of him—there was another person taken into custody on my information, who was found in the street at the time I was running after the man—I gave that man into custody, because I thought he belonged to the party—it was the first person that looked similar to him—that person has been discharged—he was not the man that took the watch—he was similar to him, but not quite the features of the man—when I took him I did not believe him to be the person who was in the kitchen, but to be a companion—eight or nine days, I think, elapsed before I saw the prisoner—I have not made a mistake, certainly—I was not particularly flurried—I was positive as to the person—he was in custody when I saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Thursday, the 7th of July, I saw the prisoner in Montague-square, about ten o'clock in the morning, with one Newland, who is about nineteen years old, and three or four inches taller than the prisoner—I knew the prisoner before—I took him into custody—the girl saw him on Saturday, the 9th of July—I took Newland up who was with him first—they were in company toge<lb></lb>ther when I first saw them—the prisoner waited at the post, looking out at the corner of the square—he had his back towards me, and I came up and secured him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> After you took Newland, did not the prisoner come up and ask what you took him for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—nothing of the kind passed—he did not see me till I secured him—I was in plain clothes—no officer was with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> This man has taken a false oath—as he took Newland, I walked up, and asked him what he took him for—he said, "I want you also"—Newland got away—he took me to the station-house, and said nothing to the Magistrate about me—I was remanded till Thursday—on Saturday, he caught Newland again, and we were re<lb></lb>manded again—the Magistrates gave Newland six weeks.</p>

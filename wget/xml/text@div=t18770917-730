                  </hi>. I am living with my uncle, Admiral Sir Adolphus Slade, at 3, Hyde Park Place—in 1869 I was travelling with my mother in Turkey, where I was introduced to Theodorides at the house of some friends—I saw him only a few times in Constantinople, and later in 1872 he called on my mother in London—he continued to see me, and I made an engagement to marry him in the Summer of 1873—I addressed letters to him and received letters from him—he said it was always best to destroy letters because people might find them, and he also told me that he always destroyed mine, and he advised me to destroy his, which I did soon after receiving them—the engagement was broken off in the Summer of 1874—it extended over about twelve months—I addressed a few letters to him, I think, in 1875, after the engagement was over—the engage<lb></lb>ment was renewed again, but only for about a month, and then it was finally broken off—soon after that I asked him for my letters; he first of all said that he had destroyed them as I had his—I several times asked him to give me my letters back, and he said my mother was prejudicing his character, that was in September, 1875, I think; and he kept the letters for that reason—that was after he said he had destroyed them, but when I asked him for them again he said he had kept them—I did not believe that he had destroyed them all—no other letters of a friendly character passed between us—T saw him once in 1876, in the Park, I think it was—I had not seen him to speak to him previous to that—I also saw him in the Park this year, in June—he asked me if I had any emnity towards him—I answered "No"—he asked me if I was sorry I had not marrid him—I said "No"—he then said he was in great distress, he had had some unfortunate specula<lb></lb>tions and had lost everything, and would very likely be made a bankrupt, in which case all his papers might be examined, and my letters as well, to prevent which 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be necessary to enable him to pay off his most pressing debts—I said I could not give him that sum of money—he said that my letters were in the hands of two other people, and, there<lb></lb>fore, if I wished to get them I must pay that sum—I said I would consult my friends about it, my trustees, and he made me swear that I would not tell anybody until he gave me leave to do so—nothing more passed then, but he wrote to me two or three letters asking me to meet him and</p>

               <p>My dear Miss Slade,—I have not yet answered Mr. Golero, expecting to hear from you. If by to-morrow's post I do not receive any answer to my Wednesday's letter I shall understand you wish to leave out of my hands this unfortunate affair. Without ex<lb></lb>plaining to Mr. Golero what the papers are I will tell him they are different papers concerning you, and that he had better come and see you, and then you can make whatever arrangement you like. I tried my best to save you and your dignity, and as I tell you, by to-morrow Mr. Golero ignores what the box contains and shall not know it from me. Unfortunately, the 18th is not far off, then I shall have done with the matter. The remaining letters in my possession you can have. Those which are out of my hands, and which are, as you know, dreadful, can be got by the 18th, provided I know by to-morrow's post the answer for Mr. Golero. Again tell me what are your wishes. What can be managed privately and confidentially now for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., God only knows what will be afterwards. Constantine Theo<lb></lb>dorides.") There is a reference thereto Wednesday's letter—I had received the letter from him on the Wednesday, and I had received other letters—I tore up the first ones and sent my maid into the Park to fetch the eight letters to which he referred—he said he would give me the remaining letters for a sum of money, and some of my mother's; there were eight altogether—the third time I saw him he said that he had no more letters, except eight, which were all in Golero's hands—I only saw him three times—I cannot fix the date—this other letter is in his writing, it is partly in French and partly in English. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th July</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">signed Constantine Theodorides</hi>, 27, <hi rend="italic">Bishopsgate Street, stating that he had received an anonymous letter; that he had seen Golero, who had promised not to open the box, except before him; that there were seventy-four Utters in it of Miss Slade's. and also a few of her</hi>

Signed</hi>, Your devoted Theodorides.) There is an allusion there to an anony<lb></lb>mous letter—I suppose I did not sign my letter—on the 18th Golero came to my uncle's house—he sent up a card, but I refused to see him—I then received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in consequence of which I communicated with Mr. M'Coan—after the prisoners were given in custody a large travelling box was brought to the police-court, carried by Sergeant Butcher—all the letters in it were addressed to Theodorides—seventy-four of them were de<lb></lb>livered to me, besides which there were fifty, I think, in the large trunk, but there were hundreds of others—there was nothing but letters in the box—I have destroyed the seventy-four letters and the fifty taken from the trunk—all those were letters which I had written to him during the engagement—I do not know the writing on this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) "Prince's Gate Hotel," but it is in the same writing as Golero's were—here are names in it of friends of my family, please not to read them out—the whole of this one (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>) is in Theodorides' writing, but I am not quite certain about the bottom, it is written rather quicker—this one, the third, is in the same writing as Golero's letter—this address, "Prince's Gate Hotel," is Theodorides' writing, but I say nothing about the others—the writing in ink corresponds with Golero's letter.</p>

Theodorides did not visit at our house on the Continent, not till he Came to London—he visited at my mother's house—he was connected with people of wealth in Constanti<lb></lb>nople, and was received at my mother's house in England, but I do not live with my mother; that was where I renewed my acquaintance with him and became engaged to be married to him—it was I who broke off the engage<lb></lb>ment, because my friends objected to it and bis friends also—many letters passed between us of an affectionate character such as might fairly pass between a young lady and gentleman who were engaged; that was the nature of the correspondence—my friends did not know of my engagement except ray own family, and I was unwilling that it should be known—his position had altered very much from the time I first knew him—I have no doubt he was in a deplorable state of poverty; he told me he was very badly off, and I believed it—no arrangement was made about taking a house with a view to our marriage; he took a house, but it was not for that, because he was going to take another one afterwards; he took a small house for the time being, which be gave up in a very short time and took another one in South Kensington, near my mother—I never met him anywhere but at my mother's house—he appeared to be in decent circumstances when I knew him originally, but I am hardly able to form an opinion—I met him at other places in Constantinople besides my mother's house—his sister is mar<lb></lb>ried to a person of some distinction and wealth, and he had held a confi<lb></lb>dential position in that house—he was still in a good position when I broke off the engagement—I have reason to know that he lost that position—I am not quite sure if it was in 1874 when I broke off the engagement first of all—the second time was in 1875, but I never keep a diary, and it is rather difficult to remember—he never took any steps to enforce the marriage—he never gave me any annoyance till I met him in the Park—he then seemed badly dressed, different to the way he dressed previously—it was by Theo<lb></lb>dorides'</p>

                  </hi>, I am a. barrister, and live at 3, Kensington Gate—I am a friend of Miss Slade's family—I knew Theodorides in Con<lb></lb>stantinople, but not intimately—about 18th or 20th July, Miss Slade made a communication to me and I consulted Messrs. Lewis and Lewis, on the 23rd, or 24th July—I called at Theodorides' lodgings, 13, Rathbone Place, but he had gone to the City—I then went on in an omnibus and overtook him and Golero in Holborn together—I got out and joined them—I had known Golero many years before in Constantinople, and recognised his face and name—I had the two letters of Theodorides with me which have been read, and one of Golero's of 18th July, signed "Golero"—we adjourned from the street into a coffee-house in Holborn—I said that Miss Slade had mentioned the matter to me and asked me to settle it, and I asked Golero what he wanted—I began the conversation by producing the letters—I asked Golero if those were the letters he had written to Miss Slade—he said they were—Golero does not speak English, but they both speak French—I said to Golero "I do not know exactly what you want, or how much you want" and I asked him for an explanation—he said that Theodorides owed him 695<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the balance of a debt, and he showed me a memorandum purporting' to be a statement of account between them shewing that balance on an original debt of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he said that as a material guarantee for the payment of the balance; he had got possession of a box of Theodorides containing letters, and as Theodorides could not pay him the money he must have it from Miss Slade—I said it was idle to ask such a large sum as 695<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but as soon as I had seen Miss Slade and Sir Adolphus Slade I would see what could be done by way of arranging the matter—during the conversa<lb></lb>tion Theodorides frequently spoke to Golero in Italian, thinking that I did not understand it, but I did—the meaning of what Golero said was this, Theodorides appeared to be inducing Golero to take a less sum than 695<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170204"></xptr>
               <p>but Golero said he would not take less than 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not quite recollect whether it was at that interview or the second that he spoke of taking two-thirds in cash from me, and an acceptance from Theodorides for the balance, indorsed by some solvent person—I then made an appointment for the fallowing day at the Cafe Monico, in Tiehborne Street—we met there and pretty much the same conversation passed—I said that when a sum was finally agreed on I would give my cheque for it—Golero shook his head and smiled, saying he would have no cheques, he would have nothing but bank notes—I asked him where the letters were—he said they were in safe custody and could be produced in ten minutes—Theodorides in some stage of the conversation asked me in an aside how much I was really disposed to give and he again suggested to Golero in Italian that he should not press for an impracticable sum—I said in an aside also that I thought I should not go beyond 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Theodorides then spoke again in Italian communi<lb></lb>cating the substance of it to Golero, and we made another appointment for the following Saturday, the 28th, at the Cafe Monico, at 12 o'clock—I found them waiting for me when I got there, and in the meantime a warrant had been taken out, but as the arrangement was not ripe for execution I said that 1 was not. ready yet, but on Monday I hoped to finish it altogether—Golero was very angry when he heard of another adjournment—he said he would not stand it any longer, he would take immediate steps—he threatened to begin on Saturday, but said that I could arrest them by obtaining a settlement on Monday—I said that if he did I should decline to carry out the matter, and he would only be cutting off his nose to please his face—he calmed down a little, and consented to suspend it till Monday—the last sum he had mentioned was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I led him to think that I would give him that sum, or a greater part of it—on Monday, at 4 o'clock, I went to the Cafe Monico, and found them waiting for me—a negotiation for the amount was then opened, and to satisfy them that I meant business I showed them a roll of bank notes—Golero said "Well, it is understood that you are to give me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—we were all three sitting at the same table—I said "No, that is really too much, but go and bring the letters and we will fix the figure"—Golero went out and was away a quarter of an hour, Theo<lb></lb>dorides remaining with me—Golero returned with the box, which was tied with red tape—it was opened—I examined its contents; it contained seventy-four letters of Miss Slade's, and two or three little objects, a tobacco bag, and something else—I closed the box and said that it was a very serious matter, that they had put themselves within the reach of the law, and in fact they were arrested—I had only been able to obtain the warrant that morning, which accounts for the postponement—two police-officers in plain clothes then came forward and took the prisoners in custody to Vine Street station—I wished to retain possession of the box of letters, but Golero applied to the inspector and said that it was his property, and the inspector sealed it up—Theodorides asked to see the warrant—the officer said that he would show it to him at the station—I saw that the seventy-four letters were in Miss Slade's writing, and were addressed to Theodorides—they were given up to her before the Magistrate—Theodorides had assured me that those were the whole of the letters remaining in his con<lb></lb>troll—I was present at the subsequent examination of the contents of the box, but I afterwards saw a trunk produced by Sergeant Russell, in which 1 with Miss Slade found about sixty-three or sixty-four of Miss Slade's letters, and a great many other ladies' letters also.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The following letter was translated</hi>: "18th July, 1877. From Paul Golero, importer, to Miss Ernesta Slade: Miss,—Last Saturday upon the repeated instances of Mr. Constantine Theodorides, I made it my duty to come and see you personally about the sealed box in my possession which concerns you. Although at the door I asked to see you, I was shown in to the Admiral, and he said he could bear all concerning his niece. I have no doubt your uncle communicated in detail the interview I had with him in reference to the sealed bos. Certainly I was ignorant of the contents, or else I should have understood of what importance were the documents it contained, and insisted on seeing only you and alone. A correspondence similar to that between you and Mr. Theodorides is of too great importance to allow any in<lb></lb>terference of third people. It is very astonishing, Miss, in spite of my great delicacy towards Mr. Theodorides and yourself, you let pass the date for the opening of the box without occupying yourself to take it off my hands. I have read your letters in full, and I assure you I admire your indifference. I expected to find some bonds or valuable objects. I have only found some letters and other papers without value. However, I am more than satisfied. I can now for the first time sleep soundly about my debt, and I shall know how to get back my debt in making use of your letters. If you have a good memory you must know what is in them, and who had' such a correspondence with you. I shall act against whoever it may be to get my debt of 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Theodorides cannot pay, I know. Therefore I trust to you before address<lb></lb>ing myself to third people. I regret that there should have been no witness at the opening of the box. In case, Miss, I am not paid by the 20th, I shall commence more efficacious measures. Perhaps I shall send some copies to your uncle, the admiral, and save the honour of the family before publication. I shall see what I have to do, being complete master, and nothing shall stop me. Take notice of what I say."</p>

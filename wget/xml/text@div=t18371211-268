                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Artichoke-row, Mile-end. On the 4th of December I was in Mile-end-road, about eight o'clock in the evening, near Cannon-place, and saw the prisoner—he snatched my muff from me, and ran away with it—I called "Stop thief" and he was stopped—I saw him in the policeman's custody—a boy brought me my muff.</p>

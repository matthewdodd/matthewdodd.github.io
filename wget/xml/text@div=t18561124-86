                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 228). About 2 o'clock in the morning of 13th Oct. I was watching in a garden, at No. 18, Warwick-place, Peckham-road—when I had been there about two minutes, I saw a light at the back of No. 16, Warwick-place—after waiting about a minute I saw the light move, and directly it moved it went out—I saw the light for about three minutes altogether; it was shining through the fog; it was very foggy that night—I then instantly heard some one drop over the fence into the next garden, No. 17, and about a minute afterwards I heard some one go over the fence at the bottom of the garden—I waited about a quarter of an hour, and then I got over, and went to the place, where I heard some one get over into the shrubs, and I caught hold of the prisoner standing upright among the shrubs—I said, "Halloo, my lad! what are you doing here?"—he said, "Nothing"—on the way to the station he tried very much to get away—he refused to give his name and address—I found on him five farthings, a knife, and a porte-monnaie—I went to No. 16, Warwick-place, and examined the back part of the house—I found a pane of glass had been broken, and the window lifted up, and a hole cut in the shutters, and burnt—I produce the part; it was burnt, and then cut—some chips were lying outside, and a piece of glass; the knife would not have cut through the shutter if it had not been burnt—the knife was covered with candle grease when I took it out of his pocket, and all charred with dust inside the handle—only this bit of the shutter was cut—I made a further search by day-light, and found this piece of candle, wrapped up, about three yards from where the prisoner had been standing—the shutter was quite warm at the time I put my hand to it, and the charred wood was quite warm; it had been done quite recently.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 16, Warwick-place. I was called up by the police, at near 5 o'clock, on this morning—I saw the shutter before I went to bed; it was quite right then—other persons were sleeping in the house besides myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> A few months before this job happened I got mar<lb></lb>ried; my mistress and I fell out, and I parted from her; I came round Peckham Rye on this night, and got over into a field, to see for a place to lie down; I got over into this gentleman's garden, and while standing there I picked up a knife; I had not been there above five minutes before the policeman came and caught me there, and asked what I wanted; I said I wanted nothing.</p>

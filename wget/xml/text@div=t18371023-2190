                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Griffiths, a private soldier, and live in York-street, Westminster. The prisoner's husband was a soldier—from a motive of compassion, seeing she had nowhere to lay her head, I took her in for two nights—not as a lodger—I went out on Saturday, the 18th, about eleven o'clock—I did not return, as my goods were seized, and sold to Mr. Phillips—I owed 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to my landlord, but he wanted to impose 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the landlord swore that I caused a <hi rend="italic">row,</hi> and I will sent to prison for want of bail, and the woman accused me of striking her—I remained in prison eight days—I was liberated on the 26th—when I went out on the Friday night I left the key turned in the lock—when I came from the prison there was nothing in the room but a wire basket.</p>

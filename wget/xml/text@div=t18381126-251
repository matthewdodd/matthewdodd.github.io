The prisoner worked for me about four months, and left on Tuesday—I missed things, and had suspected every one in the place, and last Sunday week my apprentice informed me that two lamps of mine were in a shop at the corner of William-street, Cornwall-road—I went there, and saw these lamps, with these reflectors in them—they were made for another pair of lamps, but the prisoner had fitted them up for sale—the prisoner lodged in that house.</p>

These lamps, or some like them, were made in my place, three weeks ago last Sunday, by the prisoner—he does not lodge with me, but he asked my permission to make a pair of lamps there—I said he might do it—he came two or three evenings before, and on Sunday three weeks he came and finished them at my place—I went in a little before dinner, and saw him at work with lamps similar to these—I dare say they are them—they were all to pieces and bits on the bench—this come I had in my hand, or one I could almost swear was the same, and one of these lamps I can swear to—it was bruised in the nozzle in a bad way—this is the one—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)—I have never had the lamps in my hand since they were made till this moment—I said, "You have made a botch of this and spoiled it"—"No," says he, "it won't matter"—this was three week last Sunday.</p>

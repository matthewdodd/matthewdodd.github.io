On Sunday, the 26th of March, I went to bed last, about half-past ten o'clock at night. I fastened all the doors and windows myself; my house is at the corner of Villier's-court, into which I have a private door - I fastened that; there are two squares of glass in the door, each about ten inches by nine, one was broken on the Friday - the pane was broken quite out; I observed it to be so at three o'clock on Saturday morning, when I got up - it was perfect and firm on Friday night about ten. The prisoner was a cadee at the White Horse Cellar. On Sunday morning, about half-past one o'clock, the watchman called me up, and said a man was in my house; I came down, found nobody in the house, but found the prisoner's hat on the floor - he was gone to the watch-house. The bolts of the door and the double-lock were undone; but there was a secret latch which he could not undo - the shop-door was also open, but nothing taken. I went to the watch-house, found the prisoner there, and knew him. I neither threatened or promised him. I asked him how he got in, and what made him do it? he said he was coming up the court, saw the square broken, and thought he would get in. He said he had broken the square on the Friday.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. James's. On the night, between Sunday and Monday, I was going my rounds at one o'clock; when I came to Mr. Taylor's house I heard something rattle in the shop - I passed by, and cried the hour three doors farther, but kept my eye on the door; I then returned, and heard a chain rattle - I also heard an iron bar make a noise and saw the door open. I stepped forward, pushed both the doors open, and found the prisoner in the shop without his coat and waistcoat. I charged him with robbing his master, and said I would see his master. I thought he was a servant. I alarmed the house; he ran in backwards and came back into the shop. I seized him, we both fell together, he got out and ran; I at last secured him, and took him to the watch-house. I saw a good deal of blood on the door in the court, just by the glass. When I got him to the watch-house I saw his hand was cut.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. The prosecutor delivered me a hat. I examined the prisoner's hand at the watch-house; it bled very much when he was brought in, and there was a large gash in his hand which appeared to be cut by glass. I found a small piece of glass in his pocket, which I compared with the piece took out of the door. It appeared the same kind of glass from the thickness and colour - it would not fit it. It was sticking in the top of his pocket, as if it had stuck there as he got through.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Taylor. I was going to my master's stables, in Bond-street, on Sunday night, between seven and eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner - I knew him before. He asked if I lived with Mr. Taylor? I said yes. He said, he supposed I slept at the top of the house. I said, I did not know whether it was the top or the bottom, I had but just come to live there. He asked who slept on the first floor, I gave him no answer and left him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TAYLOR. I thought some drunken man had broken the glass, as it was about the height for a man to break.</p>
               <p>His LORDSHIP in summing up the evidence, desired the Jury to consider whether they were of opinion that the prisoner broke the glass on the Friday night, with intention to enter at another time.</p>

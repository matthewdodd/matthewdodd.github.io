            , a Neighbour (whom I always thought to be a very honest Woman) came and desired me to let a young Woman, just come out of the Country, lie with me for 2 or 3 Nights, till she could provide herself with a Place. I told her, I could by no means suffer any such thing, for People would say, that I let out my Lady's House in Lodgings when she was from Home. But Mrs. Newman would take no Denial, and so at last she over-persuaded, and brought the Prisoner. The Prisoner staid with me 2 Days, and in that time she told me as many Lies as this Court would hold, though I believ'd them all at first. She said that she had liv'd at 'Squire Goare's in Great Monmouth-street 3 Years, that her Father and Mother had kept the George-Inn in Northampton, but were lately dead, and had left all they had betwixt her and her Brother, who was Master of a Stage-Coach at the Brook-Bar in Holborn. There was not a Lady that past by the Window with any thing rich in her Dress, but this Creature told me that she had got such another. On the 2d Day she was with me, I left her within, and went out to St. James Market to get something for Dinne, I staid about 2 Hours, and when I came back I found her standing at the Door. She said, a Girl had been these to tell her of a Place, and she was going to see it, and desired me not to go to Dinner till she came back, but I never saw her impudent Face any more till she was taken up. I soon found she had robbed the House, and I went to enquire after her at 'Squire Goare's, but could hear nothing of her there. I was directed to one Mrs. Banister, with whom she had liv'd, and whose Name she took upon her self when she came to me. By her means I heard the Prisoner was gone to Service at Mrs. Duncan's Boarding-School at Islington; I went thither, but it was too late, she had lived there but 3 Weeks, and then was discharged. At last I found her at one Goddard's in St. Mary lx, where she had met with a Husband. I was told that she robbed Mrs. Kirby before she robbed me.</p>

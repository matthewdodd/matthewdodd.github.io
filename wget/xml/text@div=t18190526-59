               <p>DR. RODERICK M'LEOD. On Wednesday evening, the 5th of May, I was walking from Bow, to my own house at Westminster - I got to Aldgate church about eleven o'clock, and was walking slowly along. A young man, whom I believe to be the prisoner, came right up against me at the <placeName id="t18190526-59-crimeloc318">corner of Mitre-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18190526-59-crimeloc318" type="placeName" value="corner of Mitre-street"></interp>

He made so many apologies for stopping me in my way, that it put me off my guard entirely; I said there was no occasion for any apology; I endeavoured to make way for him, and to pass him. In making that effort to pass him, I felt a violent snatch, and thought my watch, seals and chain and all were gone. I immediately called out Stop thief! and pursued the man. When I got a little way I came in front of the watch-house; the constable of the night met me, and asked me to step in until the watchman and beadle, who were in pursuit of the man, came back. I went in, and in a few minutes one of the watchmen brought a young man in whom he had caught; I told him that was not the man who stopped me, and therefore I could not give him in charge. In a few minutes after, Fawcett, the beadle, came in with a hat in his hand, and said the man had got away but he had knocked off his hat; I left my address at the watch-house and proceeded home. On Wednesday, the 14th of May, I was requested to appear before the Lord Mayor,; when the prisoner was produced the features of his countenance made such an impression on me from what I have stated, that I said I felt no hesitation in saying I believed him to be the man who stopped me. From the observation that I made at the time, he is the man, I have not the most distant doubt of it. I have neither recovered the seals or chain; the chain broke off at the ring, and the watch was left.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so light on the 5th of May, as to enable you to know his person again on the 11th - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. All this was done at one snatch - A. I felt nothing until it was snatched - there was no struggle or resistance on my part - it was about eleven o'clock, it might be a few minutes after, but I cannot tell. I have no doubt in my own mind of the prisoner's being the man, but I am not infallible - he kept saying,</p>
               <p>"Sir, I am very sorry I stopped you." I saw him all that time. There was another man there, who asked me if I had lost any thing?</p>

            . I am beadle of St. James, Dukes-place. Just after eleven o'clock - it was gone eleven, I was in the watch-house, and heard the cry of Stop thief; I immediately went out - there were several men running about and the watchmen. One man had slipped through the dark court into Duke's-place; when I got there he was about a hundred yards before me; I pursued him from there, to the end of Winfield-street, Petticoat-lane; I there made a blow at him, intending to knock him down, I was not quite near enough to him, but knocked his hat off, and then lost him. On Tuesday following, the 11th, I saw the prisoner and took him - I suspect him very much to be the man I had pursued.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take him - A. I did not see him till the Monday after, and then he gave me the slip; I saw him again on Tuesday, and took him - I did not know him before, except by seeing him about the street. I took him believing him to be the same man, and informed the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was it - A. It had just gone eleven o'clock; he was just before me - I did not see his full face. I saw him on the 10th, at the Roebuck, public-house, Duke's-place, about half-past seven o'clock at night - Winfield-street is a good way from there; he just came in and went out again - I am confident he saw me; I said nothing to him. Next night, about seven o'clock, I saw him there again - another man was taken on the night of the robbery but not by me. I knew the prisoner before by sight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can prove that I was not there at eleven o'clock at night.</p>

            . I live in Camomile-street. The prisoner lodged with me; he is a tailor. On Wednesday evening, the 5th of May, he came home about eight o'clock - he went out about half an hour after and returned about ten o'clock to supper, and supped with Mr. Abrahams, myself, Mr. Shannon, and one Solomons - we all sat down together to supper about five minutes after ten o'clock; we had fish and sallad for supper. The prisoner left the room, about half-past ten o'clock, and went up to bed - he sleeps on the second floor; we supped on the first-floor. I heard him go into his bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you sleep - A. In the next room to the prisoner. I went to bed a little after eleven o'clock, and he was in his room then for I heard him cough; he could not have gone out from the time he came in until I went to bed, or I must have heard him. He sleeps in the front room, and we supped in the front room. Mr. Shannon went away about eleven o'clock;

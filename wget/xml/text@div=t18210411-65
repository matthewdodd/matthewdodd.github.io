             was going by at the time; I told him what had happened, he took the little girl away with him, and went over to the other side of the way - my father went with him; he came back in about ten minutes. I went with him to the ruins in Foster-lane, where the new post office is building, we found the gate locked; we went round to Bell-square, and found that gate locked also, so that nobody could have been in the ruins. We got over the hoard, looked about for some half crowns, and in about ten minutes my father picked up one, and called me to look at it before he picked it up - it was bad; I found in a piece of paper two more half crowns, about a yard from where the first was found - they were folded with a piece of paper between them; they were marked, and then given to my father.</p>

            , I am the father of the last witness. I came in and found a little girl in the shop; from what she told me, I went out, and found the prisoner about seven or eight houses off, on the other side of the way, in Noble-street, he was walking to and fro. Taylor was with the little girl, he stopped and spoke to her, the prisoner saw her, and went on very quick; I followed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110045"></xptr>him into Foster-lane, and he turned up a court, not a thoroughfare - I went up to him, looked him in the face, and said</p>
               <p>"I believe you are one of the men I want." He said,</p>
               <p>"No, I am not." I told him I was sure of it. I laid hold of both his hands, one hand was in his right hand breeches pocket - he struggled very much to get his right hand from mine, and then he threw two parcels from him over the board, in St. Martin's-le-Grand; the wind blew the paper of one of them back on the ground. I called Mr. Lobb to pick it up - Taylor came up at the time and took the prisoner into a baker's shop; he took a pocket-book from him, in which I found three good half-crowns, a good five shilling piece, and five-pence half-penny in copper. I returned to my house and took my son to the spot where he threw the parcel over. We got there in ten minutes. I saw a half-crown, and called my son to look at it, he picked up a paper about a yard off, containing two more in the direction in which the man threw it. I produce them, my son gave them to me, and I marked them before I lost sight of them. I produced one half-crown, the one found upon the ruins and the one found by my son. I saw the prisoner and the girl together, they recognized each other - he was very resolute, and very unwilling to be secured; we were obliged to tie him, and she said</p>
               <p>"You shall not tie my father."</p>

               <p>the prisoner Baker—I took some numbers to him; I forget the number now, I took them to him on the Thursday before Christmas—he stopped me on the Wednesday night as I was going home, and asked me if I could get him some "Tichborne Trials, "I should never be found out—I took him two bundles, 130 in each bundle—he did not give me anything then, next day he gave me 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the numbers are sold at 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each to the trade—I had not taken any to him before, nor did I afterwards; that was the only time—he met me at the corner of a court that leads to Mr. Thorburn's place—I was carrying the parcel on my shoulder, not covered with paper—he gave me the 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. next day, in Fleet Street-when he asked me to bring him the numbers, he said "I will give you a good price for them, you will never be found out; I know you don't get much here, you don't get enough to keep you; why don't you take a chance while you can get it."</p>

I am a publisher, at 63, Fleet Street—I sell the "Englishman" and the "Tichborne Trial"—I know Baker; I have been in the habit of selling both publications to him direct; he has come to our premises to purchase them—the trial was sold by the quire, twenty-six to the quire; he paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a quire—I recollect Edmunds absconding—on examining our stock, I missed certain numbers of the "Tichborne Trial"—I saw Baker at our office on the morning of 10th January—he came there in the usual course; he came every Thursday morning—I don't think I said anything to him at the office that morning; he was taken into custody there; I had given instructions to have him arrested in the ex<lb></lb>pectation that he would come; the constable came in immediately after him—I heard the constable say that he should take him into custody on a charge of receiving a certain number of the "Tichborne Trial," well know<lb></lb>ing them to have been stolen—he said "I am very sorry"—I and my brother afterwards went to the police-station—in the presence of the inspector, the prisoner said "Can I have a private interview with these gentlemen?"—he was allowed to have an interview with me and my brother—he first said "I have been led into this by others, Mr. Kenealey; I hope you don't want to press this against me?"—I answered "If you give me the names of your accomplices, we may be inclined to get you as light a sentence as possible"—he said that unless I made a promise not to proceed against him he would give no information—I told him that I could not enter into conditions at all—he said "I will pay you the value of the "Tichborne Trials" that are missing, if you will let me off"—I believe we</p>

               <p>had stated in the presence of the prisoner and the inspector that the value was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I answered that I could not compound a felony—he said it was impossible to be honest in the news trade, if a man wanted to be honest they would not allow him to be so—he also said if we had taken more precautions we should not have been robbed-Edmunds was afterwards brought into his presence, and Edmunds said to him "You led me into this," or words to that effect-Baker replied "No; I did not lead you into it."</p>

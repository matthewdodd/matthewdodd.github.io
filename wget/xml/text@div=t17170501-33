That examining the Waggon they found two Packs cut, one of Linnen and another of Silk, and one Piece of Linnen taken out. That taxing the Prisoner, he answer'd them in menacing Language, saying he was a Man of Character, being a Knight Baroner, and would expect Satisfaction for such Scandal; bar however they not believing him, persisted to search him, as is usual to common Criminals, to see what Pistols;&amp;c. he had about him, but found neither Arms nor Mony, nor any dangerous Weapon, but only a small Knife and a Tooth-pick-Case. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, saying he went to enquire for one Mr. Edwards of Bristol, and went to the upper end of the Inn-yard to enquire of the Hostler. The Court making use of his pretence of being a Knight Baronet not in his favour, he affirmed at the Bar he was so; and this was confirm'd by some there.

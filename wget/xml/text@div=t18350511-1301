                  </hi>. I am a seaman. I went on the 24th of April to the White Swan, with one of my ship-mates—I called for a pot of beer—the prisoner served us, and I gave him a shilling in payment—I received that shilling from the landlady of ray boarding-house, Mrs. Cole—it was an old shilling, with the King's coat of arras on it—he put the shilling into his mouth, and <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> down a shilling on the table, and said, "That's a bad shilling"—I took it in my hand, went home, and got another shilling—the one he gave me back had the crown and lion rampant on it—I told him it was not the same shilling—he said nothing—I showed it to Mrs. Cole, and said, "Never mind it; put it down to me."</p>

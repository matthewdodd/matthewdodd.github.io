                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Cubitt On this day week I was employed in making some stables at the bade of No. 69, Eaton-place—the stables come into Lyall's mews, South, and opposite them are the stables of Colonel Vernon, who is in Ireland, and has got his coachman with him—I have seen all the prisoners at Colonel Vernon's stable—they all lived in the room over his stable—at half-past four o'clock this day week, I left the property safe at the stable where I was at work—when I went on Monday morning, I found it was gone from more than one yard, and the tools were taken from the loft over the stables—no one could get to the loft without a ladder—in consequence of suspicion, I at once went over <hi rend="italic"></hi> to Colonel Vernon's stable on Monday morning—I knocked three <hi rend="italic">times</hi> distinctly—I heard some one in the stable—they did not answer me, bat ran up stairs—I then saw Bryan Stewart look out at the window—I asked him to allow me to come into the stable to measure the size of the harness-room—he made no answer, but went back, and in a minute or two Milton came to the window—I asked her to let me in by the Colonel's orders to measure the size of the harness, room, as we were fitting a harness-room up at another place—she seemed very confused, and said she could not let me in, she had not the key, that her daughter went out to work in the morning, and took the key with her—I waited a few minutes, and kept watch—I then saw Bryan Stewart open the stable-door, peep out <hi rend="italic"></hi> several times, and then shut it again—he could see me, and when he saw me he closed the door, and disappeared—I waited some time, made a communication to my em<lb></lb>ployer, and went before the Justice—I obtained the assistance of Thomp<lb></lb>son, and accompanied him to the stable where the prisoners lived—be knocked at the door—Milton looked out of <hi rend="italic"></hi> the window from above Thompson asked her to let him in—she refused—he asked a second time—she still refused, and I think she said he most wait till the family was in town he told her if she did not come down and let him in, he most break the door open, but if she would come down he would read the warrant to her—she then came down, and opened the door—we first <hi rend="italic"></hi> went into the stable, and found this flush boarding and floor boarding at the further end of the stable—this is heavy—on looking into the manger we found two dosen bolts, and a quantity of nails—there was a box which is used as a corn-bin—it was locked up—we asked Milton if she had got the key—a he said no she had not—we broke it open, and it contained my saw, hammer, two centre-bits, a gimlet, a bradawl, and a chalk-line—I had left them safe on Saturday night—we then went up stairs to the loft, and immediately on getting up there, we found a board which I identified as Mr. Cubitt's—it was just pot up temporarily, and some saucepans on it—we then went to the cock-loft, and there found a cart load of stuff which was my master's—amongst it was this log which has Mr. Cubitt's name branded on it—we found this ladder, which is Mr. Cubitt's—this would help them very materially to get into the loft, and to get the property which I missed—here is a van-load of property here. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined b</hi> y <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I live at 6, White-street, Waterloo-road, and am a sailor. On 4th April, between eight and nine o'clock, I went to a public-house called the Herb of Waterloo, in Waterloo-road, kept by Okey—I was nearly drunk when I went in—I had nine sovereigns and a half in my left waistcoat-pocket, and a crown-piece in my right waistcoat-pocket—I remem<lb></lb>ber seeing Frost there—he had a white smock-frock on, and a red handker<lb></lb>chief round his neck—I wanted to go to sleep, and I did fall asleep—when I was sleepy Frost was near me, and he was <hi rend="italic">fumbling</hi> at my waistcoat-pocket, but I was too drunk to take notice of it—I paid for what I drank there with some silver—I did not change any gold—I afterwards was taken to the station, and when I got sober I missed all my money, and my hat and hand<lb></lb>kerchief were gone, but when I got home a single sixpence was found on me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barwoman at the Hero of Waterloo. I remember the prosecutor coming there on the evening of 4th April—three or four coal-heavers drank with him—I saw Turner there; he drank with him—Turner told me that the sailor was a relation of his, and that he was not so drunk as he pretended to be—the sailor went to sleep—the coalheavers that he had been drinking with, were near him at the time he was asleep, but not Turner—after Turner had said about his being a relation, he still remained in the house—I heard of the sailor being rubbed—Turner still remained in the room—he paid for a glass of gin-and-bitters, which the sailor had—I said to Turner it was a pity that the sailor should have any more drink, and Turner said he was not so tipsy as he pretended to be, he could go home if he liked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a porter at the South-western Railway station. I went into Okey's, at a quarter before nine o'clock that night—I saw both the prisoners and the sailor there—Frost was dressed in a white smock-frock and a white straw hat—the sailor's head was lolling on Frost's breast—I saw Frost put his hand into the sailor's right-hand trowsers pocket, and take some halfpence out, which he gave to another man, who is not in custody, and he called for a pot of beer—Frost had a white straw hat on, like a sailor's hat, only not covered—when Frost took out the halfpence I looked at him, and he kept his eye fixed on me—I then saw him put his hand into the sailor's waistcoat pocket, and he took out something, but I did not see what it was—I said to some parties who were there, "That man is robbing the sailor"—I should have given him into custody at the time if it had not been represented to me that Turner was a cousin of the sailor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say Frost kept his eye on you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have no recollection of having said before, that it was either his jacket or his waistcoat pocket that he put his hand into, I could not say which—I might have said so—I was not present when Turner said he was a relation of his—it was represented to me—Frost was two or three yards from me when I saw this doing—I have been about two years and a half on the railway—I go into that house to take what refreshment I require.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

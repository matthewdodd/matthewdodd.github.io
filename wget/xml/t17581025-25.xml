            . I sold this bay horse that the prosecutrix has swore to, to Mr. Watkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the horse?</p>
               <p>Cape. He is a bay horse with a bald face.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you the horse?</p>
               <p>Cape. I bought him of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Cape. On the Friday after Christmas-day; the prisoner said he had been in the country to sell a little house and land that he had there, and that he bought this horse there in order to come up to London again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for him?</p>
               <p>Cape. I gave five guineas for him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell him for to Watkins?</p>
               <p>Cape. I sold him for four guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it that you sold him to loss?</p>
               <p>Cape. I let him out for three or four months, and worked him myself in a little cart, and I had worked him down very poor, but he was moon blind, or I had not sold him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the bar before?</p>
               <p>Cape. I did, he shod the horse two or three months after this.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he confess confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Cape. No, he did not, he said he bought and paid for him, and so he says now.</p>

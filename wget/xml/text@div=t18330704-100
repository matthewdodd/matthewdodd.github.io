             (police-constable N 104). On the Sunday morning stated, I fell in with the prisoner a quarter before three o'clock in Macclesfield-street, Islington, he was carrying these four gowns; I stopped him, and asked him some questions, which he would not answer, and I took him into custody; he was more than a quarter of a mile from Mr. Drew's - I have had the property ever since.</p>

This is his property, it was taken about eleven o'clock on the Saturday night, from inside the counter, but we did not miss it till the officer told us of it; I had seen it safe at seven o'clock on Saturday evening, and at half-past ten o'clock the prisoner came into the box with a bunch of roses in his hand, he said he wanted to pawn them, as he was hard up; I said we did not take them, and he went away, and came in again in half an hour.</p>

I bought them of a woman in the street - the indictment says four gowns, but I bought three gowns and a petticoat - if I had been a thief or a rogue, I would not have carried them across the street, and I would have taken the duplicates off them - I never was before Judge or Jury before; I have been nine years in his Majesty's service, in the 10th regiment of foot; I have four brothers laid in the East Indies, who were killed in the Berbice war - I am a native of Londonderry.</p>

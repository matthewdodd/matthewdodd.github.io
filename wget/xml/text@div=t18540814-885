                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser. Between two and three o'clock on the morning of 19th July I was in Old Compton-street, going home, and was assaulted—an arm was thrown round my neck, which nearly strangled me—I do not know who the man was that did that—I saw the one that took my watch and chain—that was the prisoner—he broke the chain away from me—he came from the other side of the road—he seized the watch and chain, and took the watch and chain away—the other man was holding me at the time—after the watch and chain were taken, both of them lifted me off my legs and threw me into the road—I felt very queer at the time, and have been queer ever since in my throat, and other bodily injuries—I have had pain in my throat, and have been under the doctors' hands with it—I got up and went round to the corner of Pulteney-street, and then the policeman came—I believe I was able to shout; they tell me that I did, but I have no recollection of it—I saw the prisoner brought up by the policeman—this is my watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>), and this is the part of the chain that was left in my possession.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, C</hi> 37). On the morning of 19th July I was on duty near Compton-street, in Great Crown-court, about half-past 2 o'clock—I heard a scuffle and a very weak cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner running very fast through Little Crown-court, towards Great Crown-court—I seized him, and took him back to the prosecutor in Wardour-street, at the corner of Little Pulteney-street—I asked the prosecutor if that was the man; he said that was the man—I took him to the police station—he deli<lb></lb>vered up the watch and said he was guilty—he repeated that a second time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence (written</hi>). I am a very poor man, and get my living by hawking things about the street; it was a great temptation for a poor fellow like me to find such a prize; when I picked the watch up I was walking away, when I met the policeman, who asked me where I was going; I told him I was going to the police station, that I had found a watch and chain and was going to take it to the station; when he heard the cry of stop thief he asked me to stay; the cry was not after me, but after some man who ran in a contrary direction; when the prosecutor was asked if I was the man, he said no, it was a man dressed in woman's clothes; the policeman said, "You had better give this man in charge, as he states he picked your watch up;" the prosecutor then said, "It must be him;" he was so drunk they did not ask him any question, but detained him until the morning, and then told him I was the man; he had no recollection of what he said or did when he came to the station.</p>

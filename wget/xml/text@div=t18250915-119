I got up on Sunday morning, the 21st of August, and went out to get my milk - after serving some of my customers, I returned home, and met my son at the door, who said, "Mother we have been robbed;" I missed this property from the lower back room where I live.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's son. On the 21st of August, Mrs. Bradshaw, another lodger of my mother's, came to me, and said, the prisoner was in my mother's room - I went towards my mother's house, and met the prisoner with the bundle in her possession - I stopped her.</p>

            . I lodge with Mrs. Thompson. On Sunday, the 21st of August, I went into the yard about half-past seven o'clock in the morning; I saw her window shutters were open, which was unusual - I looked in and saw the prisoner in the room. I went and told the last witness, and as he came along he met her with the bundle.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to get something for breakfast - and as I returned, I met the son who charged me with robbing his mother; I went and told my husband of it - I went down again, and saw this bundle in the passage - the son said, "Leave the bundle, and I will have nothing more to do with you;" he then said, "Leave the house directly." I said, "No, I will not, I will stand my ground" - I have every reason to believe that the son robbed his mother himself as I have heard them say that they have not bought any thing themselves.</p>
               <p>DANIEL THOMPSON re-examined. Q. Did you see her husband at all? A. No.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 36, Maryland-street, St. John-street-road. I am a gentleman—about half-past twelve o'clock on the night of the 10th of April, I was returning home from the City, and in Princes-street, by the side of the Bank, I saw two women, and two or three men, on the other side of the way—immediately I came opposite to them the prisoner, who was one of the women, ran across and seized hold of my right arm—she wished me to stop for an improper purpose—I begged her to leave me, as I was going home as fast as I could—however, she kept hold of me, and we went round the corner to Coleman-street—that was not out of my way—she wanted me several times to stop at several doorways—she went through White Rose-court,</p>

               <p>which leads into Basinghall-street—that was still in my road, the way I go and return night and morning—we went on till we came to ana avenue called Sambrook-court—previous to coming there I begged her not to stop—I said, "I cannot stop, I am very late"—she pulled me a few yards up that court against my will, and she began to be very loving—I begged her to let me alone, but she seized tight hold of me, and held me very tightly—I said, "You are a <hi rend="italic">rum</hi> one at all events"—then all in a minute she let me go and ran out, and in came two men to inquire if that was a thoroughfare—I thought it was very strange—I put my hand into my pocket, and my purse was gone—I had in it three new Victoria sovereigns, two half-crowns, three shillings, and a sixpence—I rushed out of the court, and turned fortunately to the left—I did not like to be robbed in that kind of way—I met the policeman—he said, "What are you looking for?"—I said, "I have just been robbed"—he had seen the woman run that way—we went down Lawrence-lane, and found the prisoner and another under a doorway, and I heard the purse drop on the stones—this is my purse.</p>

I received information from the prosecutor—I followed the prisoner—I had lost sight of her—I went in pursuit of her, and found her in Lawrence-lane—the prosecutor said he had been robbed, but he did not say of what—I asked if it was by a female—he said it was—when I overtook the prisoner I saw the purse drop from her hand on the ground—when we got to the station the prosecutor was asked what was in the purse—he said three new sovereigns, two-half-crowns, three shillings, and a sixpence, and that is the money in it.</p>
               <p>(Frederick Lewis, of Great Suffolk-street, Borough, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

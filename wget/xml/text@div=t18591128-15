                  </hi>. On 24th November I was standing in one of the recesses on London Bridge—I felt a tug at my pocket—I looked down and saw the prisoner with my watch in his hand; he put it behind him and passed it to some one else—I got down and took him and he wrenched away from me—I said he had taken my watch—he said he had not, and he pointed to some one else who was running away, and said he had got it—I am quite sure I saw it in his hand—he got away from me—I saw him on London Bridge ten minutes afterwards; the policeman had him then.</p>

I am a shopkeeper in Devereaux-court, Strand—I was passing over London Bridge on the morning of 24th November—I saw the last witness scuffling with the prisoner—he had his arm round the prosecutor's neck and his other hand was in front of the prosecutor—but what he took from him I could not see—I am quite sure that the prisoner is the person who was scuffling with him—I saw him in custody about ten minutes afterwards.</p>

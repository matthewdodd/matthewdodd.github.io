The prisoner was given into my custody on the 26th of December last, by one Jones, for stealing fixtures and other property from his house, No. 10, Harrow-road—I found a quan<lb></lb>tity of pots at No. 22, North-street—I traced "No. 20, Lloyd's-row" on one of them, and found out the prosecutor, who went with me to No. 22, Lloyd's-row, and missed his fixtures and tools—he then went with me to No. 22, North-street, and found several articles, which he claimed as his—he afterwards went with me to No. 10, Marsham-street, and found the two articles produced in a cellar in the back yard—the case was taken before the Magistrate, at High-street, who did not commit the prisoner, but held him to bail—last Sessions he did not make his appearance, and was taken on a warrant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an excavator. In consequence of the prisoner's robbing me, I went in search of some of my property, and it turned out that some of the prosecutor's property was on the same premises—I was present when he sold some scaffold-boards, pick-axe, iron crow-bar, and other things, at Somers-town—I cannot positively swear that any part of the prosecutor's property was on my premises.</p>

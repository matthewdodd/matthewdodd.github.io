            . I am a druggist in the Poultry; I hired Morgan as a porter the 27th of February 1770; he lived with me till the December following; he behaved very well as a porter.</p>
               <p>Rowland's Defence.</p>
               <p>I had nothing to do with the box; I had ten yards and a half of linen, which Morgan offered me at 1 s. 6 d. per yard; I was in a hurry, and could not stay to talk about it, so Morgan threw it into the manger. When Morgan was taken up, I then brought the cloth to Mr. Hotchkin; I know no more of it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177204290019"></xptr>For Rowland.</p>
               <p>Mr. Savage. On Sunday the 23d of February Mr. Stracey and I went to dine with a gentleman. Rowland has lived with me ten years. When we came home at eight o'clock, he was at home at supper; I knew nothing of this till next morning. I had a suspicion of a servant of mine that he had robbed me; I spoke to the cooper, and asked him if he saw any back-door work; he said no; but in about five minutes he said he could tell me something that would surprize me, that the coachman had left a box of linen; my coachman said directly,</p>
               <p>"Lord, Sir, I have ten yards and a half of cloth he gave me." I know no more of it; he always behaved as an honest, sober, just man; I had an excellent character of him, and I believe he deserves it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stracey. I have known Rowland ten years; I believe him to be a sober, honest man; how he came into this affair I know not.</p>

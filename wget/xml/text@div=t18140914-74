On the 12th of September, about half past eight in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and requested to look at some French cambric; I shewed her some. She bought three nails at fourteen shillings a yard; I took two shillings and seven-pence halfpenny of her for it. From her manner, I suspected her; I let her go out of the shop, and then I perceived the parcel of cambric was diminished. I pursued her, took hold of her arm, and told her, I believed she had got something that was not her own, and as I was bringing her back into the shop again, I perceived a piece drop from her clothes. The officer being on the spot, I gave her in charge. He searched her, and found nothing else. About two minutes afterwards, a man came in the shop, and brought two quanties more of French cambric; they appeared to be Mr. Stiles's property. There was no other customer in the shop at the time the prisoner was there.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 12th of September, between eight and nine o'clock, I was coming by Mr. Stiles's shop, I saw the prosecutor have the prisoner in his hand; he said, here Sapwell, take her. I instantly began to search her, and close to her right foot, I saw this piece of cambric muslin; I cannot say I saw her drop it; it is five yards, and these two other pieces, I received of the prosecutor. I produce them.</p>

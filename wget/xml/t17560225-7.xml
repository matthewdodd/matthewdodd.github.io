               <p>Q. What was said before Sir Samuel in the prisoner's hearing?</p>
               <p>Brisake. Mr. Hall said he had them from Mr. Hambleton, and Mr. Hambleton's wife said she had them of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What said the prisoner to that?</p>
               <p>Bris ake. He said his wife gave them to him.</p>

               <p>Brisake. No, I never saw him before we were before Sir Samuel, neither can I conceive how he came at them.</p>
               <p>Henry Hall. These curtains were brought to my house by a broker in Spitalfields, one Hambleton, to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Hall. I keep a broker's-shop in Moorfields. When I came to look at these, I found they were not compleat (produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor. ) I was not minded to buy them; he told me they were the property of a man under misfortunes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy them of Hambleton?</p>
               <p>Hall. No, I did not; but I lent some money to Hambleton to buy the other of them; happening to have a linen draper at my house, I shew'd him them, and ask'd him if he had any thing that would match them; he then told me they were the property of Mr. Brisake, and he had been with him to see if he could get more of the sort to match what was left. I went with him to Mr. Brisake's, and he swore to his curtains. I heard the prisoner say he carry'd them to Hambleton, and Hambleton said he had them of his wife.</p>

            . To the best of my knowledge I had these curtains from the prisoner at the bar; I deliver'd them to my husband, and said I had occasion for money, and he must go into Moorfields and sell them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. These are not the curtains that I sold her; these are blue cheque, what I sold her was red cheque, which I sold to her for fourteen shillings. I have been acquainted with them five or six years.</p>

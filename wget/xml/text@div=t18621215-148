                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, E</hi> 12). On the morning of 23d Novem<lb></lb>ber I was in Tottenham-court-road—I saw the prisoners at about half-past 12 o'clock at the corner of Frances-street—I was on the west side towards Oxford-street—they walked towards Oxford-street, and I was four or six yards behind them—as they were crossing the end of Chenies-street they met a man coming in the opposite direction—Johnson said to Brown, "Here's a chance"—Brown said, "Let the old b—go, he has got no <hi rend="italic">super"</hi>—that is a slang word which thieves use for a watch—at that instant I crossed the road to the corner of Gooch-street through hearing those words, and both prisoners stopped at the corner of Chenies-street for ten minutes—the person they spoke about passed on—I placed myself in a doorway out of their sight—they then walked backwards and forwards from the corner of Chenies-street to Frances-street four times, and the fourth time they met a man midway between the two streets—Johnson caught hold of him by the collar behind, and Brown in front—the man immediately cried out, "Police," and "Don't rob me"—as soon as they caught hold of him I sprang across the road, and took them in custody—I was so close on them that they let go immediately, and they made off—I pursued them—they turned down Tancrill-street, where I lost sight of them—I met Sergeant Ryan, told him what I had seen, and we went together to find them—he was in uniform, but I was in plain clothes—after searching about for half an hour I saw them at the corner of Chenies-street, Tottenham-court-road—I crossed towards them—they walked on, and in my crowing the road I met them—I immediately seized them, one in each hand—Brown caught me by the throat and got away from me—I tussled with Johnson, and he dropped a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and a dark lantern—a woman came up at that instant, picked them up, and went away with them—Johnson said, "You b—, if you do not let me go I will knife you"—a private gentleman came up, and I begged him to take hold of one hand, which he did, and assisted me to the station with him—he is not here—I am certain the prisoners are the men I saw assaulting the gentleman—Ryan went after Brown.</p>

On the night in question Lam<lb></lb>bert made a communication to me—I did not see the assault on the gentle<lb></lb>man, but I was with Lambert when he pursued the prisoners—I lost sight of them, and came up to them again—I saw him take them, one with each hand—I kept away, being in uniform—I saw Brown escape, and went after him—he struck me across the head with this iron bar, and smashed my hat to pieces—I had actually taken him; I had put my hand upon him—the blow stunned me, but I afterwards pursued him, and found him and Mr. Foster together—I took him in custody.</p>

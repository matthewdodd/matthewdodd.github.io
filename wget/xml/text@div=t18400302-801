                  </hi>. I am a labourer—I live in Hayes-court, Rose<lb></lb>mary-lane. I have been married about nine months—I have known the prisoner about two years and a half—we lived together as man and wife, but had ceased to do so about twelve months before I was married—I had one child by her—it is dead now—it was alive at the time in question, and was at my house—I had taken it out of St. George's workhouse about nine weeks—the prisoner came to trouble me very often after we parted, and an<lb></lb>noyed me in the streets with all sorts of abuse, and throwing mud in my face. On the 30th of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, I went to the Pewter-platter public-house—I had not been there above half-an-hour when she came into the tap-room, where I was standing, wait<lb></lb>ing for employment at coal work—it is the place where we go to get em<lb></lb>ployment in that line—I went to see if the landlord was in the bar to turn her out, because she had been a great annoyance there before—(she had not said or done any thing at that time,) she followed me, and drew her right hand from under her shawl with a cup in it, and threw this vitriol in my face saying, "You would not let me see my child, and take that for a</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 184.) On the 30th of January, about half-past eight o'clock, I saw the prosecutor in Cock-lane, Ratcliffe, about twenty yards from the Pewter Platter public-house—his face ap<lb></lb>peared all in a burning state—he pointed out the prisoner to me on the opposite side of the street and gave her into my custody—I took her to the station-house, and she took this cup out of her pocket—it was rather wet in the middle—I did not observe whether it had affected her clothes—I put it into my handkerchief to take it home, and it burnt a bole in it large enough to get my thumb through—I asked her what she was going to do with the cup—she said she was going to get some castor-oil for her child—when I took her I said she was given into ray custody by the pro<lb></lb>secutor—she told me she did not care, for he deserved all he had got.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Lower Shadwell. I was in the bar of the Pewter Platter public-house on the evening in question—the prisoner came down the passage with the prosecutor—I heard her say to him, "She bounced about the room, and would not let me see my child"—I directly turned, and saw her lift her hand, and directly run out of the passage—I did not see whether she had any thing in her hand—I heard the prosecutor halloo very loudly—I went up to him, and asked what was the matter—he said she had blinded him with vitriol—his face was all streaming down—I assisted him in undoing his handkerchief, and he was led away to the doctor's—his face was quite black, and he com<lb></lb>plained very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pupil at the London Hospital. The pro<lb></lb>secutor was brought there on the 30th of January, about eight or nine o'clock in the evening—he was labouring under the effects of sulphuric acid having been thrown upon him—the skin was destroyed, and he was suffering violent pain—his face and neck were affected, the neck princi<lb></lb>pally—the collar of his coat was burnt—if he had not been attended to immediately it would have run to high inflammation; but in consequence of that he was greatly relieved—he was under my care fifteen or sixteen days—I am confident it was sulphuric acid, because the remedies I applied would not answer to any other—he told me it was vitriol, therefore I applied the remedies proper in vitriol, which is sulphuric acid, and they answered—it is of a very inflammatory nature—I should say, from the state his clothes were in, that an ounce and a half, or two ounces, had been thrown on him—if it had gone into his eyes it would most probably have destroyed the sight—we could not have applied the remedies in sufficient time to save it if he had not been brought when he was—his life was in no danger—if it had not been attended to it would have been much worse, but still it would not have killed him—at all events it would have taken some time to have done it—it would subject, him to very severe inflamma<lb></lb>tion, but I do not think it would have caused death.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner in her defence stated, that the prosecutor would not suffer her to see her child, which was in a dying state from his ill usage; that she took it some castor oil in a cap, when his wife abused her, and he dragged the child out of her arms, and turned her out of doors. She afterwards went with a friend to the Pewter Platter public-house to have something to drink, and finding him there, she said, "So, you want to hinder me from seeing my child, and it is dying: there is a God above who will reward you. "She further stated, that she had bought the vitriol to clean some copper, and by his knocking her about and ill-using her he knocked it over himself; that she was the fourth woman he had seduced, and turned his back upon, and he had shamefully treated and ill-used her.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brown Bear Alley, East Smithfield. I knew the lad Isaac Rummins, and Joseph Abrahams, and John Carpenter—I remember when those three lads and I were in Butler's Buildings—I do not know what day it was; it is about a couple of months ago, we were playing together—I saw the prisoner standing by the One Crown public house—there was another boy there that I did not know—he was not one of our party; he called Sullivan a name, and Sullivan came over and hit him twice in the face—Rummins laid down, and Sullivan kicked him three or four times, I do not know in what part—Rummins began to play after he had the kicks, and he said, "I have got a pain in the place where Sulli<lb></lb>van kicked me—he was hardly able to walk; in about ten minutes after he</p>

               <p>felt the pain he went home—after Sullivan had struck and kicked him he went home—I had seen Sullivan before—I ran down Butlers Buildings, Sullivan ran after me, and kicked me on the leg, and threw me down.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Butler's Buildings. I knew Rummins; I was playing with him, and some more boys—I know Sullivan, he is bigger than Rummins was—I was playing with Rummins and the other boys, and Sullivan was over on the other side by the public house—a boy came along who did not belong to our party, and he called Sullivan names, and So Sullivan came to Rummins and hit him twice and kicked him close to his side, while he was lying down—he kicked him more than once—he said to Rummins that if he caught hold of him he would jump on him—Sullivan walked away—Rummins got up, and took a lot of stones and threw at Sullivan—I am sure that was after Sullivan had kicked him—he had not done anything to Sullivan before he hit him and kicked him—Rummins went home after a while.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of the deceased, his name was Isaac Rummins. I remember the day when this happened—it was on a Thursday—I saw my brother that evening—I had seen him about two hours before, when he went out—when he came home I did not see any difference in him—on the Sunday he complained of pain in his leg, and it looked bruised, very trifling—I asked him if he had had any fell—he said he had been kicked—I fomented his leg with hot water and flannels—I took him to the hospital on the following Wednesday, and got some lotion—I used it; it did not do him any good at all—I afterwards went to a doctor; he gave me some stuff to stop his sickness, he said he could not do anything to his leg, he must go to the hospital—I know Sullivan—in consequence of what my brother said, I went to him, and asked him how he could kick him who was only a child compared to him—he laughed at me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. George's Hospital. I remember the lad being brought in on Wednesday, 25th March—he had an abscess over his right hip—it was opened by Mr. Burket, the surgeon, three or four days afterwards—that relieved the lad—the abscess continued to discharge very profusely—he gradually sunk, and died on 10th April—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the organs of the body were healthy—I attribute his death to the abscess—a blow or a kick would have caused that abscess—I could see no natural cause to account for the death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do not you think that a fall on a stone or a brick would produce the same effects as you saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, any blow would—I have not said that this abscess was of several weeks duration when he was brought to me—I do not remember it, it might have been—I never said so positively, if I did say it.</p>

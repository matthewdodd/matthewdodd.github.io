On the 22d of July, at a quarter before seven in the evening, I served the prisoner with a glass of cyder in the parlour, which joins the bar. There is a door leads from the parlour to the bar; he paid for it, and left the house. At half-past nine the same evening I saw him again. I heard Murphy, the servant, speaking to some one on the stairs, and having no lodgers, I called to know who she was speaking to. I saw the back of a man going into the yard. I took a candle, and followed him. I found a small piece of muslin and a piece of cotton, strewed about the yard, which had come from my work-bag up stairs. I saw the man go into the privy, and I asked what business he had up stairs. He said, my name is

            , and I came out of the parlour; he came out, and then I saw his countenance. I said to him I have served you before this evening; he said Yes, certainly you did. I threw the parlour door open; the prisoner then went into the parlour. I left him there while I went to look in the yard; I went to the privy, and there saw a bag down on the soil. I saw a man immediately take it up with a rake. There was an old silk gown, and some articles of no value in it, it was mine. I went into the parlour, and said to him, did not you take the keys out of the parlour cupboard,</p>

               <p>"Pray do tell me if you have." I had missed them ever since he came for the cyder. I sent for a smith, and had the cupboard-door opened, and to my surprise, there was no plate in it. I sent for Warren, the constable, who took him into custody. I had put the eighteen spoons in a box in the cupboard at six o'clock that night. I locked it, but did not take the keys out.</p>

            . I am a constable of Marylebone. On the 22d of July I was fetched to Wells's, and took the prisoner to the watch-house. He said his father was to be found at a public-house in a street in Tottenham-court-road; that he lived at Camden-town. In consequence of what I heard, I went to No. 4, Miller-street, Camden-town, and enquired for Mr. Napper. I found nineteen pieces of plate in a box there. I afterwards saw Coates fit a key to that box, it opened it.</p>

               indicted for a conspiracy
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Before the Jury were sworn, Mr. Shepherd, of counsel for the defendants, observed that such indictments were instituted for the purpose of preventing combinations, very dreadful in their nature and consequence. If that object could be attained without putting the unfortunate defendants in a situation of being without any resource, either for their own support, or that of their families, the ends of public justice would be answered. He thought that the object attained in this case, though there were unlawful combinations existing, and very many persons were then languishing, for similar offences, in different gaols, in the most miserable situation; he therefore threw the defendants on the mercy of the prosecutors, and the Court, undertaking they should plead guilty; and should they at any time be guilty of any sort of offence or combination, or avow any thing against the interest of their masters, then they might be brought up to receive that punishment which they would deserve; and then the hand of the law would fall upon them with all its weight. He wished to avoid the consequences of a conviction, which must inevitably be ruin, misery, and distress, to the defendants.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, for the masters, observed, that the ends of these prosecutions were attained, if the defendants were convinced that what they had done was wrong; that the masters had no wish to injure, nor any animosity against any one of the men. It was the alarming combination they wanted to suppress; and the punishment of these men must be exceedingly severe, if the masters proceeded to convict them. It was not their wish to tear them from their familles, and send them for two or three years to a loathsome gaol. He therefore said, if these men were sincere, would come into Court with that contrition which was expected from them, plead guilty, and throw themselves on the mercy of the prosecutors, those prosecutors had no wish to pursue them to a severe punishment, unless they should offend again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow said, it will be well for these men to remember, that this is not the conclusion of the business, it is only the evil day postponed. It is only punishment remitted; if they behave as good members of society, this offence will not be included in the catalogue of their sins; but if they do not, it will increase the score of their offences. These men are to understand, that if they do not offend again, they will not be brought up for punishment; but it is also to be understood, that this favour is extended to them on condition that they shall not enter into any new conspiracies themselves, but on the contrary, that they will do their utmost, by their influence and example, to prevent the like in others. In short, he added, it is a sincere repentance that we ask for, and that repentance to be shewn by their good conduct, for the benefit of the trade in general.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. - The counsel for the defendants seems to have taken a part which certainly does his feelings much honour, and I hope may be of essential service to the public. If we impose a severe punishment on the parties, when the combination is at an end, we, in fact, do an injury to the public, because we are depriving them of the advantage of a great many honest sober citizens, of men who, having once done<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280087"></xptr>wrong, are disposed to do right. The law knows no resentment against the persons of individuals; it is the crime alone which the law seeks to punish; but if these prosecutions were to take effect, and were to punish these men, the only way would be to send them to a gaol, where, in all probability, they would form very bad connections, and the public would be very materially injured by the enforcement of these kind of prosecutions.</p>
               <p>The conduct of counsel for the masters does them equal honour, and the prosecutors have shewn lenity to these men; but at the same time that they have shewn that lenity on those grounds upon which a public man ought always to act as to individuals, they have abandoned any private resentments that might have existed in their minds against these men. In short, public advantage seems to be the only motive of these prosecutions; and the masters are now ready to shew the defendants every favour they can, upon condition of their behaving better in future. It is necessary something should be held over the heads of these people, by way of terror; and after what has been said by the Counsel for the prisoners, I should hope there will be no occasion on the part of the masters, to bring forward against them the Judgment of the Court.</p>
               <p>The Defendants then retracted their Plea of not Guilty, and <rs id="t17891028-97-verdict463" type="verdictDescription">

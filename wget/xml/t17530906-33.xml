               <p>Jonathan Joel. On the 15th of August at night, after twelve o'clock, I was very drunk, I met the prisoner and another woman in Bishopsgate-street, who asked me to treat them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before?</p>
               <p>Joel. No, not I.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they pick you up, or you them?</p>
               <p>Joel. I suppose it was the common salutation, How do you do, my dear. We went into several publick-houses, I remember one was in <placeName id="t17530906-33-crimeloc168">Montague-Court</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you sit down?</p>
               <p>Joel . We did, one sat on one side me, and the other on the other, and we staid some considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay?</p>
               <p>Joel. I can't tell how long.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your watch in your pocket when you was there?</p>
               <p>Joel. I am sure I had it when we went in. We went all out together, and after we were standing in the street this woman at the bar invited me to do that thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What thing?</p>
               <p>Joel. Called carnal conversation, so we went into an alley, I believe I had not carnal conversation with her, but I don't swear that; as she, with one hand was getting things in order, at the same time she with the other snatch'd my watch, I felt her lug it out, then she let go her hold with the other hand, and ran away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you catch her again?</p>
               <p>Joel. No, I did not; the watch was stopped by a pawnbroker, and is here in court.</p>

            . This watch ( holding one in his hand ) was brought to me on the 15th of August, by the prisoner at the bar; she told me her husband was in trouble in a spunging-house, and she wanted to borrow twenty shillings upon his watch, I told her if that was the case I'd go along with her to him, and lend him as much as I could upon it; but before we were got for she began to cry, and said, if I would be easy she would tell me the truth. Then she told me, that the night before she had conversation with a man, and the watch dropped out of his breeches upon her petticoat, and she took it. I advertised the watch three times, and in about a fortnight after, the prosecutor came and swore to the watch, and that the prisoner pick'd it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence <rs id="t17530906-33-verdict169" type="verdictDescription">

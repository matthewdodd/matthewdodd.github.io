                  </hi>. I am the wife of Rufus Bonniwell—we live at King-street, Richmond—he keeps an upholsterer's shop—about 11 o'clock in the morning of 2d August the two prisoners came and asked for a chess<lb></lb>board—I told them I did not keep them—they asked if I had a table with checks upon it—I showed them one—one said it would be too cumbersome, and the other did not think so—they asked me the price, and I told them 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about an hour after, I felt in my pocket for my purse, and it was gone—it had been last in my pocket about a quarter of an hour before they came in—it contained a sovereign, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a silver pencil-case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—during the time they were in the shop, they were close enough to have taken it—they passed from my left side to my right—one of them was examining the table—Alexander came close to me—there is no counter in the shop—nobody had been in the shop, or near me, after they left.</p>

Q.</hi> How long before they came had you seen it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From a quarter to half an hour—I had only just been through the shop to the room at the back—it was a leather purse with anelastic band—I went to the butcher's, and I had to take my purse out, to take some money out—I was putting it into my pocket just as I was coming into my shop—I never saw the prisoners before—they had left the shop about half an hour—the baker called, and I felt for my purse to pay, and missed it—no one had been in the shop, and I had not been out—I had not been talking to any one.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, W</hi> 147). About quarter after 11 I was on duty at Richmond, and went in search of the prisoners—I appeared on the railway-platform at quarter to 12 or 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoners there—I asked them if they were natives of Richmond—they wanted to know what that had to do with me—I told them I had reasons for asking—they said they came from London—I said, "What part?"—they said, "What has that to do with you?"—I asked them if they had been in any shop in Richmond—they said, "Yes, several"—I asked them if they had been in an upholsterer's shop—they said, "No"—I took them back to Mrs. Bonniwell, who identified them—I took them to the station, and on Williams I found two cedar pencils, and two railway-tickets, one was Richmond to Vauxhall, and the other Richmond to Kingston—they bear the same date—I searched Alexander, and found on him 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—they both gave their addresses and I went there.</p>

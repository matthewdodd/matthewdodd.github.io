                  </hi>. I am a ship's steward, and live at No. 15, St Alban's-terrace, Vauxhall-bridge-road. On Saturday, 10th May, I was returning home, and passed Golden-lane about 3 minutes past 12 o'clock—there is a public house at the corner of the street, and the prisoner and two females were trying to get in at the door, which was closed—I tried to get in, but they would not let me in—one of the females said that she knew where she could get something to drink; the observation seemed addressed to me—they went down Golden-lane, and I followed them—we turned into a court, and the prisoner stepped behind me, put his hand round my throat, and almost throttled me—3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was taken from my waistcoat pocket, and a gold ring off my finger—when I recovered myself I walked into Golden-lane, and saw a constable, who took me into several houses, and I picked out the prisoner from about fifteen others—I had been drinking, but was perfectly sober.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.You cannot tell, I apprehend, from seeing a dead body, whether it died<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110118"></xptr>from taking prussic acid? A. Not without examining it internally; the friends would not allow the body to be opened, and the Coroner did not see any particular reason for it - the prisoner was brought before the Inquest to give an account.</p>
               <p>Q. The two terms contracted are very much alike, and a boy making up a prescription might mistake one for the other? A. It is possible.</p>

            . I am an apothecary, and live in Tottenham-court-road. I saw the deceased on Sunday, the 31st of March, at No. 28, University-street; she had a nervous fever, and the tooth-ache; I prescribed for her - the prescription was written in the book, on the 1st of April; I prescribed among other things tinct. hydrosiamus; there had been a prescription immediately preceeding for hydrocianic acid for a patient - there was no prussic acid in what I prescribed for her; I saw her again directly her husband came for me on the Monday, after the prescription had been taken; I found the bottle with the label on it, for a table-spoonful to be taken every four hours - it had been prepared from my shop, and had been prepared by the prisoner; on smelling it, I believe prussic acid to form part of the contents of the bottle; she was hardly in existence when I saw her, the nerves were prostrate; I should suppose she died from the effect of the prussic acid, combined with the state she was in; there appeared to have been prussic acid in the bottle- I cannot say how it came there; the lable was in the hand-writing of the prisoner - she died within a few minutes after I saw her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were you there when the medicine was sent out of the shop? A. I was not - I had but one assistant - the prisoner is eighteen years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he understand Latin? A. As far as I examined him; I did not examine him all through the pharmacopiae; I believe he understands Latin quite sufficiently to make up prescriptions - I never tried him to translate a page of Virgil; I should think I could do it myself; I certainly did not inquire whether he had learned his Latin Grammar - it is a question never asked - I say it ought not to be asked; I gave him no salary - he was to come to me on trial, and 3s. a week was to be given to him to pay the expences of washing until we made an agreement; there is a spaee of six or seven inches between the two prescriptions - Mrs. Latter's follows the other; the prisoner had been nearly a month with me; any one who had vision sufficiently to tell light from darkness, could tell which was which; he has made up prescriptions with prussic acid in them scores of times, and made them correctly; one or two drops is the commonest medicine in the world; I have taken as much pains as any body has ever done; the Coroner's Jury said I had not used due caution in taking his character; I mean to prove to the contrary - I had his character from Mr. Broughton, No. 44, Leather-lane.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Leather-lane. The prisoner was in my service between two and three years - he left two or three months back; I gave Mr. Clapham such a character as I considered he was justified in having - he was not a very well informed young man when he came to me, but being a relation of my wife's I paid particular attention to him; he knew the properties and character of prussic acid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long ought a person to serve his apprenticeship before he dispenses medicines? A. In two or three months a person may make up prescriptions; it would take six or eight months, or perhaps twelve months to make up every prescription - I think it may be learned in that time by a person who did not know Latin; he came to me as shop-boy - I do not know what he had been before; I do not know that he is in any employ before he was with me; he was my wife's nephew - he did not know a syllable of Latin when he came to me; I considered the instruction I gave him quite a sufficient remuneration for his services - I consider when he left my shop his services would be worth 8s. or 9s. a week; he was not apprenticed to me at all - I dismissed him for his impertinence; I never had the least fault to find with him except for that, he acted as servant in my shop and cleaned my shoes, he was not entrusted to make up prussic acid or any thing of the sort - I never had a prescription come into my shop of that sort while he was with me; I am in a considerable business, and did not, in the two or three years, have a single prescription of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had, should you have thought him competent to mix it? A. I should have been very cautious in what I suffered him to do, if I had been there - I took him from the country.</p>

            . I am a Policeman, and live in University-street. The deceased was my wife - Mr. Curtis saw her; the four bottles produced are the medicine given her by direction of Mr. Clapham - Mr. Clapham saw her on Monday, the 1st of April, after she had taken this medicine; I ran for him in consequence of the symptoms she exhibited - he came directly; she was dying quite fast, and did not live ten minutes - her name was Mary Rocher Latter - I saw three table spoonfuls administered to her out of that bottle; she exhibited no symptoms of dying till after she took that medicine.</p>
               <p>MR. CURTIS. This is the bottle which contained the prussic acid - it now smells very decidedly of prussic acid- in my judgment she died from taking the prussic acid contained in the mixture; the dose supposed to have been given was sufficient to cause death, but I would not swear that much less would have done it.</p>

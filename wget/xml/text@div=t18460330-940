I live in Half Moon-passage, leading from Gracechurch-street to Leadenhall-Market—I am the beadle of Lime-street ward—about five o'clock on Thursday morning, 26th of March, I saw Jones coming from Gracechurch-street with two females—he had a large basket on his head—I watched and saw him pass Mr. Warmington's door and return to the females—he had some conversation with them—he then returned towards Mr. War<lb></lb>mington's, and passed on to the house of Mr. Lambert—he had the basket still on his head—I afterwards saw him without the basket—I went round and told the policeman to watch at that end of the passage—I afterwards saw him join the women again—I saw him again at Mr. Warmington's shop door—he had nothing with him then that I could perceive—I then lost sight of him—I saw him again in a short time, when the policeman had just taken hold of him—he had a bag on his shoulder—the policeman put his hand under the bag and said, "Where did you get this?"—he said, "At War<lb></lb>mington's"—I went round another avenue and took the two women—I knocked at Mr. Warmington's private door, which is about three yards from the shop-door—after knocking for about five minutes Mr. Warmington's man opened the door—I went into the shop—I saw Brooks about twenty feet from the door, in the middle of the shop—this meat had been taken out of the bag which Jones had, and put into the basket—it was then laid on the block in the shop—I asked Brooks if he could identify that meat as his master's—he went towards it, turned it over, and appeared very much agitated and confused—the answer he made was, "I found the door ajar"—I said, "That is not the question, I ask you, can you identify this meat as your master's"—he turned it over and looked at it again, and said, "It did not come from here, it is none of ours"—I pointed to the vacant places in the shop where I thought it had hung, and said, "That is where the leg of mutton hung, and that is where the beef hung"—they had hung up in rows—Brooks made no reply, but Cox came in directly afterwards and said he could identify the beef—I directed him to get down another leg and chine of mutton—he said this leg was part of the same—we fitted them and they corresponded exactly—I have been a butcher all my life—I asked Brooks if he knew Jones—he said to one of the men "He is a chap that used to live along with us."</p>

               <p>Where is it now? - I believe Mr. Kirby, the keeper of the Compter, has the watch in his possession; it was delivered into his possession at Guildhall, it was produced at the examination, it was taken from the prisoner; my watch is in possession of Mr. Kirby, Mr. Alderman Crichton desired him to take care of the whole property; I sold him the watch, he had 11 l. of me besides, in change for this 30 l. note.</p>

               <p>The court were of opinion, Mr. Beauchamp was a competent witness, as he could be no more interested, than a person prosesecuting a thief for stealing his goods (whether there was a felony committed or not, must depend upon the evidence, ab initio) he is entitled by law to the property stolen, the moment the prisoner is convicted; therefore more strongly interested in the conviction than Mr. Beauchamp, in the present case; to incapacitate a person from being a witness, he must be immediately interested in the subject matter in dispute; supposing it to be a forgery, the person whose name is forged as an indorser, cannot be examined as a witness, to prove it is not his hand writing; if it was his hand writing, he would be charged with the payment of the money; therefore he is particularly interested, which is not the case, here it is a vague interest, and not the subject matter in consideration of the court.</p>

            , to take it to Great St. Helens, and see if the acceptance is good; Hevey said, he would wait till he returned, says he, he cannot be gone long, not a quarter of an hour at most; I said it could not be half an hour, he waited; when he came back, he said, he had seen a person who looked like a clerk there, who said, it was a very good note, and would be paid when it become due; in consequence of that, I let him have the watch, and gave him 11 l. 2 s. in money; and likewise a bill of parcels and receipt in the name of M'Carty; he took the watch and away he went.</p>

               <p>The accepter said, it was perfectly good, and would be paid when it became due? - I heard that from the servant. I looked all through it, I took it on the credit of the Bath bank, the acceptance; and the prisoner's appearance; I looked to the name of the acceptor, and gave credit to that, I knew nothing of Hevey before, no other conversation passed, he might be a swindler, or a substantial man; I trusted to the appearance of the note, and I relied upon the credit of the Bath bank; the order was signified by the indorsement; the first credit was to the bill itself; I was examined at Guildhall five or six times; I remember I said, the prisoner told me his name was M'Carty.</p>
               <p>Did you accompany that with any other observation? - I said, that he told me his name was M'Carty, on two or three examinations.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I did not take him up, I was at the Mansion house when the prisoner was brought there before Mr. Alderman Pugh; I searched him, and found he had a handful of gold, which I gave him again, by order of the Alderman, I found a pocket-book and a great number of notes in it, bank notes in appearance, they have been opened by different magistrates, and sealed up again; he went by the name of Hevey, never by any other name. (Then he produced a number of notes, sealed up.</p>
               <p>Court. Are they of the same kind with the rest?</p>
               <p>Clerk of Arraigns. The same bank; here are a great number, and for different sums.</p>
               <p>Court. Are they all indorsed? - Here are many B. M'Carty, and there are some blank ones; and here is a blank for a bill of exchange from Dublin, and their sums are different.</p>
               <p>Court. There is one payable to Hevey himself, I see.</p>
               <p>Clerk of Arraigns. Yes; there are some blanks of different forms, here is one with Scarborough on it.</p>
               <p>Court. There are two payable to Hevey himself?</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. There are many indorsed B. M'Carty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beauchamp. I first enquired of the real partner of the Bath Bank here in London, he said he believed there were no such people at Bath, and I was taken in; I went to Bath, the person at the house told me, that seeing the paragraphs in the paper, the man had disappeared, and they could not find him; I could find no such persons as Smith, Moore, and Co.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was apprehended long before this came due, and you put advertisements in the papers about it? - No; there were no advertisements, but paragraphs in the papers, that such a person was examined at Guildhall; I heard in consequence of that this person had decamped.</p>

             was called, but objected to being an evidence upon the trial, as he was committed prisoner upon the same affair, and desired to know if he was indicted, that if he was, he would not be a witness.</p>
               <p>The Court informed him, he would not be obliged to answer any question that might tend to prove him guilty of any crime, that he was not bound to give evidence that might criminate himself, that if he was to accuse himself in Court, he might be indicted for it, and it was open for him.</p>
               <p>The Council for the Prisoner told him, he would not ask him any questions that could possibly criminate him.</p>
               <p>He then submitted to be examined.</p>
               <p>You know the prisoner at the bar? - I do, very well.</p>
               <p>You had a house in St. Helen's? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you know such a person as M'Carty? I do.</p>
               <p>Court. All this may be very material evidence to prove him guilty of a conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. It does; it may go farther, it may make him an accessary before the fact.</p>
               <p>The Court said, it is necessary to tell you, if there is a bill preferred against you for a conspiracy, what you have now said already may certainly go to make against you upon that charge.</p>

               <p>Do you know M'Carty? - Yes; I know him.</p>
               <p>Do you know M'Carty's hand-writing? I cannot possibly say; I have seen his hand writing I believe upon the back of the bills, I can say the hand-writing was equal upon every bill that I have passed through my hands, which I have accepted and paid; I have not seen him write an indorsement, therefore I cannot possibly say whether I know the hand-writing or not.</p>
               <p>You have seen him write at other times? - I have had letters from him.</p>

               <p>He did not recollect M'Carty's being in the King's bench prison; the letter produced by the wife was all the knowledge he had, that he was at Bath about a month or six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>The three different signatures are shewn to the witness; he deposed, that he delivered them to be his hand writing, but would not be positive.</p>
               <p>This witness was asked if he could write, he said a little; he was then desired to write his name, which he did, in a very good hand.</p>

               <p>Court. You are going to disprove his hand writing by a similitude of hands, which you cannot do, it is not a proper proof.</p>
               <p>Mr. Robinson called. Deposed he had seen M'Carty write once, to a bond of indemnito to the parish, in the year 1774. The bond shewn the witness, signed at that time, was objected to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashhurst stated, there were two questions proper for the consideration of the jury; the first, was, whether they believed it to be the indorsement of any person of the name of

             M'Carty; if it was not, there could be no doubt it was a forgery. If there was no such person in existence, or that it was not really his hand writing; but supposing they should be of opinion, there was such a man existing as

             M'Carty, and that it was his hand writing; there still might be another question, proper for their consideration, (and that was upon a point, which he believed had never been precisely determined by any judicial determination). Whether, if a person produces the real signature of a person existing, purporting to be the indorsement of such person, and says, I am that 
               <persName id="t17820109-22-person331">

             M'Carty, or that man (whoever he is) that indorsed the note, that in fact is not the man; it shall, or not, amount in point of law to a forgery; and said, if the jury found their verdict upon the latter ground, he would take care the matter should undergo a discussion, before the twelve judges, who would settle the point of law. The law in general was thus, If a person tended any instrument to another, with intent to procure money or goods, and indorsed it himself by another person's name, in the presence of the person to whom it is tendered, that would certainly be in point of law, a forgery; that he believed had already been determined; but that was not the case here, the prisoner did not sign the name

             M'Carty; I am innocent as the child that never was born; and that the Almighty may make an example of me before the world, if ever I did it; I have a wife and three young children, the eldest not above three years old, and the youngest not above a few months; I have no provision for them but my liberty; and also, my lord, that I may be an example if ever I indorsed it, or said my name was M'Carty; the witness said the bill was good; there was another person present when I offered to indorse the bill, and he has it unindorsed by me, and I hope, gentlemen, you will consider it.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Beauchamp. Whether at the time the prisoner offered the bill, the servant was in the shop? And whether the prisoner offered to indorse the bill?</p>
               <p>Court. Was the servant in the shop at the time the bill was offered to you? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Beauchamp. Yes; but he was employed at the farther end of the shop, upon other business.</p>
               <p>Did or did not the prisoner, at the time, offer to indorse it? - No, sir; he said he had indorsed it, and that was his name.</p>
               <p>He did not say he would indorse it, but he had indorsed it? - He had indorsed it, he said.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came he to go out of your shop, before the boy returned? - He was gone a long while, I had the watch; he was in and out of the shop, and waited; I had the watch and money too, till the boy came back.</p>

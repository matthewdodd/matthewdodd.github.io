I look'd a little distance back, and seeing the prisoner stooping down upon a post I ran back, and laid hold of him by the collar, telling him I missed my handkerchief and believed he had got it. I pull'd him up from the post, and found my handkerchief in his hand (produced in court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it?</p>
               <p>Shepherd. I believe it is worth half a crown; it is a silk handkerchief, not much worn.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the prisoner from you?</p>
               <p>Shepherd, About a rod distance.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the handkerchief last?</p>
               <p>Shepherd. I know I had it in my pocket about an hour before.</p>

            . As I was walking down Bishopsgate Street the prisoner brush'd by me, the prosecutor being before; after that the prosecutor charged him with taking his handkerchief, and about a minute after I saw him take it out of the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take the handkerchief ?</p>
               <p>Sobard. No, I did not; he is a weaver, and the master he has work'd for these twelve years told me he never heard he wrong'd any body before, but he could not be here.</p>

               <p>I took the handkerchief from off the ground and put in on the post, I was not nigh the gentleman.</p>

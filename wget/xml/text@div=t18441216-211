On Monday, the 2nd of Dec., about a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in with some patterns of silks to match—I was not able to match them—she purchased several small articles, which came to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were several pieces of silk on the counter—one very nice piece was ticketed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which she remarked was very cheap—I had occasion to leave her, I should think a dozen times, to get the different things she wanted, and on my return the last time, I saw that her hand seemed to shake, and she seemed rather anxious to get out of the shop—she gave me half-a-sovereign, and said she would be back in five minutes for her parcel and the change, and left the shop—as soon as she had left, I examined the silks on the counter, and missed a piece marked 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard, which was one of the pieces that bad been shown to her—I immediately went and mentioned it to Mr. Hardwick—the prisoner returned in about a quarter of an hour, and asked if her parcel was ready—I said it was—Mr. Robinson immediately asked her to step into the ware-house, he wanted to speak to her—she went in with him—I went in a few minutes after, and heard her denying that she had taken the silk—I after­ wards heard her say that it was in a pawnbroker's shop over the way, but that it was not taken by her.</p>

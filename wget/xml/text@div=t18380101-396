                  </hi>. I am landlord of the White Swan, Little St. Andrei. street, Seven-dials. On Tuesday, the 27th of December, the two prisoners were in my tap-room—I could not get them out—I called for a police<lb></lb>man, but he dared not come in, he said, except for robbery or murder—they were too much for me—I could not get them out—I tried to get them out, and they threw my table against me, as if they were going to murder me—I called the policeman at ten o'clock at night—I sat down till four o'clock in the morning, and fell asleep—I then awoke, and saw Compton at my till—Phillips was on the other side—Compton had some coppers in his hand, and the till, and was going to put them into his pocket—I took him by the collar—he put them back, and said, "I have got no money"—my wife was in the parlour—I said, "We will search you"—we searched his right-hand pocket, and found this money—I charged him with its being my money—that money was missing from the till—we have two bowls in the till, and, as near as I can say, three minutes before, this silver was in the bowl, and one halfpenny laid on this bowl on the silver—the halfpenny was found in his pocket—all this time Phillips was on the other side, and he kept on telling Compton to cut my b—y head off, and beat out my brains—Compton was inside the bar, and Phillips on the other side—he could see all that was done by Compton—he said, "You have three halfpence of Compton's money, give it him back, or I will pull you up and make you sorry"—I told him to behave himself, or I would call a policeman—I was going to call a policeman, and he clung round my neck, and held his hand over my mouth as I got along—our door was closed—he got his head against the door—I got the door open as well as I cook—he put his hand on my mouth, and Compton ran out of the house—a policeman met him and brought him back—I had found the money, and gave it to my wife—the policeman took them to the station, and the money was left there.</p>

               <p>they said they would go out if she would draw them a little ale—she drew them one pot, I think, and then they sat down—my wife was poorly—she was near her confinement—she was sober—I had not been drinking with the company the greater part of the day—the police<lb></lb>man came in directly I alarmed him—I have seen Compton in our house twice before, and Phillips several times—I do not know where they live—I was sober—I have never been tipsy—I laid hold of some of the party to get them out, but not these men.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 71.) I took Compton about twenty yards from the prosecutor's, hiding up against a baker's door—the prosecutor stated his loss, and neither of them denied it.</p>

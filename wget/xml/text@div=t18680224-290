                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Walter Graham, oil cake manufacturer, at West Drayton—on 24th January the prisoner came to the mills, and asked me the price of linseed cake—I said 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per ton—he said he wanted some, but he did not give me any directions where he wanted it sent to, and I referred him to Mr. Graham—he wrote down his address, this is it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "J. H. Field, Wilsdew House, Thorpe, Surrey"—I have made inquiries, but no person of that name lives there—this order was brought to me at the works on the 30th (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "Eggham Hythe Farm, 29th January, 1868. Gentlemen, Please deliver to bearer two tons of best linseed cake, and oblige yours respectfully, C. Saunders. Please send account by the bearer"—I gave the cake to the carman, who gave the name of Thomas Wiggins—I saw them loading the cake, and went away for a short time; when I came back it was gone—I next saw the prisoner at the Kingston police-station on 30th January, and identified him as the man who had been to my place—he was with me altogether about half-an-hour—he</p>

               <p>went away, and came back and said he had been to the hotel to have a glass of ale, and said I could do business as well as my master—I said in this case I could not, and again referred him to Mr. Graham—I saw the cart that came for the cake—there was "Saunders, Egham, Surrey," on the side of it.</p>

Simply handed the order to me; we had no conversation—we have had orders from Mr. Saunders before—I have had letters from Mr. Saunders—I have never seen him write—I believed that order to be in Mr. Saunders's writing—there was no one else with the van but the man who called himself Wiggins—it was about twenty minutes or half an hour from the time of my receiving the order and the van; going away—there were four or five of my men helping to get the cake into the van—this order was given to me four or five days after I saw the prisoner—when I saw him at the police-court he was not in the dock, but in the yard—I went in to see if I knew him, and I did; there were about twelve others there with him—I do not know whether he came out first or last; I merely saw the man there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Egham, Hythe Farm, and am a customer of Mr. Graham's—this order was not written or signed by me, I know nothing about it—the prisoner was in my service five years ago—I have seen his writing, and I have compared with a book the writing on the order, and believe it to be his—I did not send a man named Wiggins to the prosecutor on the 30th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the prisoner write that in the book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is an account that he kept—the writing in the book is his—he was the only person who kept the accounts—I did not take any part of the book to the police-court—I would not swear that I have seen him write; I have no doubt I have a good many times—I am in the habit of sending orders to Mr. Graham—we do not generally send written orders; we send an order by the boy, a printed order—I have never sent an order like this—if one of my clerks had written out the order I should not expect them to deliver it—I believe this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be in the prisoner's writing—at the police-court I said I did not think it was, but now I believe it is, as I have compared it.</p>

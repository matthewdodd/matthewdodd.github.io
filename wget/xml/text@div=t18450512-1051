                  </hi>. In March last I lived at No. 11, George-street, St. Giles's, as charwoman. On Monday night, the 31st of March, I recollect a man and woman coming there about a quarter to eleven o'clock, to the best of my opinion—I never saw the man before—the woman went by the name of Mrs. Tape—she asked for a threepenny room, and the man gave me the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of his hand—he was dressed in a cap and a velveteen jacket—I did not show them to a room—I gave the light to the woman—she found her own way, and the man went with her into the back parlour—after they had gone I stopped a bit in the front parlour—I then came out and sat down on the stairs for a few minutes—after they had been in the back parlour a short time, it might be a little better than five minutes, I heard the cries of murder—it was the cry of a woman—she repeated it three times after the first cry, "Murder! murder!" Justin one breath—I got up and knocked at the door of the back parlour—I knocked twice without receiving an answer—I then put my back to the door and forced it open—I then saw the woman sitting on the bedstead, and the man stand<lb></lb>ing over her with his hand up over her neck—his hand was not stirring at all—I thought he was beating the woman—I said, "For God's sake do not beat the woman"—he turned round and faced me—there was a glim<lb></lb>mering light in the room—there was not much candle—a little bit—he did not say a word—he came from the bed and came out at the door—I was close against the door—I caught him by the outside pocket of the coat as he was coming out at the door to run away—he forced his coat out of my hand, caught me round, and threw me up by the fire-place—in doing so he took hold of the front part of my shawl, and left marks of blood upon it—he succeeded in getting out—the woman got up off of the bedstead and walked to the fire-place, just as I was getting up—she had her hands up to her face so that I could not see any blood—she never spoke—she gave a bit of a stagger, and down she fell against the fire-place—I called out to the landlady of the house, "Mrs. Hall, stop that man"—he was out of the passage before I had time to get out of the room—I saw him in the passage at the street-door—Mrs. Hall had hold of him—he forced himself away from her, opened the door, and went away—I returned to the back parlour immediately along with Mrs. Hall—she brought a candle—I found the woman lying, making a great noise, but she could not speak—there was a knife sticking in the side of her neck—I then went for an officer, and found Allen down by the station, standing at the corner—he came immediately, and he pulled the knife out—I after<lb></lb>wards</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 159.) I was on duty on Monday night, the 31st of March, at a little before eleven o'clock, standing at the corner of Clark's-mews and George-street—I know No. 11 very well—I was on the same side of the street as No. 11, and fifty-two feet from it—I have measured it—a little before eleven o'clock I observed a man come from No. 11 towards me—before he came up to me he crossed over the way, when he was from nineteen to twenty feet from me, and passed on on the other side of the street—he had on a dark coat, I believe a velveteen coat, and a cap—I believe there was a peak to the cap—I would not swear positively whether there was a peak or not—about five or six minutes after that man crossed over I was fetched to No. 11—I had remained all that time at the corner of the street—I did not observe any one else come out of No. 11 before Mrs. Palmer came to me—no one could well do so without my observation, because the door went on a creak, and I heard the door close when the man ran out—I heard the noise, and also when Mrs. Palmer came out—I heard no such noise in the interval—on hearing what Mrs. Palmer said I went directly to No. 11 with another constable—I found the deceased in the back room lying on her side, with a knife sticking in her neck behind the ear, with the handle upwards—she made a sort of smile, and moved her eyelids—there was some motion of her muscles as I drew out the knife—I produce the knife—she did not speak—I cannot say whether she died immediately, for directly I drew out the knife I ran for a surgeon—I was gone a very short time—when I returned she was dead—I have preserved the knife ever since—I afterwards saw Mr. Brothers at the inquest—he saw the body of the woman that I found in the back parlour—I have no doubt who the man that passed me was, but I would not swear positively—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man, but I would not swear it positively—I have a strong belief that he is the man—I knew him before, I should say for about three or four years—I am in the habit of seeing him frequently as I cross Seven-dials, and the neighbourhood—I did not know where he lived—I never spoke to him that I am aware of.</p>

               <p>minutes talking to him—he told me he had got a little better—that was all that passed—I saw him again on the Monday night, about half-past line o'clock, in Bloomsbury-street, near the chapel—he was by himself—he crossed to me—I did not see whether he left any one—I asked him low he was—he said, "Much the same"—he asked me how I was—I said, "I am very well"—he said, "I have just been blowing the old b----up, and she denies all; if I come up to her in these clothes, the will know me; I will go home and change my clothes, and then she won't know me"—he had on then a fustian jacket and a hat—I am sure he said she would not know him—he said, "I shall put on my black coat and my cap"—he then left me—I saw him again about ten minutes after, as near as I can judge, when he came back to me—he then had on his black I velveteen coat, and a cap with a peak—became and looked straight in my 'face, and said, "Do you think she would know me now?"—I said, "Yes why should not the woman know you?"—that was all that passed—he said he had something at home to pepper her—that was before he went to change his clothes—he has frequently said, when I used to meet him, that he would <hi rend="italic">pay her out, serve her out</hi>—he did not say it that night—after this second conversation, I went in another direction—I was gone about three quarters of an hour—when I returned, I found a mob of people about No. 11, and heard that a murder had been committed.</p>

On the night Mrs. Tape was murdered I saw the prisoner, a little after nine o'clock, by the chapel, in Charlotte-street—he passed by me, but did not speak—I saw him go up and speak to Mrs. Tape—Graham, Scotland she, were together—I do not know what he said, but I heard Mrs. Tape say, "I did not"—he had a hat on at that time—about a quarter of an hour after I saw him at the corner of Pine-street—he patted me on the shoulder, and said, "How are you, old girl?"—I said, "Very well, thank you; how are you?"—he said this Mrs. Tape, the old woman, had given him the <hi rend="italic">clap</hi>—I said I was very thirsty, would he give me half a pint of beer—he said, "Yes, two, if you like"—he said, "I had a hat on when I saw you before, but I have been home and put my cap on"—he afterwards asked me to go and examine him, and. offered me a fourpenny-piece for it—he was standing at the corner of the street, and he said, "I know you have a room of your own; if you will, take me home, and see what is the matter with me?"—he had only a four-penny bit, which he gave me—I had an opportunity of seeing how he was dressed when he went to my room—he had a cap and a velveteen coat on—my room is a very little way from No. 11, George-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cutler, residing in High-street, St. Giles. My shop is about 300 yards from No. 11, George-street, or hardly so much, in one direction—I know Endle-street—that is about the same dis<lb></lb>tance from my shop—on the night of the 31st of March I waa in my shop, and sold the knife produced—I know the person to whom I sold it—it was the prisoner—he came into my shop about ten minutes to ten o'clock, as near as I can judge—when he came into the shop he said, "What is the cheapest small carving-knife you have?"—I said, "I will show you some directly, I believe I have some second<lb></lb>hand ones"—after I had finished what I was about, which was in the space of half a minute, I went round to the other side of the counter, and took three carving-knives out of a drawer—I was on one side of the counter, and he on the other—there was a very good light in the shop, three gas burners—he spoke to me across the counter—the counter runs in two directions—I went round to another part, still keeping inside the counter—he accompanied me round on the outside, and stood opposite me there the same as before—I took the three carving-knives out of the drawer, and placed them on the counter before him—I said, "These are a shilling each"—he examined them—he took all three together into his hand, and examined each of them—no observa<lb></lb>tion whatever passed from him—he put down a shilling, and was about to take one of the knives which he had selected away—he kept one in his hand, and put the other two down, and was about to leave the shop—I said, "I will wrap it up for you"—he came back, and gave the knife back into my hand—I went round the counter, and set the edge of it on a stone that we have for the purpose, then wrapped it up in paper, and gave it to him—nothing more passed—he then left the shop—I did not notice his dress particularly—he had a hat on, I am certain, and a dark coat, but what kind I do not know—I had no recollection of having seen him before—he was quite a stranger to me—I saw him again on the following Friday, I think—he was then in custody.</p>

               <p>remember the man again who purchased the knife, and she thought he had a blotch by the side of his nose, not that she would know him by that par<lb></lb>ticularly, but that she thought he had a blotch—I hare never told anybody that I should know him by a blotch by the side of his nose—I never said that I noticed a blotch by the side of his nose—I was not in constant com<lb></lb>munication with the police after I gave this information, once or twice I possibly, not more—I did not hear that a young man had been using threats towards the deceased—I did not know of it till after the prisoner was taken into custody—I did then hear that he was a person who had been using a threats against Mrs. Tape—not before I saw him—one of the police-officers from the Bow-street station came and fetched me and told me that Connor was taken into custody—I do not know the officer's name—I am not aware that he is here—he did not tell me that a young man was taken into cus<lb></lb>tody who had used threats towards the deceased, nothing of the kind—he said that Mr. Pearce had just brought a man to the station-house, that they believed to be the man—that was all—I saw Pearce before I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner—I had no conversation with him about the prisoner—he merely said that the man would be brought out—that was all the conversation we had till after I saw the man—he did not, after I had seen him, tell me a word respecting the threats, nor before I was examined—I never heard a word from Mr. Pearce about it before my examination—I had heard it rumoured, nothing more—I was present before the Magistrate—one of the women was examined first—I rather expect it was Bridget Ronan—I do not know whether Elizabeth Hill was examined second—I was not in the office—I did not hear them examined—we were placed in a room at the office and called in one after another—I had heard it rumoured about these threats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And at the time you were taken to see Connor you had no doubt he was the person that used those threats, had you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not thought on the subject at that time, I assure you—I saw him first at the station-house on Friday evening, and on Saturday he was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On Friday evening before you saw him, you had not heard I that a man was in custody who had been threatening the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nothing of the sort—my great certainty was not till after I had finished my one examination before the Magistrate—the chief reports that I heard were from I one and another of the witnesses in the waiting-room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you had heard there were reports of that sort before you were examined before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Precisely so, I had—the man was in I my shop altogether, I should say, two or three minutes—he had his hat on all the time—the only words he made use of while he was in my shop was asking me whether I had the knives—that was the first question he put to line—he said nothing after that—I was more sure of him when I heard him I put a question to me before the Magistrate—that was the second time I heard his voice—he did not speak in the station-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was there remarkable in his voice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot describe pre<lb></lb>cisely as to the tone of voice, but my impression was as to his age more than anything else, that he was from nineteen to twenty, that he was a man who had not reached manhood—it was not a set voice—it was from his voice that I judged more particularly as to his age, that it was the voice of a person in some degree changing its tone from boy to man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What opportunity had you of seeing his face during the time he was in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He directly faced me when he came in at the door—the breadth of my counter is about thirty inches—he stood directly in front of</p>

               <p>me when he came in, and when I went round to the other side he stood directly in front of me again—I saw his face—one gas light was directly over his head—that would throw the shadow of his hat over his face—the other gas lights were in the window, about two yards from where he was standing—they gave a very good light indeed in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 11, Crown-street, St. Giles's. I have been acquainted with the prisoner a good many years, I should say, five, six, or seven years—I have been on friendly terms with him, and continued so down to the time when the death of this woman happened—on the night of the 31st of March I saw Connor—I did not notice the time exactly—it was about seven o'clock—it might be just about dark—it was on the Seven Dials, near the Crown public-house—he was in the habit of going there, and I too, and it was there that I saw him—in the course of conversation he told me that he was suffering under a certain disease—I did not notice bow long he remained with me—he might have remained half an hour—I did not notice him going away, but he did go—I missed him—about eleven o'clock that night I was at the same spot, outside the door of the Crown, and Connor came up to me—I think be came up from Queen-street—I think it was in that direction—Queen-street leads from Broad-street towards St. Giles's—I know George-street—it would lead to George-street—it is only two or three streets from George-street, and almost in a direct line—I should say it would take a person five or eight minutes to walk or run from George-street to the Crown.</p>

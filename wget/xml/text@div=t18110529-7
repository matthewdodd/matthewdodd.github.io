               <p>Q. This is not your house no more than it is the other four - A. No, we all occasionally sleep there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. On that evening had you occasion to leave that turnpike house - A. About half past nine in the evening I went to the other gate at Kingsland. When I left it I fastened the door and window; I left the house quite alone, I was obliged to go to the other gate that is about twenty or thirty yards off; I left four shillings and a penny in the window in penny-pieces; they laid about five or six inches from the window; I returned about ten minutes past ten. When I opened and went in I found the window wide open; I left it down, it had been down all the day; I missed all the penny-pieces he had been there.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street office. On Sunday night I was in Kingsland-road in company with Kennedy, Gleed, Valentine, and Rice, and crossing from Dalton-lane, to come into Kingsland-road, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I saw Kemlin standing within a few yards of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290007"></xptr>the turnpike house; I stopped a few moments, Kemlin gave a whistle; which was answered by another immediately; Kemlin then holloaed Bill and walked on to Shoreditch; after he had walked twenty yards he came up with the two prisoners; we let them walk on all three ten or twelve yards further, all conversing together; Kennedy and Valentine was close behind me; I went in front of the two prisoners, I ran after Kemlin, I found Kemlin in custody of Rice. We took all three of them to a public-house, Archer was taken into the side parlour, the other two were taken into the tap-room; Kennedy searched Archer, and when I came into the parlour I saw a quantity of copper in Kennedy's possession; I asked Archer how he came by the copper. Kennedy and Gleed were present at the time; he said he had taken it from his mother; he afterwards said that Beazely had told him to go, and shove the door of the turnpike house in, and on the window he would find the copper; he said he had told Beazeley he was afraid to do that, Beazeley then told him to shove the window back, and take the halfpence out, which he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand that Kemlin has been admitted an evidence - A. Yes, he was the first person that I observed.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he to the turnpike - A. Between two and three yards.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you made no observation of the prisoners at the bar - A. None; I did not see them at all then; it was about two minutes after I saw them, about twenty yards from the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. And Kemlin, when he came up to them, he was conversing with them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not he have given the penny-pieces to them - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there time for it - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a police officer of Worship-street. On this evening I was with Armstrong near the turnpike gate, I did not see Kemlin until Armstrong saw him. I heard a whistle, that whistle was answered by another whistle; I was about twenty or thirty yards from the turnpike gate; I saw them when they were apprehended, they appeared to be conversing together, and Kemlin ran away; as soon as Armstrong came up, he, in the first instance, stopped Archer, and put him up against the wall; I took hold of Archer, Kemlin ran away; Rice, Armstrong, and Gleed pursued him; I took Archer into the Swan public-house; before we got into the Swan Rice came up with Kemlin, we took them all into the Swan public-house, I searched Archer, in his hat I found these two handkerchiefs, in one of the handkerchiefs there were twenty-three penny pieces, in his right hand coat pocket I found twenty-nine pieces, and in his waistcoat pocket I found one penny-piece, and three halfpence. I then asked him where he got these penny pieces, he told me that he had them from his mother to carry to his grandmother at Newington. I told him from the circumstance of his having some in his hat I told him I did not believe him. I desired him to sit down. In about a quarter of an hour the turnpike man Rogers came in; he said the window of the toll-house was shoved open, and four shillings in penny pieces were taken out.</p>

            . I am an officer. On this evening I was in company with my brother officer I first observed Kemlin about four or five yards from the turnpike and I saw the two prisoners walking together on the road, from the toll-house, and Kemlin was on the path, they walked twenty or thirty yards, and then they joined, and they all conversed together about ten or a dozen yards; Armstrong stopped them, the moment he stopped the prisoner, Kemlin ran away, I ran after him about forty or fifty yards, and overtook him; I asked him what made him run away, he said he had been fighting with somebody in the road, and he was afraid it was the same party that came after him. I searched Kemlin, I found twopence halfpenny upon him in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. to Rogers. All that you lost was in penny pieces - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Rice. I saw Archer searched, I saw the things found in the manner described by Kennedy. I heard him say that Beazeley had been down in the morning to the toll-house, and asked him if he would be in a good thing, and he went along with them. Beazeley persuaded him to break the toll-house open, but he was afraid to go in at the door; he pushed the window back and got out the penny-pieces; he cried very much, and said he was very sorry, and that he had been over persuaded by Beazeley.</p>

            . I am a brick-maker. I have known both the prisoners at the bar for about five or six years. On the 12th of May I was coming along the fields with my brother, about half past six in the evening, I met Beazeley, he asked me if I would take a walk round the Cat and Mutton field. I left my brother and went with him; we met Archer; Beazeley and Archer asked me if I would take a walk to Shoreditch; I went with them. We walked up Shoreditch and came back again towards Kingsland-road turnpike; Beazeley said, would I go to Kingland. This I suppose was a little after eight o'clock. We went as far as the King's Arms public-house, Kingsland, we had a pot of beer there between us three; then Beazeley and Archer came towards the turnpike. I went over the road. I returned to them. Beazely told Archer to get some money out of the turnpike house; Archer went to the turnpike-house, and got some penny-pieces out; I heard the window go back. He afterwards told me he took them out. Then we came on towards London again, and just as I got up to them, them gentlemen came up and took hold of me; I thought it was somebody else, I ran away.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you recollect whether you made any noise before them gentlemen came up - A. Yes, I whistled, and called Bill; that whistle was answered, I cannot say by whom.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence; Beazeley called three witnesses, who said they never knew any harm of them.</p>

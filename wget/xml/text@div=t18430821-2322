I am a widow, living at the White Hart, St. Martin's-le-Grand—on the 13th of July I was in Cheapside—I had a reticule on my arm, containing 2 sovereigns, a bunch of keys, a pair of spectacles, a banker's book, and some other articles—I got as far as Milk-street—the prisoner followed after me and cut my bag off my arm—he was close to my arm—no other person was near—he ran away—I took him and held him at the corner—a gentleman was passing—it was raining—he would not assist me—the prisoner struggled hard and I lost my hold—he went a distance up Milk-street—the policeman went after him and took him—in the struggle of holding him the string of my bag dropped from my arm—the policeman picked it up in the direction the pri<lb></lb>soner had gone—it was part of the string with which my bag was fastened.</p>

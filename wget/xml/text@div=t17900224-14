               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I understand there was some other person went with you and Mayne to this house? - There was another officer, belonging to the same office.</p>

               <p>Explain the use of all the things present.</p>
               <p>Clark. The bottle had had aqua fortis, and in the bason water, and if any metal is put into the aqua fortis, they then throw it into this water, and the strength of this aqua fortis makes this water all a pickle; I have tasted it, and this is so; by this sort of stuff being put into the aqua fortis, it draws the silver on the surface, and the strength of the aqua fortis turns them black, as some are here, then by being rubbed by sand and water, the black comes off and leaves the white.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Clark rubbed one, as a specimen, about a quarter of a minute.)</p>
               <p>Among the money produced, is there any fit for circulation? - Here are two half crowns which have been fit, but not being kept properly, are tarnished, but by rubbing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240024"></xptr>them, they will be as good as ever in a moment; and I can venture to swear that they have been manufactured in the way I have said.</p>
               <p>Are they counterfeit coin? - Yes; they are counterfeit Mint money.</p>
               <p>Pray what effect hath this on the hands? - It turns them black, as mine are now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have told us, on other occasions, that cork hath been made use of in this business; there is no cork here? - There is not; it appears as if this money hath been in currency, and bought up by the Jews, and coloured afresh, in order to give it currency again; there is no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you of your knowledge in this business tell us the quantity of silver may be in that half crown? - According to assays made, a half crown hath about four-pence halfpenny-worth of silver in it, and a shilling two penny-worth.</p>

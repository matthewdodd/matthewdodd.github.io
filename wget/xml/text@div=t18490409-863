                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Tapping, who lives at Hounslow, in the parish of Heston. On 3d Oct. I came home a little after five o'clock, and found the back bed-room window had been broken open—when I went to work in the morning I left it safe, and the rest of the house locked up—I missed from the table-drawer a ring, which I had seen safe on the Monday—the drawer was not locked—I found a box unlocked which I had left locked—I missed from it thirteen half-crowns, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I had seen safe on the Monday—the key of the box was in the drawer with the ring—I know the prisoner; she used to come to my house frequently—this is the ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Oak coffee-shop, in Lambeth—the prisoner is my sister. I remember seeing her on 21st Nov.—I had not seen her for near three years—she said she had no money, but she had something that would make money, and she then asked me to go with her to a pawn-broker's, which I did—she then took a ring from her finger and pledged it for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I could not swear to the ring.</p>

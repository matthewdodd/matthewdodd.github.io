             sworn. - The prisoner had bought a coat of me; he had not money enough by three shillings, and he came to me again with these things about six or seven weeks ago to sell them, and pay me the three shillings; there were two cotton waistcoats and another waistcoat, and a pair of plush breeches, seated with velveteen, very old; I had them about a month when Mrs. Pierson called and claimed them; they had laid all the time in the window; it was the week before last I believe she claimed them, and I delivered them to the officer; I gave him eighteen shillings for them; I valued the three waistcoats at fifteen shillings; the breeches were not worth above four shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing of selling these things to that gentleman at all.(

               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Pierson). Are you positive that the waistcoats you saw at Hart's were your's? - A. Yes; I know one of them by my own work, and the other I had washed myself several times; and the breeches I know to be mine; they are very remarkable; I know them by a piece that I put in them.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Hart). Where did you find the prisoner? - A. The officer found him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pierson. He was taken the day after I found the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have got nothing at all to say, but I lodged in the next room to Mrs. Pierson; she said, she had lost some things; she suspected an old man that lived at the top of the house, and I asked her why she did not go to seek after him; and she went to seek for him, and could not find him; I teach dancing; I know nothing about the things; I always paid her my rent very regular.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Pierson). Did he pay his rent? - A. Not always; I was obliged to seize his goods for rent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mrs. Pierson). Q. Upon your oath, did you not charge somebody else with committing this robbery? - A. I thought of an old gentleman that was coming up stairs one time, but that I know nothing of.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this old gentleman? - A. A person that came after one of my lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said before now that you suspected that person of having robbed you? - A. I did think at one time that it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that gentleman an Irishman? - A. I am not sure that he was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not said at any time you supposed yourself to be robbed by an Irishman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But with respect to this old man, you had some thoughts you had been robbed by him? - A. I had; but unless I had sure proof that he had taken them, it was wrong to say any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had lost the things five weeks before you had any tidings of them again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, how many hands they might have gone through in that time, you cannot tell? A. No.</p>

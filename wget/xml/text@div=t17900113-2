               <p>Mr. Cockerill came to me, and suspected Jackson; I went with him, and his son, and Staines; and found the prisoners, and the property.</p>
               <p>You gave them some information, did not you? - So far, as where they lived.</p>
               <p>They first had a search warrant against your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came they to suspect these people? - Because they said, they had robbed them before.</p>
               <p>Did you know where they lived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At whose lodging was it? - I believe the old lady was the proprietor of the place.</p>

               <p>Was it not you that gave them the first intimation that these prisoners had some of their property? - I could not tell that they had.</p>
               <p>What did you tell them? - I told them so far as this, when they came to search my place, they had no search warrant; I gave them liberty to search; I knew myself innocent, and I said, I cannot think how you came to imagine any such thing; says he, I have not any suspicion Bugg of you; but you need not think much of it, for we have served other people the same that work for us; I worked for him at the time; then my wife said, I do not know why you should take him to gaol; and my wife said, she thought

               <p>My husband has been very bad these twelve weeks, and I went on the Monday night; I had some chairs to bottom; I carried them home on the Monday morning, and I said to my husband, now this money must go for rushes again; I went to buy some rushes, and the man gave me sixpence; I thought to get half a peck of coals, three farthingworth of tea, three farthingworth of sugar, a halfpennyworth of bread, a halfpennyworth of butter, and three farthingworth of balm; and Sir, I went home with it, and my husband said Nanny, come hither; I went to the bed-side, says he, Bugg has brought you a gown to mend; says I, I am not going to mend her gown; I had the gown under my arm; I went to the place where she lodged; I told her I could not mend it directly: that gentleman came up stairs and said, what have you there; I said nothing to you; I shewed it him directly, says he, it is not yours: well says I, she left at my room; I am a poor woman, but honest to the back of me; I did not undo it, if a cap and apron were there, I did not know it.</p>
               <p>Then it was not in your lodgings where they found you? - No Sir, it was this woman's lodging; me and my husband lodge in Castle-street, Great Saffron-hill; this was in Turnmill-street.</p>
               <p>Bugg. I believe she does live there; I was up at the place where her husband was ill.</p>

               <p>She certainly tells the truth, she had the things from me about nine in the morning; I was going to work; I met with an old woman, and bought that bed-gown and bonnet, and apron; I gave half a crown for them; they were mere rags; I carried them to her husband for her to mend them, some time after; about eleven she came up to me with the apron; I took no notice; she sat down, and Mr. Staines and

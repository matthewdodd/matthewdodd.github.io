                  </hi>. I live at 175, Sandringham Road, Dalston—on Friday night, the 7th July last, about 10.30 or a little after, I was in a public-house at the corner of the Liverpool Road—prisoner was there with some others; they came round me and asked me to stand some beer, and to get rid of their annoyance I put 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the counter—shortly after I said I should take a cab and go to Dalston, and I left the public-house—walking along Upper Street, before I came to the Green, opposite the bazaar, I felt a man's arm round my neck—I caught hold of him; I did not see his face, he was strangling me; I struggled with him, and in a moment there were three or four in front of me; I was kicked and thrown to the ground—I saw ray chain hanging loose—the prisoner fell on the top of me and tried to beat my head on the pavement—I had taken hold of the prisoner with one hand; I had my brief-bag with various papers in the right hand, and my supposition was that they wanted to take my bag—I seized him with my left hand by the collar—I did not cry out—I don't know what became of the men I saw in front—I was on the ground a minute or two, perhaps—he got up and I got up and followed him—he ran across the dark side of the road towards Duncan Street—I followed and struck him—there were two or three persons who had seen the assault and followed to protect me—Dawson, I believe, is the name of one of them, but I am not acquainted with the names of the others—a policeman came up shortly afterwards and I gave the prisoner into custody—I put the value of my watch at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it is a common workman's watch which I wear down in low neighbourhoods.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 56, Rushton Street—on Friday, the 7th July last, I was walking along the Upper Street with two or three others when I saw the prosecutor about half the distance that I am from the prisoner—I saw a man with his arm round Mr. Dyer's neck—they were struggling together, and I saw him throw Mr. Dyer violently to the pavement—the prisoner ran very sharp across the road—Dyer then got up and said "Stop him, he has got my watch"—I then followed the prisoner across the road with my friend, Dawson, and stopped him—Dyer came up and said "That is the man who has got my watch," and rushed at him and struck him in. the eye—I had not lost sight of him; he ran away again after that—a policeman came up; Dyer was then some distance away—he struck his head against a public-house and fell down—the prisoner was then given into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was perfectly sober—Fisher's is a confectioner's shop—I said at the police-court that when I saw the prisoner and the pro<lb></lb>secutor outside there they were both drunk; to my idea they were—the prosecutor had a bag in one hand when he struck him—I said "If you have got the man's watch give it to him;" and he said "I have not got his watch"—I never saw the watch—there was another gentleman standing up who pushed the prisoner off Mr. Dyer—I don't know what became of him, he went off—I looked after the prisoner—he looked like a gentleman—I will not pledge my oath there were not more there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, Upper Charles Street, and was with the last witness and saw the prosecutor, and the prisoner struggling with his arm round the prosecutor's neck—there were some others near them—prisoner threw Mr. Dyer—then a gentleman threw the prisoner off to give Dyer, an opportunity of getting away—the prisoner ran across the road—Dyer got up and followed, him saying "That man has got my watch"—May and I followed the prisoner and did not lose sight of him up to the time he was given into custody—I asked him if he had got the watch, and he said he had not—I did not see him throw anything away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before that the prosecutor did strike at him every time he stopped, and I give the same answer to-day—prisoner went up to the cab rank near the Angel and asked for a cab—he asked me to have something to drink when there was no one else near.</p>

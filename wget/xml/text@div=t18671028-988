On the afternoon of 15th October I was with Outram in Moorgate Street, and saw the prisoner with this box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), containing five lace shawls—he was looking into it, and his manner excited my suspicion—I questioned him where he got them—he said, "A man gave them to me to carry"—I asked him what they were—he said, "Some things to go down the front of ladies dresses, which my mother made"—I saw an invoice on the top which I took out; it con<lb></lb>tains the name of the prosecutor—I asked him where he was going to take them—he said that he hardly knew, for a man gave them to him to carry—I took him in custody, made inquiries, and found they belonged to Messrs. Bollen and Tidswell—I searched him at the station and found the key and a knife—I went next morning with the key, and found it opened the prosecutor's door.</p>

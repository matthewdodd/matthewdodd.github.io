Smart said the prisoner came to shew him the way, and he was to shew him the way from my house to London Bridge, as well, for 6 d., which I paid him, with 3 d. for assisting to unload the cart, and gave him a pint of beer. I wrote them a list of places where they were to call for parcels, and delivered a box of linen into the cart from my own house. I have now got the direction I gave to them, and find that,</p>
               <p>"Matthews, No. 23, Bethnal-green-road," has been added to it. The box contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

               <p>"Go and fetch the things, and I will mind the cart." I said,</p>
               <p>"No, you go, and I will mind the cart." He pretended to go after them, returned, and said he had seen the things, but the man would not let him have them, and I must go myself. I said we would take the horse and cart and both go, but he persuaded me to go alone. I left him in care of the cart, and when I got there I could find no such name or number. I came back, and found the prisoner and the box gone - he left the whip at a shop.</p>

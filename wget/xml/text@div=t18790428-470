                  </hi>. I am a domestic servant at 6, Brunswick Terrace, Regent's Park—on the Sunday before this happened the prisoner was with me, and we had some disagreement—I told him not to think any more of me, and that he must break off our engagement, and not call at the house again—on the Tuesday he came again, and in the course of conversation he said "If I don't have you nobody else shall"—we were quiet for quite an hour after that, and I went about my work—he then came suddenly towards me with his hand behind him and struck me with something—I screamed; and a gentleman came downstairs, and the razor was given up—the doctor came and dressed the wound.</p>

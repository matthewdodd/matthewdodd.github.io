The prisoner Turner was given into my custody by Hart, on the 30th of August<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150048"></xptr>- I took her to the watch-house, and asked her name - she said Ann Turner, but she was better known by the name of Ann Jones. I found the watch at the pawnbroker's, and then took Jones; I questioned Turner about being with Hart; she denied being with him, and said she knew nothing about the watch, but afterwards, at Queen-square, she said he gave it to her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am out of business, and live at Paradise-cottages, South Hackney,—on Tuesday, 8th March, at about half-past 3 in the afternoon, I was in Crab-tree-road—some lads came round me, and one or two of them tried to take my handkerchief from my pocket, but I felt it there—I was beset in a minute by eight or ten lads, who pushed me into the road, knocked my hat off, and some beset me by putting their heads into my sides, and attempting to get at my pockets—Barnes stood before me and took out what appeared to be a life-preserver, and struck me on the head as hard as he could with it—I bled very freely—I have no doubt of Barnes, and am also certain that Smith is one of the boys; he has a wooden leg—he dropped his hand from my pocket when I turned round—I felt it at my pocket.</p>

               <p>—I saw Barnes in Crab-tree-road that afternoon; he struck the gentleman on the back of his head with a stick, which bent in an oval from the blow, and the blood began to come directly—I am sure Barnes is the boy—there were other boys there, but they were not all on to him—they were close to him, but I can't say what they were doing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

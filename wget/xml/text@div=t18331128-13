               <p>JAMES WARE. I lost a set of cart harness out of the stables behind my house - a person can get from the slaughter-house into the stables - one leads to the other - I had taken the harness off the horse the day before, and in the morning it was gone - it was about three years<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280023"></xptr>ago that I lost it - I missed it in the morning - I had seen it over night safe in the stables - the prisoner lives in the next house, and has done so for nearly twenty years - there is a loft over the stables - I have seen a pair of brass hames - the officers found them at the time the fat and mutton were found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. At the office did not you look at the hames for some minutes and say you doubted about them? A. I really do not know that I did say so - I did not doubt it for I swear to them, and am certain they are mine - nobody told me I might be indicted for perjury if I said wrong to my knowledge - I know them because one had a ring broken off, and the other part was broken about where it draws from, and it was not safe - I told my young man not to use them after that time - I said the collar did not belong to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say I might buy them at Smithfield-market?</p>
               <p>A. I said they sold stolen property at Smithfield-market.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner's house which joins the prosecutor's slaughter. house - on the second floor, I found a spy hole which commanded a view of the whole premises, by lifting the wood up - tiles were taken off the roof of the house sufficient to admit a person backwards and forwards - they could easily walk along the gutter to it - we went to the stables, and on a horse collar was a pair of brass hames - Groves took them from the collar and shewed them to Ware and he identified them - I was present at the examination - I know Mr. Twyford's signature (looking at the depositions) this is his signature(read)</p>

            . I am a policeman. I went to the stables of the prisoner and found the hames, and have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>JAMES WARE. Here is where one ring is broken - I know them by that - they were not fit to use on that account - they are mine, I am positive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you lost the harness did your slaughter-house join my premises? A. They all join together, the stables and slaughter-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence stating that he had purchased the goods in Smithfield-market.</p>

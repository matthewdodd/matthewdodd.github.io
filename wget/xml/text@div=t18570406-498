                  </hi>. On 28th March, I was in King Street, Cheapside, a little before 2 o'clock; I saw the prisoner with Mr. Coker's guard chain in his hand, and he passed by Mr. Coker—I did not see any watch, merely the chain—the prisoner put his hand close to Mr. Coker's waistcoat pocket, and after that I saw the chain in his hand—I laid hold of him, and told Mr. Coker he had lost his watch—I am sure the prisoner is the person—I could not see whether, anything passed through his hand.</p>

On 28th March I was near Lord John Russell's Committee-room, about the middle of the day—the last witness spoke to me—I looked at my guard chain—it was hanging down loose, and my watch was gone—I had seen the watch safe on the guard about two or three minutes before—it was worn inside my waistcoat pocket—it was worth twenty guineas—I turned and saw the prisoner standing close by the side of me; I collared him, and gave him in custody—he said he had not stolen it, and if he had stolen it it would be found upon him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live at No. 38, Queen Street, Brompton—about a little after eleven on the night of the 23rd Septem<lb></lb>ber I was in the Holloway Road, near St. John's Church, and saw the three prisoners coming up the footpath—I met them—Atkins came right up to me, and said, "We want some money"—I refused to give them any,</p>

               <p>and told them to go on—he put his hands up to my breast and felt about my waistcoat, and then he put his hand into my right-hand waistcoat pocket, and took out some tobacco—he then put his hand into my left waist-coat pocket—there was nothing there—he then tried my right-hand trousers pocket—I had got my hands and my money in my trousers pockets, and when he did that I said if he attempted to rob me I would blow his brains out—I put my hand into my coat pocket, and he then stepped back a little—the other two went and got a piece of paling from across the road, and Atkins got hold of it in his two hands, and declared he would knock my brains out—this is the little thing (<hi rend="italic">producing a very large stake</hi>)—I got hold of it by the middle and prevented him from striking me—I then pre<lb></lb>tended to get my pistol out again to shoot them—two men were coming up the road at the time, and I suppose they heard them, and were frightened about the pistol, and they took to their heels and ran across some fields—a police sergeant came up in two or three minutes—I told him what had happened, and gave him a description of the men—the other two prisoners did not do any thing—Green told Atkins to poleaxe me—the other did not touch me at all—he was standing by at the time—they were all three standing together when Atkins put his hands in my pockets—I went through the fields with the policeman in search of the prisoners, but did not find them—I went to a friend's house near, and about two hours after-wards a policeman came and fetched me to the station, and told me to go into a room there, and see if I saw the men, and I identified the three of them—there were others in the room, but these three were all sitting together, and I noticed them distinctly—I am quite sure they are the men—when I went in Atkins was lying with his head down on the table—he lifted up his head, looked round at me, and said, "All right; I know what I have done, and I know I shall have to suffer for it;" but he begged that the two other might be let go, as they bad; done nothing—when the inspector asked me what I had lost I felt my pockets, and about my breast, and found I had lost my scarf pin—I had seen it safe about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before I met the prisoners—I fortunately had not my watch with me—Atkins punched me in the ribs and up against the wall—he did all the work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at No. 15, Brunswick Place, Upper Holloway—on Sunday night, 23rd September, from eleven o'clock to half-past, I was in the Holloway Road, and saw Atkins put his hands in the prosecutor's pocket—it Was a moonlight night, very clear—I stood about four yards from them—I did not say anything to them—I did not consider that the prosecutor was intoxicated—I was going home—when I saw Atkins put his hands in his pocket I went up to him, and asked how he came to do it, and then he went across the road and fetched the pole—I stood there all the while—they fetched the pole from a brokendown fence—when they said they would poleaxe him I went across the road, and said, "No, you won't poleaxe him while I am here," and Atkins said to the prosecutor, "If you touch me I shall poleaxe you with this piece of wood"—the prosecutor took hold of the stake, and Atkins again said he would poleaxe him.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman Y 27). On Sunday night, 23rd September, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, I received information that a gentleman had been robbed near the "Horse and Groom" public-house—I went down the Holloway Road, and there saw the prosecutor standing in the road with the pole in his hand—from what he told me, I went and searched round several fields, but could not find the men—I took a description of them—at two o'clock in the morning I went to the back of the "Horse and Groom," and in a stable found all the three prisoners sleeping. together—I told them they were charged with robbing a man on the highway—Childs and Green said they knew nothing of it—Atkins made no remark in reference to the charge, but used disgusting language towards me—I got assistance, and they were taken to the station—Childs and Green there denied the charge, but Atkins said, "I admit to it, I did it, the other two know nothing about it; let them go and see after my horses"—that was when the charge was read over to him—the prosecutor had said in their presence, "I charge these three with stopping me and attempting to rob me"—Atkins had no horses of his own there—his master had some, that he was looking after.</p>

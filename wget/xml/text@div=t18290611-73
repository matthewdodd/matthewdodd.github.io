               <p>CATHERINE ROBERTS. I paid the prisoner on the 23d of April 14s. 6d., on the 30th 4s., and on the 7th 1l. 15s. 7d., for Mr. Aveling - he receipted these different bills at the time I paid him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known him well? A. Yes; I had been in the habit of paying him bills these twelve months - here are dates to the bills; I saw the prisoner write the receipts on the kitchen table at Mr. Harrison's.</p>
               <p>GEORGE AVELING. He never accounted to me for any of these sums; I sent to Mr. Harrison, and found that he had been paid - I then sent for a constable - and the prisoner said, before the constable and myself, that he had spent the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you tell him he had better tell you what he had done with it? A. No, nor did I say it would be worse for him; my wife never acts in the shop - I have a lad who receives money, but not bills; on the Saturday the prisoner was taken up he would have had 18s. due to him.</p>

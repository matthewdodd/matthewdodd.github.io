            . I am a butcher. On the 10th of November, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, Mr. Rhodes bought two pigs - I saw the carcases hanging opposite the scale in Swan's shop; I had weighed them. Mr. Rhodes gave his name as belonging to them - he paid for them, and went out with Boulter, who had come with him - the pigs hung there about ten minutes - the prisoner then came into Swan's shop, and said, "I want two pigs in the name of Rhodes;" I saw no one with him - I pointed them out, thinking it was all right, and let him take them away on his shoulder; I had seen him before, but did not know whether he was a porter in the market, or what: Mr. Rhodes had said he would either call or send for them - he brought Clarke, the porter, in about half an hour for them; I said that a person had fetched them - on the Friday evening Mr. Rhodes pointed out the house where the prisoner lived, which is his father's shop - I walked by about nine o'clock that evening, saw the prisoner walking about the shop, and was perfectly satisfied that he was the person who called for the pigs; I am quite certain of him. Mr. Rhodes was not with me then. On the Monday evening, I took Gibbons and another constable with me, and he was taken - I did not go into the shop myself, and did not hear him say any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did Rhodes point out the house? A. About six o'clock on Friday evening; he had received information - I had not seen the prisoner after six o'clock that morning - I walked by the shop two or three times, to be sure about him, but did not go for a constable till Monday - I was positive about him - he was taken at his father's on Monday: I never said I had no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070027"></xptr>recollection of the person who came - I said, if I saw him I should know him again.</p>

            . I am journeyman to Mr. Shankster, pork butcher, of Oxford-market. On Friday morning, the 10th of November, about a quarter before seven o'clock, I met the prisoner with two pigs on his shoulder, on Holborn-bridge, going towards Holborn-hill, in a direction towards Oxford-market - he said, "Good morning" - I knew him perfectly well: when I got home, about nine o'clock, I went to his father's shop, and asked the father where the two pigs were - the father, being deaf, did not hear me; and the prisoner, who was in the shop, held up his finger, and said, "Hush!" by which I understood that I was not to say any thing more to his father - he came out of the shop, and told me that a man at Islington had bought four of those pigs, and that he had carried two of them home for the man to Islington - he after that came to me and said that a man had given him 1s. to carry the two pigs to Thompson and Fearon's, on Holbornhill - he had at first said that he had carried them to Islington. Mr. Rhodes came to me in the afternoon, and I told him what the prisoner had said.</p>

I had not seen the prisoner, and did not know they were stolen - I asked him who he had given them to; he said some man had fetched them - I was with Mr. Rhodes when they were bought; and when he questioned Harman, he said, in Rhodes' presence, that he should not know the man who took them; he said so positively - I had hung the pigs up myself in the shop - I saw the prisoner in his father's shop, about two hours afterwards - Clarke and Hodwell were present when Harman said this.</p>

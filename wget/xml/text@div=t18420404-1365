                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of information I apprehended the prisoner at the Ship and Half Moon public-house, at Woolwich—he had this tea in his hat in a hat-box—he said he had bought it with some more things to send down to his mother.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Kitchiner's, on Good Friday, she gave me this shirt, and the hand. kerchief to take it home in; when I got home my landlady said, "Have you got the shirt Hannah made for you!" I said, "Yes;" I paid the landlady and went away, leaving the shirt on the bed; I went to Wool<lb></lb>wich to get employment, and was taken there; is it feasable I should steal the shirt and tea when I had 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. about me at the time? she gave it to me, and said she should not want the money, I should want it myself another time.</p>

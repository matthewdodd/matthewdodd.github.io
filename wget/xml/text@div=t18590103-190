                  </hi>. My father carries on the business of an engraver at 17, Sun-street, Bishopsgate, and I assist him. On 19th October, between 5 and 6 in the evening, one of my men fetched me to see some one, and I found Goldwater in the shop—I had never seen him before—he said that he had got a gold plate which he wanted engraved with the Russian eagle and the Russian capitals, and wanted to know what I would do it for—I had some conversation with him, and he promised to call again—he called the next day, and asked for me—I was behind the shop, and did not see him come in—when I saw him, he said he called about the matter on which he called last night, and had brought the gentleman with him, who was outside—on that he left the shop, and brought in Kochanowsky, the person who was called the Baron—Goldwater said that they had come about the things about which he came last night, and Kochanowsky asked if we could show him some very small letters in type—I showed him some, but they did not suit him; they were not small enough—I was about twenty minutes showing him specimens, and a few speci<lb></lb>mens of plates and dies were shown to him, but nothing was settled—the same evening, between 8 and 9 o'clock, Goldwater called again with Goldberg, who he introduced as a Prussian—Goldberg asked me if I could keep a secret—I said, "Yes"—he said that he thought it was some bank-notes, but he did not know—after some little conversation, he said he would call next day, between 1 and 2, or when I was alone; when all the men had gone to dinner, and I could be seen by myself, and bring some person else with him, a Baron—the next morning, before they came, my lather and I made a communication to Superintendent Hamilton, and between 1 and 2 o'clock, when I was alone in the shop, Goldwater came—it was on 21st (<hi rend="italic">Looking at a memorandum</hi>)—he asked me if I was alone—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030055"></xptr>
               <p>said "Yes," and he went out, and brought in the Baron and Goldberg—the Baron asked me, in the hearing of the other two, if I could keep a secret—he then took a pocket-book out of his pocket, and handed me this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that he wanted two steel plates, one for the back, and the other for the front—they were to be done like the note—I told him I could do them—(I acted under the directions of the officer during the whole of the matter)—the Baron said that he did not mind how much money he paid, if it was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he offered to make me a present of a hand-some gold watch, which he took out of his pocket—I told him that I must have a deposit, but he said that the note would do, and left it with me—nothing further of any importance passed—the same evening, between 8 and 9 o'clock, Gold water and the Baron came—the Baron wanted to know if I could get paper like the five-rouble note—they were both together, but the Baron was the spokesman—he said that about five or six hundred would be required to be printed off—after we gave information, the workmen under mine and my father's superintendence, acted according to the direc<lb></lb>tions we received from the prisoners, and the work of engraving the plates was progressing from that time to 20th November—on 26th October, about 9 o'clock in the evening, the three prisoners came and wanted to see the plates; I showed them one of these plates, No. 2, which was partially engraved at the time, and No. 1 was in course of workmanship—they examined the plate, and the Baron said he was very glad to see that it was going on, and that he wanted another plate for the water-mark, producing another Russian note to show me—they said that they wanted to see the plates finished on let November; Gold water said that he hoped, next time they came, that I should have all the gas out, except a little jet at the back—on 1st Novem<lb></lb>ber, at 2 o'clock, Goldwater came to say that they were coming in the evening, about 9 o'clock—they all came together at 9 o'clock, and I showed them the same plates—they examined them, but they were not quite finished—the Baron inquired when they would be finished, and I told him on Monday week, 15th November—next day, November 2d, the Baron came between 1 and 2 o'clock, and before he left Goldberg came, and there was some more conversation about the plates—that same evening, Gold-water came and asked me for some money—on 5th November, about a quarter to 9 in the evening, Goldwater came and told me that the others were outside—I went out with him, and found the others outside—they took me to the King's Head public-house in the neighbourhood, and Goldberg asked me, going along, if I had decided about the money, the commission—when we got to the King's Head, I asked the Baron for another note, as the first one was rubbed out—he said that he had not got one then, but he would send me one, and that he wanted to see a specimen of the paper—somewhere about that time, the Baron showed me some other notes of different denominations; one for fifty roubles, and one for twenty-five roubles—on 6th November, Goldwater came to the shop, and gave me this, other five-rouble note (marked H)—on 10th November, I met Goldwater in Bishopsgate-street, and he asked me how the plates were getting on—on the 12th Goldwater came to my shop, and inquired how the plates and proofs were getting on—I had been asking them for some more money, and Goldwater said that, if I took an impression of the two plates, as the Baron could not read them, the Baron would give me some more money—on 15th November Goldwater came with Goldberg, but I did not see them—on Thursday, the 18th, Goldwater came to the shop, and asked me to go outside with him—I found the Baron outside, and there was a conversation between him and Goldwater and me in reference to the proof—I showed</p>

               <p>them a plate, and they examined it—on the next day, Friday, I saw all three of them in my father's shop, and showed them the three plates, and a proof of them—the prisoners examined the plates, the proof, and the paper—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the proof; it was done from my plates—the prisoners spoke together in their own language, and having made an appointment to meet me next day, with the plates to be delivered, they left me—on the following morning, according to the appointment, I went to the King's Head, Threadneedle-street, taking with me the plates and proofs, which the prisoners had been, from time to time, examining—I went into a room at the King's Head, and the three prisoners being there, I took the plates out of my pocket, wrapped in paper, and placed them on the table—the prisoners examined them, and I left them with them, making some excuse, and left the room, and communicated with the officers, who were outside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Goldberg. Q.</hi> When I came to you and asked you if you could keep a secret, and you could not understand me, was it not as interpreter that Gold water was brought? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, both you and Gold water spoke English to me—I can understand no other language—when you came the first time you did not tell me that the Baron sent you—I promised you a commission for getting me the order when I was paid for the work—you did not give me any order for bank-notes—the Baron gave it—you said that you thought it was for bank-notes when the order was given—Gold water always came in first—I swear you asked me for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I said that I would only give you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—you said on 2d November, "I shall have no more to do with it, I shall come no more to your place"—you first asked me for a commission on 1st November, and when I first saw you, both you and Goldwater asked for a commission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not I refuse to take the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you offered me, and say that I should have nothing to do with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You said that you would have nothing more to do with it, and would take it out of my hands and give it to another engraver in Shoreditch—I do not recollect saying, "Let it stand over till Friday, and I will settle with you, I must consider about it"—I said that I would give you no more than 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as commission—after you said "I will come no more to your place, "I did not say," Come on Friday evening," I swear that—I believe there is a Saviour—I made the appoint<lb></lb>ment with you all, to meet at the King's Head, on November 20th—I never heard the Flower Pot public-house named that I know of—I opened the parcel containing the plates and notes—you did not tell me that you wanted any notes or plates of me that I know of—you did not say that you were a party to the order which was given me, but you came always with them, and I thought you were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Goldwater, (Through the Interpreter). Q.</hi> Did not you leave the plates behind in the public-house without paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left them all open on the table, and if you did not see them, you were in the room—it was a moderate sized back room, and the three of you were in the room when I laid the plates on the table—I spoke to you all and told you that I had come about the plates before opening the plates, and about what you spoke of last night—I went to the public-house by myself—I was there first—I came up at five minutes to 10, saw the Baron go in, and went in directly afterwards, and there was only the Baron in the room—the other two came twenty minutes or half an hour afterwards—I had not opened the plates before they came in, but directly they came into the room the Baron said, "Now to business,"—I then took the notes out of my pocket and opened them—they were all there, the notes and all.</p>

               <p>as soon as I came in in the course of five minutes, ran to the back part of the house, fetched an officer, pulled me down the stairs and gave me in charge. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I was with the three prisoners half an hour or nearly three-quarters—they were up there talking, and there was bread and cheese and brandy and water, and that took more than five minutes—Goldwater did not leave the gold plate-with me to engrave—I never saw it—he said that he had got a gold plate and wanted it engraved with a Russian Eagle or Russian capitals—Goldwater did not say anything about bank-notes, it was Goldberg—my father said that if they paid-the price he would make one—it is within our line of business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Goldwater.</hi> I never saw the plates on the evening I was taken till they were shown me at the station-house: as I am unable to read or write, how is it likely I could inspect the plates to know whether they were correct or not. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You looked at the plate, but did not say whether it was right or wrong, it was the Baron said that; he was the spokesman after the first mention of the bank-notes.</p>

On 21st October I received a communication, in consequence of which, with Hamilton and other officers, I watched the prisoners from that time till 20th November, when they were taken into custody—I saw them eight or ten times at Roll's shop, all three together—on 20th November I was watching the King's Head in Thread-needle-street, by appointment, and saw the Baron enter first; after him young Mr. Roll, and next Goldberg and Goldwater together—they went upstairs to a small back room—I continued watching until I saw young Mr. Roll come out; that was about half an hour after the two went in—he made a communication to me, and I entered with the other officers—as I was going into the small room, Goldwater was in the act of coming out, and the Baron and Goldberg were standing at the further end of the room, by the window—the plates were on a seat, wrapped up in a coat at the back of the Baron and Goldwater—I took them all in custody, and Inspector Hamilton took possession of the plates—I found a pencil and knife on the table, which turned out to be the Baron's—I searched him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Consul-general for the Russian Govern<lb></lb>ment in Great Britain—during the autumn I believe two of the prisoners came to me, but I only saw them once or twice—I could not speak to their faces, but I know Goldberg the best—I have no belief as to Goldwater—he may have been to me—it is very probable he did—I can recognise Gold<lb></lb>berg's face—it was he who spoke most—I cannot exactly tell you the date—I did not take a note of it, because I had been a few weeks before deceived by a man who came to denounce pretended forgeries—I should be sorry to say the date to a month, and make a mistake—the two men said that they had found out that there was an intention on the part of some person who was expected to arrive, or who had arrived, to cause Russian paper-money to be circulated—that the person expected was a rich man, with a great deal of money at his command—that he was expected, or had arrived in London, to cause these Russian bank-notes to be forged—that he belonged to a good family, and there is some recollection in my mind, that he made use of the word Baron—I told them, as I always do to these people, that they must address themselves to the police and the Consul-general—I do not know whether I gave them the address of Mr. Mackenzie or Mr. Durham; but I said that at my private lodgings I would take no representation of that sort, and that no denunciation could be expected, unless they could give some sort of proof—I do not know that they did not say that they wanted a little money; but if I did give them any, it was but eight or nine shillings—certainly not ten shillings altogether, and from that time, I have heard nothing of them—I am told that they have called at the office, but I have not been them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Goldwater.</hi> We called on the Consul to inform him that such a thing was going to be done, expecting of course that we should be rewarded for our trouble; but the Consul would not believe me, though he said that if we brought proofs he would speak afterwards with us, and I was trying to get proof of the forgery that was to be carried on. I have not been able to pro<lb></lb>duce any proof to the Consul, because while I was trying to do so I was taken into custody; he sent me to bring the proofs, and said that I should be rewarded for it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I refused to have anything to do with them, and gave them the address of the police and of my solicitors, and said that they must go to them—I always do so—I certainly did not do anything which he might construe into an authority to co-operate with the guilty party in having the plate engraved—I sent them to the police, in order that the police or my solicitors might judge whether there was any case or not, and left them to say whether the information was sufficient to act upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Goldberg's Defence.</hi> The engraver's evidence does not show that I had the notes or gave the order. The only reason that I went there the first time was because this man said, "Here is a Russian gentlemen who wants a gold plate engraved, and he has already communicated with the engraver, but he wants to know if he can keep a secret; he did not know much En<lb></lb>glish, and asked me in German the translation of "secret." He asked me if he wanted to have a plate for bank-notes—I said, in the presence of all his people, "No, I do not think that," because you cannot go and give an order for bank-notes without 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., deposit at least. I went to the engraver</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030060"></xptr>
               <p>and said, "The gentleman who was here wants to know if you can keep a secret;" he said, "Yes." I said, "I do not think it will be a gold plate; I think it must be plate to get gold." I could not understand him exactly; he said before that the Russian gentleman was only a fortnight or three weeks in England, and I said to the engraver, "If you cannot understand this man I am at your service, but you must pay me a commission." I tried to see the gentleman, but did not know where he lived, so I went and met him there, and we all went to the engraver. I can understand German, but they spoke Russian together; afterwards he told me that he wanted some money. I said, "If you pay me, I will ask him for it." I told him, and he asked 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the first time; the gentleman prepared himself with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he then only asked for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he gave him: next time he asked 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and agreed to take 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I asked for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he offered me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I said, "No, I will not have anything at all; I am going, and will have nothing to do with the business" He said, "Well, alter your mind, come on Friday evening." I was going by myself, and he asked me if the others were coming. I said, "If they have got an appointment with you, they will come." I never examined the things. I do not understand Russian, and could not make any use of Russian bank-notes. I am not going to take an interpreter to Russia, and get them changed there; if I wanted such notes I had no occasion to put myself in a dangerous position, because my brother-in-law could have done it for me; I could have recommended them to him, and they would have been quite safe in his hands. I said the evening before, "This is a very dangerous business, tell your governor he had better drop the matter;" he said, "Mr. Roll, I cannot make use of the notes; I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for your trouble, and I shall then have a few pounds left to go home to my country." I hope you will not come to the conclusion that I was in possession of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Goldwaters Defence (through the interpreter</hi>). Gentlemen of the Jury, I have not gained anything by this; I have had no profit by it, and I do not see how I can be guilty. I am a poor man, and have a wife and family at home. I, knowing of this business going to be done, gave the necessary in<lb></lb>formation to the Consul, that I might get a little reward for my information. I therefore went very often to the man who was manufacturing it to see when it would be ready, in order to get the proofs, and take them to the Consul as he described. I am not guilty.</p>

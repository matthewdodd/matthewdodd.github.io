                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. John Passmore Smith, a tea-dealer, in Coventry-street, Haymarket. The prisoner was in his service, and lived in the house—he had a salary of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and a commission of 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound on tea, and 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pound on coffee—he went out with the cart to solicit orders, to deliver goods, and receive payment for them—the orders he gave in at the shop were generally entered in the rough waste-book by me, from his book or from his word—from the rough waste-book we prepared the way-bill—the articles were called over to the prisoner, and it was his duty to see that they were rightly called over—when the money was not paid for the goods on delivery, it was the prisoner's duty to place in the margin of the way-bill the word "dep"—it signified debt, or delivered—it meant that he did not get cash—it was his duty to check the way-bill with me every day, and pay the money marked in the fifth column to me or to Mr. Smith—those which were marked "dep" were carried from the way-bill to the day-book, and from there to the ledger, as a debt against the customer, till the time that that debt was paid—this is the way-bill of 15 th Oct.—I made it out, and delivered it to the prisoner—here are three parcels of goods delivered to Mr. Almond on 15th Oct., amounting to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and opposite that sum, in the fifth column, is the word "dep," in the prisoner's writing—this bill was handed to me in the ordinary way—here is the way-bill of 29th Oct.—it is in my writing—here is an entry of three parcels delivered to Mr. Almond, amounting to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and in the fifth column here is written "dep," in the prisoner's writing—he did not account to me for any money received from Mr. Almond on 15th or 29th Oct.—it remained charged to the customer, as the cash-book would prove, it is not here—here is a receipt of the prisoner's on 29th Oct., when the second parcel was delivered, it is the prisoner's writing, it was not attached to the account when the prisoner delivered it to me—he has never accounted to me for it since—we have a customer named Miss Parker—in this way-bill of 3rd Nov. here is an account of goods amounting to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the prisoner received them to deliver to her—I prepared this way-bill, and opposite this sum here is, in the fifth column, in the prisoner's writing, "dep"—if he received that money, he never accounted for it to me—we have a customer named Miss Carter, of 4, Kensington Park-villas—this way-bill of 9th Nov. is my writing—I delivered to the prisoner on that day one parcel for Miss Carter, of tea and other things, value 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner has put against it "dep"—if he received that money, he did not pay it to me—if he went there next day to get it, we did not send him there, and he had no business to go—I have the way-bill of the following week, to show that he did not account for it.</p>

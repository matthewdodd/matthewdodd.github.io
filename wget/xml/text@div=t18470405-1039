                  </hi> I live in Vincent-street, Limehouse-fields. On the afternoon of the 1st of April, in consequence of something I heard, I went after the prisoner—I overtook her—she had a little boy with her, Alfred Emanuel Vassie—I knew him—he is here—the prisoner had him, leading him by the hand—they were walking rather fast—I asked her what she wanted with the child—she said she wanted him to get her half-a-quarters loaf—she winked her eye at me, and said she would give him a farthing—I said, "I shall see what you want with him"—I took him from her—she walked on, and went into two different houses—I still followed her—she asked me what I intended to do with her—I told her if there was a police<lb></lb>man in the way I would give her in charge—we followed her to her own house—she was taken there, and I took care of the child.</p>

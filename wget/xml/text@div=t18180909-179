            . I am the daughter of the last witness. About nine o'clock in the evening, I was at the two pair front window, and saw Chapman go out and join a man about the same size as himself; they walked away together, and returned in about a quarter of an hour. Chapman went in, and came out and gave him something, he then returned to the shop, and the prisoner walked away. About eleven o'clock there was a gentle knock at the door, my father went down, I looked out of the window and saw the prisoner go from the door, with a roll of cloth under his arm.</p>

Mr. Thwaites asked him if he had any of his property there; he turned up the bed and pulled out a yard of cloth and a piece of linen. He said the boy gave it to him to make a jacket.</p>

The prisoner asked me to give him two yards and a half of cloth, and a boy's dress, and a pair of men's trowsers, and he would give me a 2l. note. I refused. He afterwards came to me at the door, and asked me for half a yard of velveteen and some cloth. I gave him the cloth and linen.</p>

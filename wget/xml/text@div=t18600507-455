On the morning of 21st April at a quarter past 4 o'clock I was on duty in Staple Inn, Holborn—I saw the prisoner on the top of a wall; I waited till he came down, took him, and asked him what he was doing—he said he had just left the house he lived in—I told him it was a curious way to leave the house, and asked him what number it was—he refused to tell me, and said he came that way because he did not wish to disturb the rest of the lodgers in the house—his hands were cut and bleeding—there were bottles on the wall that he was upon—that wall is about ten feet from Mr. Andrews' house.</p>

               <p>On the morning of 21st April I was called up about 6 o'clock, and on going down I found a policeman there—I examined the yard, and the wall at the back had several bricks knocked off the top of it—several matches had been lighted—the top of the window in my back room was pulled down as far as it would go—I know it was up the night before, and the shutter which is inside was up—it is lined with iron—there were marks of four or five dents on the shutter as though they had been made with some sharp instrument—the shutters were very securely bolted the night before—there were marks on the shutters on the side next the window—the distance between the windows and the shutters is about four inches—I went to bed about 10 o'clock the night before—those marks were not on the shutters then.</p>

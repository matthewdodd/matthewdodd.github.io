             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Edwards: On the 3d of June in the afternoon, I was sent out upon some business about four o'clock; upon my return between five and six, I saw a great number of people round the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in before your master? - A. Yes, I was; upon seeing a crowd round the window, I immediately ran off home, and enquired of Mrs. Edwards what was the matter, and she told me the prisoners at the bar had cut the window; the boys were both then in the shop; I asked Greenhove how he came by them, one pair of buckles had been taken from him before I came in; he said, that as he was passing by the window, he perceived it was cut, and the buckles dropped out; that he had picked them up, and given them to the prosecutor, Mr. Edwards; I then asked if they were brothers, or related to each other, and they said they knew nothing of each other.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Edwards.) In what respect did these boys seem at all connected with each other? - A. They were close together, both their heads were contained within the compass of the square of glass, stooping with their hands very close to it.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon searching them did you find any thing by which the glass could have been cut? - A. No; a piece of glass was cut out, just room for a pair of buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it of a regular uniform shape, as if it had been done with a diamond? - A. No; it had been eased out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go away together? - A. Yes; in a close conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they run away? - A. No; they walked off.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the buckles? - A. One guinea.</p>

It appears to be more a consideration what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220063"></xptr>shall be done with those children, than as to their guilt or innocence; I am afraid you must say guilty, and I will endeavour to do something with them; there is a society would be very glad of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. They have been here before, my Lord, and have run away from the society.</p>

                  </hi>, Sen. I live at Deptford, and am the father of the last witness. I recollect Mrs. Brady coming to my son for change for sixpence—I followed the two young men—I saw them first go to widow Townsend's, the baker's—one of them went it—I followed them after he came out, to the Black Horse Bridge, they were then joined by the prisoner Thomas Carthy—they then went towards Rotherhithe—I sent to William Badham, and he joined us at China-hall—when he joined us the three prisoners separated, and one went inside Mr. Mumford's shop—after he came out they fell into company again—they went two hundred yards and then went to a bun-shop—one went in—he came out and they joined again—I went into the bun-shop, came out, and followed them—I saw Marsh and John Carthy go into a pork-shop—Thomas Carthy did not go into any shop, to my knowledge—I still followed them over Mill-pond Bridge—I sent to the station-house that I wanted more assistance—they joined again after they got through St. James's-gate—we and the policeman then surrounded them, put them into a baker's-shop near Lilliput-hall, and took them to the station-house—I searched Thomas Carthy, and found on him four base sixpences, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

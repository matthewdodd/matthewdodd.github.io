                  </hi>. I live at 138, Upper Park Road, Hampstead—Chapman was in my service nine months up to the time of his being taken in custody—Gee had been my groom and left about eighteen months ago—he lodged near our place at the time of the robbery—I left home about 5th or 6th August, and on the 27th, in consequence of some informa<lb></lb>tion I returned home—before going away I hid locked my billiard-room, and put the key in my bureau and locked it—I found that in the same condition as when I left with the exception of the things taken from the bureau mentioned in the indictment—I found my billiard-room had been opened and four pieces of carpet, a piece of Chinese matting, a leather bag, a pair of mittens, a silk hat, a pair of trousers, and other articles had been token from it—I also found that a silver watch, a gold pin, a locket, a pair of sleeve links, a signet ring, two blankets, and various other articles of clothing to the value of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been taken from my place—I went with a detective to Gee's place—on leading us to his room I observed my carpets on the floor, and I said "These are my carpets," and then I said "Now I want two blankets belonging to me"—he immediately turned up his bed and gave them to me—they were between the mattrass and the iron part of the bedstead—they were nearly new—the policeman asked him if there was anything else, and Gee said "These are all the things I have belong<lb></lb>ing to Mr. Hawkins"—on further searching the room we found the four pieces of carpet, the piece of Chinese matting, a leather bag, a pair of mittens, a silk hut, a shaving brush, &amp;c.—he said he had bought the things to help Chapman, on the road to Hamburg—the trousers were found on the prisoner—they were a pair belonging to my groom that he left, and which had never before been in Chapman's possession; they had been abstracted from the billiard-room—I had not given any of the things away—I bad last year a gold ring, which Gee admitted-at the police-court, at Hampstead, he had lost.</p>

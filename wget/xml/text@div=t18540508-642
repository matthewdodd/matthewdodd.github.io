                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel Kelly, of No. 2, Turner-street, near Darby-street. On Friday morning, 7th April, my husband got up about half past 5 o'clock, and missed his shoes, stockings, jacket, two waistcoats, a pair of trousers, and a shirt; and a shift, gown, and shawl of mine—they were all safe when we went to bed the night before, about 11 o'clock—the street door was then fastened—I had fastened it myself—in the morning I saw Mrs. Ragan push the door open—my husband was not gone to work; he was sitting in the room, saying he could not go to work as he had lost his clothes—I went to the station and to Mr. Raphael's <hi rend="italic">leaving shop</hi>—things which are not good enough to pawn are taken in there—Mr. Raphael brought a jacket, two waistcoats, and a pair of trowsers—these are them—they are my husband's property—they are part of the things which were safe the night before, and which I missed—this gown and shawl are mine, and are part of the things I missed—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

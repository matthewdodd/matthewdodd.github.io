                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Cheeseman, of Bell-yard, Doctors' Commons. I remember seeing the prisoner near our house on the 7th of September, between one and two o'clock in the day, walking backwards and forwards before Mr. Ralph's door and in the passage—I knew nothing of him before—a young woman who works at the house came out and shut the door after her, and in about three minutes after<lb></lb>wards I saw the prisoner come out of the passage with an umbrella—he came from the passage off the steps—there are two doors—It was the street door not the door which the girl had shut—he was carrying the umbrella at his side, shut—I saw nothing in his hand when he was walking back<lb></lb>wards and forwards—I was in our office—the window looks into the pass<lb></lb>sage—we occupy the office of Mr. Ralph—on seeing the prisoner come out, I went and told Mr. Cheeseman, and he told me to run after him, and collar him, which I did—he had not got above thirty yards from the house—I asked him whose umbrella it was—he said it was his—I collared him, and told him to come back with me, for it was not his; and, with the assist<lb></lb>ance</p>

               <p>of a man, I brought him back to the office; and after I had fetched a policeman, I saw Mr. Cheeseman pick up a key where the prisoner had been standing, just as the policeman was going to take him away—he was standing there after I had brought him back—I am quite sure the man I took with the umbrellas was the same man as I saw come out of the house.</p>

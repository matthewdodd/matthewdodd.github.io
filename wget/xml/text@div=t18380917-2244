                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Samuel Strebel, a foreign merchant, at Clapham-common.

               <p>by the prisoner's side—it was my master's, and had been in the pantry not five minutes before, which is on the ground floor, near the door he was going out of—I ran and took it up, and he ran away—I followed him across the lawn, and he went across the common—I pointed him out to my fellow servant, who followed him, but he got away—he was secured in ten minutes, and I said he was the person by his back—he had a dark fustian jacket and dark trowsers, and was of the same height and appear<lb></lb>ance—this is the plate-(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it had come five minutes from mistress's bed-room.</p>

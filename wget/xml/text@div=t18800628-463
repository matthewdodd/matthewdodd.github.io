At about 1.15 on the morning of 18th May I was called to 21, St. Mary's Square, where the prisoner was given into my custody for bigamy—I there saw Alice Shine—she said that she was married to the prisoner on 9th February last—that on Satur<lb></lb>day, 15th May, a female came to 21, Sir Mary's Square, and inquired for</p>

On Saturday, the 24th of June at seven o'clock at night, the prisoner came and bought some mutton and steaks, which came to 4 s.; Adams, our shopman, served him, he gave me a 1 l. Bank note. I knew his father by the name of Pannington, he lived in Cromer-street, I do not know where the prisoner lived. I wrote Pannington on it, and asked his address, he said Phoenix-alley, Long-acre, - (looks at it.) - this is it; he took his change and left, I gave it to my father. About eleven o'clock that night another person came, and bought a shoulder of mutton of my father, and gave me a 1 l. note, and gave the name of Kemp, No. 1, Bury-street, Bloomsbury, which I wrote on it, and gave it my father; he looked at it, and sent Adams out to stop him, but he was gone; I went with Adams to Bury-street, and found one Kemp lived there, but he did not answer the description.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Bean. On the 24th of June, the prisoner came and bought some meat; I served him, it came to about 4 s.; he gave Miss Bean a note; a person named Kemp came about eleven o'clock that night, and bought a shoulder of mutton, at that time I saw the prisoner at the corner of the street; I passed him at the time he was standing and leaning against the corner, about three doors from our house, on the opposite side, he could see what was going on in our shop - we have strong lights. I came into the shop; Kemp was there then, he left as soon as Miss Bean gave him his change. She gave the note to her father, and he, almost immediately, said it was bad. I ran out, but the prisoner and Kemp were both gone. About half-past twelve o'clock that night the prisoner came by and I secured him. I had seen him once before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not ask if I bought a shoulder of mutton - A. Yes, and he said it was a leg, and said he paid a note for it, he came back willingly with me.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Iron, of the Strand, on the 3d of March a woman passed a note at our shop for grocery, which came to 2 s. 9 d. I marked the note - (looks at one.) - this is it. I wrote Mrs. Marriott, No. 4, Off-alley, Strand, on it. She was tried here in April, by the name of Rosanna Pannington. I went with Mayhew, the officer, the same evening to No. 4, Off-alley, and took her, we found the prisoner there also. The officer asked her where she had the note; she hesitated, and said she had it from her husband, and pointed to the prisoner. Mayhew asked him where he got them, he then said all the notes she passed she received of him, and he received them in the course of trade, and said he was a tailor. Mayhew said, then I shall take you; he placed himself in a fighting position, and said,</p>
               <p>"Will you, will you." I then saw a pistol in his hand; the woman escaped, and the pistol was taken from him after a long struggle, it was loaded to the muzzle; he was taken away.</p>

            . I am a conductor of the Bow-street Patrole. On the 9th of March I met with Bubbus, and apprehended the woman, the prisoner and another woman were in the room with her. The woman said she had the notes of her husband, pointing to the prisoner, and he said he took them in trade. I said he must go with me, he wished to see my authority, I produced my staff; he said that would not do if I had no warrant. I said I should take him, and advanced towards him, he drew back about a yard from me, and pulled a pistol from his waistcoat, which was cocked, primed, and loaded with ball. I seized it; drawing my cutlass, and he surrendered. As I was taking him to the office, he said if I would not mention any thing to the magistrate concerning the pistol, he would tell me where to get plenty of forged notes. I said I certainly should mention it. I found another large pistol at his place, cocked and loaded.</p>

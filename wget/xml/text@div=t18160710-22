            . I am a constable, and street - keeper of the Ward of Aldersgate. On the 20th of May, I was in company with Block and Pelliam, in Little Britain. Brock came to me in Aldersgate-street; when we three were in company, we went to Augel-alley, Moor-lane; this was between two and three o'clock; we went to a house which had no number. Petham led us to that house; we went up stairs first, and he could not find out the exact room; we then went away, and hid ourselves; and then he came and beckoned us, and we returned, we went up into the two pair, we went into a room where the three prisoners were. I secured them myself; they were setting on their bottoms; they were all three sitting in a row, colouring shillings; they had a piece of mettal rubbing it with white colour; that white colour was on their fingers; each was so employed. I secured the two tallest, and clapped the two handcuffs on them, and told them not to resist. I have got the three that they were colouring; they flung them down.</p>

               <p>Q.Which is which - A. I don't know, I am sure that out of the number you now hold in your hand, three of them are what fell from the three men. The rest I picked off the boards; they were laying in front of them. Brock secured the third man. We afterwards searched the room. I found them laying before them, and by the side of them. Amongst them, there was a phial full of aquafortis, and here is one here which has had it in; aquafortis was in that phial. Here are nine uncoloured blanks, and eight shillings wrapped up in Roerdon's waistcoat pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I have seen the little man, Quinn, at the time of Mr. Duncan's new house being built; as for the other two, I don't know them. They said that a man had gone out with two shillings to buy them some dinner, and after we secured them, they wished us to stay to see if he would come back.</p>

             POWELL. I am assistant to the solicitor of the Mint. I have looked over the articles, sand-paper, bason containing the mixture, the blanks, and the phial, which smells of aquafortis. There are materials sufficient to produce the colour of silver on these blanks. I look at the blanks in question; they are of a size to resemble the Current Coin of this realm, called shillings; all of them are the same.</p>

               <p>COURT. Look at that parcel containing the three which are said to have dropped from the three prisoners, and tell me if they are finished - A.They had not been finished, as they have not been washed in water.</p>

            . Re-examined. They look something yellowish.</p>

               <p>Mr. Powell. Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Putting them into the water takes off the action of the solution, which if it were not for the water, always turns them yellow, and the water takes away that discolouring quality.</p>

               <p>Q. There is a metalic material imparted to the blanks, and that is confined by the aquafortis; but unless they are afterwards washed with water, they turn yellow - A.Certainly.</p>



               <p>Q.Therefore the colour to continue, so as to be issued into the World, ought to be washed in water - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Re-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. The colouring gives it a silver colour; but to fix it, it requires water.</p>

               <p>JOHN NICOLL. I am one of the moneyers of his Majesty's Mint. I look at the three which fell from the prisoners; they were never issued by the Mint.</p>

               <p>Quinn's Defence. (By interpretation, for he spoke in Irish.) On the morning that I was taken, I left my house, I went to Cheapside Market, where all Irish labourers look for employment as bricklayer's labourers. When we went to the market, we remained there until seven o'clock, and there was a man came up to us, and asked us if we wanted any employment, and of course we said yes; and so we went with that man; he said, he could not send us to work until after nine. We went down to the lodging, and stopped until after nine. I had only a bit of dry bread for my breakfast. After that, the man told us to come to Cripplegate Church, and we waited for the man, and then he told us to go along<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100015"></xptr>with him, and he brought us up in the two pair in Angel-alley; we were there a few minutes before the man shewed us what employment he was going to give us; then he brought a piece of copper, and a large pair of scissors, and a file; he shewed us then what we were to do with these things. When we saw what colour he brought, we did not like to do it. The man said, he would give us our dinner that day; the man is now taken prisoner. I left some of these pieces on the floor. After the man was gone, the officers came in, and hand-cuffed us. I asked the constable to stop a few minutes to see if the man would return; but the man did not.</p>

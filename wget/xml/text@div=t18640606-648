                  </hi>. I am a cooper, and live at 10, Borough-road—on the morning of 15th May, I heard a cry of "Murder!" at No. 1, Johanna-street, where the prisoner and the deceased lived—I climbed up on Mr. Turner's window-ledge—the little girl opened the window, and I saw the prisoner knocking Mr. Weston's head against the handle of the drawers and the drawers—he was lying on his belly, in his shirt—she was dressed—I hallooed out, "You beastly cow! if you don't let him alone, I will knock you down with this flower-pot"—she then let him go—I saw his head fall, and I called out, "He is dead"—she ran down the stairs, and the mother came up, and hallooed out," God Almighty, go and fetch my son; she will murder him! "I said, "He is already dead"—I was going to open the door, and as I was looking through the window, I saw the prisoner in the passage—she was drunk—she told me that I had got up there to rob the place; and if it had not been for me, she would have seen the last of her husband—I heard the the cry of "Murder" once or twice—it was the deceased's voice.</p>

               <p>and her mother in the prisoner's room on the morning in question—she was quarrelling with her mother, and trying to turn her out—she told me to mind my own business—I went home, and soon afterwards I heard the children's voices—I went out and saw Samuels on the window-ledge—I went into the house after the police-constable, and I there saw the prisoner's mother and the dead man, Stephen Weston—it was from five to ten minutes after I left their shop that I heard the children cry out—the dead man was lying on the bed, which was on the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I examined the body of Stephen Weston—I have heard the evidence—I think it is quite possible the prisoner might have killed her husband in the way described in two minutes, particularly if he was not well before—the injury to the head would be quite sufficient to cause death—effusion of blood on the brain was the cause of death—the whole of the back part and the side of the head was one mass of puffiness from recent blows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How recent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Apparently quite recent—it is quite possible that all that could have been done in five minutes—that puffiness would arise in a few minutes—the wounds were such as might be produced by the head being knocked up against drawers, or from any violence, either from direct blows, or from the head being knocked—effusion of blood on the brain would be produced by wounds of that description—there were three clots of blood on the brain—they could be produced in five minutes—a man might get a great many knocks on the head in one minute—there was no fracture of the skull.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose a man suffering from delirium-tremens would be more easily affected by blows? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he would be more easily affected by violence of any kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Supposing a man had been suffering from fits of delirium-tremens for weeks, would not that account for a number of the bruises that you saw, supposing he fell down in those fits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All except two or three bruises were perfectly recent—it was quite possible to inflict the injuries I saw, in from five to ten minutes—he might have been on his back when the injuries were effected—if a man was in a trembling state from delirium-tremens, the restraint of that would affect him unfavourably—very many men have died from delirium-tremens being restrained.</p>

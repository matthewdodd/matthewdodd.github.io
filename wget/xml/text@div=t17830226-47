               <p>Court. Did you lose sight of the prisoner before you took him? - I did my Lord, one instant, for I suppose half a minute turning the corner in the coach way, among a stand of coaches.</p>
               <p>Was he running then? - Yes, a man that stood by one of the horses heads, whether the coachman, or a man that waters the horses, I cannot say, told me, that was the man I was pursuing; he had got upon the box of a coach, I told him to come down, he told me he would not; I immediately jumped up and pulled him down, and delivered him to the constable.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you find any thing upon him? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>When you called to him to come down, did you mention any thing that you had to charge him with? - I do not recollect that circumstance.</p>
               <p>Was it light? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. Say whether you can or cannot, I do not want you to swear it, I only ask you if you have that certain knowledge in your own mind that it was the same man? No, my Lord, I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Have you the coachman here, or the man that stood at the head of the horses that told you, that the man you was pursuing, was on the coach box? - No, my Lord.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 17th of January last, I was coming down Portland-street into John-street, between five and six, where the prosecutor lives, I observed a boy peeping through the shop window, which induced me to turn back to see whether any thing was going on that was criminal; in the passage I saw a man peeping in at the door of the shop, which is in the passage, and stooping down, leaning his hand on a piece of linen that was in the passage, and with his left hand pulled out a piece of linen which is here, the prisoner turned round to the right, I am sure it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever seen him before Mr. James? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing of a light in this passage? - There was a light in the further end that came from the shop door which had a glazed window.</p>
               <p>How far distant might you be from the prisoner when you stood at the passage door? - About three yards; I immediately seized him, and asked him what he was going to do with that linen, he had the linen in his left hand, and was coming out of the passage door, I seized him, and he dropped the linen, I could not make the gentleman of the house to hear; the prisoner had both his hands at liberty, and with his right hand he struck me a blow on the head, and got away instantly; I saw him again not many minutes after, he was brought back to Mr. Patten's house.</p>
               <p>Did you know him to be the same person that you saw in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Suppose he had not been taken and brought back to Patten's house, was the view that you had had of him in the passage sufficient to enable you to know him again? - I really think it was, I am sure I should have known him again, particularly as he has but one eye, which I took very particular notice of; I had him in my left hand a considerable time, and kept looking at him all the time.</p>

               <p>The master that I work for was to be here to appear for my character.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I will do the prisoner that justice with your lordship's leave, the master related to me what he had to say, if that will be of any service to him; his master called on me yesterday morning.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot do that on account of the precedent.</p>

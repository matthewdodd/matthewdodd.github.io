               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Halifax. At my house in Lombard-Street. I asked him who he received it for, and he said one Mr. Nixon. I then asked him if Mr. Nixon did not order it to be put to his account, as he keeps cash with us, being bankers. He said his master was going out of town and wanted the money, pretending to be servant to him.</p>
               <p>The bill read to this purport:</p>

               <p>Directed to Snee and Co. Queen-Street. Indorsed, John Robinson</p>
               <p>Accepted; P. Snee. Paid when due by Mess. Glyn and Company.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this Norman?</p>
               <p>Halifax. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this acceptance on it when he brought it to you?</p>
               <p>Halifax. It was, and by that acceptance he brought it to me for payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Snee's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Halifax. Yes, very well; it is not like his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he keep cash with you?</p>
               <p>Halifax. He does. I went to Mr. Vere, one of my partners, and told him of it; we sent our servant to Mr. Snee, and Mr. Snee's servant return'd with our's.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether or no I did not refuse the money?</p>
               <p>Halifax. No, the money was never offer'd him. I refused to pay it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner press you for payment of the money?</p>
               <p>Halifax. He said his master was going out of town, and he could not stay.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say he came from?</p>
               <p>Halifax. From Mr. Nixon.</p>

               <p>Halifax. Gentleman in trade that keep cash with bankers direct the bills they accept to; the banker, for him to pay them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said if he did not think it to be an honest bill. I would not have the money, and after that I gave him direction to go to the house where my master lived. I told him I came from one Goodwin, who lived at Mr. Nixon's; I can't find that Goodwin now.</p>

               <p>Halifax. He commonly makes draughts on his bankers, he very seldom accepts; he makes draughts under his own hand, so does likewise Mr. Randolph his partner.</p>

               <p>If I was guilty, and knew it to be a wrong bill, I will be judged by your Lordship whether I should have offer'd to stay there till my master came. I did offer to stay there, and they trusted me to go to the London stone tavern and back again. I could not find that Mr. Goodwin. My father lives two hundred miles off. I have sent twice to him for money to advertise this Goodwin, but have had none sent me.</p>

               <p>Q. to Halifax. Did he offer to stay, or go to the tavern and return?</p>
               <p>Halifax. I laid hold of the bill and kept it; he got out of the shop and desired to have the bill; but I would not let him have it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If Mr. Snee will please to speak to my character, I shall be obliged to him.</p>

            . The prisoner lived with me about three months before the bill was published, and behaved very well; I have trusted him at different times to receive several large sums of money, and he always brought it very honestly. I have sent him with money to the Excise-Office, to the amount of four hundred pounds, and he always gave me a faithful account.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he write?</p>
               <p>Snee. He could.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose writing do you think the acceptance to be?</p>
               <p>Snee. I can't say that is his, but a man may seign different hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you or can you not say whether the acceptance was wrote by him?</p>

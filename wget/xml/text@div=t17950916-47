               <p>Q. What Hotel did you enquire at? - King-street Hotel; I then went to St. James's-street, to Peros, thinking it might be a mistake; the people said also that there was no captain Brown lodged there, nor yet his steward; then I enquired at three Hotels in Jermyn-street, and there was no such person at either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say? - When I refused to let him have the note back again till I had enquired about it, then after that he asked me if I would let him have part of the money, that he was very much destitute, I told him that it could not make much odds to him for one night; he then said he was sorry he had been so long in my debt, but he said now he was going as captain's steward, he could be of service to me, he then ordered a quarter of a pound of eight shilling, and a quarter of a pound of ten shilling teas, and some sugar, he did not order any thing else then, but he said he would have some more things of me, as he had kept me out of my money solong; he took the teas and sugar and was going off, but I said to him, Mr. Hanson, you have not paid for it; dear, says he, Mr. Sills, you have enough in your hands; I said there was so many tricks in the world that I could not let him take it without paying for it, for the note might be worth nothing for what I knew; he said he should want it the next morning for his breakfast; I told him then I would bring it down to him the next morning, when I came down to him to King-street Hotel; and I put it in my pocket the next morning to take to him for his breakfast, but he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say he would be the next morning? - In the Hotel, King-street, that his master was there, and he should be there himself in the morning.</p>

             that did live about that quarter, but I don't know that he lives there now; but he did not live in Wapping street, he lived in East Smithfield, he was a coal merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is East Smithfield from Wapping-street? - But a very little way.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what number he lived at? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he live there, how long ago? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he live there a year ago? - Yes, I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he live there in September last? - I believe he did, I am not certain, I don't think it is quite a twelvemonth since he left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his hand writing? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Woodfall. Pray witness did I understand you rightly just now, that some time since, a man of the name of Martin lived at No. 163? - No, I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Court to Sills. You say you enquired at No. 163, and they told you there was so such man there? - They told me there was no

             but at No. 363; when Mr. Falk gave me the bill, he said that Martin was a very capital man, that he had one brother a master taylor in the Strand, and the other a master of a ship, and that they were very capital people, and that I had not the least reason to doubt the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what that Robert Martin was? - Yes, he told me he was a slop seller, and knew him very well, and Martin did know him very well, and he owes him money to this time; and Martin served the ship's crew of one captain Peckman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel; the way I got the note was, I I found it in the street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Woodfall to Prosecutor. You knew him some years? - I knew him fifteen years ago, and he went off in my debt.</p>

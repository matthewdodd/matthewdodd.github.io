On the 29th of February, between three and four o'clock, I saw a hackney-coach stop right opposite my master's door, at Lambeth; I saw Graham get out of the coach, and go over to Higginbottom's, the pawnbroker, twice, with some things - the coachman was on the box; there was a young woman in the coach - I did not see her face: Jones was also in the coach - I am quite sure of him; Jones got on the top of the box afterwards, and rode round the corner; they went away - Graham had a bundle, which she took to Higginbottom's, and when she came back the second time she had a bundle in her apron again - she went back into the coach.</p>

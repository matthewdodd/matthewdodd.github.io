               <p>I am an officer belonging to the Rotation Office, Whitechapel: On the 3d of October, a woman said, a boy had been robbed by two men, by somebody, she said, I knew: I went to where he lodged, but he absconded ten or eleven days. On the 15th coming down the road, I met Sharpling the prisoner and two others, I took him and the others ran away; I brought the prisoner to the watch-house, the boy was sent for, and he picked the prisoner out: The master had been on the morning of the robbery and described the prisoner, I cannot be certain whether he said a brown, or a blue, great coat, and striped trowsers, he had the same things on when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was the prisoner? - In the cage, when the boy came he was ordered out amongst a number of people, and the boy picked him out, he was asked if he knew any one there, and said, the prisoner was the man, and he knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I was put to the bar, and he was asked whether he knew the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I could prove that I was not there, for I was on the 3d and 4th, and part of the 5th of October, on board a ship in Greenland Dock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Calvert, as dray-man, at the brewery, in Thames-street. On Saturday, 11th March, I had a jacket there—I hung it up, in the place on purpose, which is open to the brew house—the prisoner was about the premises that day, but was not employed to do anything—he was there when I hung up the coat—he had been an occasional workman there—when the policeman had him in custody I heard him say he did not know where it was he had lost it.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at the brewery. On 11th March I saw the prisoner standing in the yard with a jacket under his arm—I asked him where he was going to take it—he said, to <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> White, down the Commercial road (that is the last witness)—I told him he had better not take it, for the man would want it—he went out of the yard with it under his arm.</p>

I received information on the Tuesday after the jacket was lost on the Saturday, in consequence of which I took the prisoner at the brewery—he was given into my custody there on 28th March—I could not find him before that—I told him the charge—he said he took the coat, but had lost it.</p>

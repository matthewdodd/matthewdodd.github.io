            . I am a labourer. I was at Mr. Abbott's, and saw the prisoner come down stairs with a bundle under his arm, and something tucked between his jacket and waistcoat - he told me I should have part if I would say nothing about it - I said I would have nothing to do with it; he went out into the lane; I told Abbott next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not tell him that night? A. I did not give it a thought; he had a pair of light plush breeches on; he said he had a pair of small-clothes and a waistcoat of Mr. Abbott's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is all false; he wanted me to steal some potatoes from a field; I would not, and then he told this of me. Witness. I did not; I knew him before.</p>

I was at Abbott's that night, and saw the prisoner there in the evening; I fell asleep, and awoke in five minutes; he was then gone, and Eldridge was sitting in his chair; he said nothing about any robbery; I heard the staircase-door shut, and the prisoner came from the staircase; I saw nothing in his hand; he came into the tap-room; Eldridge went our after him; this was about six o'clock; I saw them in the tap-room again about nine.</p>

On Monday night, 18th Dec., I fastened up the house at 11 o'clock—the house<lb></lb>maid, and master and mistress, were in the house—I was not the last up—the nurse was up last—she went to bed a little after 12 o'clock—I fastened the lower door, which leads into the garden—I came down next morning, about half-past 7 o'clock, and found that door open, which I had fastened the night before at 11 o'clock—I went in the pantry, and missed all the plate—I called my master, and he came down immediately—I missed a cloak and pair of boots of mine, which had been safe the night before—I afterwards missed an umbrella, which had been left in the pantry—some jars, which had been inside the scullery window, had been removed into the garden—an iron bar outside the scullery window had been broken—my master picked up these ropes and sticks, which did not belong to the house.</p>

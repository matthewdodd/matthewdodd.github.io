               <p>Then all those things that he thought came within that description he took away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. You said you took those goods that he brought from those premises; did you know those goods? - Best part of them, the rest the maid shewed me that belonged to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Did you let any house to the prisoner at any time? - I was asked that question in Bow-street, they sent for me, I could not positively recollect him, I saw him so short a space of time in my shop that I could not recollect him, not my clerk who went with him could not recollect him; it was a house in Union-buildings, the man that came to take the house said his name was Harris.</p>
               <p>Did you ever receive any rent for that house? - I believe not, he left I think a guinea earnest, and a gentleman left another guinea on taking away some few things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Yo do not know the person? - If it is the same person, he is very much altered, he had either a wig or his hair curled in his neck, the size is the same, but I am not clear, and therefore I would not say.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You have been employed for many years for the mint, and therefore you can describe to us the several implements that are there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Take them as they were produced in evidence? - Here is, my Lord, one pair of flasks and an odd one.</p>
               <p>Court. The pair of flasks is compleat? - These are compleat without the sand, these double wicked candles are used to smoke the mould, for when the sand is damp if it was put in then, it would blow it as they call it, that is fill it full of holes; the candles are to dry the sand.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the sand when dried in that manner, is as it were caked together? - Not a doubt of it my Lord, and that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290154"></xptr> gives it the colour of black on the face of the sand.</p>
               <p>What is the use of these crucibles? - For melting the arsenic in, to flux the colour with; by throwing it into water it throws one degree of whiteness, this is what they call blanch copper, which is melted, and then fluxed by this arsenic, it makes it what they call a white copper, not quite so white as tutenage: They scour them with the scouring-paper in order to make them take the white the better.</p>
               <p>What is that little pipkin? - It has been proved in this Court, that after they are cleared this leaves them bright, it is a kind of stuff made of black lead in order to make them look old, the aqua fortis is to draw out the white of the silver, then it is put into water and scraped with sand, then it leaves a black upon it, then it is taken off by sand, then this is put upon it in order that it should not tarnish with the strength of the aqua fortis, it takes away the brightness of rubbing with the sand.</p>
               <p>Is there the whole apparatus for coining compleat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at these shillings, are they cast or struck? - They are cast.</p>
               <p>What are these filings? - That is what is cut from the edge after they are cast, it runs round the edge, it is clipped off and then filed.</p>
               <p>Look at that metal in that crucible? - There is silver among that.</p>
               <p>Is that the same metal of which these shillings are cast? - I have not a doubt of it, but it is too nice to swear to, without an assay being made, that it is the same, but I have not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>I understand so far as the exterior instrument goes it is compleat? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. You apprehended the prisoner? - Yes, I did, it was on Friday the 10th of this month, at Tuston-street Westminster, there I found two compleat sets of coining tools in the cellar, as compleat, as compleat could be. (The Tools produced.) There are the gets, two of these have been used.</p>

               <p>Court. Mr. Clarke, if I am wrong you will correct me, each of these little projections of each side, are the parts that adhere to the shilling or sixpence? - Not a doubt of it, my Lord, there are two gets that have not been used, the metal remains on the other.</p>
               <p>Court. These things called the gets are the real conductors to each mould? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the metal remains on the conductor itself, as well as communicates to the other? - Yes, it is the main channel of the mould when the shillings and sixpences remain on, then it is called a spray, when they are taken off it is called a get; before it is used it is a plain piece of lead, but when the metal is poured in part of it adheres.</p>
               <p>Court. Go to the Gentlemen of the Jury Mr. Clarke and give them an account? - Yes, my Lord: When it is poured it runs down the sand, and it lodges itself to each of them pieces; then it is all joined.</p>
               <p>Court. When the metal comes in, it forces itself into these interstices or vacant spaces, and then it connects itself.</p>
               <p>Clarke. In the cellar I found that melting-pot, in the back parlour in the closet I found about six pounds-worth of shillings.</p>
               <p>Are they good or bad? - They are all rough cast.</p>
               <p>Court. They are not yet in the similitude of shillings? - No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Do you mean six pounds in weight or in enumeration? - In tale, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Jury. What is that piece of metal? - This is not in a state of being used at present.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Did you find any thing else Mr. Clarke? - Yes, I found the patterns from which they were cast.</p>
               <p>Then these are the patterns from which these were cast? - Clearly so, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you find them? - I found them all in the closet in Westminster.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. What name did he go by there? - He called himself by the name of Brooks, I called him Harris,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290155"></xptr> and he said, his name was not Harris; one of the officers that was with him knew him better than I did, he said, Joe, your name is

               <p>Prisoner's Council. How long was it between the time when this discovery was made in Union Buildings, and the time you apprehended this man? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>It seems at Westminster there is something that makes the apparatus more compleat than those that were found in Union Buildings? - The things in the casting way are both compleat, but there was no get that I have seen, that was found in Union Buildings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. You got this from a woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who did you pay the money to? - I paid a guinea to Mr. Oldham to redeem the woman's goods that were in the house, I paid the money to Mr. Oldham's wife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Then you received instructions from a woman, and paid the money in consequence of her directions? - Yes.</p>

               <p>(The Power of Attorney handed up.)</p>
               <p>Court. Here are witnesses to this.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. We cannot find them, this money is the produce of the sale of Harris's goods.</p>
               <p>Court. How does that appear? - Because Bolton identifies these goods to be the goods he had seen in Tennis Court, which goods he seized in Union Court, for the rent.</p>
               <p>Court. He said, some he remembered, and the maid shewed him the others.</p>
               <p>Then there is a balance received by this gentleman, which was the balance of these goods sold, now how do you shew this was by the order or direction of Harris, for Oldham nor his clerk do not know him.</p>

            . The evidence goes no further than to prove that the produce of these goods were applied to pay the rent to Oldham.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Nares. But then they do not shew that he was sent to Oldham.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. No, but I prove the goods in the house, the wife in the house, and these goods are sold afterwards; as to this power of attorney Mr. Bogle does not know who the witnesses are, nor we do not know who they are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Nares. The evidence must be taken as far as it does go, as proper evidence abstracted from the letter of attorney; that must be laid out of the case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolton. Before I paid Mr. Bogle, I asked him whether that was Mr. Harris's writing, he said yes, says I, will you swear to it, he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Nares. There is another thing as to that woman; who swears that is his wife?</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. Bolton said, that was his wife.</p>
               <p>Bolton. It was the woman that went for his wife.</p>
               <p>Court to Bolton. When you went to the house who did you see there? - Mrs. Lewis, the woman that went for his wife, she that came to take the house of me.</p>
               <p>Did you see her afterwards at Bow-street? - I saw her after she was taken.</p>
               <p>Court to Bogle. Who did you pay the money to? - To Mr. Harris's maid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and live in Ann's-row, Bromley; the deceased, Thomas Boulter, was my brother. On Monday morning, the 26th of March, I heard what was about to take place, and went down to the marshes in Essex, near the river Lea—I saw Curtis, Tantony, and Blaker, and my brother come in a boat—I saw the prisoner there—a fight took place between my brother and Blaker—the prisoner picked my brother up, and put him on another man's knee—he continued to do so during the fight, and he wished him to leave off—they fought about thirty-five minutes—I saw Blaker strike my brother a blow with the right hand under the left ear—it appeared a chance blow—he fell down, and never was sensible afterwards—he was put into a boat and taken away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gardiner-place, Poplar. I knew the deceased—I was present at the Angel public-house, when there was a dis<lb></lb>pute between him and Blaker—I was present on Monday, the 26th of March, at the marshes, hearing a fight was to take place—I did not see him pick him up—I was not very near—the prisoner came there in the boat with the rest, and remained till it was over—I did not see Boulter fall the last time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Brunswick-street, Poplar. On Monday, the 26th of March, I was called in to see the deceased—I found him at hi, lodging, in Leicester-street—he was insensible, and never became sensible—he died about two hours after I arrived—there were several con<lb></lb>tusions on his face and head—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the im<lb></lb>mediate cause of death was the rupture of a Wood-vessel in the head, which might be produced by a violent blow in a fight—he had every appearance of having been engaged in fighting—there was a blow immediately below the left ear—I have not a doubt death was occasioned by blows received in fighting—after having heard the evidence, I believe that was the occasion of his death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. On the 26th of March Boulter called me up, as I live with his mother—I went down to see the fight, but not to be second—I wiped his face several times—I tried to persuade him to leave off fighting—he said no, he would not; he had brought forty people there to see the fight, and he would not make fools of them—at last I caught hold of him, and said he should leave off fighting, I would have no more of it—Blaker came up to shake hands with him, but he got out of my hands, and fell down on the grass—I took him to his mothers, and went for the surgeon.</p>

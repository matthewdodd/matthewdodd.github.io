                  </hi>. The prisoner had been about two years and a half in our employment when this robbery was discovered—prior to Wright being examined before the Magistrate I had an interview with him, and from information I received from him I went to Wells's lodgings, with Harvey, a policeman—Wells was not there; we found a child and two females, one of whom said she was his wife—we did not search much; Harvey looked about a little, and found this hair seating (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was wrapped up in brown paper behind a couch, in one corner of the room—I then went home, and called Wells into my private counting house, and said, "How could you prove such a rascal after the kindness we have shown you; Wright is in custody, is there any person else that is connected with this matter but Coombes?" he said, "No"—I asked him how the horsehair seating came on his premises—he could see by that that I knew something about it—he said one of the porters must have taken them there, and he hedged about and prevaricated a good deal—I said, "It is quite impossible; you had better tell the truth; did not you take it yourself?" he said, "I did"—all I said was, "You had better tell the truth."

I dropped the things that I had. He said no words from you, he spoke Spanish, which I understood myself. He said, I will serve your comrade the same; you have no business in Spanish ships; he had in his hand a large knife, and when he told me I had no business in Spanish ships, he struck me again with the same knife, in the same arm. I laid hold of the knife; I could not get the knife from him. Some of his countrymen came to help him; then I ran away. When I ran away, he stabbed my jacket, it did not touch my skin; he stabbed the jacket in my back. I went to a surgeon, and got my wounds dressed. It was this jacket that I have on now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him any provocation of any kind - A. No; I never spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in this country this time - A. Going for three months, part on board a ship, and part on shore. My comrade is not here; the ship went away the next day, and he went with the ship.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Holloway, surgeon, Burr-street. On the 4th of this month, the prosecutor came to me to have his wounds dressed; he had two wounds on the left arm, one on the dead joint muscle; it appeared to have been inflicted by a knife; the other was near the wrist, that was a simple inscissed wound, not far deep. The dead joint muscle was injured some little, it is recovered now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor worked on board that ship five days, I had never any thing to do with him at all. The night he was on shore, I never came on shore at all. I am quite innocent of the charge. Mr. Thomas here knows I was on board.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS. I don't know he was on board that ship; I knew he belonged to the Spanish ship, De Elberga; the owner of the ship is Mr. Dubois London Wall.</p>

               <p>Tho. Gilbert. About 6 Weeks ago I lost a Spoon, and my Maid informed me no one had been in the Kitchen but her Couzen, the Prisoner; I sent after her, and she would own nothing; but last Saturday was se'ennight, Justice Chamberlain sent to let me know he had got my Spoon, and I must prosecute the Prisoner.</p>

            . About 10 Days ago the Prisoner and Mr. Gilbert's Maid came and ask'd for a Spoon, which the Prisoner had pledged to me on the 6th of Sept. last. I brought it down, and the Maid asked her Couzen (the Prisoner) how she could serve her so; they made Words together and went away. I would have sent for Mr. Gilbert, but they did not care I should. In about a Week's Time the Maid came again, and I delivered the Spoon to the Constable. The Prisoner brought it to me herself.</p>
               <p>Q Is it your Custom to take such Things in Pawn from People you are unacquainted with?</p>
               <p>Smitherman I serve a great many People in a Day, and am not positive whether I took it in or not. I am as careful as I can be.</p>
               <p>Jury. Just now he said the Prisoner brought it to him herself; now he says, he does not know whether he took it in or no.</p>
               <p>Smitherman. I found it in her Name in my Book, and she told me she brought it herself.</p>

            . I lost a Spoon of Mr. Gilbert's on the 6th of last Month, and not only lost my Place about it, but paid 10 s. for it besides. I taxed the Prisoner with the Spoon, and she deny'd it; but afterwards she carry'd me to the Pawnbroker's Shop, and I saw it with T. G. M. (my Master's Mark) upon it, but he would not let me have it without Money. About a Week afterwards I sent to my Master Gilbert, but because I had paid for the Spoon, he would not come to the Pawnbroker's. Afterwards I found out the Prisoner, and charged a Constable with her, upon which she carry'd me to Smitherman's, and the Spoon he shewed me was the same that was lost.</p>

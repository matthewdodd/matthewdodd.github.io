                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Marylebone Savings Bank. Dr. John Hume Spry and several others act as trustees—in January last we had an account of a person named Mary Todd as a depositor—on Saturday the 20th Jan., between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner, Elizabeth Todd, came to the bank and presented this deposit book to me—it is the book which was given to the person who had invested the money in the name of Mary Todd—the first deposit was made on the 14th October, 1837—I cannot say whether she was alone when she came—she presented the book and said she wished to withdraw the whole of the money—there was then 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. standing in the name of Mary Todd—I asked her if it was her own money, and if the account belonged to her, she replied that it was her account and that she paid the money in—I then proceeded to fill up the notice ticket now produced previous to its being signed—I handed it to her and told her to write her own name—she wrote a name here which I could not exactly make out, and asked her what name it was—she said Mary Todd—I then asked her again if she had paid the money in—she said she did—I told her it was not much like the writing in our book, and if she could not write it better on the day of payment she would have some difficulty in getting the money—she said she had not written for some years, and had not got her spectacles with her, but between that and the day of payment she would bring her spectacles, and also practise writing in the mean time—we require ten days' notice of an intention to withdraw money—she then left, and on the Tuesday week following, the 30th, she came again—I filled up a receipt and handed it to her to sign—she wrote the name of Mary Todd once—I looked at it and asked her if she could write it better—she said shew ould try, and then wrote the name the second time on the same paper, and I struck out the first—I was not satisfied with that second writing, and snowed it to Mr. Douglas Finney, the assistant secretary—he asked her to write the name again on the back of the receipt, which she did—he said he was not satisfied with the handwriting and should require her to make a declaration before a Magistrate—the prisoner Trussler then came forward and said she could make oath that the was the person who paid the money in—Mr. Douglas Finney then said he would fill up a declaration for them both to sign—he asked Trussler if she was present when the first deposit was made, she said she was—he then pre<lb></lb>pared this declaration for them to make before a Magistrate—I am not positive which took it, but they went away with it—they returned in about half an hour and communicated with Mr. Douglas Finney—I have been a clerk in the bank twelve years—I never saw the prisoner Elizabeth Todd before to my recollection—I was not the person who received the original deposit in September, 1837—Mr. Douglas Finney received it himself—there are three entries in the deposit book in my handwriting—I cannot say of whom I received those deposits—the depositor does not sign after the first time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant secretary and actuary to the Marylebone Savings Bank—I remember Sheath calling my attention to the signature of Mary Todd, on Tuesday 30th Jan., on a paper—I told Elizabeth Todd the signature was not satisfactory to me, and asked if she was the Mary Todd who deposited the money in the first instance—she said she was—I then said I should require a declaration to be made before a Magistrate of the fact—the prisoner Trussler was about a foot from her—I cannot say whether she heard this conversation, but Trussler came forward on my saying that, and said, "I came with this party, and know her to be the Mary Todd"—I then asked if she saw her write her name in the signature book in the first instance—she said, "No, I was waiting outside"—I then asked Trussler if she would have any objection to make a declaration as to these facts—she answered, no—I then prepared a declaration, which is here—I read it over to them, very care<lb></lb>fully explaining to them that if they declared here anything that was false, they would be considered guilty of perjury and liable to the same punishment—after reading it over to them and explaining the penalty, I asked if they were willing to make it—they said they were, and then left with the declaration, in about a quarter of an hour they returned—Trussler said, "We have come to tell you the truth, sir"—Todd then said, "The account was my sister's, who is now dead"—I said the case was of so serious a character I could hear nothing further till my father, who is the actuary, returned—I directed them to sit down in the office—after a short time my father returned, and they were shown in to him—before that Todd might have mentioned in my presence that there was a son living and a will left—she certainly did afterwards—I believe she remarked that nearly the whole, if not the whole, of the money had been paid in by her, and belonged to her—I was present when they were shown in to my father, and then Todd stated that the account was not hers, that the money had been paid in by her sister in the first instance—that her sister was dead, had left a will, and there was a son living, but that the whole, or nearly the whole of the money had been paid in by her, and belonged to her that on a former occasion she had received the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I then pro<lb></lb>cured the receipt for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; which I showed her and asked if that was her handwriting, pointing to the signature—she said it was—after Trussler had admitted this was not Mary Todd, I said to her, "How could you allow me to prepare this declaration, when you state that you came with the right Mary Todd, and you knew at the time this was Elizabeth Todd?"—I believe she began to cry—I could not swear as to the very answer she made—I and my father told them if they were allowed to go they must consider the charge</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Crown-court, Covent-garden, and am the son of the late Mary Todd—she was a spinster—I proved her will on Saturday, the 27th of January—I knew she had money in the Marylebone Savings' Bank—she died on the 16th of January—I proved the will in a sufficient sum to comprehend the money in the bank—the prisoner Elizabeth Todd is my mother's sister—I have known Trussler five, six, or seven years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you, as the executor, go and receive the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> During my mother's life-time some conversation arose respecting her name in the deposit-book, or the bank-book, I do not know which, but it was to the effect, that the book has only the name, of Todd, and I urged the pro<lb></lb>priety of her taking the book herself, at the next deposit, that I should have no difficulty in establishing the fact that it was her money, and no other Todd, knowing I was her executor, her answer was, "You know your aunt has paid in most of the money, and she will not cheat you,"and that she had on one occasion drawn out 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; of the money.</p>

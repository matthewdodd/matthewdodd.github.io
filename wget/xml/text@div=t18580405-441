I was present at the table of the House during the whole of Saturday, 2d May, the day upon which Mr. Glover, the defendant, took the oaths and his seat for Beverley—the House was sitting, and the Speaker in the chair—Sir Denis Le Marchant, the Clerk of the House, would administer the oath—I am not in a position to say that I saw the oath administered to Mr. Glover—I have no doubt that the declaration was deli<lb></lb>vered to myself personally—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) appears to be the statement of the particulars of qualification handed in at the table, in my presence—I have no doubt that this document was handed in, but I am not able to identify it, as having been delivered into my own hand—I should, perhaps, explain to the Court the process of swearing in the members at the commencement of the Session, and the mode of taking their declarations, it will then be understood why I am not able at once to specify this; at the commencement of the Session a great number of members are waiting to be sworn at once, and their names are taken down by one of the clerks at the table, and kept in a list; the Clerk of the House then reads from that list, out loud, in the hearing of the whole House, each name in succession as it stands on that list; every member so called then takes his place at the table, and when they are all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185804050128"></xptr>
               <p>assembled there, the clerk proceeds to administer the oaths, and also the decla<lb></lb>ration of qualification, which they repeat after him, all at once; when they have taken the oaths and the declaration, they withdraw from the table to their seats, and then the clerk assistant again reads each of those names in succession from the list, and each member, on being called a second time, comes to the table and delivers in to the clerk assistant the statement of his qualification, referred to in the declaration of qualification; as soon as the declaration of qualification has been handed in, the member handing it in proceeds to sign the parchment roll of the oaths, and also of the qualification; there are two rolls, and the lists of the names of the members who take the oaths on each day, are filed and preserved in the Journal Office of the House of Commons; Sir Denis Le Marchant, myself, and Mr. Henry Lee, the second clerk assistant, were the parties who administered the declaration to the members after the general election of 1857, and who took the declara<lb></lb>tions and gave them the parchment rolls to sign.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Chief Clerk to the Court of Bankruptcy and Insolvency in Ireland; it is now one court. I produce the petition and schedule of Edward Glover, filed in the late Court for the relief of Insolvent Debtors in Ireland, dated 26th June, 1849, filed on 27th June—the vesting order bears the same date—the matter was finally heard and adjusted on 23d March, 1850—here is my own memorandum made at the time—Edward Glover swore to this schedule on that day, and was discharged forthwith—there is an endorsement on the petition "First arrest 15th June,1849; commitment 15th June, 1849"—he would not be out on bail until after his schedule was filed; he might after that—it was filed on 27th June,1849—I do not know Mr. Glover's signature; I did not see him sign the schedule—it is not signed by me, but by Richard Farrell; he was the</p>

               <p>Commissioner of the Conrt at that time—here is "Dublin, 23d March,1850," in my writing; I wrote that at the time the schedule was sworn to—Iadministered the oath; I see that from my having filled in the date—I produce an affidavit purporting to be sworn by Edward Glover, on 13th May,1857, and filed on the 15th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then, as a matter of course, a party who becomes insolvent remains from the time he is arrested until he files his petition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Necessarily so, there is no means of getting out, the Court has no jurisdiction until the petition is filed—there was a warrant of attorney given to empower the assignee to enter up judgment at the suit of the provisional assignee against the insolvent, for the amount of the scheduled debts—if any judgment was entered up it would not appear among the records of the Insolvent Court—Mr. Worrall was the trade assignee—it was not the course in the late Court of Insolvency for creditors to prove their debts until a dividend was about to be made—that is called an audit—I do not know that there ever was an audit in this case—I should say there was not; it would not be within my knowledge—I do not know whether the assignee ever filed an account—if there was an audit there would be a chief clerk's report upon it—ifthere is such a document it would be on the files of the Court—I looked and found no such document—I looked generally; I did not make a negative search—I can speak as a matter of certainty that there never has been an audit, but I do not like to speak to it, because it is a matter of record—there may have been an audit, and the registrar not have made his report upon it—Ishould say there has been none.</p>

I believe—I think that was some months ago, I think since my appoint<lb></lb>ment—Iwas not present at the sale, but Mr. Martin, my attorney, was—an assignee cannot act as attorney for himself; I do not mean Mr. Martin of Beverley, but of Dublin, formerly of Cork—he named me as a very suitable and proper person to be assignee—I was not a creditor, but I was attorney for a creditor, and it was in that way I first heard of it; that creditor is Herbert Eyre O'Donnell—I heard that Mr. Martin was employed by Mr. Leman of Beverley—I do not know that he is the agent of Mr. Wells, the petitioner—there is a very great friendship between Mr. Martin and me—I believe it was some time subseqnent to the Beverley election that I was nominated as the trade assignee; if you will allow me, I will explain how I became acquainted with it, Mr. O'Donnell got a circular as a creditor, and be sent it to me to do what was necessary, thinking there was something coming to him in the shape of a dividend—he is my principal, and it was from him I first heard of it—he is a creditor for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was intended that he should be appointed trade assignee, but as be lived in a very remote locality, it was considered that he could not do justice to the general body of creditors, the assignee representing all the creditors—he was a solicitor, but I believe he is a miller now; he lives at Drimolee, County Cork—I do not think there was any very great opposition made to my becoming trade assignee—a Mr. Daley who was a creditor, had a day or two, or a week, to consider, from the chief clerk, whether be would accept the appointment, and then he said he would have nothing to do with it, and the consequence was they considered I would be a proper person—Mr. Martin has acted as solicitor for me ever since, and has attended the Encumbered Estates, and all that.</p>

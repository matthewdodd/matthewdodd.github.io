The outer door could be opened outside by pulling a string. I am sure it was fast; the room-door was fast and the key in it. I was up stairs; my watch hung over the fire-place in the room. I heard the street - door open, ran down as fast as possible, and saw a man go out of the outer door and pull it after him. I looked into the room and missed my watch. I immediately ran after him; I did not see the prisoner stopped. The prisoner was brought back in less than a quarter of an hour, by Daily. I do not know whether he is the same person that I saw in the house. I had had the watch eight years, it is worth 30s. A person could see the watch hang up through the window. I tried the door before I went up stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am groom to Henry James Cook, of High-street, Isling<lb></lb>ton. About half-past seven o'clock, on the 16th of Jan., I had the articles stated all safe in the stable—I locked the stable-door—next morning I went to the stable, and missed them—the tiles were taken from the roof, and a hole made large enough for a man to get in—these things produced are all my master's.</p>

I was returning home from Hornsey, and between six and seven o'clock met the prisoner and two others at the corner of Sermon-lane, Liverpool-road—I had known Butters six or seven years—he said to me, "Do you want to buy any harness?"—I said, "Not at present"—he said, "Do you know any body that does?"—I said no, but if I heard of any body that did I would tell him—I am a harness and coachmaker—he asked me the value of it—he did not produce it—I told him to describe it—he described it as a martin<lb></lb>gale,</p>

               <p>saddle, two whips, and an umbrella—I told him I thought it was worth about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but if he would let me see it, I could tell him better—he said he had not got it then, but if I went up to the Belvidere in half an hour, I could see it—I went there about nine o'clock, and these are the articles he brought—I showed them to the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am bailiff to John White Cator, of West Lodge, Enfield. On Thursday, 24th Oct., he had a hundred ewes, and one ram in a field—I counted them between seven and eight o'clock that morning; and again on Saturday morning about seven, when there was one missing— I searched and found the skin and entrails, and two unborn lambs in a ditch—it was fresh killed, and was skinned very neatly—the sheep were all marked with a round hole, and an "M" in it, and a dot on the right shoulder—I gave the skin to the police-sergeant—on Friday, 1st Nov., I went with Watkins to Mr. Goodson's, who sent Stafford to us—Watkins asked him what he knew about the sheep which was lost from Mr. Cator's—he at first said he knew nothing about it—the policeman said, "Yes; you do, you have heard something about it"—he said no he did not, for a minute; and then said, "About a month ago I went into a <hi rend="italic">Tom and Jerry</hi> to have a pint of beer, and heard three or four railroad-men say there were some very good sheep on West Lodge, and he thought there would be some of them lost this winter"—the policeman asked him if he would allow him to search his house—he said, "Yes"—Mr. Pennyfather who was there said, "Stafford, just go and put my horse into the cart before you go"—he said "Yes," and went to do so—in a few minutes I went out, and could not find him—I and the policeman ran as fast as we could to his cottage—it was between nine and ten in the forenoon—Wakins asked the female prisoner whether Stafford had been in—she said no; he had not—he said, "Are you sure of it?"—she said, "I am,</p>

               <p>—he has not been in here since he went out in the morning"—Watkins told her to dress herself, for they wanted to look into the house after some mutton which was lost from Mr. Gator's—she said she thought if we went over the other side of the hedge we should find something in the field—Watkins stepped out on the threshhold, and she tried to close the door against him, but he got in, and we searched the house—there were some mutton bones on the table—he asked her where she bought her mutton—she said at a butcher's at Enfield—in a room up-stairs I found one leg of mutton, one shoulder, one neck, one breast, and two pots of suet tied down—the bones on the table were from the neck, and I think the shoulder—Mrs. Stafford said a blackberry-man from London, named Sam, brought them there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher. On 2nd Nov. I examined four joints of mutton at the station, and the skin of a ewe—I could not judge whether the joints belonged to the skin, they were so dirty, and had been cut up while the mutton was hot, but a portion of the udder was left on the joint, and a portion was deficient on the skin, but they were very dirty and I could not match them.</p>

                  </hi> I am a farmer, of Yorkshire. On 6th Aug. I came to London—I left my carpet-bag at Bishop Stortford, intending to take it on my return—in the afternoon I was in Bishopsgate-street and met the prisoner with it—I had not seen him before—I asked him what he was going to do with it, and said it was mine—he said it was his—I took him and it to the station—it had in it a coat and trowsers, a waistcoat, and several shirts—this is it; it is mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This address of yours was on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I produced the key at the station—the prisoner said he had come from Bishops Stortford that morning—he said at the station that it must be a mis<lb></lb>take, and from what I have since heard, I think probably it was.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). The prisoner was given into my custody—I found on him a small key which would not open this bag—I went to the Eastern Counties Railway and telegraphed <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Bishops Stortford—this other bag was sent up from there: the key found on the prisoner opens it—the prisoner identified it—it contained a coat, a pair of trowsers, a piece <hi rend="italic">of</hi> ham, and other things—it is not quite so large as the other.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you find at the railway that they knew the prisoner perfectly well? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I found on him this certificate that he was two years in the service of the Company and was dismissed without any fault—I have been down to Bishops Stortford and find he has been living with his mother, and has a good character.</p>

                  </hi> I am a clerk at Bishops Stortford station. The prisoner was in the Company's service two years—he was very honest, and conducted himself well—both these bags were in the booking-office—the prisoner came to take his ticket some time after the prosecutor had left his bag—the prisoner put his bag on a form—he borrowed a newspaper; he read it till the bell rang—he then seized a bag and went off, leaving his own bag behind.</p>

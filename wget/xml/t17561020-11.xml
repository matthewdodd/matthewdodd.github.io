The prisoner came there last Monday was a week, and called for a pint of beer; he sat down, and ask'd me what it was o'clock. I pull'd out my watch, and said it was a quarter too slow; he took it up, and said so it was, and put it in his pocket. In a few minutes time I turn'd about, and said I believe you have made a mistake in putting my watch in your pocket and then he offer'd me some reasons for his so doing.</p>
               <p>Q. What reasons did he assign?</p>
               <p>Murphy. He had been at our house, and wanted to buy a spotted dog of mine, asking me a guinea to boot betwixt this watch and my dog. He came again in a day or two after, when we agreed for half a guinea to boot, which I gave him, and he took away the dog and left the watch, the same which he put into his pocket; at that time he said he was advised to take the watch away.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear that the dog had been stolen from a gentleman, who had claim'd him of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Murphy. I did hear so.</p>

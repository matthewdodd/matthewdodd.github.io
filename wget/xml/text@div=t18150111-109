            . I am bailiff to his Grace the Duke of Devonshire. The deer got his leg broke; I shot it, and skinned it in the slaughter-house; the slaughter-house is in the yard, and all the premises are within the Park fence. Badsey is a labourer employed on the premises. On the 21st, I went into the slaughter-house, and missed it. The officer found part of a deer at Mrs. Crystall's, the hind quarter; I knew that part of the deer, where the accident happened, because there was a deal of concealed blood on the part where the leg was broken; I knew it again, because I dressed it; the body was worth ten shillings.</p>
               <p>ELI STEADHY. I went to Mrs. Crystall's house, just at he back of the Pack horse, Turnham Green, where the prisoner lodged, about a mile from the Park; I there found haunch of venison. On the 27th of December, I apprehended the two prisoners at Acton, in Middlesex; I took them up on suspicion of stealing the carcase of a deer, and when I found the deer; they came in the house, they said, they were not guilty of any thing of the kind; they said they were innocent.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH CRYSTALL. Q. Do you remember part of the carcase of a deer being found at your house - A. Yes. I live at Turnham Green.

                  </hi>. I am a fisherman, and live at 11, Marl borough-street, Greenwich—on the morning of 18th January I went into Ware's-court, Greenwich, to call a boy of the name of Blake who worked for me—I called out "Boy Blake" seven or eight times, upon which the prisoner came out, and said, "I will give you boy Blake," and struck me a violent blow on the left side of my head with a heavy weapon something like a poker—I had seen the prisoner before, but did not know his name—I never had any quarrel with him—he struck me more than once—I fell back, and when I was on the ground he kicked me on my left side—I was insensible for a minute or two—after I recovered I crawled out of the court and went to my brother's house—I lost a great deal of blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prosecutor just before 1 o'clock going towards the court—he said he was going to call the boy Blake—I saw him again about half-an-hour afterwards at his own door—he was bleeding tremendously from a cut on the head, and he fell down on the stones insensible.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 69). About 3 o'clock on the morning of the 18th January I met the last witness—in consequence of what he said I went to the prosecutor's house—I found him insensible, and his shirt, guernsey, and trousers completely smothered with blood—I saw him again about 9 o'clock that same morning—he was then sensible—in consequence of what he said I went to the prisoner—as I was going up the stairs the prisoner said to the boy, "Go and fetch a policeman, and I will have the old man locked up"—I said, "You need not send for one, here is one here"—he said, "I am very sorry for it, very sorry indeed"—I said, I should take him into custody for the assault—he said, "He came and called 'Fire,' my wife awoke me, and I came out and we struggled together"—I found no poker in the house—there was a little bit of iron—there was no blood on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was lying in bed about 2 o'clock in the morning—I heard a strange man come up the court and call out "Fire," below—the prisoner's wife came down stairs, and asked, "Who, and what are you"—I got out with a candle to save my children from being burnt, as I thought, and I saw the prisoner come down stairs in his night shirt, and put the person out of the door—I then saw it was Mr. Cobb—I live next door to the prisoner in the lower room—Mr. Cobb came out of Fry's passage—they live on the second floor—I saw the prisoner put Mr. Cobb outside of the door—this was exactly at 2 o'clock, for I heard the clock strike 2 just as</p>

               <p>the man called out "Fire"—he went away not long after that—he staggered very much up the court, and seemed to be in liquor—I did not see any signs of blood about him.</p>

            . I was on duty at the watch-house on the 14th, and the prisoner was brought in by the watchman- he had this hat on, and the keys and handkerchiefs in his pocket; he threw down the keys and said to the prosecutor "Take them - they are your's;" he did not say he took the hat by mistake.</p>

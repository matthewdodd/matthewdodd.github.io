               <p>THOMAS PENRY sworn.</p>


               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Rich. On Tuesday the 21st of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock the prisoner, with another woman shorter than herself, came into Mr. Rich's shop; they had bed-gowns over their gowns and long cloaks. They asked me if we had not some silks at four shillings, or four and three-pence a yard. Before I could well give them an answer, Mr. Rich came and asked them to walk into the back shop; I went into the back shop with them; they sat down on the other side of the counter, and asked for some small beer; I went up stairs and fetched some beer; when I returned, a customer came into the fore shop, and I left Mr. Rich alone with them. While I was serving the customer, a lady came in, and Mr. Rich left them to speak to the lady, and desired I would go backwards. I had not been long with them before the shortest of the two went out; Mr. Rich had sold them fifteen yards of silk. I put it up in a paper; I gave it to the shortest, but they said it was for the prisoner. The shortest paid for it. The prisoner asked her to lend her the money as she had not enough, and the shortest paid the whole. While the shortest was out, I asked the prisoner a great many questions; they pretended to be market women. She had a round basket which she put upon the counter. She said that they used the Fleet-Market, that she came from Hammersmith. She was looking for a colour to please the other one against she came back. She returned in about ten minutes, crying, and said she had lost some garden stuff she had left at the corner of the market, that it was ten shillings loss to her. The prisoner desired her not to cry, and told her she would be at half the loss. They pitched on another gown which was cut off and laid on the window. They were to call for it in the morning, and they went out into Artillery-street, towards Artillery-lane. We missed two whole pieces of silk, containing about ten yards, before they had been gone ten minutes; there had not been any body else in the shop. We have never found them again.</p>
               <p>When was the prisoner taken up? - On Wednesday last, I believe; this was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050070"></xptr>Tuesday fortnight before I saw her at the office in Litchfield-street, when she was taken up; I knew her again immediately. She denied knowing any thing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen her before she came to your shop? - Not to my knowledge. I am very certain the prisoner is one of them.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Rich here? - No.</p>

               <p>I am servant at a grocer's and chandler's shop, in Artillery-lane. On the 21st of March, the prisoner and a shorter woman came into our shop. The prisoner asked for a halfpenny worth of small beer; she asked to stop while the other went out to look after a basket of spinage, which, she said, they had lost. I asked her to sit down in the parlour; as she sat there, she pulled a roll of silk, without any paper over it, out of her pocket, and put it in her apron. The other came in soon after; she pulled out some pink-coloured silk from under her cloak, and left it on the table; I had it in my hand. I went after her to the door with it, when they went out. I described it afterwards to Mr. Rich.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the same person? - I saw her again on Wednesday night at Litchfield-street, and am perfectly sure she is the same person. I remember her, and the tone of her voice.</p>

               <p>I was employed to nurse the prisoner. I have been with her almost a month; it will be a month next Monday, since I first went to her. She lives in Portpool-lane.</p>
               <p>What has been her state of health? - I look upon it to be a lingering labour. She has been extremely ill; she had a midwife with her, who, I suppose, is here. I did not lie there of nights. I remember St. Patrick's day, the 17th of March, it is my husband's birth-day; she was ill some days before that. She was never out from that time while I was with her, which was generally from five or six in the morning, till seven or eight at night.</p>
               <p>(She called two other witnesses, who deposed she was ill about that time, and very seldom out.)</p>

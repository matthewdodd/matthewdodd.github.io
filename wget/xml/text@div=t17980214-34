             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I live at Saltpetre-bank, I am a bricklayer: I know the two prisoners, Frewin and Bowers: I let George Bowers a whole house, at three shillings and three-pence a week, and Frewin lived with him, Bowers paid me the rent; Frewin had the one pair of stairs, and Bowers told me that he lived in the first floor, and slept in the garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Frewin ever with Bowers when he told you which rooms they separately occupied? - A. Yes, he was, more than once or twice; there is no number to the house, it is at the corner of a court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long is it since you let this house to this man? - A. It might be four months back.</p>
               <p>Q. They are both soldiers you know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know they were on duty at the Tower, when they were taken into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say, of your own knowledge, that they have occupied that house lately, before that time? - A. I saw him knock at the door about five in the morning, and saw him go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that Frewin was with Bowers, when he told you? - A. Yes; I told him he had better not have the house, as he would have to pay something more than he had done before, and he told me he had got a comrade that would have his first floor; Frewin was with him at that time, and he has said that several times in the presence of Frewin; Frewin desired, after he was in custody, that I would let his brother-in-law have his things, I went to the house, and I found in a box, in Frewin's apartment, this horse-pistol, (producing it;) afterwards, Bowers's wife wished to have her property; I took a stove out of the fire-place, but did not pull down the hob; I went to let the house a few days after, and in pulling down the hob, I found these keys all pushed underneath, (producing a parcel of picklock keys;) this was in Bowers's apartment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. This was some time after the prisoners had left the house? - A. Yes; some days after they were taken.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an officer of Bow-street; I was with the last witness at Bowers and Frewin's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the first-floor? - A. Yes; I found two books, two volumes of Smollett's works, a blue coat, two pair of stockings, and a silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Burford.) Look at these two books? - A. These are the first and sixth volumes; I have brought the second with me, they correspond exactly in the binding, they are the two volumes that I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that blue coat? - A. I believe this to be mine; the lining of the right-hand pocket is wore more than the other, by the wearing of a snuff-box, the linings have been taken out of the sleeves, or I could have proved it with more certainty, because I always have, to all my coats, a piece of silk at the bottom of the sleeve; I lost stockings of this pattern, but the mark is taken out, this pocket handkerchief I cannot swear positively to.</p>

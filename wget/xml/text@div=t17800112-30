The prisoner took the things, mentioned in the indictment, last Monday was a-week; she lodged in my two-pair-of-stairs back room. She took 4 china coffee pots, 2 china dishes, 4 china plates, 4 tea-cups and saucers, and a china tea-pot stand; I lost one pair of silk stockings; and I missed 20 l. at several times. On Sunday was three-weeks, I had six shillings in my pocket; I lay with her, and about an hour after I laid down, she took it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Why do you charge her with taking them? - There was nobody in the house but her, and they were found upon her. I found the coachman that drove her away; and he drove me to the place; he searched her lodgings and found up stairs the stand. I felt her hand in my pocket when she lay with me; she had three shillings, and she gave me the next morning, when I charged her with it, two sixpences out of it; she said she would not leave me while I had a bed to lie on.</p>
               <p>She said that out of friendship to you? - No; she said possession was nine points of the law, and she would not go.</p>
               <p>You turned her out at last did you? - I told her I was going to move, I was stripped so bare.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I believe you was so bare of money that you was obliged to sell your things to pay your rent? - I was.</p>
               <p>This woman lived with you some time? - Five months.</p>
               <p>What business did she carry on? - None.</p>
               <p>What business did you carry on? - The coal trade, while I could; I lost forty pounds by her.</p>
               <p>The morning she packed up to leave your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120050"></xptr>lodgings, you was present was not you? - No; I was below she was above.</p>
               <p>Had she bought any china of you before this? - Yes, half a guinea's worth.</p>
               <p>You did not know where she was going? - No; she desired the coachman not to tell where she was put down.</p>
               <p>When you was before the magistrate you did not mention any thing about this money? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>I believe you sent to this young woman and told her, if she would give you some money you would not go on with this prosecution? - No; she offered me a guinea not to go on with it.</p>
               <p>Court. What value do you put upon what you found in the house where she was? - About five shillings.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Are they here? - No.</p>

             stopped on the first floor. I said I had a search warrant to search her place. What for? said she. I said some china you have stolen from Mrs. Davis. She said she did not know that she had got any. I opened the door, and called for Mrs. Davis; she came up; when she came into the room she had four cups and saucers in her hand which she got from the people on the first floor; they said she had left them there. I examined all the prisoner's things over, and found some more china in her trunks, which Mrs. Davis said was her's. Some time after Mrs. Davis said, I want two china dishes. Said the prisoner, if the constable will go along with me I will find them. She went into Covent garden; to a woman in the market who went home and gave her the two dishes, which she gave Mrs. Davis. The prisoner said she had left them at that house a day or two before, and that she had only just come to her lodging.</p>
               <p>Did she say they were her's? - No; she said they belonged to Mrs. Davis. When Mrs. Davis saw them, she said they belonged to her, and the other delivered them up directly.</p>
               <p>Did she say she had bought them? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The four cups and saucers were not in this woman's room at all? - No.</p>

               <p>The only piece of china found in her room was the stand for the tea-pot? - Four coffee cups were found in her trunk, and that stand for the tea-pot. They are trifling things, but they were found in her trunk.</p>
               <p>The prisoner claimed no property in these two dishes? - No; she said they were Mrs. Davis's.</p>
               <p>Court. What said Mrs. Davis to her, did she charge her with having taken them away? - Yes. The prisoner said she did not know how she had taken them away, but said she had got them at such a place in Covent-garden, and would return them.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. You could never have found out these dishes if she had not told you where they were? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutrix. You said the other witness found these china cups? - They were in the first floor.</p>
               <p>You said the constable found them? - He found the china up stairs, the coffee-cups and stand; the tea-cups were in the first floor.</p>

               <p>JOHN STARKEY. I live in John-street, Brick-lane. On the 7th of September, about half-past nine o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18271025-201-crimeloc1155">Brick-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you not so drunk that you could not see at all? A. I walked from Smithfield without assistance; the fair was just over; I saw my watch safe in Long-lane; I was the worse for liquor; I will swear I felt it drawn from me in Brick-lane - I did not see Calley near me - it happened ten or twelve yards from St. John-street, in Brick-lane, on the right hand side.</p>

            . I was in Brick-lane, and saw the two prisoners (whom I knew), coming along with Starkey, who appeared very drunk - they were coming up towards me - Graham on his right hand, and Stone on his left - they went a few yards beyond me, on the other side of the way - I looked to see what they were going to do, and saw Graham pinion the prosecutor's arms - Stone drew out the watch, and drew it up his own sleeve with a jerk - he passed on directly from the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you gave an alarm? A. Yes; I alarmed my brother, and called to a man who came out of the Hare public-house - I particularly noticed Stone - he passed three or four lights, with his face towards me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I keep a fruit-stall at the corner of King-street, Brick-lane, which is less than twenty yards from where the robbery was committed - I had come from my stall to the other side of the way - I told a man, who came out to take the prosecutor from the door - it was half-past nine o'clock - the watch does not sit till ten - I went to the Hare to ask them if they knew the prosecutor - I knew the man who took it; I went next morning to the constable, and to Worship-street on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you often go to the Police-office? A. No; only when I have a call; I never applied there for employ; the prisoners ran different ways; I saw Stone about a fortnight after, and Graham two days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not send for an officer and have them taken? A. There are such dreadful characters about there, if a man dare to interfere, he would be crushed under foot; Graham had a white jacket on; I did not notice whether he had a hat or cap on; my brother was against the public-house.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him robbed? A. No; he said he was robbed; he turned round, and said to another gentleman, "That is the person who robbed me;" I saw neither of the prisoners there; a young man and a lad were leading him; when I spoke, the tall young man let go; he said immediately that he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take these men? A. Because he at first said it was another man - I knew Graham before, and if he had been there I should have seen him. I have been a watchman nine years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furrier, carrying on business at 25, Goldsmith Street, Whitechapel—I work for Messrs. Christy; they order caps, and I make them up—I buy the fur myself—during Easter week I went with a person named Reynolds to the prisoner's public-house, at Whitechapel—I saw a sealskin cap lying about in the parlour, of my own make—I asked the prisoner whether he purchased it at Christy's—he said, "Is it your own work?"—I said, "Yes"—he did not say whether he bought it at Christy's—he knew I worked for them—Mr. Reynolds is the prisoner's cousin—the prisoner they asked me if I could alter the cap for him into a turban shape—I took it home and altered it—he asked me if I would buy five sealskin caps—I looked at them, and found they were my own make—I asked what he wanted for them—he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would not take them then, and went home to alter his cap—I went and made a communication to Messrs. Christy—they gave me the money to go and purchase the caps—I went and saw the prisoner; he showed me the five caps again—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for them—I charge Messrs. Christy 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for some of them, without the lining—I took them to Christy's after I bought them—on the Friday following, the prisoner came to my place, and said, "I have got a new lot of cape for you"—I went and saw him on the Saturday—the caps were brought from up stairs, in a shawl, or something of that sort—there were eighteen sealskin caps, and twenty-eight Balmoral caps—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for the eighteen caps, and 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the Balmorals—he showed me a sealskin waistcoat, and said I must take that as well, as it was of no use to him, and I gave him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I paid him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the whole—on 12th July he came to me, and said he had some more caps—I went to his place, and saw thirteen more sealskin—he wanted 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more for those—I said I could not purchase them then, and went out—the officers went in and took him—those caps were lined—I called his attention to the lining being rubbed in one of the caps—he said, "I did not do it"—I asked him once for a receipt—he said he had the receipt of his own, but he gave none, and I did not ask him again—Reynolds was only present on the first occasion.</p>

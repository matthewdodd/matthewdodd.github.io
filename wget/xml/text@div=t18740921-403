                  </hi>. I am single and lire at 18, Goldington Street—about 12 o'clock on the night of 27th August I was in the George public-house near the Euston station—I saw the female prisoner in the next compartment—I had known her before—she came round to me and we had a quartern of gin, for which I paid—I had about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket—she saw me take the money out of my cloak pocket to pay for it and put it back again—I then came out as they were closing—I proceeded a little way down Seymour Street, and left her when I saw her talking to the male prisoner at the corner of Seymour Street—I did not know him—I crossed over by St. Pancras Church further down on the other side of the way, a little below the church and the male prisoner came across the road—I stood still for a minute or two and He gave me a blow on the chest—I was in the act of getting up again and was on the kerb, when he made another hit at me, and forced his hand into my pocket—this mud on my cloak was caused by my falling—my right pocket was hanging out as I ran to the constable to give him in charge—he also made a kick at me—as I was getting up, the female prisoner was at his side and said "Have you got it?"—I picked up my bonnet, and by that time they had got away across the road and down Seymour Street—I looked for my money and my pocket handkerchief—I did not lose sight of them—Butcher said he would knock my brains out if I followed him—I followed them to Ossulston Street and gave them into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 159). I was on duty on" 27th August in Seymour Street, Somers Town—I saw the prosecutrix there and the two prisoners—I came up the corner of Chapel Street, and heard the prose<lb></lb>cutrix say "As soon as I see a police-constable I will give you in custody"—I went and asked what was the matter—she said "I give these two in your custody for knocking me down and robbing me of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "How did they knock you down?"—she said "The male prisoner struck me in the chest"—there was mud on the back of her waterproof—I told them they would have to come to the station along with me—the prosecutrix was sober, but very much excited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I searched them, and found 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Batcher, and I was found on Clarke by the female searcher after we got to the station—a third party, a woman, was between 500 and 600 yards away, and the money might have been passed—I saw nothing of the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Clarke's Defence.</hi> On 26th August I met the prosecutrix. We have walked the streets together and shared our money together. She sent word to me that she was sorry to place me in this position, and knew I knew nothing about it. I gave her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to take her mother brandy and grapes in the Hospital, and I have been living with her some time and she is a prostitute. I cannot say why she gave me into custody. We had been drinking from 9.30 till 12 at the George public-house; I spent 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with her there. She was drinking with a man who keeps a coffee-house, a brothel keeper. I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and spent it with her, and she denied having a halfpenny in her pocket. She treats me and I treat her; in fact, we never leave one another. I stopped a fortnight with her, three weeks before she gave me into custody. She has been convicted several times; six months for stealing,' and two years for robbing a woman of her shawl, and some time previous to my being taken into custody she was to be apprehended for beating another woman, and even her mother has been convicted of felony. It is nothing but malice her doing this. Is it likely I should call a youth and ask him to pick her pocket. She was intoxicated, and he pushed her and she fell down.</p>

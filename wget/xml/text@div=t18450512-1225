                  </hi>. I live in York-row, Walworth. In 1843 I carried on the business of a baker—I ceased to do so on the 31st of Dec. 1844.—I was brought up a farmer—the prisoner came into my service in 1843—he was to bake bread for me—it was part of his duty to carry out bread to my customers, but not without my leave—he had a guinea a-week, and a quartern of bread a-day, and a quartern of flour on Saturday nights—he continued in my service till the 25th of April, 1844—he never had his</p>

               <p>bread before six o'clock on other nights, and from eight till ten on Satur<lb></lb>day nights—on other'nights he left work a little after six, and on Saturday nights at ten—the bread he had was stale, and he had the flour on Saturday nights, from eight till ten o'clock, in a bag with my name marked on it—he generally had a baking of his own on Sundays, and always a batter-pudding under the meat—the bag that he had the flour I in on Saturday night was produced on Sunday over the meat—Mrs. Hunt made a communication to me, in consequence of which the prisoner was given into custody—I did not allow him a halfpenny a loaf on bread that he sold—I never gave him permission to open accounts with persons without my leave—I was not aware that any bread was being supplied to Mrs. Hunt—the prisoner left my service on the 25th of April, 1844—a day or two afterwards I found four quarterns of bread in a pump, mildewed—I had no other servant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Hunt. We live in George-street—I have known the prisoner about nine yean—in the beginning of Sept., 1843, he said Mr. Bush allowed him a halfpenny a loaf for the bread he sold, which made it better for Mr. Bush and for him, and he asked us to take bread of him—my husband said it did not matter who he had hit bread of, as he paid for it—we had not dealt with Mr. Bush before, nor did we know him—from that time we dealt with the prisoner—we had sometimes a quartern and a half of bread in a day, some<lb></lb>times less, about six or seven loaves in a week—I took more on a Saturday than other days—I always had new bread—he brought the bread in a morning, and on Satur<lb></lb>day, between four and five o'clock, he brought a quartern of flour—he continued to supply me from Sept. till the 26th of April following—these are the bills—on the 13th of April here is a charge for a loaf of bread and a quartern of flour—I had them of the prisoner—for about the first three weeks I paid for the bread and things as I had them—the prisoner then wished me to discontinue it—he said it would serve Mr. Bush, and he would have the overplus for himself—from the time I began to deal with him till I ceased, I never saw Mr. Bush—I paid the prisoner on account 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. again—last Friday week the prisoner had summoned my husband to the Court of Requests—I had not the money to pay it, and I went to Mr. Bush to see if I could talk to him to inter<lb></lb>cede with the prisoner to get time—the prisoner had summoned us in his own name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There is an execution out against your husband, is there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is—I had known the prisoner nine years—he had been our tenant, and lived next door but one to us all the time this was going on—I have paid him three sums on this account since he left Mr. Bush—the rest he summoned us for—my husband went before the Com<lb></lb>missioners, and they ordered execution—I then went to Mr. Bush to intercede with the prisoner—my husband is not out of the way—our house is not shut up—they have not been trying to take our goods under the execution—they have not issued process—our door is not kept shut—I</p>

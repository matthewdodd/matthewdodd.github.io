On the 5th of March, I went to bed at twelve o'clock at night - Turner was up last; I saw that all the doors and windows on the ground floor were secure. I heard a noise about twenty minutes or half-past one o'clock, like footsteps on the stairs leading from the kitchen into the parlour; I only heard it for a few minutes, and then heard Turner open the window of the adjoining room, and call the watchman - I did not leave my room. Turner came to me; I gave him a light, and know nothing more. No property was taken. Clutterbuck has been an occasional servant in the house. I keep the Duke of York public-house.

            . I am servant to Mrs. Smith, and saw every thing safe when I went to bed. I did not see whether the kitchen was safe - the front of the house was fastened. A little after one o'clock I heard a noise, as if somebody was breaking, or had broken into the house; I cannot say whether I heard them in the house. I alarmed the watchman, and asked him to look round to see if all was safe, and saw him go round; he went for more watchmen. The noise continued for about five minutes. I got a light from my mistress, went down, and let the watchmen in at the front door - we went into the skettle-ground to see if we could see anybody - we found a small window in the back kitchen broken, and marks of its having been wrenched; it swings open, and there were marks between the sash and frame, as if it had been forced - the kitchen door was open. There were footmarks on the kitchen floor, of more than one person having been there; it appeared as if their shoes had been off, for there were prints of their toes, as if their feet were wet, which made the marks; there was a jar broken in the yard. I saw nothing of the prisoners.</p>

I went to the back door, and was in Nottingham-place, and another watchman went into the house - in three or four minutes I heard the prisoners coming towards me; I immediately sprang my rattle, and Dennis came to my assistance. I opened the door leading into the skettle-ground of the house; it was unfastened. I found Brimmell and Wales there, behind the door in the passage leading into the skettle-ground; they might be fifty yards from the house, but within the same fence as the house is in; it is a private passage belonging to the house. I secured them, and asked how many more there were of them; Wales said there was another one, but he had made his escape over the wall. I took them to the watch-house; they were searched, but nothing found on them.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. In consequence of information I went in pursuit of Clutterbuck, and took him in the Commercial-road, about seven o'clock that morning (the 6th of March). He had only one shoe on. I neither threatened or promised him. I did not mention to him what I took him for. I asked him why he was guilty of a crime of that description, after living with Mrs. Smith - he said it was Brimmell's fault, that Brimmell had advised him to do it, that he (Brimmell) had got hold of the pot-boy who usually lived there, and wanted him to be one of the party, but he refused, but told him where the keys were kept, and where the copper and silver were kept. He said that Wales brought a chisel, and that he himself (Clutterbuck) broke the window open, and got in himself first, and Brimmell followed him, without their shoes, that Wales stopped in the skettleground the while, and that he went into the skettle-ground in the evening, and secreted himself there.

We went to the house between nine and ten o'clock, and went through the house and down into back-yard. We remained there till one o'clock; we then made an attempt to get into the house. I forced open the kitchen window with a small chisel that Wales brought with him. Brimmell stood by me at the time, and Wales was in the skettle-ground. I then got into the kitchen through the window, and Brimmell got in with me. I went up stairs, and then returned to the kitchen, and Brimmell and I went out by the door. I afterwards got away over the garden wall, leaving Brimmell and Wales in the alley. - The prisoner Wales declines saying anything."</p>
               <p>CLUTTERBUCK's Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, suffer me respectfully to state to your honourable Court, that when Stone, the constable took me into custody in the Commercial-road, he accused me of breaking into the house, telling me to inform him all I knew, for he would clear me, and shew me mercy, if I did but tell him the truth. I very naturally felt shocked at so dreadful and foul an accusation - under such particular embarrasment, I was not sensible of what I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070014"></xptr>did say. But it becomes me now as a man, to speak the truth candidly, and not endeavour to justify myself in any manner by falsehoods or prevarication. I know the two prisoners at the bar, and was in their company the same night, but I left them about nine o'clock, to return home. Respecting what has been deduced in evidence, I most humbly protest my innocence, and beg leave to repeat again, that my being taken into custody on a charge so dreadful, the threat of Stone, and his offering to clear me and shew me mercy, put me in that distressed state of mind, that I neither knew what I said or did. Should you consider me as guilty. I supplicate for mercy; but, fully on the other hand anticipate that you will find me innocent.</p>

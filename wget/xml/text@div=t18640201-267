I am a brother of the last witness—I had two penny bets with the prisoner—I threw a penny on the floor, but he dis<lb></lb>puted it, abused me, and called me such filthy names that my brother told him he ought to be ashamed of himself—he then began blackguarding my brother, and shoving his head into his face—he then went round two or three people, put his hand into his pocket, opened a knife, darted past my left arm, and my brother called out that he was stabbed—I am certain my brother had only shoved him—he then went some steps backwards—I went to seize him, and he made a stab at me with the bloody knife—I was so frigh<lb></lb>tened that I went back a step or two, and he put it in his pocket, rubbed it up and down, to rub the blood off, and then threw it to the other end of the skittle-ground—I picked it up, put it in my pocket, and seized him—there was a little blood on it when I picked it up, but I drew my finger over it and shut it up—I did not strike the prisoner.</p>

I am waiter at this ground—after this dispute had arisen, the prisoner used very bad language, and shoved his head in the pro<lb></lb>secutor's face, who shoved him away—it was a shove, not a blow—the prisoner then went back three or four yards, put his hand in his left-hand trousers pocket, pulled out a shut-up knife, and opened it—I caught hold of his left arm and said, "Don't be a fool, "but he got away from me, rushed past two or three people, stabbed the prosecutor, and threw the knife away—the prosecutor said, "I am stabbed"—the prisoner said, "Yes, and God blind me I will again"—they had been drinking and smoking all the even<lb></lb>ing, but were perfectly sober—the prisoner had been playing at skittles for several hours.</p>

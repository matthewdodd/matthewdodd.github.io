                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 29th of March, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I went into No. 12, Norfolk-street, Southwark, to search for stolen property—the street door was open—Annett and Church went with me to the door of the back attic—we found the door fastened inside by a piece of wood put into a sort of iron dowell—we forced it open, and, on entering, found the three prisoners there—Freeman was sitting by the side of the fire—I saw him put his hand on this pipkin, which was on the fire—he took hold of it, turned it over, and spilled some of the contents into the fire—I could distinctly see it contained metal—I went and laid hold of it, then went buck to the door to prevent their going out, and picked up this file—the other officers secured the prisoners—as I entered the room I saw Young with his arm throw something out of the window, which was open, and which looked into the back yard—after taking them to the station, we all returned to the back yard—we had been absent about twenty minutes—I observed the window through which Young had thrown something, and in the back yard of No. 19, Pepper-street, which is the next yard, I found a counterfeit penny piece—I did not see Murphy do anything—I saw Young distinctly throw something through the window.</p>

I went with Harris on the 29th to this house—I saw Harris, on going into the room, take the pot off the fire, and take it to<lb></lb>wards the door—Freeman was sitting nearest to the door, close to the fire, and had a mould in his hand, which I produce—I took up a penny piece which dropped from the mould in his hand, with part of the <hi rend="italic">get on</hi> it—it was very hot, I could scarcely hold it—the moment I took hold of him he broke the mould between his finger and thumb—I saw Young get up, and throw some pieces of metal, apparently about the size of penny pieces, from his right hand, through the window, which was open—I saw them fall into the yard of No. 20, Pepper-street, about five yards from the house—when I entered the room Murphy was sitting close to the window—they all sat close together—it is a very small room—when I went in Murphy got up—I secured the pri<lb></lb>soners, searched the room, and found these coloured penny pieces on the floor—I found this spoon on the window cill, and a bag containing blue—these pincers were on the floor, near where Murphy had sat—this bag was damp—I found this knife on the hob, with a piece of metal attached to it—I took the prisoners to the station, returned, and found four penny pieces, coloured like copper, in the yard of No. 20, Pepper-street, where I had seen Young throw them—Freeman was looking for something—I asked what he was looking for—he said, for the lock and key—I said, "Do you belong to the room?—he said, "Yes"—I saw a padlock in the room-Freeman showed me another padlock—he said that was not the one they locked the place with.</p>

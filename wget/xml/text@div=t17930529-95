On Friday last the 31st of May, between the hours of twelve and one o'clock, I was behind my counter, I found my window had been broke, and a silver fruit knife gone; I keep a hardware shop; my wife was present at the time, she said, you had better take the things out of the window and send for a glazier, and have the window mended; just before dinner my wife went out to see if she could get a knife out by the hole that was broke, and she could but just touch them; we went into dinner, we had not been at dinner three minutes before we saw the prisoner at the bar, he looked first at one part of the shop and then at another; he then looked up and down the street, I went out at the back door and came into the street that way and Mrs. Jones walked forwards toward the shop, when I came to him he had got a hook in his hand, and was trying to take one of the other knives out of the window, a silver handled fruit knife, he drew it from the situation where it was before, about two inches and a half, he had removed it an inch out of the window; I thought he laid hold of it; I seized him instantly, and took him into the shop myself, and when I took him into the shop he had the hook in his hand, some way or another he dropped the hook out of his hand, that I did not find the hook to produce it when I came before the Lord Mayor, but Saturday morning when I was sweeping the shop I found the hook; when I came into the shop Mrs. Jones went out and pushed the knife into the window as far as she could; I am very positive it was removed, because when I went to dinner I observed where it lay, and I was so positive with respect to his having the hook on him, that I had him taken up stairs and searched to find it, but did not find it till the next day.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness. I was in the shop at the time that Mr. Jones perceived the window broke and a knife gone; this was before I went to dinner; I went then into the street to see if I could take a knife out with my finger; I could reach one with my finger, but I could not take one out of the hole it was so very small; I wished Mr. Jones to take the knives out of the window; we went into the parlour the back part of the shop, we never took our eyes from the window till we saw the boy come up to the window, he looked in to see if any body was in the shop, and he looked up and down the street, and then he put his hand to the hole of the window, and attempted to get a knife out; Mr. Jones went out of the private door and catched hold of him before he got the knife quite out, and brought him in; I went out into the street and shoved the knife back again to where he had got it from, it was drawn through the hole about an inch, there was one gone besides this, which I have never seen since; I missed that before I sat down to dinner, we missed the first between twelve and one, and the boy came about twenty minutes after one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was looking in at the window when this gentleman laid hold of me, and took me into the shop.</p>

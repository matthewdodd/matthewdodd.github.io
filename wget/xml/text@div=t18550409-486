                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the employ of Richard Hall, of Kingsbury, Middlesex. A person named Tomkins has a field adjoining his, and next to that is a field belonging to a person named Bolton—there is a gap in the fence, which separates Bolton's field from Mr. Hall's—Mr. Tom<lb></lb>kins has been aware of that—I have impounded the sheep on other occasions, and on 18th March I found them in the field, and proceeded to impound them—I drove them along Bacon's-lane, to the pound—when I came to a turning near the Green Man beer shop, Tomkins came up from the beer shop, and stopped the sheep—there were eighteen of them—the prisoner, and Richard and William Miller, came from the beer shop about ten minutes after Tomkins—Tomkins ran before the sheep and stopped them—he then laid hold of my collar—about ten minutes afterwards he let go of my collar, ran before the sheep, and turned them back, as I was striving to drive them into the pound—in a few minutes he <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> me again by the collar, and struck me on the back of my neck five times—the prisoner was present then—as I was getting up Tomkins kicked me on the loins—I never</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Green Man beer shop, at Kingsbury. Tomkins lodged at my place—on Sunday, 18th March, he was at my house, dining with me—some sheep went past the end of the road—he got up, and said, "There go my sheep," and went out to look after them—after he went out, Richard Miller came and ordered some ale for his master—Windsor and William Miller were at the door when I got up—Windsor was at the step of the door—I did not see him in the house—I saw them all three go off the step of the door, and then I looked through the parlour window, and saw them going up the road.</p>

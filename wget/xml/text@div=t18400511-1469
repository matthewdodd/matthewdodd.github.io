                  </hi>. I live at Southam, in Warwickshire, and am a cattle-dealer. On Sunday, the 5th of April, as I was going to Barnet-fair, I left my cart at the Bald-faced Stag public-house at Finchley—I have known the prisoner a year or two, he had done jobs for me—he was near enough to hear the direction I gave the ostler at the Stag—I left my cart there because the pony set to kicking, and I could not get on—I told the ostler to take care of it till I called for it—after that the prisoner went on to Barnet with me—he remained with me two or three hours—I then left him at Barnet, and I went on—the value of my cart was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the harness and collar were worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave the prisoner no authority in any way to sell the cart for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in John-street, Portland-town. The prisoner came to me on Friday, the 10th of April, and said he had a cart and harness for sale at the Bald-faced Stag public-house at Finchley.</p>
               <p>—I had a horse, and I borrowed a cart—the prisoner and I and two more men went to the Bald-faced Stag, and saw the cart—it was a small one, and would not suit me—the prisoner tied the cart behind mine, and brought it away to my house—there was a harness and a collar in it—when we got to Portland-town I bought the harness for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and let the cart be at my stable—he said he wanted to sell it, as he was going into the country—on the Tuesday following he came again, and brought Edwards—he sold the cart to him, and Edwards took it away.</p>

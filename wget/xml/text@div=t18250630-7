On the 4th of June, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was coming from Spitalfields, and was accosted by the prisoner Davis soon after I turned the corner of <placeName id="t18250630-7-crimeloc36">Wentworth-street</placeName>

I walked on - she still followed me, and wished me to give her something to drink; I said, No: she then caught hold of my left arm, and tried to drag me into a court, but I got away, and ran over to the other side of the way; she ran after me, and thrust her hands into my pocket; I resisted, and endeavoured to get away as fast as I could; Ferris and another came up - I struggled, and endeavoured to get away. Davis pushed me, and knocked my hat off, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300007"></xptr>in running to save my hat she endeavoured to push me down on the ground, but I saved myself by a bar before a window. Ferris came up, using very bad expressions - she said,</p>
               <p>"So help me God, you must satisfy the woman" - they all three pinioned my arms down, and broke two buttons of my waistcoat; Davis took my money out of my breeches pocket - there were eight sovereigns and four half-sovereigns wrapped up in a 5 l. and a 30 l. Bank note, taken from my right hand pocket; I had a purse containing 8 s. 9 d., and an old subpoena in my other pocket, which Ferris took out. I had received the money for my employers, at Masterman's bank that day, and was going home. I am sure these are the women - they were taken on the Monday following. I have not recovered a farthing. I recollected having seen Davis about Whitechapel before; it was quite light: I am sure they are the women. I was quite sober. They ran round different courts, and I lost them. I immediately went to Lambeth-street-Office, and gave information. I saw them in custody on the Monday, and am positive of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Had you called any where? A. I called at several houses, but at no public-house - I swear that I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not speak to Davis first, and offer to go with her? A. No. The money was safe when I was in Crispin-street, two streets from where I met them, and I saw them take it out; I saw it in their hands: it was a very fine evening. I was not confused. I swear to them positively; I cannot be mistaken. I called Stop thief! but not a soul would come to my assistance.</p>

            . I live at No. 33, Rose-lane, Spitalfields. Some days before the 4th of June the prisoner Ferris had a violent cold, and on the 4th of June, between twelve and one o'clock, she came into my apartment, which joins hers, and was in my room from then till after nine o'clock, unwell. I rubbed her neck with hartshorn and oil, as she had lumps in it. Rose-lane leads into Wentworth-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is she? A. I did not know she was one of those characters; her room is on the same floor as mine, but I was not acquainted with her; I washed for her.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you for remembering the 4th of June? A. It was on Saturday. I heard of the depredation on the Monday. I went to Lambeth-street, but the Magistrate said it would be best for me to state this here.</p>
               <p>Q. What made her stop so long, you not being particularly acquainted with her? A. Her's is a back room, and she was lonesome, and she was ill; I cannot tell how she gets her livelihood. I have lodged there nine months - she has been there two months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner FERRIS. I stopped in her room as she was teaching me how to make a basket.</p>

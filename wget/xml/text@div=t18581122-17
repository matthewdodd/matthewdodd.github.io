                  </hi>. I am a milkman, and live at Noble-street, Clerkenwell—I was in Lower-road, Islington, on Saturday, 30th October last, about 11 o'clock at night; and the female prisoner asked me if I would stand a drop of gin, and I stood a quartern of gin—alter that we came from there and she said she should like a drop of beer—she asked me to go to the Pied Bull public-house and we did, and had a drop of beer there—I then had my purse, containing 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in an old tobacco pouch in my left hand pocket—the male prisoner was standing at one corner in the public-house—he came up and said, "Have you got any money?" I made no answer—he put his hand in my pocket, and as I was trying to get his hand from my pocket, he up with his hand and struck me in the face, and he and the female prisoner pushed me out at the door—the female prisoner pushed me out—I cannot say what became of them—I came out and stood with my head against the post, and my nose and mouth were bleeding; I went across to a policeman and told him of it—I had my money and purse before I went into the public-house—I had halfpence to pay for the beer—I had the purse in my pocket, and immediately I came out I mined it—I was not drunk—I had had part of a quartern of gin, and a drop of beer.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many women did you go into the house with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two females—I met them coming through Compton-passage; and coming along the females asked me to stand a drop of gin, and I did—the female prisoner and her sister were together at first—it was past 11 o'clock—before this I had left my father, who lives in Compton-passage, and had gone to my wife—that was before I met the females—I had left my wife because she was going to stop up all night with a person that was ill, and I was then going home—my wife did not know anything about this—the females said they had just come from a hard day's work at the ironing-board, and would I stand a drop of gin? and I said, "Yes"—I only went into two public-houses with them—the York was the first one—I did not see the male prisoner there—we had a quartern of gin to drink there between us—I was only in two public-houses—I had had some ale before I met them—I swear that I had not been in a public-house with any other women—it had gone 11 when this occurred in the Pied Bull, it was between 11 and 12—it had gone 1 o'clock when I gave them in charge—I gave the policemen a description of the persons, and they said they would find them for me; and I was waiting there from between 11 and 12 till 1, till the policemen brought them to me, I was not in a public-house—when I went into the public-house, the male prisoner was standing at the corner with his arm on the bar—I did not notice whether he was drinking—I did not hear any of the women say anything to him—I believe the female offered</p>

               <p>him the pot and he drank out of it—the two females were together—I did not notice which of them offered it to him—I do not know whether either of them said anything to him or not, but one handed him the beer—I did not go up to him and say, "What right have you to drink beer out of that pot?" or anything of that sort—I did not go near him at all—he came up to me and asked me if I had got any money—that was after he had drank the beer—I swear I did not speak to him—I did not ask the woman why she offered him some beer—there were not many persons there at the time—I do not know whether it was a barman or a barwoman there—I swear I do not know whether it was a man or a woman behind the bar; I did not take notice—when this case was before the magistrate, the barman was sent for by the magistrate, and he came—I do not know whether he is here to<lb></lb>day—the magistrate sent for him after he had heard my evidence—my nose was bleeding; the policeman saw it—I swear that after I saw this man drink, I did not go up to him and use some language to him, nor did he and I exchange blows—I cannot tell whether the person behind the bar saw what he did to me or not—I saw the female prisoner again after I had left, and before I gave the man into custody—she was on the opposite side of the way—I left them in the public-house and went across the road—I swear that after that, and before I gave him into custody, I did not see the man again that night—I did not say to him, "I say old fellow, I'm d—d if I have not lost 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the company which I was in last," or anything like that—he did not say to me, "More fool you"—I believe there is a pie-shop near there on the other side—I did not see him go and get a pie there—was waiting about for nearly an hour and a half, before I gave him into custody and then the policeman brought him to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman N</hi>, 134). On the evening of 30th October I saw both the prisoners—I saw the female in company with the prosecutor shortly before 11, or about 11 o'clock, together, in High-street, Clerkenwell—I heard the female prisoner ask the prosecutor to come to the Pied Bull public-house—at that time the male prisoner was standing about ten yards distant—they went away in the direction of the Pied Bull, and the male prisoner followed after them—I saw the prosecutor about two hours after<lb></lb>wards—he made a complaint to me—he described the persons who had robbed him—in consequence of that description, I apprehended the two prisoners about 1 o'clock, in Chapel-street—they were both together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was it you first saw the prosecutor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 11 o'clock—I did not see him afterwards till near I—the male prisoner was in Chapel-street when I apprehended him, a short distance from the Pied Bull—there is a pie-shop not far from it—he lives in a court opposite—he was about 400 or 500 yards from there when I apprehended him—the female prisoner lives in the same court—the Pied Bull is a very respectable house—it is a licensed house, rather on a large scale, and a great many persons about the neighbourhood frequent it—the male prisoner did not seem to have been drinking at all when I apprehended him—he said he knew nothing at all about it—he said he had never taken the man's money—he did not say there had been a row between them at any time—he did not say that the prosecutor had insulted him, or anything like that—he said he had not seen him at all—I swear that the prosecutor was not present—I</p>

               <p>took him to the prosecutor at once—he said he had seen no man; been in company with no man—I did not tell him where he was charged with rob<lb></lb>bing him, till afterwards—I should say it was about twenty minutes after I had seen the prosecutor that I apprehended the prisoner—this case was remanded once before the Magistrate.</p>

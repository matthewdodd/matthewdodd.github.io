                  </hi>. I am one of the messengers to the Court of Bankruptcy—I produce the proceedings against William Buckwell, the prisoner—the petition for adjudication is dated 1st February, 1862; it is the petition of Messrs. Bowstead &amp; Co., of 34, Craven-street, Charing-cross—the adjudica<lb></lb>tion is dated 4th February—it is my duty to see that the adjudication is duly gazetted, and it was so—the choice of assignees was to take place on 22d February, at 11 o'clock; that would be the first meeting—the second meeting, appointed for the last examination was 1st April—the bankrupt surrendered on 5th February—I find a memorandum on 1st April, that In consequence of his not having filed his accounts, it was adjourned to 23d April—the memorandum is this: "The bankrupt, not having yet filed his accounts, and stating that his books and vouchers were in Italy, and that he could not prepare his accounts until they had been sent over, the exami<lb></lb>nation was adjourned till 23d April, at half-past 12 precisely"—on 23d April the bankrupt had not filed his accounts, and was not prepared to pass his last examination, whereupon the examination was adjourned till 14th May next—I have no doubt I was there on 23rd April; there is nothing upon the proceedings to show me that I was there; it is my duty to be there daily, and I am there daily—I sometimes prepare the protection order, but sometimes I never see it—it is given to a bankrupt upon his first sur<lb></lb>render—the day of adjournment is endorsed upon it, and signed by the registrar, and he has protection from time to time—the bankrupt was there on 23d April.; I know that by his examination and his signature; it was a private examination, which was taken down and signed by him—he did not appear upon the adjournment-day, the 14th May—the record of that day is signed by Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque—he states, "Although I sat from the hour of 12 o'clock until 2 in the afternoon, for the purpose of receiving such surrender, he did not attend"—there is on the proceedings a duplicate of the protection order which was given to the bankrupt—I know that a protection paper was given to him—I did not compare that with any other; they are usually made out together; they are taken from the docket-book, and one is a copy of the other, or ought to be—this has Mr. Hazlitt's the registrar's, signature—this and the one given to the bankrupt, would both be originals; both would be signed by the registrar—I think this is the handwriting of my clerk, who is here—it is the usual practice to serve a docu<lb></lb>ment upon the bankrupt, in reference to the adjourned meeting; on the day of the choice it is usual for the bankrupt to get his protection paper filled up with the day appointed for passing his last examination; that is always done, and it is usual to have it endorsed at each subsequent adjournment—the prisoner was present on 22d February, when the adjournment to 1st April took place—I do not find anything on the proceedings to show that he was present on the 22d February, but I find a summons to him similar to</p>

               <p>what was first given to him; we give the bankrupt a second one on the day of the choice, to remind him of the day of the last examination—that would not be given to him if he was not there; it would not have been made out—I find that he was there on 26th February; he submitted to a private ex<lb></lb>amination that day—he was present on 1st April—I find an examination here on that day signed by him.</p>

I am one of the firm of Johnson, Cooper, Wintle &amp; Co., accountants—I was first employed as accountant to the bankrupt imme<lb></lb>diately before the choice, and afterwards I consented to act as accountant to the estate—it is the practice at the first meeting to see that a bankrupt has protection—the first meeting was on the 22d February—as his accountant I should see that he had protection on that day—here is a paper on the pro<lb></lb>ceedings in my own handwriting, dated 22d February; it is a summons to the bankrupt to appear on 1st April, and is signed by Mr. Hazlitt, the registrar—to the best of my knowledge and belief, when I filled up this one I also filled up a second one, and upon the back of both the protection would be endorsed—one would be filed on the proceedings, and the other given to the bankrupt, but not by me—to the best of my belief I have seen that document in the possession of the bankrupt; he would produce it for the purpose of having the protection subsequently endorsed on it—that is the only way in which, in accordance with the practice of the court, further protection would be granted—I was present on 1st April; protec<lb></lb>tion was then accorded to him—I have looked through the books and Papers produced by the messenger—I have here a bill-book—I was present when the bankrupt was examined on 23d April; I think I remained to the end; I have no doubt of it—I believe the bankrupt was present when the day for the adjournment was fixed—between 23d April and 14th May I had interviews with the bankrupt—I can't say whether or not I called his at<lb></lb>tention to the meeting of 14th May; I can't call it to my memory—the protection was until that day—to the best of my knowledge and belief, there was an endorsement made on 23d April on his protection-order—I think I made it myself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). There are summonses which would apply to the bankrupt or any other witness—I am not quite sure that that has not got the word "summons" printed in the margin—the protection-order is made out at the end of the meeting or examination—the day for the next examination must be fixed before it could be made out—it is made out and the projection put on the back to save him from being arrested during the adjournment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> According to practice, is it uncommon for the pro<lb></lb>tection so properly endorsed to be sent to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes it is sent by post; I have known instances of it—this particular one I made out myself; to the best of my belief I took it down to Mr. Martin, and gave it to him—that is the last I remember of it—on the last occasion, when I think I endorsed upon it the day of adjournment, I gave it to the bankrupt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understood you to say you gave it to Mr. Martin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; we are referring to the 22d February—that was not the last occasion—to the best of my belief, the last time I saw it in possession of the bank<lb></lb>rupt was on 23d April, but I can't swear positively—to the best of my belief I saw it then in the Court of Bankruptcy, at the meeting, in the bankrupt's possession—the endorsement would be made on it at the close of the meeting—it was at the close of the meeting that I saw it—after that it would have to be re-endorsed, and re-signed by the registrar in attendance—that would be done at the end of the meeting—I cannot state positively whether the bankrupt left before the meeting closed; I do not recollect that at the close of the meeting there was no registrar there to sign the protection for some time after the bankrupt had left—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber at what time I left; I have such a multitude of these matters, I could not say without a reference—I have referred to the minute of adjournment, and I cannot say positively that the protection was given to him on that day; but to the best of my belief, I endorsed the date upon the back of it, and gave it to him—I should get it signed by Mr. Hazlitt—it is the custom for the accountant to get the renewal of the protection signed, but not the original protection—I believe I did it, but I won't say positively—my memory is a blank as to what hour the bankrupt left; his examination that day must have taken some considerable time—it must have been late in the day before his examination was over—as a rule, the registrar sits until 4 o'clock—I do not remember that he went away that day—as to the pro<lb></lb>tection, I can't state positively, but to the best of my belief I endorsed it and gave it to him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you looked for this very document amongst your own papers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have not looked for that paper; I have looked through all my papers, and it is not there, I should have seen it if it had been there.</p>

               <p>he have to be taken before the registrar to acknowledge his signature? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He would, and the registrar has signed it—I think that was signed at the time; the examination would be acknowledged before the registrar by the bankrupt—that would be the last thing done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Gazette of 7th February, 1862, was put in, containing an advertisement requiring the bankrupt to surrender and be examined on 22d February.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I have to submit two objections, which seem to me fatal to this indictment. The first is, that the Registrar, whose power and jurisdiction is defined by the 52d sec. of the Act, had no power to adjourn, except for the consideration. of the Commissioner, and here the adjournment was by the Registrar; that objection, if it prevails, goes to the root of the whole matter, because the adjourn<lb></lb>ment-day is the one relied on as to the non-surrender. I contend in the first instance that the Registrar had no power to make the adjournment; and in the second place, if he had such power, he has not exercised it in due form of law, at provided for by the Act. The document, by, which the adjournment was directed, is headed, "Before, Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque;" that is struck out, and Mr. Registrar Hazlitt's name inserted; subsequently Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque's name it again put in, and the document concludes thus</hi>—"<hi rend="italic">where—upon I" (that is, Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque, the name last mentioned) "do adjourn the examination," and that is signed by Mr. Hazlitt, the Registrar. The second objection is, that the non-surrender here has been misconceived; it clearly points to the case of a bankrupt who does not submit himself at all to the jurisdiction of the Court. Now, whatever other offence this prisoner's may be, it is not an offence within this Act of Parliament if he has once surrendered (see Reg. v. Kenrick</hi>, 1 <hi rend="italic">Cox's Criminal Cases, p.</hi> 146). <hi rend="italic">I further submit that, in order to make this an offence at all, notice in writing must be served upon the bank<lb></lb>rupt or left at his last-known place of abode, to submit himself to be examined before the Court at the particular time limited by the proper authority; there is no distinction between the notice described in the first part of the section, and that described in the second, and the same ingredients are essential in both.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">The first objection cannot be sustained, because the Registrar might act either under the</hi> 52<hi rend="italic">d section, as registrar, or under</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 13 <hi rend="italic">Vic. c.</hi> 116, <hi rend="italic">sec.</hi> 27, <hi rend="italic">as deputy for the Commissioner; in which case the proceedings would be properly described as taking place before the Commissioner, i.e. before the Court, in the same way as matters taking place before a Master would be described as taking place before the Court of Queen's Bench. Mr. Hazlitt is in attendance, and can prove that in this instance he acted in the unavoidable absence of the Commissioner.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Registrars of the Court of Bank<lb></lb>ruptcy, attached to the Court of Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque—I remember making this order on 23d April—I have a memorandum here in my diary, "adjourned to May 14th, at 12 o'clock"—I infer that Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque was not there on that occasion, and it was therefore necessary for me to act as his deputy—I conceive that I should be acting under 27th section of the old Act—Mr. Fonblanque is a great invalid, and is very fre<lb></lb>quently absent, and I act very largely for him—whether he was absent on that particular day from illness or not, I cannot say; but I infer that he must have been ill, or he would have been there—whenever he was absent, I presume that he was unavoidably absent, in consequence of his state of health—he has unfortunately been absent for the greater part of this year, and for a considerable time last year—the words "Mr. Commissioner," in this document, were struck out by me, because here are my initials—who in<lb></lb>serted "Mr. Registrar Hazlett," or "Before Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186303020014"></xptr>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">There is other evidence of the day; the secondary evidence of the document in the bankrupt's possession, in which his attention is called to the adjournment.</hi>

               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

He has submitted to be examined from time to time, he has not passed his last examination, and he is not in a condition in which he could do so; but supposing it was required that there should be a further examination which he was called upon to attend, after having already sub<lb></lb>mitted, in the words of the Statute, to be examined from time to time, then I think that express notice ought to have been given to him to attend.

The only evidence that we have of that, at it appears to me, is this particular document, and in that the hearing is alleged to be before Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque, and he makes no order whatever; the order is made by somebody else, who, although he might have authority to act in a matter which was before him and not before the Commissioner, was not the proper person to decide upon this matter.</hi>

               <p>Court. When had you last seen all these notes. - A. I missed 37291 on the 26th of May, 37300 I missed on the 28th of May, 38101 I missed on the 27th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time on the 27th of June had you last seen that. - A. I believe it was about a quarter past four o'clock in the morning, it was then in that cabinet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. When did your ladyship miss it. - A. About half after six the same morning; upon missing the notes I went up stairs into my maid's room to see if they were all asleep, my suspicion rested upon three, the servant maid who undressed me, and the servant who let me in, and the servant who came home with me; I called up my housekeeper and requested her to come to me immediately, which she did. The men servants room were searched first, nothing was found; I then with my housekeeper went up into the prisoner's room, I found her in bed, I told her I had missed two notes since I came home that morning, and that they must be in the house, she told me I was welcome to search her pockets, there were nothing in them but her own property; my housekeeper lifted up her bed, found her pockets and searched them, we found nothing there; on lifting up the mattress my housekeeper found another pocket, which she gave to me, the prisoner then said it was her pocket, there was nothing in it but what was her own and nobody should see it; she attempted to snatch it, I took the pocket down stairs, and desired her to follow as soon as she had got her clothes on; I did not open it till the prisoner came down stairs; it was opened first in her presence, and various articles of mine were found in it, and among them the two notes I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020034"></xptr>lost, one of which is 38101.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say or do upon your finding the notes. - A. She said she had taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present at the time the pocket was searched. - A. Mr. and Mrs. Markham, my housekeeper, and colonel - .</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that this is one of the notes that you saw at one o'clock. - A. I am sure it is.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner and you had agreed to part. - A. We had, she was to have gone away that very morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you discover these other notes. - A. They were in her breast, she took ten notes from her breast herself and held them in her hand, they were taken out of her hand, and the other two notes in the indictment were among that number; there was the 37291 that is marked with a cross, I made it myself, and 37300, I have no hesitation to say that they are my notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any thing during the time that she lived with you that appeared that she was deranged. - A. No, she was sometimes confused and melancholy, but I had no notion that she was deranged, I recommended her to a lady, I only took it to be a stupidity.</p>

               <p>Q. During that time in your judgment, has her mind been found all that time. - A. By no means in my opinion, from her incoherent manner of asking of questions, and before you could answer she would go into some other subject, she would jump up and go out, and after wandering up and down, she would return home.</p>

               <p>Q. Down to what time has she so conducted herself that you thought her deranged. - A. Within these six or seven months she lodged with me, she frequently shaved her head, she said it relieved her, and she would cut her head, she said the more she cut it the more service it was to her; I was so alarmed at it once that I called out, and I took the razor and hid it; she got it after that and used it frequently.</p>

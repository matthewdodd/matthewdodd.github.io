On Saturday, the 15th of September, these shoes were on a shelf by the door - I was in the shop about seven o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner step into the shop a little way, and reach them off the shelf; I was behind the counter - I called to him; he ran away - I pursued him, calling Stop thief! he turned the corner; I followed him down a gateway, and took him in a passage; I then fetched a Policeman, and Knight picked up the property - I had not seen them fall from him, but am sure I saw him take them; I missed seven shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. Yes, but not to recollect him personally; I knew his face - the shelf is on a level with the door, about four feet from the ground - he must come inside to reach the last pair of shoes: I lost sight of him for a moment as he turned two corners, but Knight was in pursuit of him.</p>

            . I live at Old Brentford, and am a cow-keeper. I saw Treagle and several others running along, calling Stop thief! I ran after the prisoner, and took him, as Hawkins was calling Stop thief! I lost sight of him twice as he turned the corner, but am sure of him: I took him in the passage - Hawkins and two or three others came in; I held him while Hawkins fetched a Policeman - seven shoes were picked up in the passage - I did not see how they got there; he never got from me - when he got to the station-house he said he was running after the man, as he heard Stop thief! called.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There were two or three others? A. Several persons came and picked the shoes up - they were running after him, and came to the place directly after I got up; I was the first who got near him - I knew him before well.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was passing Mr. Hawkins' shop; Mrs. Hawkins told me a man had taken the shoes - I ran the way she told me, and met Knight, who gave the prisoner in charge - he said the man had passed by him, and they had taken him for the thief; as I took him to the station-house he called to a boy by name, put his hand into his bosom, and gave him a duplicate of a watch, which I took from him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

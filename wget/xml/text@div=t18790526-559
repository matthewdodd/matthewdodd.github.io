                  </hi>. I have an office at 4, Chapel Street, Mayfair—about midnight on 26th April I was in Long Acre with a friend, Mr. Macgregor, going home towards Piccadilly, when six or seven boys came towards me, some on the pavement and some in the road, so that I could not pass, and one of them struck at my face with his fist, but I kept off the blow with my arm, and at the same moment the prisoner, who was the tallest of them, butted at me with his head and snatched my watch chain, and broke it off at the swivel—I felt the tug—the watch remained—I then knocked the prisoner down in front of me, but was knocked down myself, so that I could not hold him—he got up and somebody else got between us, and I had to fight my way through them—he ran away and I followed—he ran into a doorway and stood straight up with his back against the door—I caught hold of his arm, and a policeman came up—I never lost sight of the prisoner—my chain was worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or less—Mr. Macgregor was close behind me, and I broke my stick in the struggle and called to him for his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I had been to a friend's house in Torrington Place—I had nothing to drink on my way back, and was perfectly sober—I charged the prisoner with stealing ray watch, but found it safe in my pocket after at the station—I said at the police-court "I tried to follow the man who ran into me, but the others dodged in between us and I got knocked down several times"—that is correct—Mr. Macgregor was behind me—the door-way is round the corner—I did not speak to the prisoner—I might have told the police sergeant that I had lost my watch and chain in a fight, but I do not remember—when I gave the prisoner in charge I said "That is the boy who has taken my watch"—I did not say I thought he was one of them, but was not sure—at the police station I said I was sure he had taken my chain—I heard Mr. Macgregor swear to the prisoner being the man who took it—I was not hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I was butted in the stomach and my hat' driven over my head, and I was knocked down by a blow on the top of the head, but was not hurt—I saw the prisoner all the time and saw him knock me down—I did not examine the inside of my pocket until I got to the police station.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Queen's Gate, Westminster, and was with the prosecutor at midnight on 26th April walking down Long Acre, on our way to Piccadilly, when six or seven boys came up and stopped us—the prisoner was one of them—I was standing by the prosecutor's side when the prisoner rushed at him and struck at him about the head, but he kept off the blow—one of the others then rushed behind the prosecutor and took I hold of him by the collar, and the prisoner rushed in and butted him in the stomach and tried to take his watch, and the prosecutor called out "He has taken my watch"—wit was dark; I did not see him take the chain—I did not notice a lamp near—we then chased him for about two minutes, and did not lose sight of him—I have no hesitation in identifying him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I do not know that neighbourhood—we did not run far—I heard the prosecutor complain of losing his watch, and when the policeman came up he found the chain had been broken off—we had not been out to supper, and had nothing to drink on our way from Torrington Place—I am not a medical student.</p>

               <p>the corner of James Street and Long Acre—I went up and saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor and the prisoner and the last witness—the prisoner was standing in the crowd, and the prosecutor charged him with stealing his watch and passing it to some one in the crowd—I took hold of him and he said, "If I have got your watch, you had better go to the station"—on the way to the station the prosecutor said, "I have still got my watch, the chain only is gone"—the prisoner, when charged at the station, said it was merely a got up affair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prosecutor told me he had been attacked by the prisoner, and he had taken his watch and chain—he did not say he had lost it in a fight—the prisoner went quietly to the station and was searched, and no watch or chain found on him—the chain was gone altogether from the watch.</p>

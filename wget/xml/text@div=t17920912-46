               <p>I get my living in the streets, I am what they call a Castar - . I met this lad coming through the lane from the half-way house Redman's-Row, he had 4 papers of starch in his apron, there was another boy with him, I suspected they had stolen something, I took him and Price going to the watch-house; Mr. Newell came out, he was about a quarter of a mile from Newell's house; I saw this boy hand the starch over the bank. I went up to him and he seemed to be easing himself; I asked what he had there, he said some starch, he was going with it to Catherine Wheel Alley; that was about ten o'clock in the morning, I think on Saturday the 7th of July.</p>

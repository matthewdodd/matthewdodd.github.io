On Sunday the 15th of this month the prisoner came to my house; he called for a glass of ale and left it at the bar; he went through the house as we supposed to go into the yard; I was not in the house then; my wife went into the kitchen and saw the prisoner coming out; I came in and met the prisoner and my wife together; she said she thought the prisoner had something not his own. He made no answer; I took the towel from under his coat; the tablecloth he pulled out of his coat pocket, I knew them to be mine, they are worth three shillings. He had not the least appearance of being intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk of William Henry Freeman, proprietor of the Equitable Loan Office, No. 73, Oakley-street, Lambeth—the prisoner came to me on or about 12th July last, with this form of application for a loan of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—one portion of it has to be filled up with his own name, and the other portion the proposed securities have to fill up; he brought it to me filled up as it is now—I do not recollect selling him the form—it is a form issued from our office for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he left the form, and came for the money on the 18th—in the meantime our secretary, Mr. Aaron, made inquiries—he is since dead—the note purports to be signed by J. F. King, Luke Laws, and William Fox—on the 18th the prisoner came, and I paid him the money—the prisoner signed the name of J. F. King in my presence, and a man who came with him signed the name of William Fox in my presence—the name of Luke Laws was then already written in the note; our secretary got that signature—the loan was to be repaid by instalments</p>

               <p>—2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid by various instalments up to about 11th Nov. last, and then they ceased—I sent each of the securities a letter for the amount of the balance, and they said they knew nothing of the transaction—I made inquiries of Laws and Fox myself—I next saw the prisoner on 4th May last in St. George's-circus, Blackfriars-road—I asked him if his name was King; he hesitated for some time, and then said, "Yes, my name is King"—I asked him if he recollected obtaining a 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. loan of me in Oakley-street; he said, yes, he did; he said he thought it was all paid, I believe he said he thought his securities had paid it—I said they had not done so, that they denied all knowledge of the transaction; he said something about it being a mistake, and any reasonable reparation he could make he would—he Raid, "lam busy now, and cannot attend to it," and went away in a bustle; a constable was present, and I gave him into custody.</p>

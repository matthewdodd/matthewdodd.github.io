            , late of the 47th" - I then told him, as the order was to pay the money on the sale of the stock, I could not pay it him then; but that he must come again in a few days' time, when the stock would be sold - he asked what day he should come - I think Wednesday was mentioned - this was on a Saturday - he remonstrated at not being paid then, and stated that he had received the order from Captain Gordon for a particular purpose, and that it was of a pressing nature - I said I was sorry to put him to inconvenience, but I could not pay the money till the stock was sold - he then left - I saw him again on the 18th of December; I think it was Wednesday (it was a few days after this) - he asked if I was ready then to pay the money - I said, "Yes," and asked him his Christain name - he replied, "Charles" - I then filled up the order, conceiving he was the proper person for whom it was intended, and whom he represented himself to be - this is the order (looking at it) - he signed it in my presence - this order which he signed was the authority for paying the money - in the course of our business, the party applying would be called on to sign such an order as this before it was paid - we do not pay the money in my department of the house - we should not part with the money unless that cheque had been signed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you ever seen Captain Gordon since he wrote that letter? A. No; I know nothing of the prisoner except in this transaction - we were agents for Captain Wainwright, late of the 47th- Captain Gordon is also of the 47th - Captain Wainwright's name is not Charles - we were agents for him while he was in the 47th - he is on half-pay now, and not in any regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner brought you that letter which was your voucher or authority for payment of this money? A. Yes, on his signing the cheque; the letter was my authority to charge it to Captain Gordon's account - if Captain Gordon asked for a voucher, I should have to produce the letter and the receipt - the letter is my authority, supported by the receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you use and treat that paper which you have produced in any other way than a receipt for the payment of money, which Captain Gordon had previously ordered to be paid? A. I treat it as a draft in acknowledgment of the money - Captain Charles Wainwright, if there is such a person, had no money in our hands to give an order to receive - the letter does not mention any Christain name - I am not aware that there is such a person as Charles Wainwright, who has any money in our hands to which an order could apply - I do not know all the clients of the house - I paid the money on the faith of Captain Gordon's letter to the party who said he was Captain Wainwright - Captain Gordon is at Mullingar - he corresponds with us from Ireland.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. The letter of Captain Gordon was the authority on which you sold out his stock? A. It was; the cashier pays the money on authority of the draft - he does not see the original order, when he pays the money - he pays it on production of the draft which the prisoner signed - my handwriting is on the draft.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The cashier knows your handwriting on the draft? A. Yes; my initials are on it - that forms a voucher or authority to the cashier to pay the money - he would not pay it unless it was marked by the clerk, who has charge of the account.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If the draft was not signed, your initials alone would not be the authority to pay it? A. No; the draft must be signed before the cashier would pay it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you consider you were paying the money to Captain Wainwright late of the 47th? A. No: I did not pay the money - I knew Captain Wainwright, late of the 47th, and supposed the prisoner to be another Captain Wainwright.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You knew nothing of this cheque? A. No; my name is not Charles - I was acquainted with the prisoner about three years ago - he knew my Christain name is not Charles, and he knew I had belonged to the 47th - Captain Gordon is in health as far as I know - he is with his regiment at Mullingar - I have not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100108"></xptr>seen him for half a year - the signature to this letter is his handwriting - I do not know what acquaintance he may have made within the last half-year - I have been all over India, and never knew any Captain Wainwright, but myself - there may be one in the militia that I do not know - I knew a Mr. Campbell in the regiment, intimately - he was acquainted with Captain Gordon - he died suddenly - I do not think Campbell knew the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, although a gentleman by birth and education, I am so paralyzed by the disgrace and ignominy of my present situation, that I have not power to address you verbally, although my life or liberty might be the forfeit of my silence. I must therefore trust to this less effective mode of expressing to you the truth of my case. My father was a man of high respectability, nearly related to the banker and the baronet of the same name; he was an East India director, and I need not add therefore of good fortune. The wants of a man are more or less in proportion to his station in life. My life was that of a gentleman moving in the best society, and to keep a footing with those I associated with, required pecuniary means of considerable extent, and those means were supplied by the hand of a kind and affectionate parent, while my father lived; unfortunately he died, in 1832, and then, for the first time, it was found that his affairs were insolvent, and I, of course, destitute and pennyless. I was of no profession, for I had quitted the army in my father's lifetime, and of course had great difficulty to live and support myself and wife. I had some trifling assistance from friends, but that of course could not last, and I was unable to extricate myself from my embarrassments, and was obliged to keep myself secret and change my name; and, for fear of being arrested, took the name of Wainwright, and went to Ireland, where a friend of mine was with his regiment; this friend was Captain Duncan Campbell, of the 47th: he knew me both by my own name of Prescott, and by the assumed name of Wainwright; and, as I had held a commission in a dragoon regiment, I had (although retired from the service) been generally since styled Captain, which accounts for my being called Captain Wainwright, as I had been called Captain Prescott; and so friendly was Captain Campbell with me, that he advised me to continue the same name, and I corresponded with him by that name when I left Ireland and came to London. At length, my distress and difficulty increasing, I wrote to him for the loan of 50l., and an order came for the amount from a Captain Gordon; this order was addressed to me as "Captain Wainwright, British Hotel, Cockspur-street, London." I there received it, as I had received other letters, and then, as has been stated, presented it for payment on the one day, and received the amount on a subsequent day. Now, gentlemen, where is the forgery? Was I not the person who wrote to Captain Campbell? If I were not the person intended to have the money, who was? My brother-in-law's name, 'tis true, is Wainwright; his name is not however Charles Wainwright, but Henry Maxwell Wainwright; he lives at Aske, near Farnham, in Surrey, forty miles from London. Did he write to Captain Campbell or Captain Gordon for the loan of money? I humbly submit that it is the duty of the prosecutors, before they ask for a verdict of guilty, to convince you that I am not the person who was intended to have this money, by producing the person who was. Captain Gordon intended it for the person who wrote to Captain Campbell; and I am that person, otherwise I should not have received the letter addressed to me. Again, when I presented the order the amount was not paid, but I was directed to return some days after. Would a guilty man have returned? No; he would have sent a messenger, or done any act rather than ventured again to the same spot. I had no such fear; I was doing nothing wrong; and I returned and signed the draft which the clerk placed before me. If any other person had been in expectation of such order for 50l., that person would have gone to the British Hotel, for the letter, and to Cox and Greenwood's to inquire. Is there any proof that any, even the least, inquiry was made there for the letter? and if any other person but myself had expected it, and had been disappointed, would not that person have been a witness here to-day, and complained that he had been defrauded of the 50l. which had been sent him? Gentlemen, the facts resolve themselves into this - I was distressed, and in fear of my creditors, and to avoid arrest, assumed the name of Captain Charles Wainwright: my friend, Captain Campbell, knew it, and corresponded with me accordingly. I wrote to him for a loan, which was sent me by his friend; and I signed the name I had assumed, and by which I was known in the transaction. What forgery is this? What was my conduct when apprehended? - The officer said he had a warrant against me for fraud: I said I knew nothing of it. It was true; I knew of no fraud. He said it was from Cox and Greenwood's. Knowing I had committed no fraud, I offered to go there with him, but he refused to allow me: and then he mentioned the name of Wainwright; on which I instantly named the transaction, and the sum received. Did this look like guilt, gentlemen? No; I had nothing to conceal. I had received the money intended for me, and supposed, because I had not repaid it, that I was to be arrested for the amount, and, of course, was anxious to avoid a prison, not merely on account of the 50l., but for fear of other creditors. I certainly complained of the neglect of my friends, and my want of means to live,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100109"></xptr>and said, I was obliged to do as I had done, referring thereby to the loan I had made of the 50l. These are the facts, my Lord and Gentlemen, and I trust you will see that in writing the name by which I was known to the person to whom I wrote for the money, I did nothing dishonest, or fraudulent; and with full assurance on your judgment, I rely on your verdict of acquittal.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM BALLARD. Q. Was it possible for the prisoner to mistake you for a sheriff's officer? A. He knew me as an officer of Marlbourough-street - I have been so ten or twelve years - I never knew him go by the name of Wainwright.</p>
               <p>JAMES POWELL. No application has been made for this money in the name of Wainwright; nor has anybody claimed it - I should not have paid it to anybody but a person named Wainwright.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the White Hart in London-street, Greenwich. On Tuesday morning, 17th Oct. a little before 1 o'clock, the prisoner was in front of the bar talking to two or three friends—I don't think he was either sober or tipsy, he had been drinking a little—whilst he was there David Evans came in, he was neither drunk nor sober; he had been drinking; he had half a quarter of gin and some cold water—a general conversation took place between him and Hockley and friends round the bar—a fight was spoken of between two other men, and Evans and Hockley disagreed about it, and Evans said he would fight Hockley for half a crown; he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out some halfpence, and said, "I have not got half a crown, I will fight you for nothing"—Hock<lb></lb>ley</p>

               <p>said he would fight him wherever he liked to go; upon that the landlord interfered, and said he would have no fighting in his house, and they left the house—I went out with them—they went into the road—Evans was in the road first, and Hockley went out to him, and they commenced fighting—they had no seconds—Evans fell down, I can't say from what cause; they began to fight, and closed, and Evans fell—Hockley had not hold of him at the time he fell; they were struggling, closing together—he got up again, and they commenced fighting again; they closed again, and both fell down, Evans fell in the gutter, and Hockley alongside of him—Hockley got up, Evans remained in the gutter—I left him there, and came away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachman, living at No. 4, Brand-street, Green-wich—I was at the White Hart on this evening, and saw the fight—Evans walked off the footpath into the road, buttoned up his coat, and put himself in a fighting attitude—Hockley walked out afterwards into the road, and they commenced fighting—the first round, down they both went together, and very short it was—Hockley was fresh, and the other was very tipsy—Evans fell about a yard from the footpath, not near the gutter, on the opposite side—they both got up again, and had another scrambling round, which ended at the opposite side of the road; they then both went down together, Evans undermost—Hockley got up, and Evans laid in the gutter—I saw Hemmings and Stanley go to him and pick him up, I do not think he was able to get up himself—I observed blood on his nose and mouth—he did not speak—Stanley fetched some water, and he drank some—a man named Sullivan came by, and he said, "Oh, put him up, he will do, I know him; you go home, he will wake up and go home directly; I have been drinking with him to-night"—we left him there, not with Sullivan, we left him alone—by Sullivan's advice we set him up against the door, and left him—the prisoner was very handy there at the time we set him up against the door—we did not leave him there, he went away; we all went away together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—about 7 o'clock in the morning on 17th Oct., I went and saw the deceased at his own house—my assistant had previously seen him at the station—he was in a collapsed and sinking state, through exhaustion—he died in the course of the afternoon—I afterwards made an examination of the body—the cause of death was an extravasations of three or four ounces of blood between the membranes of the brain—there was a contused lacerated wound, about two inches in length, on the right side of the head, which extended to the occipital—that might have been produced by a kick, or by a fall—there was also a slight abrasion on the left arm and right thigh.</p>

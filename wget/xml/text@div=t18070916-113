On the 27th of August, between the hours of six and seven in the morning, I discovered my coach-house door broken open; I found the harness to be gone off the pegs. I ordered my man to go to Mr. Bott's, Worship Street, to borrow a harness; there he received information of the harness.</p>

            . I am a harness maker; I live in Worship Street. On the 27th of August, about half past eight in the morning, Mr. Dagley's servant came to me, requesting I would lend his master a harness, he informed me that his master's premises had been broken open; I lent him a harness. About half an hour after he was gone, I saw a person coming down Curtain Road, with a harness on his back, he came to my shop, and asked me if I bought such things; I told him I had suspicion that he had stole it, he said his master gave it him; he told me his master was at the corner of the street, I took him to the corner of the street for him to shew me his master, he could not find him; then he clung hold of the railing, and wanted to get away; I secured him; I took him to the public-house in Worship Street: I searched him, I found this tinder-box with tinder in it; I found a steel upon him, he said he had it to light his pipe with it, and he was a shoemaker, he heated his tools with it. The man that he represented to be his master, is a man of a very bad character.</p>

             for victuals and instructions. I had been with him about three weeks to instruct myself in shoemaking. We worked in a stall, therefore it is necessary to have a light, I put the matches and tinder-box into my pocket, and just as I was going to open the stall, he wanted me to go with him to dispose of the said harness; thinking it was his own property, and knowing that he had a horse once, I went with him; he went into a shop in Old Street, he came out and said they could not agree for the price; my master sent me into this shop in Worship Street; there I was stopped; I told Mr. Botts my master was out of doors; when I came out he was gone, and since I have heard he has absconded.</p>

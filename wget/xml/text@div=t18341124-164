                  </hi>. I am a driver of a Stratford stage-coach. On the evening of the 25th of October, I was driving the coach to Stratford, and saw a cart, driven by the prisoner, pass me at the Harrow public-house, near the three-mile stone, it was going at the rate of ten miles an hour, when I first saw it—the prisoner was not driving fast, but trotting along—it appeared to me to be a very heavy cart—it had only one horse—when I got up by the side of him, he quickened his pace immediately and passed me, and went over the Harrow-bridge, at the rate of ten miles an hour—I cannot say he was galloping—he was sitting low in the front of the cart—I understand there was a bundle of sacks in the cart, which he was sitting on—he was sitting very low on something—he appeared to have a full command of his horse—he had the reins tight in his hands—I saw Monk, the deceased, walking in the road by the side of the curb, from two to three feet from the footpath—I was in the middle of the road—the road is wide enough for four or five carriages to pats a-breast—there was room enough for a carriage to pass on the right, or off-side, as well as the left—he should have passed me, not on my side of the coach, but on the other—we were both going one way—he passed me on the wrong side—I saw Monk walking in the road, and saw him knocked down either by the horse's head, or by the shaft of the prisoner's cart, and the near wheel ap<lb></lb>peared to me to go over his body—it was the near shaft—the deceased was between my coach and the cart, passing on the wrong side—he was be<lb></lb>tween the pavement and the cart—the near wheel went over him—the cart continued to go on—I was desired by persons on my coach to go after it as fast as possible, to get the Stratford turnpike-gate shut to stop him—I passed him about thirty yards, before I got to the gate—I do not know what became of the cart—at the time he got over Stratford-bridge he slackened his pace—I consider he was going at the rate of eight miles an hour when it occurred—I believe it was half-past six o'clock—it was dark—there was light enough for me to see the man walking—there are gas-lamps all the way down the road.</p>

               <p>but I saw nothing coming in the way—if the prisoner wanted to pass me, it would be more difficult for him to go round to pass, than to keep on the left hand side—I was alongside of him for a long way—his going on the left side was not caused by my being in the middle—there was room on both sides—I believe there were three people in his cart—I did not see more—I did not notice the horse—it was a heavy cart—there was a some<lb></lb>thing in it, I could not see what—I was going at the rate of from seven to eight miles an hour—I think the road is about twenty-five feet wide—the bridge is narrower than the road—it continues nearly the same width almost all the way to the turnpike—I do not know that there is any dif<lb></lb>ference—the bridge is a quarter of a mile from the turnpike—I do not know the breadth of my coach—five coaches could not pass over the bridge abreast.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stratford, and was a passenger on Winch's coach. I was sitting on the dickey, at the hind part of the coach—the first I saw was the cart leaving the man lying dowr in the road—I pressed on the coachman to drive on—the cart came at a moderate pace after the coach—the coach was pasting the cart at the time the accident happened—the coach was on the right hand side, (the off side)—the road, I should think, is twenty-four feet wide there—I do not know the width of a coach—I allow five feet for each footpath, but from curb to curb it is about twenty-four feet—there is room for three coaches on the road with safety—the deceased was on the left hand side of the road, going into the coun<lb></lb>try, and the cart was on the left hand side, going down the road—I got down from the coach, and wished the prisoner to go back, telling him there was an accident—he got out of the cart, and went back directly—he said he did not know he had run over any body—he was a little fresh, but knew what he was about—he was sitting low in the back of the cart, with<lb></lb>out a seat—I think he was in such a position as would prevent his seeing what he could have seen if he had been on a seat—the cart I stopped with the prisoner in it, was the same cart as I saw leave the body of the de<lb></lb>ceased, and the prisoner is the man who was driving it—the deceased was taken to the sign of the Two Brewers—the accident occurred between the two gas lights—it was rather a dim light—there was a very good light from the gas, but it was between the two lights—I saw the cart and driver, and the body of the deceased when the cart was leaving him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the off side—three persons were in the cart besides the pri<lb></lb>soner—they sat on his left hand side—their sitting there would certainly prevent his having a good view of what was on the near side of the cart—a person passing from one gas-light to another would not see so well as if there was no gas-light—it operated like a blind—I have been acquainted with the prisoner some years—I know he is short-sighted, for some time back I had a warrant to apprehend him for a debt, and I know he did not see me—I have repeatedly met him on the road, and I have had money to pay him, and he has not known me—I consider the cart was going at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour—it might be more, but I was busy in conversation with a friend—I should say it was going seven or eight miles an hour—I did not see the deceased till I brought the prisoner back—I saw the legs of some person on the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the Stratford-road, behind Winch's coach, and saw the cart—I took particular notice of it—it was going fast, but the man was well on his own side, and had the reins in his hand—he appeared to sit in the cart—I cannot say whether he was on a seat—I saw something drop from the tail-board of the cart, as it appeared to me, and I thought it was a flat—I said so to a man who was with me, and he said it was a man—I went, and found it was a man—I did not see him afterwards.</p>

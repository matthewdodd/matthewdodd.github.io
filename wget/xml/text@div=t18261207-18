            . I am a drover. On a Wednesday evening in the last month, about six o'clock, I was in <placeName id="t18261207-18-crimeloc107">East-street Marylebone</placeName>

I saw the child afterwards - a woman took it away; it screamed out for its mother - I saw the wheel of the cart go over it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The child had just run out of a shop? A. Yes, and ran immediately into the road; there was but one horse in the cart - I was about half-way down the street - the child ran into a man's arms; the horse stopped and flew back - I do not drive horses, or know what pace they should go; I cannot tell whether it was a gentle pace; it was about eight miles an hour - I told the Coroner so - the Jury there returned a verdict of Accidental Death - the horse was gallopping when I saw it.</p>

            . I was in East-street about half-past six o'clock, when the accident happened - I saw the cart coming at a very moderate pace; it was not gallopping, I am sure - the prisoner's horse was inclining towards the curb; I saw the child against the kennel; the wheel went over its body; it got up again, and the hind part of the cart knocked it down again; it then ran into a man's arms, and a woman took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. The accident happened instantaneously? A. Yes, I heard the prisoner cry out, and saw him backing the cart - I cannot say whether the wheel went over by his backing. The prisoner was anxious about the child, and said he would pay all expenses - he said, "Will not the child be better at home?" the doctor said it would be better to take it to the hospital. The Coroner's Jury returned a verdict of Accidental Death, and I consider it purely accidental - I swear the horse did not gallop.</p>

            . I was in East-street; the cart was coming very fast towards me - I heard it, but did not see it till the accident happened - I saw the child after the accident - when I first heard the cart coming, it was going very fast, so much so, that I could not go across the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You judge of its going fast or slow by what you heard? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he was entirely ignorant of the child being near the cart, till after the accident occurred, and that it was entirely unavoidable - he was drawing towards the curb-stone to call on a customer.</p>

I am a porter, and was in East-street at the time of the accident - I saw the prisoner coming with his cart, and heard him halloo out - the child was getting up after the cart went over it - by the exertion of the prisoner in pulling back the horse, the cart went over the child; it got up, and ran into my arms - the mother came and said, "Oh! it is my child!" upon my oath, it was purely an accident.</p>

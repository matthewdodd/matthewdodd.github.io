                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of Clarence Street, Kingston-on-Thames—on 12th August I went to bed at 11.15 p.m.—I previously went round the premises to see that all was safe—the iron gate had no fasten<lb></lb>ing, but I put a case of biscuits in front of it, which was sufficient to prevent any one getting in—the doors and windows were properly fastened—the window through which an entrance had been made had a few parcels in front of it—I left it shut—I found it open—I was awoke next morning by the police about 5.30—I looked over the premises with them—I found the yard door open, also the window of the store room—I missed two coats, two pairs of boots, nine cambric handkerchiefs, one silk handkerchief, 10 cigars, two cases, a thimble, some postage-stamps, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze—5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was in the till, and a packet of five shillings' worth of coppers was on the sideboard in the sitting-room—I have identified the whole of the property as mine—this spoon and fork also were in the sitting-room cupboard—I have occasionally employed Wright; he would know the premises—they were entered by climbing over the wall, re<lb></lb>moving the yard gates, and entering the store-room window, which I found open—a person would then reach the other rooms—I found the lid of a water-butt in my yard removed to the other side of the yard, as if it had been used for getting over the wall—the lid was on the butt the night before.</p>

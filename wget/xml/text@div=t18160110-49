About six o'clock in the evening of the 12th of December, I was in the shop when the prisoner at the bar came in, and asked for a pair of second hand shoes, that would come to about three or four shillings. I gave him one of a pair at four shillings, which he tried on, and said it fitted him exceeding well. He asked to look at the other one, and pretended he could not get it on. I told him they were fellows. I saw some more men waiting at the window for him. I turned round to call my husband down; immediately the prisoner ran across the shop to the door, to get out; but I caught him by the coat, pulled him back, and locked the door. He left his own shoes, which were very tidy ones, under the chair.</p>

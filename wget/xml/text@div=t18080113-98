            . - Mr. Gurney. I believe you are an officer of the customs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of Tuesday the 15th of December, were you in Bartholomew-close. - A. I was, about twenty minutes after eight, soon after it was light, Mr. Ellis was with me another officer; I saw Bray and Potts come out of a public house, called the Baker and Basket, in Cloth-fair; Bray came out first and Potts followed; Bray had a bag twice as large as Pott's, they had each of them a bag; Bray's bag was the largest considerably, there was double the quantity in it; by the bend of the bags on the shoulders both of them appeared to be grain of some sort. When they came out they went down Middle-street, towards Bartholomew-close; they appeared to be in company together: I watched them; Bray and Potts turned into Half Moon-alley, and the moment they turned in Bray mended his pace and ran; Potts was behind him. I lost sight of Bray, when he turned the elbow of the alley. I could not pass Potts the passage was so narrow; Potts went into Aldersgate-street, he appeared to be looking about for Bray, he had lost him by his manner; some man came up to him and asked him to have something to drink; he turned into a public house, I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the contents of the bag on his shoulder. - A. I did, I found it contained forty two pounds of cochineal; I took Potts in company of my brother officer to the custom house. When I got out of the public house into the street, I saw Bray about forty or fifty yards off at the end of Hare-court, he appeared to be looking for Potts. He had no bag then.</p>

I had met him, in consequence of something that passed the day before: on that morning in Aldersgate-street; I went with him into a room in the Baker and Basket public house, Cloth-fair: Mr. Bray brought a bag on his shoulder: he told me to go into the public house and get a pint of purl and gin: he took the bag backwards and asked me to hold one end of the bag, while he emptied part of the contents of the first bag into that bag: I did so, and he emptied part of the contents of the first bag. I did not know at that time what it was: I saw it afterwards when the two gentlemen stopped me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that first bag. - A. It was emptied all out into two bags, one of which I carried and one Bray carried; I do not know what became of that bag; Bray took the largest bag, and I had the smallest; he went out first, I followed him; I lost him all at once; when I got into Aldersgate-street, I looked all round, I could not see him; when an opposite neighbour of mine, his name was Sadler, asked me to have something to drink; I put the bag down in the public house, and while I was going to have a glass of something to drink, Mr. Ellis and the other gentleman came in and took the bag from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the "Sun" public-house, Sutton Street, Clerkenwell—on 12th July the prisoners came to my bar together—I know Willis—Adams asked for a pint of porter—it came to twopence—I served him—he gave me one shilling in payment—I gave him the change—Willis took the change up—they both drank the beer—there was nothing in the till—I put the shilling in the till—after the prisoners had gone I went to the till and found the shilling there, examined it, and found it was bad—I put it in a little ornament on the bar shelf by itself—it remained there till Monday, the 16th—on Monday, 16th, both prisoners came in together—I recognised them directly—Adams asked for a glass of porter, and a quartern of gin and peppermint for Willis—that came to two-pence halfpenny—he paid with a shilling—I looked at that shilling—it was bad—I said to the landlord, "These are the people that passed the other shilling upon me; they have tried to pass another"—I gave Mr. Miller the shilling—I afterwards gave him the other shilling from the ornament—he marked them.</p>

I am landlord of the "Sun" public-house—I recollect seeing the two prisoners in my bar on the evening of 16th July last—they were standing about two yards from the last witness—she came to me and said, so that the prisoners could hear it, "Sir, these are the two persons that passed the bad shilling two or three nights ago; they have tried to pass another now"—I said, "Are you sure? Mind you make no mistake"—she said she was quite sure—I went to the other end of the bar and sent my servant for a constable—she then gave me the other shilling, kept in the ornament, and I went round to the bar where the prisoners were—the woman said, "Don't lock me up"—she said, "Give the man in custody, but don't lock me up"—I gave the constable the two bad shillings—I marked them before I gave them to him.</p>

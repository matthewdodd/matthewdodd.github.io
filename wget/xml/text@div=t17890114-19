I said, Gentlemen, don't go to hurt me, I hope you won't hurt me; I am a poor man, like yourselves. The man with the tuck said, don't make any hesitation at all, or I'll run you through instantly. Then I pulled out what trifle I had, it was but a shilling, and the man that had hold of me by the shoulder took it out of my hand, and the other d - mn'd me, and bid me go along. I went on as far as Ball's Pond Turnpike, and there I met Sir

            's men, the patrols, and I gave them information directly. I know the man that put the tuck to my breast; the outside one is the man. It was a moon-light night; it was close by a hedge; I had an opportunity of seeing his face by the light of the moon. He kept the tuck stick opposite to me, and swore he'd run it into me. I had notice of their being taken last Monday week: I saw them at Bow-street; they were shewn to me as the two men that were taken up. I knew the face of the outside prisoner, Hathaway, directly; they did not shew me any body; I said, directly, this is the man that robbed me. There is a deal of difference between their conditions now, and when they robbed me; for they were both in sailors dress. I will not positively swear now to either.</p>

               <p>On the 14th of December we came up with the prosecutor, who informed us he had been robbed by two men in sailors habits, and a tuck stick; we looked about for them in the public houses about Holloway, and we could not find them. On Sunday week afterwards, we met two men, in sailors dress; with this tuck stick, by the Shepherd and Shepherdess Fields. We took them in custody, and took the stick from them.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Had you any opportunity of particularly observing this stick? - It was a knife-blade, or a razor, and sharped off; it had several knots on it. That is the stick I had hold of; I am sure that is the stick.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's council. Was you ever in Exeter 'Change? - Not these three years.</p>
               <p>Have you been through Fleet-street lately? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you been down Snow-hill? - I very seldom walk about.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you never saw a stick-shop in your life? - I never saw such a stick as that, with a tuck in it. It was a yellow stick, with a blade; I have no doubt but it is the stick.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hathaway. I bought the stick<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140037"></xptr>at Portsmouth; I gave 3 s. 6 d. for it there. I was just come from my lodgings to get a shirt, last Sunday night was a week, and the runners took me up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Hathaway called six witnesses; who gave him a very good character.</p>

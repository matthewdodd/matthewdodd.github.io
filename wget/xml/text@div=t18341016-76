               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you put any mark on it when you took it? A. Yes; I did not know the prisoner before, but the party with him were friends of mine, and I asked them if it would be right before I changed it - I cannot be mistaken in his person - he was about an hour in the house, and dressed nearly as he is now - I know his features - I cannot say whether he had a white cravat on - I think he had the coat he has on now, and the waistcoat too, but I will not swear it - I think he was dressed as he is now - I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

             re-examined. This is the note I lost - I have no mark on it, but I remember the number, it is No. 2043, of the Cirencester bank, for £5.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you be certain that you recollect the number? A. Now I see it I do - I should not remember the number without seeing it; but I had five running numbers, from 2041 to 2045 - on seeing it, I swear it is the one I lost - it was not shown to me before last night - I had the number in my mind - not of the individual note, but of the running numbers - the first number was 2041 - I have no name on this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came from Wiltshire, and went with my uncle to Scotland - I returned, and went as junior clerk to Mrs. Guthire, of Ivy-lane - I was taken ill, and went into the country, and returned to the Old Bell, to sleep there, three or four nights - when the gentleman suspected me, I told him I had once been in a scrape similar to this, and rather than be exposed in the papers, if it was agreeable to him - (he had said, "If you will pay 5l. I shall be satisfied") - I called for pen and ink, and asked him the sum he lost - I gave him an order on my guardian to pay the money on account of my uncle - he took the order, and was well pleased - before he got out of the room, the officer came in, and said, "No; you have given the prisoner into my charge, and I must take him" - I was rather doubtful whether the order would be paid, and I wrote that letter; but my mind was so agitated at being accused, I knew not what I wrote - the letter was then not half finished, and the man would not allow me to finish it.</p>
               <p>MR. CHARLES re-examined. He did not give me an order - he wrote an order - he did not do it at my request, and did not tell me he was doing it - I did not see him write the order - I saw him write the letter, and, it appears, an order was written - I never got it, and do not know who did - I saw it produced at the watchhouse - it was taken from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to a gentleman named Holmes? A. Yes, with Mr. Bunyer - Mr. Bunyer took the order, I believe, but I did not see it - he brought something with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see it, or hear it read? A. Not to my recollection - I went in order to get the money - Mr. Bunyer had that letter with him at the time - I saw the order presented to Mr. Holmes - I was not aware then that I was obliged to prosecute the prisoner - I did not consider myself the prosecutor then - I intended to get the 5l. if I could; and, if I got it, I intended to give up the prosecution.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not tell you he had been in a scrape before, and, sooner than get his name into the newspaper, he would write that order? A. I do not recollect it; I have not the slightest recollection of any thing of the kind - I cannot say whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I put the order into his hand, and he read it; and he said, "I do not want to prosecute you, if you will pay me part of the money now, and the rest afterwards"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, at 37, Old Broad-street. I have an account at Robarts, Curits, and Co.'s—the prisoner was in my service as clerk for about ten months, and left about 31st Aug last—on that day he said he felt poorly, and asked leave to stay away—I usually keep my blank check-book in a private drawer in my own room—the drawer was generally unlicked—he was employed in an adjoining office, and had access to my room in the course of his duty—I am acquainted with his writing—these notes are both written by him—they reached me after he had left on account of illness—one is dated "Tues<lb></lb>day morning," and the other had no date—I received them before 13th Sept., when I discovered the forgery—(<hi rend="italic">notes read</hi>—"Hackney, Tuesday morning,—Dear Sir, I am happy to say I am much better, and trust to be able to come to the office to-morrow morning I have had two blisters on, and am much relieved. The bearer, my sister-in-law, will take any message you have to leave. John Byron."—"Dear Sir, The doctor strictly forbids me yet to go out. I yesterday experienced a relapse in fever, and am now in bed, suffer<lb></lb>ing very severely. I am to be bled in the arm this morning, if I am not better by twelve o'clock")—the signature is gone—they were thrown into a rubbish-paper drawer, and there may have been something gone—this check is not my writing, nor was it written by my authority—I knew nothing of it till I found it had been paid—the date and filling-up of it are written by the prisoner-the usual part is printed—the signature I believe to be his writing, but I cannot swear that—it is a very good imitation of mine—it is the sort of check I use—it purports to be drawn for duty on tea, per <hi rend="italic">Boyne</hi>—I always express the subject in my checks—the prisoner would know that—this is the check-book I had in use at that period (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is marked to contain 150 checks—I have counted it, and find it now contains 146—I miss four—those I used I took from the usual place, and left the margin—in those I miss the margin is gone also—I see my name and address written on this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—it is in the undisguised writing of the prisoner—he did not return to my service—I did not see him again till he was in custody, in the beginning of January—I had two or three other clerks in my employ<lb></lb>ment at the time</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>At the City Theatre, in Bishopsgate-street—I only went there now and then, for pleasure—I went alone, and he attended there for pleasure, not as an actor—I was acquainted with him eight months before we were married—I first knew he had another wife about three days after he left London—he was so ill on the Saturday that be could not get out of bed till four o'clock—he did not come home till a quarter to eleven at night—I did not go with him to Newcastle then—I gave no children by him—the last Sunday we were at Newcastle, a policeman called and asked for Mr. Mason, which was the name we went by—I saw him, and he asked me some questions—the prisoner was up stairs at the time, but he never asked for him.</p>

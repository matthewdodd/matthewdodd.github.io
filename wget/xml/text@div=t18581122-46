                  </hi>. I live at 23, Newton-street, Hoxton.

                  </hi>. On 9th November, I was in Cheapside and saw Mr. Hester's watch taken—Mr. Robinson seized him and his hat was knocked over his eyes—he took his hand off the prisoner to put his hat right, and I seized the prisoner—we struggled some time and I was knocked down; one man hit me on the legs and arm and held me by my hair behind—we all fell down together, about a dozen of us—I endeavoured to catch hold of a black man who had got the watch, and the prisoner came in front of me and said twice, "He has not got your watch"—I felt my coat unbuttoned to the very last button, and both his hands in my waistcoat pockets—I had four or five shillings there half an hour before which I afterwards missed—I retained hold of the prisoner and gave him in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 83, Victoria-road, Kensington—I was with Mr. Raven—I saw a watch taken from Mr. Hester—I seized the man and was <hi rend="italic">bonneted</hi>—I let go my hold to put my hat up, and to get my hand from another man's month, who was biting me—some little time afterwards the prisoner came up and said, "Let him go, let him go, he has not got your watch"—I said, "I know all about that, attend to your own business"—shortly after that we were thrown, and when we recovered our feet I saw the prisoner's hands in Mr. Raven's breast, and heard Mr. Raven say, "You have robbed me"—I seized him and held him—he said that he would stab me or skewer me, and I received a gash on one side of my hand—I think it was with a blunt instrument, such as a wooden skewer—it severed the flesh—I think he said "I will stab you," but there was a great dis<lb></lb>turbance.</p>

I am a traveller, and live at 6, Wardrobe-place, Doctors'-commons—I was in Cheapside on Lord Mayor's day, and saw the prisoner leading a gang, and <hi rend="italic">bonneting</hi> people—I know he was leading because several of his associates followed him, and directly he <hi rend="italic">bonneted</hi> one the others <hi rend="italic">bonneted</hi> also, and if he got into trouble they took his part—I had him in view three-quarters of an hour, and saw that happen very often—I lost my hat when I was <hi rend="italic">bonneted</hi>, and did not get it again.</p>

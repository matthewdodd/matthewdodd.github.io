                  </hi>I am an excise-officer, and live in Liverpool-road, Islington. On the 23rd of May I was looking out of my window between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—I saw two drays going along the Liverpool-road—I saw a child on a waste piece of ground adjoining the road—I saw it come and pass under the horse of the first dray—the horses were going very slowly—the child advanced a step or two, and then it turned to the right again towards the bind horse—the off wheel knocked it down and passed up the left side of it, on its garments—the horses conti<lb></lb>nued in the same line of road in which they were going before—the dray did not swerve from its track—the driver was riding on the shaft or on the fore part of the dray—he was on the near side, which he ought to he on—the dray was on its proper side of the road—there was no person walking by the side of the horses, and no reins to the horses—I thought I stated before the Coroner that the driver was sitting on the shaft or the fore part of the dray, but I do not see in my deposition any thing about the abaft—it says "the front part of the dray" here—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the deposi<lb></lb>tion</hi>)—I thought I called out, but I am not certain whether I did or not, as I was very much frightened—I did not know the person who was sitting on the front of the dray.</p>

                  </hi>I am a painter. I was in the Liverpool-road, and saw two drays coming along—I saw a child in the road—it fell before it came to the wheel of the first dray—I did not see the wheel touch the child, and I do not think it ran over the child—the wheel did not occasion the child to fall—the shaft-horse did—I picked up the child, and took it to Mr. Cooper, the doctor—its face appeared grazed a little on the left temple—there was a little dent on the forehead—I did not see any blood on the child, but I got a little on my trowsers—after the child had been to the doctor's I carried it home—I think it was dead when I picked it up—it was fifteen months old—I saw the prisoner when he came into the doc<lb></lb>tor's shop—I had not seen him before—he said he was very sorry, and when we got to the station-house I heard him say he was the driver—he was quite sober, and the dray stopped directly.</p>

                  </hi>(<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi>160.) On the 23rd of May I was in the Liverpool-road—I followed Howe to the doctor's, where the child was carried—the prisoner was there, and, after I had ascertained that the child was dead, I said, "I believe you are the driver"—he said, "I am"—I said I understood he was riding on the fore part of the dray—he said he was, and he did not see the child till the head was nearly under the wheel—I took him into custody—he was quite sober—he stated that he spoke to his horses, and they stopped instantly—there were no reins to the horses.</p>

                  </hi>I am fourteen years old, and am the daughter of James Odell, a lamp-lighter. The little girl who was killed was Emma Brooker—she was fifteen months old—she could run about—on Saturday the 23rd of May, I saw her with her two sisters, about a quarter before eight o'clock, in the Liverpool-road—the eldest is about twelve, I think, and the other eight or nine—the child had hold of her youngest sister's hand, and I saw her let go her hand—I was at that time on the other side of the road—I saw Ann, the eldest sister, go to the other sister—she said she would go and tell her mother that she had let Emma run in the road—she was going to hit her—Emma then ran into the road, and a brewer's dray came up, which had two horses in it—they were going very slowly—it was on the left-hand side going towards London—I think Emma went in the road to pick up a piece of paper—she went before the first horse's head—she then came a little way in the road, then went to turn back, and the shaft-horse knocked her down with his fore leg—nothing else touched her—the wheel went up her clothes—I did not see any body on the dray—I do not think any thing touched her head—she was taken to Mr. Coo<lb></lb>per—she squeaked once when she was on the ground, and curled herself up—the dray stopped then—I did not hear any body call out, or give any caution to the driver.</p>

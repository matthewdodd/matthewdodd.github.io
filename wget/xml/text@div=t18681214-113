I am the wife of John Lee, and reside at 98, Wardour Street, Oxford Street—I know the prisoner, and was present at his marriage with my sister, Harriet Ball, at Colne, in October, 1858—my sister is now living—the prisoner lived with her for two or three years after the marriage, at Erith, Huntingdonshire, and I have never seen her since, until I saw her in Court.</p>

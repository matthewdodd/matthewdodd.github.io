               <p>Q. Did you know them?</p>
               <p>Blundell. Yes, I knew them before they came out; of the two prisoners, one caught me round my neck, and the other held my arms; they rifled my pockets; I attempted to cry out, and they stopped my mouth; they took my pocket book, about fifteen shillings in silver, and a tip-staff I had in my pocket (I am an officer in the Marshalsea) a handkerchief and other things I had in my pocket: they swore sadly, and Dyer said she would cut my throat if I made a noise; in my struggling because I kept my hands fast they did cut me a-cross the fingers with a knife I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. A pin perhaps?</p>
               <p>Blundell. No, it must be more than a pin; when they left me I catched hold of one, and said I had been robbed, and she was one of the persons; a man came up and bid me go about my business or it would be worse for me; I left them and went away; after they robbed me I followed them into a house, which I saw them all go into; after they had taken my things first in the street I followed them to be sure to know them, and I went into the house; they were people I knew when I lived five years in the neighbourhood; I thought I would be certain to the persons of them; I took hold of one that was tried last sessions that I was obliged to let go. When they were taken before Justice Sherwood,

             wanted to be admitted an evidence; they were taken two or three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all taken together?</p>
               <p>Blundell. No; first two were taken; then the other two, one over night the other next morning; Mr. Sherwood took her aside afterwards and said she was a principal concerned and he could not admit her an evidence; she said she would produce all my property if he would; he would not; then she swore a great oath that I never should have my property; Mr. Sherwood advised me to offer some little reward for my pocket book; I offered a guinea; it was brought home next day by a man that keeps one of these girls company; he was afterwards taken into custody and was discharged last sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. This was pretty late at night?</p>
               <p>Blundell. About half after ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the women?</p>
               <p>Blundell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Salt-Petre-Bank acquaintance?</p>
               <p>Blundell. I lived in business five years in East Smithfield, and knew these people backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your business there that night?</p>
               <p>Blundell. I had been at Nightingale lane and other places at that time upon business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal in watches?</p>
               <p>Blundell. No; I had one since I had been out; I had not put it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. It is extraordinary you should have two watches in your pocket on Salt Petre Bank?</p>
               <p>Blundell. I had not been home to put it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. If you live in that neighbourhood how came you to think of following them into the house to be robbed again?</p>
               <p>Blundell. I wanted to be sure that they were the people.</p>
               <p>Q. When were these two women taken up?</p>
               <p>Blundell. Two or three days since the last sessions; they were all taken up, but they were all four rescued out of the coach going through Rag Fair.</p>
               <p>Q. In the day time?</p>
               <p>Blundell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I fancy you was not much in earnest?</p>
               <p>Blundell. I was not with them then, there was the keeper belonging to Clerkenwell Bridewell.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180004"></xptr>Court. Did you miss your things as soon as the women left you the first time?</p>
               <p>Blundell. Yes, immediately, because I found them take it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Blundell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not at all?</p>
               <p>Blundell. I had been drinking but was very sensible and knew every transaction that passed.</p>
               <p>Dyer. Farrell came in with him into the house I was sitting in, and asked him if either of the women were there; he made answer and said, no; he took a lad out; the people said he was an apprentice; he said he was not one; they sat down and had a pint of beer; Farrell asked him again if any of the women were there; he said no, and both of us were there at that time.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I told Farrell these were the women; he said never mind them, they are to be had at any time, it is the man we want first; we were afraid of taking the women lest the man would get away; I knew they were the women; the constable said let them alone, we can get them at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear you did not say they were not the women?</p>
               <p>Blundell. I did not.</p>

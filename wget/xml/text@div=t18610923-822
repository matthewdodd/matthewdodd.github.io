                  <hi rend="italic">Grace Darling</hi>—I was out on business that evening, and was returning to my house 5, London-court, Deptford, at about half-past 11 at night—I went into the Plough public-house, at Plough-bridge, Rotherhithe, and had a, glass of half and-half—I was sober—when I entered the house, three sailors came up to me—the prisoner was one, and the other two, named Thomas and Cavanah, was with him—Thomas and Cavanah asked me if I was stevedore to the grace Darling, and I answered that I was—they all then said that they belonged to a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Cambria</hi> lying at the head of the <hi rend="italic">Grace Darling;</hi> that they were hard up and wanted a friend, as their vessel would not be paid off till the following Monday—they asked me whether I would be their friend and give them something to drink—I told them they could have whatever they liked to drink—I gave them something to drink, and then they asked if I could oblige them by letting them have a shilling a-piece—Thomas said, alluding to the prisoner, "Here's our third mate, he will be answerable for us"—the prisoner said, "Let me have 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I ultimately gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other two a shilling each—after a little time the house was about to be closed, and we all went out together—before that they said I was the best man they had met some time, that I was a gentleman for giving them what they asked for—after they left the house, they said they were going aboard their vessel, and should go the same way as where, I lived, for it would be the nearest way—they accompanied me and kept repeating that I was the best man they had ever met with—I got about seventy yards, and all at once I was down on my back—the three attacked me, one at each side and one at my back—they knocked me down right on my back—they were all three together—the prisoner was behind me—it was done so quickly, that I could hardly tell who gave me the <hi rend="italic">lay</hi>, but I went back, and this man was behind—while I was on the ground they said, "He is down now, boot him," and they did boot me; that is being kicked—it is the common expression among the <hi rend="italic">Yankee</hi> sailors—while I was on the ground, I felt a hand in my right-hand trousers' pocket—to the best of my opinion it was Cavanah's hand, not the prisoner's—they took about 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of ray pocket—I was struggling with them to get up—I was kicked about the head and I had this eye completely closed—I thought it was completely out.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> This man asked me to go and have some tea with him; I would not go with him, but told him we were going aboard ship; we followed him; I was walking with Thomas, the prosecutor was walking with Cavanah, The prosecutor said that some one had put their hand in his pocket. Cavanah said, "It is not me, I hope you don't think it is me." The prosecutor said, "You are a liar 1" and then there was a fight between them; he struck Cavanah; I don't know which struck first I wanted Thomas to come away; but he would not, but went and sat down on the kerb-stone. I went away and presently Cavanah came up with me, and we afterwards went aboard the ship and slept there that night. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, That is not true.</p>

In consequence of information I received, I apprehended the prisoner in Chambers-court, Ratcliff-high way, on 10th September—I took the prosecutor with me to identify him, and said to the prisoner, "You are charged with being concerned with two others in robbing this man with violence, in the highway"—he said, "I stood on the bank and saw him knock him down, and then he came over to me and said, 'Let's make a run of it' and we ran across the bridge into Commercial-street"—I was looking for him from the Sunday.</p>

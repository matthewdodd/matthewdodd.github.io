On the 1st of January, in the present year, the prisoner at the bar, came to my house, in company with another person, with one eye. I believe it was about one or two o'clock. They were in the tap-room for sometime, before they came to the bar for change; when they came to the bar for change, Maycock asked me if I could give that man, meaning the other, change for a five pound note. I mean the man with the one eye, that I described, I told him I did not think I could, for he was a stranger, and I did not like to give change to a stranger; the prisoner then told me he was no stranger, for he was very well known in the neighbourhood, and he generally lodged at the Little Bell in St. John's-street, and went by the name of Nelson, but his real name was Wilcock. He said he would be answerable for it, and I might put his name, on it if I pleased. I had seen the prisoner several times, and knew him about ten months; I knew what his name was. I took the note from the other man, and asked my wife if she had change, and she said she had, and I gave her the note to put

I remember the prisoner at the bar coming in company with two other persons to my house, on the 13th of January; one of the other persons was a one eyed man; he was a person whom I afterwards saw at Marlborough street; that was the time Farthing, the last witness but one, attended. They had a pot of ale, and a drop of spirits put in it, at my house. I drank a glass with them, and after it was pretty well drank, the one eyed man tendered me a two pound note. I said, I could not give him change for the note, as I had no silver left. The one eyed man and the prisoner were very pressing for change, for they could not pay the reckoning unless I did. I told them I could not change it by any means; but I offered to give them two one pound notes, and they said, that would do. Maycock said so. I remember they said, they could not pay their reckoning without it I delivered the two one pound notes to the one eyed man. I held the two pound note, and asked the one eyed man his name, and he said, Maycock. I looked at the prisoner, and said, George, that is your name. He said, you may put that on master, it is all right. I wrote on the note directly, before I put it out of my hand. That is the note. The third man, then gave the one eyed man, Adams, one shilling and sixpence with which he paid the reckoning.</p>

            . I am inspector of bank notes, to the bank of England. The prisoner was apprehended on the 23rd of January. I saw him; I went to Marlborough-street. He was not charged with the whole of the present charges. He was only charged with uttering to Dell. He gave me an answer to a question which I put to him; which answer I took down in writing at the time; neither promise nor threat, nor any other inducement was held out to him. He said he knew the man who paid the two pound note at Dell's. He was a corn porter, and he was called One Eye, or Nelson. I saw him on the Monday after the Saturday, (that is the 15th). It was in Smithfield, and he told me he had been in the country as a drover. I never knew any house at which he lived. I never had any other money transaction with him before this. nor since. He did not appear to have any more money about him; nor did I ever see him change any other bank notes. I have known him ten years; I met him in Wilderness-row. He asked me to have something to drink; it was about dusk. We went into Dell's; we had a shillingsworth of wine and water. When we left there, he went away and I went home. I saw him on the Monday, I did not drink with him; and never saw him since; he never paid me any notes. He said his name was Nelson, because he had lost one eye. I read this over to him afterwards. It was not before the magistrates. That is forged in every respect, in the plate signature and paper. The signiture is Y. Butten; there is such a clerk, but it is not his hand writing. That is also a forgery, forged in every respect as the last, only with a variation in the number; it is the same date and the signature, and it is from the same plate as the first. That is forged also in every respect, in plate, paper, and signature. The signature is in the same hand writing as the signatures of the other two. The name signed is S. Hulm. We have different signaturs for the different amounts of notes, and Hulm signs the five pound notes. I am sure he is not the signer of this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I leave all to my counsel. I know no more of this man, than that he was a horse dealer, and worked up and down the roads.</p>

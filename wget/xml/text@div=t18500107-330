                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I live at the Union Hotel, 33, Salisbury-square. On Monday evening, 4th Jan., about eleven o'clock at night, I was in Fleet-street—the prisoner accosted me, and I took her to sup with me at a tavern near Temple-bar—she afterwards took me to her house in a small alley near Temple-bar—we both went into a bedroom—I put my watch on the mantel-piece; the prisoner looked at it to see the hour—I took it from her, and put it on the mantel-piece again—I remained with her ten minutes—she left the room first, and I missed my watch—I searched with a policeman for her, but could not find her—I had seen her speak to policeman No. 50, and informed him—it was a gold watch, and with the seals and chain was worth 300 francs.</p>

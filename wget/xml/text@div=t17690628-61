This was about a quarter after six. My man then knocked the prisoner's door open, and the flames came out. The house was soon burnt down, all but the wall.

            . I am a tallow-chandler, and live next door to the prisoner. I was knocked up in a very great hurry in the morning between six and seven. The prisoner 's house was on the fire. I saw in a little time my house on fire in several places. We were very busy in getting my goods out of a one pair of stairs room. I saw the rafters of my garret on fire, which the firemen put out. I know, about ten days or a fortnight before the fire, the prisoner was removing some of her goods, and they were putting some back again the day before the fire.</p>

            . There is one house between the prisoner's and mine, but as my porter was taking down the shutters about half an hour after six this day seven night, he said he thought he smelt fire as he came by the prisoner's house. I thought I smelt it very strong. I saw some smoke come out of the prisoner's house. I instantly ordered the shutters to be broke open; then the flames burst out. After the smoke began to clear away I could discern the fire to proceed from under the stair-case; that seemed to be on fire first. I looked at my watch, and it wanted exactly twenty minutes of seven. The house was soon burnt down, all but the wall. I saw a window of Mr.

            . I live three doors beyond where the fire was in the Charles Street. I was going out between six and seven, when at my door there was an alarm of fire. I went to the prisoner's door; the smoke came out at the window, and there was a cracking within side like a bon-fire in the street, when it is about half lighted. A person knocked the door open with a hammer, and the fire gushed out very much from the stairscase. They immediately pulled down the shutters, and broke the glass. The fire issued out from thence, and got a-head prodigiously, and destroyed the inside of the house from top to bottom. I saw the roof of Mr. Wells's house on fire.</p>

            . I lodged in the prisoner's house, in a three pair of stairs room. On Sunday the 25th of June, about twelve at noon, I was dressing myself to go abroad, when on a sudden my door opened, which was locked on the inside. I was greatly surprised at it. I turned round and there was the prisoner. I asked her what she wanted. She said she thought I had been abroad. Then she said she should be obliged to me if I would go down to answer at the door, for she did not care to see any of her acquaintance that day. I was to inform them that she and her children were gone out. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280046"></xptr> went down, but no body was at the door. I went up again, and went out with my child a little after twelve, and returned about two. Then the prisoner asked if I should be at home or abroad. I said I was not certain. She said she was going out, and I was desired to let her in. (The lock of the street door was out of order, and the key would not open it on the outside.) I did not go out. She came up between eight and nine to light a candle. She said she was in a bad neighbourhood, but she had taken care of herself. She went away, and desired I would let her in at ten. She came home a little after twelve. I let her in with another woman with her: that woman had a lighted candle in her hand, and a whole one not lighted, seemingly of about four in the pound. The prisoner took and lighted the whole candle by the other, came in, and wished the other woman a good night. She shut the door, which I bolted and double locked, left the key in it, went up stairs, and left her standing at the door to go into the parlour. I saw her no more till the Wednesday morning, before Justice Miller. I was awaked in the morning by the cry of fire: my husband was in the bed with me, and my child about three years old. He got out, and found the room full of smoke; he looked out at the window, and the people called to him to come down: he opened the door and went to the top of the stairs, and the smoke met him, so that he could not go down: then he said, We are all gone! He then went to the child that was asleep, and took and laid her out at the window in the gutter; (there was a parapet wall;) he then took me in his arms and lifted me up, and assisted me to get out into the gutter, and followed me. I then had the child in my arms. We were only in our shirt and shift. I with the fright found myself fainting, upon which he took the child, and pushed me on my side towards the tiles, so that I should not fall over; he went with the child over the top of one house and carried it to the top of another; it is a flat roof; he left the child, and came and assisted me up to the child; but we saw no way to get down. After we had stayed some time, there came somebody out at a trap-door, and we went down into the house, where we got some clothes. There was no body in the house when I let the prisoner in but she, my husband, self, and child. On the Sunday morning there stood a mahogany table by the shop window with a large feather bed upon it, and behind the door stood another with a feather bed upon it. She had two children and a niece that she kept in the house then, but when she came up to light her candle, between eight and nine, they were gone.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live next door to the Bagnio, Charing-Cross. On that Monday, near eight in the morning, a man met the prisoner at my door, and said something to her; he seemed to be in a terrible flurry. I begged of her to come in: she said she hoped no body was burned, and that she went out about five in the morning. She said she had a candle to see to pack up her goods. There were two men with her, Mr. Thompson was one of them. The other man said he was going to take her goods away for her.</p>

I enquired, and found it was at the prisoner's house. They told me she was absconded. After that, going to my father's in the Strand, I met her. I said, How do you do? I suppose you have heard of your misfortune. No, said she. I said, Did you not hear your house is burned down to the ground? Said she, Good God! I hope not. What next affliction is to come upon me? She immediately burst into tears, and said she could not stand. Then the gentleman asked her to come into the shop. She went in. I said to her, If you can walk, I should be glad you would go down there, for people said very uncivil things of you. Go, and satisfy them you had no hand in it. When we got to the end of the street, she sat down, and said she could go no farther. We went in at a public-house in King-Street, but the crowd was so great, we could not get along. I once lodged in her house.</p>

I immediately throwed water on the shutters of two houses fronting; then I went up upon the top of Mr. Well's house. I saw two of the rafters on fire. I called for water, by which I saved his house.

She said she never saw such a place as Charles-street, for there were no neighbours; but she would be revenged. Whether she meant of Mr. Wells, or the neighbours, I cannot say.</p>

The prisoner hired a room of me about a fortnight or three weeks ago; she came to me that Monday morning the fire was, to desire me to come to take two bedsteads down for her, and see that the carman took care of the goods. I understood she was coming that day to my house. I went with her to Charing-Cross; there I was to hire two carts. I hired two. When I came back, Mr. Thompson met her and asked her where she had been. She did not appear to be in any concern of mind till he told her of the melancholy accident of her house being burned down; then she fell against a shoemaker's shop.

            , Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>On Thursday afternoon, the 18th of August last, as I was passing down the back lane leading towards <placeName id="t17850914-21-crimeloc101">Stepney-fields</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17850914-21-crimeloc101" type="placeName" value="Stepney-fields"></interp>

               <p>What do you suppose it to be worth at the time it was taken? - I do not know, it cost me three shillings, I am not acquainted with the value of old handkerchiefs, I suppose it is not material.</p>
               <p>But it is material? - Then if it is material, I wish to value it as low as possible; I only come here to do justice to my country; I wish to exercise the feelings of humanity at the same time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman cannot swear I picked his pocket, I was playing with some other boys.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said before the Justice he lived at Brentford, he was playing at hoop; he appeared in a very indifferent situation, I gave him six-pence at the time, and I gave him six-pence after he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, If the indictment had been proved as laid, it would have been a capital offence, for if you find him guilty of privately stealing from the person to the amount of more than a shilling, it would exclude the benefit of clergy.</p>

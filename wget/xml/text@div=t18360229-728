                  </hi>. I live in Dorchester-street, Marylebone—I did live in Boston-street. I know the prisoner—he applied to me to make him a pair of shoes about the beginning of November or the end of October—he asked if I would take the payment out in bread—I said I would in a week or two, but it was not convenient to make them then—I made them after<lb></lb>wards, and delivered them to him—they came to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I made a pair of shoes also for a person he called his fellow-servant—I don's know who it was, but he used to come with him—I was to be paid for them also in bread the bread was left at my place till I left Boston-street, and after</p>

               <p>that it was left with Mrs. Mitchell by Gates or his associate or companion—the shoes were fetched from me—I almost forget who fetched them—I saw the prisoner afterwards, and he said they fitted him very well, but were rather too large.</p>

The prisoner never accounted to me for bread sold to Gibbs or Mrs. Mitchell—I never had such customers—I did not know them by name or sight—he did not account to me on the 10th of December for two half-quartern loaves sold to Gibbs of Mrs. Mitchell—he never named them as customers—there was a deficiency of bread, but I did not know which of my servants to suspect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It was counted out to me when I took it out, and I ac<lb></lb>counted for it in the evening—if I was deficient, I was accountable for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. NELSON</hi>. He never paid for any deficiency of bread—and ac<lb></lb>count of what he carried out was entered in the ledger, and he gave an account of what he had done—it was always satisfactory.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you account for this bread being your property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell how he managed it—I had a customer in that house, in Boston-street, and he regularly took bread there—I am not aware that he</p>

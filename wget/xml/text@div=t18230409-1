            . I am an officer. On Sunday, the 2d of March, about one o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner in the Commercial-road, with a bundle on his shoulder, and asked him what he was carrying, he said,</p>
               <p>"Copper;" I said, I thought something was wrong, and that I must see it - he told me I had no occasion to look for it was copper. I took him into a public-house, and found it was copper done up in canvas; it was in three square cakes. I said it was marked, and I must take him to the watch-house; he said,</p>
               <p>"I hope Mr. Carter you won't do that as you know the consequence will be I shall be convicted and have to pay a penalty of 5 l.," and it would be better for me if I had 5 l.; I said I must do my duty, and took him to the office. He knew me before.</p>

            , Esq. In February last, (I think the 26th or 27th) the prisonerapplied to me, and said he understood there was a cable on board the ship Mellish, which was for sale; (I did not know him before) I said it was an old one, and he had better go on board and see it - he returned to me the next day or the day after, and said he would purchase it. The price was 70 l., which he paid, viz 20 l. in money and a bill for 50 l., which was regularly paid. He expressed a wish to go on board and chop the cable up - I gave him an order to go on board, and do what he pleased with it.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Williams and Greenfield. On the 26th of February, I delivered 1218 cakes of copper, marked W. and G., to Voss - they were put into the barge from the warehouse. I sent out no other copper of that description for a month before; but some was sent out a week or ten days afterwards, but none so early as the 2d of March. The copper produced is part of that I delivered; I speak to it from the initials, quality, and size. It is worth about four guineas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What is the value of the largest piece - A. I should think not less than 50 s. All the copper goes through my hands. The mark W. and G. is put on in casting it.</p>

I received one thousand, two hundred and eighteen cakes of copper from Rolls, on Wednesday, the 26th of February; I delivered them on board the Mellish, at Blackwall, in the Thames, outward bound, part on the 27th and the remainder on the 28th of February.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you on board all the time - A. Yes, and had them locked up under hatches.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Majori-banks, as rigger and labourer on board the Mellish. I was on board in the afternoon when the copper was put on board, both on Thursday and Friday - it was stowed in different places in the hold, and on Monday the 3d of March, I found three cakes stowed in different places from where they originally were. Other goods had come on board so that we could not get to the copper to count it without unlading the vessel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You have not ascertained how much remains on board - A. No. There were thirty labourers employed on board getting in the cargo. I had not observed the prisoner on board.</p>

            . I am foreman of the labourers on board. On Thursday, while the copper was putting on board, I saw the prisoner there, he went between the decks, and said he had come to buy a cable - I do not know how long he stopped. He was there again on the Friday.</p>
               <p>MR. KERSHAW re-examined. Mr. Majoribanks and I are the sole owners of the vessel. These cakes of copper are much smaller than the usual size. They cost 1 s. 1 d. per l b. - one weighs 56 lbs., and the others 28 lbs. each.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am a dealer in marine stores. I have no more to say.</p>

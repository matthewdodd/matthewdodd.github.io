About a quarter past 1 on Sunday morning, 2d August, I found the prosecutor lying down on the road asleep, near the Red Lion, Southall—I woke him—he told me he had lost some<lb></lb>thing, and made a charge against the prisoner and a man—we found them asleep in a barn, and while searching the man, the prosecutor saw the female trying to make away with something in the straw—he caught hold of her hand, and held it down—I turned my light on, and she had these two letters underneath her hand in the straw—I gave her in custody to another con<lb></lb>stable, and searched the straw—the other constable found this purse in her bosom, and another one was found in her stocking with two half-crowns in it—three pennyworth of coppers were found in her bosom at the same time—the man was taken and committed, but the bill has been thrown out against him—they state that they are husband and wife—they are strangers to us.</p>

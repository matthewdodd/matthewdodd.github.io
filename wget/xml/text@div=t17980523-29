            : On Wednesday, the 25th of April, between nine and ten in the morning, I lost a gown out of the passage; I keep a cloaths shop; it hung up for sale; a person of the name of Ashley told me of it.</p>

             sworn. - On Wednesday the 25th of April I saw the prisoner and another standing looking in at the shop window of Mrs. Clark for some time; the prisoner then ventured into the passage; the other remained at the shop window; he came out again; he then went into the passage a second time, and unhooked a gown; he looked at two or three, but he took one down which hung upon a nail; he wrapped it up in as small a compass as he could, and put it under his left arm under his coat, and went off with it; I immediately ran out of doors without a hat to pursue him, which I did; I first crossed the way to tell Mrs. Clark of it; I laid hold of him fast by the collar, and brought him back to Mrs. Clark's house, and there I took the gown from him.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Clark.) Q. You saw Mr. Ashley come back with the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take the gown from him? - A. Yes; I know it is mine by the print.</p>
               <p>- GIBBONS sworn. - (Produces the gown.) I received it from Mr. Ashley.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clark. I believe this is the gown; I had hung it in the passage that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it being your gown? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was going along the street, I saw this gown lying at the side of the door, right under the window; I took it, rolled it up, and put it under my coat, and that gentleman came and took hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Ashley). Did he pick it up from the ground? - A. He unhooked it from a nail; it was his second attempt.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

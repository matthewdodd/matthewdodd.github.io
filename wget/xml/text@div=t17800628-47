            . The prisoner's sister lodged in our house six years; she is gone away now. The prisoner used to stay with her three or four months at a time. I missed three aprons and a muslin handkerchief sometime in the beginning of March; her sister was in the Borough, but the prisoner was in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>How long was her sister from home? - About three weeks. I mentioned the loss of them in the house, hoping they would be brought back again. I mistrusted the prisoner had them. The handkerchief was taken out of a drawer in the fore room; the aprons from a box in the back-room; they were not my own, they were brought to me to wash.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say when you mentioned the loss of the things? - She frequently said she could swear to the apron's being in the back room; that was my apron. She went away in a few days afterwards, and I immediately missed saveral things. Whe n I found she did not return, I suspected some things were gone. She did not come home all night, nor all the next night; then I missed a silver tea spoon, a child's silver buckle, a gold ring set with stones, a child's frock, a silk gown, a pair of stuff shoes, a muslin neckcloth marked with a T and an S, a napkin, a towel, and a cap. I did not miss the napkin and towel at that time; I found them at a pawnbroker's afterwards.</p>
               <p>When did she go away? - About the end of March. I missed the tea spoon the next day. I made enquiry after her, but could hear nothing of her for some time; three months after I heard she was in Tothilfields Bridewell.</p>
               <p>What became of her sister? - She left my lodging; she lives near to me. A person told her that her sister was in Tothilfields Bridewell; I heard that and went there; I desired her to tell me where the things she had taken were; she asked me if I had any paper about me; I said no, but I could get some. A person who was with me went and got some paper, and she began to set down where the things were. She said her hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280119"></xptr> shook, and then the person set them down for her.</p>
               <p>Who is that person you took with you? -

               <p>What did she say for herself? - She made no excuse at all; I said nothing about the gown she had on her back, which was mine, because it was spoiled. It was a pea-green silk gown. I said to Lewis, that is my gown, what shall I do? he said mention it; I said it was of no use to mention it, it was spoiled. I did not mention it to her till the next day.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing at any time how she came by the things? - She made no apology. I asked her where the things were, and she set them down. The next day when I mentioned the gown to her she said that was not a place to come to to upbraid her. I mentioned it again before the justice; then the prisoner said it was only a dyed gown.</p>

               <p>Was there any promise made to her before that? - Not in my hearing. This is the account I took from her mouth at the time:</p>

               <p>Did she say where these things were? - Yes, I went the next morning before Justice Hyde, in St. Martin's-street, and the prisoner was examined, and remanded till the Monday following. I went before Justice Hyde again on the Monday, then the Justice sent an order to Mr. Dobree, a pawnbroker, in Oxford street, to bring the things; I carried the order to Mr. Dobree.

            . Did you go to the pawnbroker's with Lewis? - Yes, I went with Lewis from the justice's to demand the things; the pawnbroker bid me call again, and he would look up the other things. He said she had taken the silver buckle and ring out of pawn at the end of March. The pawnbroker said I was very welcome to the things, but he would not be at the trouble to come here.</p>

               <p>My mother and sister lodged in this person's house seven year; I used to make that my home when out of place. I used to do any thing she wanted; when she wanted money to pay her washerwomen she sent me to pawn things for her; she knows she gave me orders to do it to bring money to her. She sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280120"></xptr> me last March to pawn that frock for eighteen pence; I pawned it at Mr. Powell's and brought her the money; as to this gown I was to buy it of her. She said she would have half a guinea for it. I said, I thought it was too much for a dyed gown. I told her I would give her seven shillings for it. She heard that her husband cohabited with a woman in the street, and asked me to go with her and lent me the gown, a long Bath cloak, and a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>To Smith. Is that true that you lent her this gown? - It is not true; I never knew she had it on her back.</p>
               <p>Did you ever send her to pawn any of these things? - No, I never sent her to pawn any thing, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She sent me to pawn three gowns for a guinea on Saturday night. I have pledged several things for her.</p>
               <p>What was that silk gown worth at the time it was taken?</p>
               <p>Smith. It cost thirteen shillings and sixpence making up; I have charged it twelve shillings. I charge nothing for the silk.</p>

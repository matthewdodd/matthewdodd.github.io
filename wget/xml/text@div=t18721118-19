                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son—the prisoner was in his service—on 31st October, about 5 o'clock in the evening, I was present at the loading of the prisoner's van—there were forty-five packages of tea, consisting of nine chests, thirty half chests, and six boxes—before loading, I counted the packages as they were piled in the warehouse, and found the number correct—after that I took the delivery-note, and checked every number—I helped to put them on the van, and after they were loaded I got up and tallied them, and found them correct—the nine chests were at the bottom, and the half chests at the top—they were loaded from our warehouse—we are City carmen, and they were to go to Ward's Wharf; for the Civil Service Co-operative Company.</p>

               <p>31st October, about 6.15, the prisoner came there with a load of tea, and a delivery-note—he only delivered forty-four packages—I told him there was one short—he said he thought there was one short—I only signed for forty-four—it was a chest of Congou that was short—I did not see what was in the van.</p>

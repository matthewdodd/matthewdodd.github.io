                  </hi>. I am an importer and manufacturer of chi<lb></lb>cory, at 2, Moore-lane. In May, 1848, I had a fire at the premises which I then occupied, in Whitechapel, and where I kept my chicory—from thirty to forty tons of the chicory was saved from the fire, but it was charred exter<lb></lb>nally, and it was removed to premises in Glasshouse-yard—before last Christ<lb></lb>mas, most of it was again removed to where I now have premises, but some was left in Glasshouse-yard. On 14th Dec. I employed Styles to remove some of it from Glasshouse-yard to some premises in Spitalfields—I suppose the quantity to be removed was about ten tons—it never was weighed—it was all packed in bags—I told Styles there was from eight to ten tons, and he made an agreement to remove the whole at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—I saw him again on the Saturday before Christmas day; he said the whole was removed, and I said if he would call on me, I would pay him for removing it—he told me he had completed it—he had commenced on the previous day—he told me that he thought the quantity was larger than I had specified to him—I told him I thought there was from eight to ten tons, but whatever the quantity was, I would pay him—I paid him a sovereign, a day or two afterwards—it was at</p>

               <p>the rate of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—on 7th Jan. I went to the premises of Purkiss, in New Inn-yard—he showed me a small quantity of chicory, and some bags—they were the bags in which the chicory was that I told Styles to remove—there was a double cross, meaning the number, on them, and other marks of my own marking—I could swear to them—I then examined the chicory, and knew it from the quality of it—it was a foreign article, and a great number of pieces were charred by the fire—there was about a ton of it, and about thirteen bags—I then went to the station, and took an officer, and saw Styles in Moore-lane—I asked him how he became possessed of the chicory—he told me he had received instructions from a man of the name of Watson White to get it ground for him—I then went with him to Purkiss, and he stated that Styles had called upon him with a small sample of chicory, and said he had got about two tons, and wished him to purchase it, he said he could sell it very cheap, at 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton—he said he had declined to purchase it, and they had agreed that he should grind it for Styles; that he sent him half a ton for that purpose, and subsequently he sent him half a ton more, making a ton—he said that Styles said it belonged to him, and he would sell it him at 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton—I then gave Styles into custody—I afterwards went to Steward-street, St. Luke's—I there saw twelve or thirteen bags of chicory—I ex<lb></lb>amined the chicory, it was my property—it was charred and burnt—the bags were strange bags, they did not belong to me—they had the name of "But<lb></lb>terfield" on them—there was about 25 cwt. of chicory there.</p>

I am in the employ of Mr. Browne—I was on his premises, in Glasshouse-yard, on the Wednesday before Christmas, assisting in remov<lb></lb>ing some bags of chicory from there to Spitalfields—Finn came there with a cart, and at different times that day he took away several bags of chicory—he took away thirty, thirty-two, or thirty-three bags—I was there helping to load the cart, and I went with him on each occasion to my master's premises in Spitalfields, and the bags were placed in my master's warehouse there—Finn came again, next day, with the cart; and I, on that day, assisted him in loading the bags, as 1 had done the day before—about thirty bags were put up then—on the Thursday, I left a man there while I went to Spitalfields—I left the premises open—Finn went with me, but a glazier was left there—the same thing took place on Friday and Saturday, but Finn did not take so many loads—he took two bags on the Friday, and on Saturday he came again, and took away about thirty bags—on each of these days I was loading my master's chicory into his cart—I was not on the premises all the time; I was only on the premises to load—I went away with the loads—the name of "Turner" was on the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee and chicory roaster, of New Inn-yard, Shoreditch. About Christmas, Styles came, and said he had got a sample of chicory to show me; he said he had got about three tons of it, and he could afford to sell it very cheap—he could sell it for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton, or would I grind it for him—he said it was all foreign, and came from the docks—he said he would send me half a ton—in a day or two afterwards, Finn came, and said he had brought the chicory from Mr. Styles—he brought it in a cart, with the name of "William Styles, Milton-street" on it—I ground the chicory, and Styles came and saw it after it was ground—he said be would send me half a ton more, and he sent it a day or two afterwards—Finn brought it in the same cart—some of the chicory that was sent in on the first occasion was wet, I had to dry it before I could grind it—I did not grind any of that that came the second time, but it appeared to be the same—in a few days afterwards Mr. Browne came—I showed him the chicory that Styles had come and seen when it was ground, and I showed him the bags which Finn had brought the chicory in—after that Mr. Browne came with the officer and Styles—Styles then said he had had the chicory from a man of the name of Watson White—he had not mentioned that name to me before.</p>

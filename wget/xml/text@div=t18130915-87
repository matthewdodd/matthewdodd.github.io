               <p>Q. In consequence of information that you received were you induced to go to M'Gibbs's house, in Fitzroy-square - A. I was. That was on the 27th of May last. I was there introduced to the prisoner. I knew her before; she gets her bread by making bad money, and putting it off. A conversation arose that I wanted some bad money; she said that she could serve me with any quantity; her mother was by at the time; I knew her. The prisoner whispered to me, and told me that she took a good deal more pains with her goods than her mother did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by goods - A. Counterfeit shillings. She finished the counterfeit shillings better than her mother did. I asked her how she sold them; she said forty-four for a pound, two bad ones for a good one, and four over in a pounds-worth. She appointed to meet me at a public-house in St. Martin's-lane. On the 28th I agreed to meet her in St. Martin's-lane; a man came with her; she called him her husband: his name is

I waited in the street until she came out; she said she had another person to serve and then she would go in doors and serve me. She went up a court to this person, and then returned to me. We walked together to a gateway, and then there she gave me twenty-two counterfeit shillings; I gave her ten shillings, two three-shilling bank tokens and four shillings in silver.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you get that money that you paid her - A. Matthews, the officer, marked it and gave it me.</p>

            . Q. You are the assistant solicitor of the Mint. You have been long in the habit of proving money: look at these twenty-two, and tell me whether they are all counterfeit - A. These twenty-two are all counterfeits; they appear all alike, and they appear not to have been in circulation.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met Mrs. Fitzroy; she made me a gown. I went up to her on Sunday night; I saw Mrs. Tuhoy and this man, Herbert; they deal in bad shillings and bad notes; they asked me if I wanted any. I said I wanted nothing of the kind.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150052"></xptr>I had but fourteen shillings and sixpence. On the Saturday Mrs. Tuhoy borrowed ten shillings of me; they both said would I have any thing to drink. We went to the corner of the street, to the wine vaults. Herbert treated me. I said to Mrs. Tuhoy, will you give me the ten shillings that I lent you on Saturday; she said she had not got it; here is twenty-two shillings. I replied I would have nothing of the kind. She said, Mr. Herbert, if you will lend me ten shillings I will pay you on the Monday. Herbert gave me the ten shillings, but the twenty-two shillings I did not give him at all. They found the ten shillings on me which they say is marked.</p>

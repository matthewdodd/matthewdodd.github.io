               <p>Q. Was not that conversation a threat to commit her? - A. Yes; the Magistrate asked her if she knew the consequence of not swearing the truth, that she was liable to be committed for perjury.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate order her out for commitment before she would swear to any of the property? - A. She was ordered out with a young man that was with her.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Lambeth-street: On the 21st of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I went to the prosecutor's house, in Baker's row; I found the prisoner in custody in a room adjoining the bar, he was delivered up to me, and I took him into the parlour, he was crying very much; I said, I am sorry to see you in this situation, your father being a respectable man in the parish; he said, he had been drinking with some sailers in that house for about an hour, and that he was very much in liquor or he should not have done it; he seemed as if he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not so much in liquor as not to know what he was about? - A. I do not think he was; he said he did take them, and that he carried them home to his own house, but he did not think any body saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made him any promise, or offer of favour? - A. None at all; he said he carried them up two pair of stairs, and threw them into the chimney-place; I asked him if he took them through distress; he said, he was very short of money, and what he earned would not support him and his wife; and that he had applied to his father several times, and he could not get any thing from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were he and you the only persons in the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you gave him no hopes if he told the truth? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that his parents were respectable, and wondered that he could have done such a thing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He seemed to you as if he had drank a great deal of liquor? - A. He did; he said he should not have done it if he had not been so much in liquor.(The property was produced).</p>
               <p>Lee. These are Mrs. Harrison's; here is one of them marked A H.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You did not know these things before the Magistrate? - A. Mr. Tweed, and his friends, persuaded us not to own the things, because of hurting his son.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020056"></xptr>Q. Did you not swear, before the Justice, that you did not know that property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harrison. I know these to be mine; there are the initials of my own name and my daughter's upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you not tell the Justice you could not swear to them? - A. Yes, because I did not look over them; the prisoner's father said, for God's sake do not look at them; but when I did look at them, I was sure they were mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

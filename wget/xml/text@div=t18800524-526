               <p>May I was on duty in Great Russell Street, about 12 yards from No. 22 I saw the area grating rise up, and the prisoner jumped up from it and commenced running at a very rapid pace—he must have seen me—I gave chase, halloing "Stop thief!"—a gentleman took up the chase—we over took him—I said to him "You will have to come back with me to the house I saw you leave"—he said nothing till we got back to the house—I stood on the grating and looked down and saw smoke and flame in the basement—I said to the prisoner "You have set the premises on fire"—he said "I suppose it will be hot for me to-morrow morning"—I gave the alarm of fire—constables immediately came up and set to work and extin<lb></lb>guished the fire—the prisoner seemed very excited—he was perfectly sober—I took him to the-station, and then returned to the house—I found two constables there, and a fire in the cellar.</p>

I was called to the house, 22, Great Russell Street, on the morning of 5th May by the last witness—I found the grating closed, but unfastened—I raised it and dropped down—the kitchen door was about two inches open—I looked in and saw wood and shavings lying on the floor in three different places—the place was full of smoke—there was a space between the first and second fires of about two yards' and half, and between the other two about a yard and a half—I observed papers and boxes about all over the kitchen—I closed the door and called for water, which was handed to me by another constable and the neighbours, and after about 10 or 12 minutes I succeeded in extinguishing the fire until the arrival of the fire brigade, and I left it in charge of them.</p>

I am a brushmaker and a maker of satin store decorations, of 22, Great Russell Street—the prisoner was in my employ<lb></lb>ment for about two months up to the Saturday when he left of his own accord—this fire occurred on the Tuesday following his leaving on the previous Saturday—the front basement is used by me as a workshop—it contained dyes and cutting machines—I and my wife were at the premises up to 8.30 on the night of the fourth—we went through the premises from top to bottom and the last thing we turned off the gas, and it was perfectly safe—we left no light in the kitchen—the grating in the pavement was not left open as it was fastened with a ring and a long chain that goes through a staple underneath into the front vault, and there it was fastened with a cord twice over—it could not be opened from the outside without con<lb></lb>siderable force—it was fastened that night—there were shavings and cutt<lb></lb>ings in a bag and some about the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman in charge of the Holborn Station—I went to these premises about 25 minutes past 1 on the morning of the 5th—the fire was not out when I arrived—I found in the workshop a large bag of paper cuttings on fire at the back part of the front basement, used as</p>

               <p>a workshop—I afterwards examined the place—the fire had no doubt broken out either in the bag of shavings, or close outside it by the bench—the fire was what I called darkened down when I got there—the constables had been putting 60 or 70 pails of water previous to my arriving.</p>

I saw a lot of shavings on the floor all alight. I jumped up again as fast as I could, and my hat fell off into the area. I jumped up into the area with the intention of running for a fire engine. I was stopped by a gentleman getting out of a cab, and Police Constable 45 came and charged me. I know nothing about how it came alight".</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> What I said in my statement is perfectly true—I was perfectly dumb at seeing the fire—I went down seeing the light; I was certainly unlawfully on the premises at the time, but I don't see why I should be found guilty of setting fire to it—the shavings might have been kindling there for hours, and there might have been a gust of wind did it—it is rather an awkward position to be placed in—the policeman was 150 yards from me when I came up: I did not see him—it was not him that caught me, but the gentleman—the policeman said the gentleman would have to come up in the morning, and what I said was "I dare say you will make up a nice case for me in the morning;" that was all I said.</p>

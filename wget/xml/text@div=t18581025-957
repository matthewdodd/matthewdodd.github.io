                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Devonshire Arms, Queen-street, Golden-square. On Thurday, 2d September, Dutton came to the bar for half-a-pint of porter—I served him, and he gave me a sixpence—I broke it and found it was bad—I told him so, and asked him if he had any more of the same sort—he gave me a good sixpence—I kept one part of the sixpence that I broke and gave him the other—the last witness came in and told me something, and I showed him the part of the sixpence—I afterwards gave it to the constable.</p>

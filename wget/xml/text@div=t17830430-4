               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Newport, keeper of New-Prison, I was at a public house in Covent-Garden; I think it was the 10th of March, and I hear'd the cry of Stop thief! I went out directly and there were a great many people running, I ran after them, and at the Adelphi, in the Strand, the prisoner was stopped, and the prosecutor said he was robbed and brought the prisoner to Row-street, and there he owned that he had the cloaths, some of them pawned, and some at his lodgings in Bread-street.</p>
               <p>Court. What you taxed him with it, did you? - Yes, I went to his lodging, and found some of the things which are here, two pair of breeches, two shirts, and a prayer-book, one pair of silk stocking legs in the pocket, here is a coat which was at the pawnbroker's, the pawnbroker is not here, here is no handkerchief nor stockings.</p>

               <p>As soon as I was committed to Tothill-fields, the prosecutor made a demand of 6 l. not to appear to prosecute me; I have witnesses that he made a demand at another time of three guineas, and one guinea the Sunday before last, he came down Tothill-fields, Bridewell, and called on my master before at Hungerford Market; he was to to have called on Monday on my master to have received this, I was coming up by the Bath coach, and this man got on the coach, and by drinking two pints of beer on the road we were acquainted; he said he had no acquaintance, he would be glad if I would recommend him to a lodging, I told him he might lodge where I lodged some times, at the George in the Haymarket, the next morning we went out together, and were out all the day long; I was his chief support all the time we was out, and it cost me a good deal of money that day, he and two more acquaintances, he said he received a letter from his relations at Leicester, that his grandfather was dead, and that he could draw some money from them, on these considerations I supported him till nine o'clock at night, and I left him and returned to the lodging where I was, and I asked for his bundle as he said he must go the next morning to the country, and I told him I hoped he would make some acknowledgement for the money I had expended upon him, and he said he could not without I stopped his cloaths.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had not a farthing of him, I had half a guinea when I came to the Inn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord the prosecutor offered me three several sums to make it up, he came to me three weeks ago, and offered to take 3 l. and last Sunday was se'nnight he agreed to take a guinea, and then he never came.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

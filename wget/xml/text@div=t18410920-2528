                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living in a cottage near the Horse and Groom public-house, on the Croydon-road. On Monday, the 13th of September, I left my cottage at a quarter to two o'clock, at dinner time—I locked the door and took the key—no one was at home—I left my clock, and coat, and hat, and snuff-box all safe—I was fetched back, and these things were gone—these produced are them.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at work in a field adjoining the prosecutor's house on this day, and saw the prisoner come from aside the house with the coat on his arm—the prosecutor's daughter ran up and said her father's house had been robbed—I went after the prisoner, and caught him hiding the coat in a dunghill—I knocked the hat off his head, and took the coat out of the dunghill—I took them to the house, and found the clock in a ditch in a field which the prisoner had been in, covered over with grass.</p>

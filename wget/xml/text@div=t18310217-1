             only, lives there. On the evening of the 24th of January, about twenty minutes past five o'clock, I was shutting up the shutters - I saw the prisoner break the shop window, and take out a piece of Irish diaper; he ran about twenty yards, and threw it into the street - I was pursuing him at the time; I do not know whether he saw me - he threw it down, and ran away; I followed, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. by MR. BARRY. Q. Were there any other persons about? A. I did not notice - it is a crowded neighbourhood, and a great many people passing in general; I did not observe any one in particular - there is another person here who saw him throw the linen down - it is Irish diaper; I saw the window broken - I was within three yards of it; the prisoner could not fail of seeing me, as I was standing there: I think the prisoner ran one hundred and fifty yards before I took him - I was about ten yards from him when he threw the article down; it was nearly dark - I was not above twelve yards from him at any time while he was running; he only turned the corner of Houndsditch, but I did not lose sight of him, as he ran across the street - I could not have lost sight of him, I followed him so close; there were not a great many people in Houndsditch - the part of the house where the window is broken is in the parish of St. Botolph, Bishopsgate without; I do not know what the prisoner was committed for - it was for breaking the window and stealing the Irish: there is a communication from the shop to the house - Mr. Hargrave sleeps there sometimes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any communication with the house without coming into the street? A. Yes - the house is in three parishes; the part broken is in St. Botolph's Bishopsgate - the room in which Mr. Hargrave sleeps is in three parishes; the head of the bed is in two parishes - I sleep in the shop.</p>

            . I live at No. 21, Charter-house-street, Charter-house-square, and am a commission-salesman. On the 24th of January I was in Bishopsgate-street, near the shop of Hargrave and Theobald - I saw the prisoner skulking under their window, for what purpose I did not know; when I got within half a dozen yards of the shop I saw him drive his fist through the window, and steal a piece of diaper - he passed me within about a couple of yards; I pursued him for a distance, and raised a cry of Stop thief! Stop him! I followed him, and he threw the diaper in the street, in the carriage way - as soon as he threw it down I went and took it up; I took it into Hargrave and Theobald's shop - I gave it to a young man- the bell was rang, and Mr. Hargrave came down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The man was a stranger to you? A. Yes - I did not pursue him further when he threw it down and I took it up; he got out of my sight altogether, of course, when I turned my back on him - I called Stop of course, when I turned my back on him - I called Stop thief! Stop him! as loud as I could; I did not speak to the last witness.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what parish is your shop? A. In three parishes - the pane of glass which was broken is in St. Botolph, Bishopsgate without; the servant sleeps close to that window, and in the same parish - the whole of that part of the shop is in that parish.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stock broker, carrying on business at Pinner's hall, Old Broad-street; in the course of last year I had several business transactions with Mr. Jessupp. On 16th May, I paid the prisoner three sums of money, 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 259<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 183<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making in all 628<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>), is in his handwriting—when I received this paper I had paid him 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on receiving it I paid him a further sum of 259<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I had received of Mr. Thomas Dickenson, an I 0 U of the prisoner's for 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I paid him—here is the prisoner's writing; cheque 139<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., notes 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., gold 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid him 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money, in his charac<lb></lb>ter as clerk to the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>that no part was paid to the prisoner on the account that I had with him—the 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in a later part of the day, I suppose—the prisoner came again the same day and received 183<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—it was paid that day, I have the entry in my book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stock broker in Token House-yard In May last year I was at Bank Chambers—on 1 6th May the prisoner was in my employ—on his receiving money on my behalf, it was his duty to bring it to me daily—on 16th May, I received several sums which the prisoner had collected for me—amongst others I had four sums as having been received from Mr. Mossop; 139<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 418<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he did not give me any particulars what they were for—there was a running account with Mr. Mossop, and that balance he would have to pay that day—T had been away some time, and had only come home a day or two at that time—if these were cheques, I gave them to the prisoner to pay into the bank; if they were notes or gold, I should pay them in myself—it is all entered as cash—I have no doubt they were not gold, from the amounts being uneven—I cannot say whether they were gold or not—I have the entry in this book in my own writing, and here is a book made up by the prisoner which is a correct copy of my own book—the prisoner only paid me that day 418<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he left me the beginning of July.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. There was something about some Luxembourg shares? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I found they had not been delivered, and he left; but these were discovered after the prisoner had left—it was the universal practice for the prisoner to pay every day when I was at home—I was out a good deal about that time—he had not to buy shares on my account—there was a gentleman, Mr. Broderick, to whom he was to give any sum of money if I was away—the prisoner might buy shares for me, but he could not pay for them; Mr. Broderick could—the prisoner could not sign cheques; I never made a payment except by cheques—the prisoner was never allowed to retain money to my knowledge; he was allowed half the commission on business done on his own account—his salary and commission would be nearly 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time he left.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At what time on the 16th was it he paid this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On that day I find two sums entered together at different times; they appear to Have been at the close of the day—I received sums as paid from Mr. Moasop after that day—I find an entry, which I believe is Mr. Broderick's writing, on 23rd May—I received no sum of the prisoner as relating to the 16th May, after that time; no I O U was paid to me.</p>

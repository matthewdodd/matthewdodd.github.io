One Evidence depos'd, That he going upon the Common to look for a stray'd Horse, saw two Mares feeding, and the Prisoner hid in a Bush near them, that, describing a Horse he wanted, the Prisoner told them he believed he was in the Bottom, and ask'd them, if they came to fetch them Mares to go to Hertford Fair the next Day. So he supposing they were Strays, and did not belong to the Prisoner, thought to have carried them to the Pound till they should be inquir'd after by the Owner; and being about to drive them away, the Prisoner saddled one and bridled the other, and carried them away; that they secur'd the Prisoner and had him before the Justice, and there he said they were his own. The Prisoner prov'd in Court they were his own Mares, so the Jury <rs id="t17221205-37-verdict200" type="verdictDescription">

I am one of the City constables: I was sent for on Monday, the 2d of February, by the last witness; I went up to the prisoner, and said to him, my good man, where are you going with these two cows; he said, I am going out of the market with them; I said, it is very odd you should go out of the market with them, just as you come into it, before you sell them; who do they belong to, says I: he said, a gentleman; I asked him where the gentleman was; he said, he would be here by and by; I told him I should keep him in custody, and lock up the cows; I then took him into custody, and locked up the cows at the Raminn; he said they were his cows; I took him to the Compter, and he gave in his name Chalkley, and, instead of that, it was the farmer's name; I was present when Money afterwards saw the cows, and said they were his master's.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. If you had not known your cows were missing, and had seen them in Smithfield-market, would you have said, these are mine? - A.

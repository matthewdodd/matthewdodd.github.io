Last Monday fortnight, about 7 o'clock in the morning, I received information from a policeman, went to the chapel, the door was open, and on entering I found a looking glass and two prints behind the door—they had been in the vestry the evening previous—the poor boxes had been violently taken from their places, and their contents abstracted—I know that there had been money in them—I had left the door double bolted inside, and the person who went out last, went by the vestry door—the property belongs to the Baptist church, meeting in the chapel—I am one of that body—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the articles.</p>

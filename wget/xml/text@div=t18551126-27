                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live in King-street, Covent<lb></lb>garden. On Friday evening, 16th Nov., I was in the shop—the prisoner Scales came in a little after 5 o'clock, just as the gas was lighted—she wanted some paper and gave me a shilling—I said it was bad, and I rung the bell—she told me her name was Ann Walker—I said, "Have you any mother?" she said, "No"—I said, "I will send my young woman with you, you shall not get off so easy "—she said she did not expect to get off go easy—she said, "My brother gave it me to buy the paper; he is going to write a letter "—I asked where her brother was, she said he was outside—I sent for a policeman—he came in, and the prisoner Johnson followed him in, and said, "What is the matter?"—I told him—he said he was very sorry indeed, and he offered me a good shilling for the bad one—the police<lb></lb>man said, "I don't think this lady will take the shilling"—I said I should be very sorry to do anything to hurt a child having no mother or father—Johnson said, "I will go to the station with you"—he said he gave the child the shilling, that he had received change for a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—Scales was taken to the station—Johnson said, "I will go and tell the inspector the truth, that I gave her the shilling"—he went with us as far as the corner of Russell-street—he then ran away—I heard no more of him till the Sunday morning, when I was sent for to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Johnson's Defence.</hi> On the Friday my brother called and asked me to lend him five shillings, I went to borrow them; I met him and gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece to take what he wanted; this girl came up, and I said to her, "Wait here;" my brother said, "When are you going to write to your uncle?" I said I would do so at once, and I gave the child a shilling to get some paper; while she was gone my brother left; I went round the corner and saw the child in the shop; I asked what was the matter, she said it was a bad shilling; I said to the lady, "I will give you another;" she said she would not take it, being persuaded by her next door neighbour; the shilling passed through several hands; the lady said she would give the child into custody; I said I would go and bring the person from whom I had got it; while I was going, I thought as I had had a quarrel with my brother that he gave it to the child to serve me a trick; I ran away, and met my brother; I taxed him with having given the child a bad shilling; he said he had not, I asked him to come and see the child and get her away; he said it was useless, as the child had probably been discharged; with respect to the money found upon me, I had felt very much annoyed on the Saturday morning, and did not go to work; I met a friend who was employed, and we met some friends, and went to a public house and a gentleman came in and pulled this hat on my eyes, and as to where the money came from I know nothing about; what is easier than for two or three pieces of coin to be slipped into one's pocket? we find, repeatedly, that thieves do nothing but take purses, and empty them, and put them in some one else's pocket; this hat is not mine (<hi rend="italic">putting it on his head</hi>) it is a great deal too big for me; my hat was altogether different to this, as this child will acknowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of things were they - A. Different kind of wearing apparel; my mistress sent me down to Mrs. Edwards about it; I told her that my box was broken open, and a great many things broken open; she said she knew nothing of it: I told her she must have duplicates of the things; she denied at first having any, afterwards she delivered them up to me; I had four duplicates from the daughter, and the others of Mrs. Edwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. It is her daughter-in-law, is it not - A. It is her own daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the girl delivered up four duplicates to you - A. Yes; I put them all together; I cannot distinguish one from the other; they were all delivered to Humphreys , a Bow-street officer.</p>

               <p>Q. Now tell us what of your mistress's were lost at that time, and since have been found - A. There are gowns, stockings, shirts, frocks, pinafores, and muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. You and your mistress were just returned from the country - A. Yes. I knew where they were always kept, and they were under my care; I put them in the drawers and gave my mistress the key, and when I returned I found the drawers broken open, and the things gone.</p>

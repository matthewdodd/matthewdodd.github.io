            . On the 29th of June I sat up till between the hours of twelve and one o'clock, with my wife, apprentice, and journyman: the house was made fast when we went to bed, and between the hours of two and three the watchman call'd me up, and said our house was rob'd. I got up, and at that time miss'd nothing. When the children got up and went to be dress'd we miss'd the child's coat and stay; then we went to searching and miss'd the tea-chest, and other things. I went and described the things lost to several pawnbrokers round about, and when I came home the spoons were stop'd at one of them, who sent for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175107030004"></xptr> me. I went to the pawn-broker's where

             was stop'd with them, and also another woman who made her escape afterwards. I took the women to a publick house, they beg'd I would not make any disturbance and they would have me to the person that broke open my house, &amp;c. I took her that is got away to snew me the boy, and left the prisoner in custody. She went with me to Cable-street, to a house of very ill same where Young was (one Stitchbourne keeps the house). The woman gave me the signal, the boy got up and crept under my arm to get away, but I took hold on him, and took him over to the sign of the Blew Anchor, where the prisoner, Hughs, was to be brought: there my journyman demanded of him, what he had done with the goods. Young said, he would let us know where every thing was, and that the tea-chest was then at his washerwoman's, and the woman that is got away, who lodged at that house, had bought it of him for half a pint of All-sorts. The woman who bought it went with me there, and took it out of a cupboard under the stairs, it had one of my child's petticoats lap'd round it. I brought the washerwoman's husband with me to the Blue Anchor, he is a watchman, then I had four of them. While I was in the house

             came in and whisper'd to the prisoner, Young, they had some money in their hands. I ask'd him, what was that woman's business? he said, this is the woman that has bought the child's coat, and the things belonging to it. Then I had five of them. I went to Justice Manwaring and told him the affair, he order'd me to bring them to him. I took them there, all but the person who made her escape, and the boy confess'd the fact, saying, he broke the house open between two and three o'clock, and went in and took the things mentioned. The goods were produced in court, except one canister which was lost. The spoons and tongs were mark'd J. M. M.</p>

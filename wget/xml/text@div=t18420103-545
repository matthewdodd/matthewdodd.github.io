                  </hi>. I am a servant out of place; I have been living at Camden Town for two months, and left my place last Thursday; I now live in Tottenham-place, Tottenham-court-road. On Sunday evening I bad been into the City to see a few friends, who I lodged with when I came up to London, and was returning home at eleven o'clock in the evening—I saw a man in Tottenham-court-road, and asked him what the time was—he told me—while I was talking to him, a man came up with some tarts for sale—I bought one of him for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I took from my pocket—I did not take more money out—I had five shillings and two sixpences loose in my pocket—I felt it when I took out the penny-piece—I had more half-pence there—I asked the man who told me the time if he would take a little of my tart—I had began to eat it—he refused, and offered to treat me to something to drink for my kindness—he was a respectable looking nan—I refused to have any thing to drink, and in the meantime the pri<lb></lb>soner came up—she was dressed as she is now, only with a bonnet on—she shook hands with the man—he asked her to go and have something to drink, and told her he had been asking me, and I had refused—she said, "Come along, my dear, I will see you are righted"—I did not understand what that meant—I went with her to a public-house in Tottenham-court-road—I do not know the name of it—we had a quartern of rum there, a glass each—we then came out, and I found the rum took an effect on me—it rather overcame me, not being used to it—I had not drank any thing more in the course of the day—I was turning to go home, which was not far from there, and the prisoner called me—I was very cold at the time, and asked if I could go any where to warm myself—I did not know whether there would be a fire at my lodging—I lodge with another female—the prisoner called me and said she would take me to warm myself—I went with her and the man into another public-house—I do not know the name of the street—they took me down two or three streets—there was a fire there, but we did not go to warm ourselves—they had a quartern of rum, and asked me to take some, but I did not—they drank it—I drank nothing there—we came out, and I asked the prisoner to direct me to Tottenham-court-road—she said, "Yes, come with me, I will take you there"—the man said he was going to a friend's house, and we were to go together—we all three went together—they took me down a street, knocked at a door, and a widow came to the door—the prisoner said, "I shan't go in, you shall go in, you will get op better than me, I will wait"—I did not know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201030112"></xptr>
               <p>what she meant—I and the man went into the passage, and the man was talking to the woman—she wanted 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of him, and he would only give a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they talked about a room, and when I heard that I thought it was a disreputable house, and I returned out—the man followed me out, and immediately I got out I met the prisoner, but I never saw the man again—I told the prisoner I was very cold, and asked her if she could take me somewhere to warm myself, or tell me my right road—she said, "Come with me and I will," and in the meantime I searched my pocket—my money was quite safe—we were walking down the street, and I felt her hand in my pocket—I am a stranger in London—I have only been here two months—I came from Gloucester—I am twenty-two years old—I lived with Madame Niblet, at Gloucester, two years and a half.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to go with the prisoner after her taking you to a dis<lb></lb>reputable house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know my way—she was to show me my way to my lodging—I told her about the house being disreputable—she said, "I thought you would get on better than me; I thought you would have had half-a-sovereign of him; he is a man of plenty of money, and I know him very well"—I said I was very sorry, because I did not know any thing about the man, nor her either, and asked if she would put me in my way home—when I found her hand in my pocket I stopped at the door of a house, and accused her of it—she said she had no money at all—I sat down there—nothing was the matter with me then—the rum only overcame me just as I took it—I searched for my money, and told her she must have picked my pocket—she said she had no money at all—I missed my handkerchief off my neck—it had been only just put on and tied in one how—she said she had not seen it—I missed all my money, halfpence and all—I had nothing left in my pocket but a pen-knife and key—after I found my pocket picked I told her I was very cold, and asked her to take me somewhere to warm myself—she said she had no money, or she would take me to a coffee-shop—a policeman then came up—the prisoner said she would not believe I had lost my money, and she wished to search my pocket before the policeman—she did search, and did not find my money—I accused her of robbing me when the policeman came up—he asked her about it, and she said she had no money at all, he was quite welcome to take her—the policeman took us both to the station, and when she was warming herself there I saw my handkerchief round her neck—that was when she was going to be searched—I told the policeman it was my hand<lb></lb>kerchief—she said nothing—she went out of the station to be searched, and when she came back she had it still on her neck—I told her it was mine, and she said it was hers—this now produced is it—I had only had it three days—I gave 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it in Tottenham-court-road—I am quite sure it is the same—it is not marked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I deny a great deal of it; she says it was eleven o'clock; it was just ten minutes to twelve when I saw her and the man talking to<lb></lb>gether. I knew the man by sight, and he asked me to go and have the rum. The prosecutrix and I were both tipsy—I left her talking to the man: she proposed going into the house with him, and said, "If I get half-a-sovereign, I will give you half of it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is very wrong—the prisoner did not appear tipsy when I met her, nor afterwards—I was not locked out of my lodging—I had the key to get into the house—I never saw the prisoner before—I never said any thing about half-a-sovereign to her—she said, "You ought to have got</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201030113"></xptr>
               <p>half-a-sovereign out of him"—I understood what that meant, and I told her I did not know but it was a respectable house—the man had not said any thing to me before I went in; but, speaking to the woman as he did, I thought it was a disreputable house, and turned out—I thought I was going to warm myself, I did not know he wanted any thing improper—I did Dot suspect any thing of the sort till then—I am not often out at late as that, and was never spoken to so before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 26.) About two o'clock, last Tues<lb></lb>day morning, I saw the prosecutrix standing against the door of No. 10, Upper Cleveland-street, New-road, and the prisoner with her hand under<lb></lb>neath the prosecutrix's gown—I went up to them—the prosecutrix said the prisoner had robbed her of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner said she had no money about her, nor the prosecutrix either, and asked if she might search the prose<lb></lb>cutrix's pockets in my presence—she did so, and took a pen-knife and a key from her pocket—the prisoner asked me if I could tell her where she could take the prosecutrix to warm herself—I said I could not—she said the prosecutrix had no money; if she had, she would take her to a coffee-shop in the New-road—I took them both to the station, and there the pri<lb></lb>soner said she had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her pocket, and that was all the money she had about her—they both appeared to be quite sober—the prisoner was taken into another room to be searched, and when she came out the prose<lb></lb>cutrix said she had got her handkerchief on her neck—I took it off her neck, and the prisoner said it was hers, that she picked it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Chapman. I was employed to search the prisoner—we were in a room by ourselves.

                  </hi>. I am the agent of William M'Kenzie, of Glasgow, and carry on business as a publisher at No. 22, Paternoster-row. On 27th June the prisoner called on me; he stated that he had been with our Liver<lb></lb>pool agent, travelling for him in Birmingham, last year, for about, two months; that he had been very successful during that time, he had been drawing 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week as commission, and that he merely gave up our agency then to take to a permanent agency; and he relinquished that as business was rather slack at the time—he anted me if I would give him a specimen of the same work for which he canvassed in Birmingham—I did so—it was the "Imperial Journal of Arts, Sciences, Mechanics, and Engineering"—he then went away, taking it with him, and next day, returned with the same list which I had given him, with six names and addresses on it—he said that they were subscribers who he had got to the work, and that they were the signatures of the parties, with the exception of one, Gunning and Quarrell—he asked me if I would advance him a sove<lb></lb>reign upon them, and believing his representation that the signatures were genuine, I did so—on the 29th he called on me, and said that he had got seven more signatures—I made inquiries, and in consequence of what I learned, I gave him in custody on 14th July—I found that the names were all fictitious.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of King-street, Cheapside, in partnership with Mr. Ledbury. Early in Nov. I was employed by the defendant's creditors to look into their accounts—I first communicated with the defendants on 5th Nov., and went through their books with their assistance, and that of their clerk; and likewise made the necessary inquiries of them—I attained a certain result, which I mentioned to them—I told them that there appeared to be a deficiency between their debts and assets of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they had been in business about thirteen months—the deficiency bad occurred during that time—they stated their capital to have been, I think, about 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not count that capital in the deficiency—adding that capital would increase the deficiency to 3,230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in speaking of the assets, I speak of the assets which we could find on the premises—they accounted to me for the deficiency by stating that they had had great losses by selling their goods at a sacrifice—I did not find out what had been the loss each month since they had been in business—they gave an account of about l,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of goods that had been pledged with Monastery and Co., and they gave me up seventeen pawn deposit notes, I think amounting to about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which I have given credit in the assets—I think there is a surplus of between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between the amount they were pawned for and what they ultimately fetched.</p>

               <p>so—I swear that—they stated they had redeemed goods from time to time, but did not give me the amount—I did not look to the books to ascertain the amounts that were redeemed—I never have done so—I had no opportunity—I only had the books for a short time—there were entries in the books of what had been pledged—I do not think there were entries of what had been redeemed—they read from the books on the opposite side of the table, and I wrote it down—it was at a private meeting of creditors—I believe the books did contain to some extent an account of their redeemings—their debts were 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upwards, and their assets 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upwards—I am speaking from memory—I have a memorandum here, made by my clerk—the assets were, I think, 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and consisted of the stock in trade, fixtures, furniture, and a surplus of goods in pledge, a surplus above the amount advanced on them—the amount of the stock was between 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—fixtures and altogether, including some pianofortes, which they had bought on speculation, I believe the amount was about 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have the items here—I ascertained the value of the stock in trade by taking it down with the aid of their own people at the cost price—Ellis and Everington's account in the books appears to be an account of barter of umbrellas and parasols sold to them on the one hand, and on the other of silks bought of them—I cannot tell you the amount of goods purchased by Ellis and Everington—it is spread over a long period—it may probably amount to 1,477<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the books do not show the cost price of those articles—I have not seen in the books that the cost price of those goods was 1,724<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not seen the books since they were declared bankrupts—I am not accountant under the bankruptcy—I do not know whether the books show a loss by the bankrupts in their dealings with Ellis and Everington to the amount of 246<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Pawsons—it was not a meeting of creditors—I am not aware whether the prisoners had sent for Mr. Foot—when I went there Mr. Howell, of the firm of Ellis and Co., Mr. Pawson, Mr. Foot, Woolf,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202020041"></xptr>
               <p>Lyons, and Messrs. Ellis's solicitor, Mr. Parker, were there, and a Mr. Jenkinson, came afterwards—the creditors asked the state of their affairs, and they said they could not tell the particulars, they were insolvent, and the creditors then requested them to execute an assignment and to sign a decla<lb></lb>ration of insolvency, both of which they did—I have no recollection of any other material fact—there was conversation about the state of their affairs, and that was the result—the bankrupts did not state that the cause of their bankruptcy was the requirement by Foot of security for a contract which he had entered into with them to the amount of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it did not happen when I was present—I do not know that I ever heard of it—I could not have forgotten it if I had—I may say I never heard of it—the assignment and declaration were printed forms, and were filled up in the counting house by Mr. Parker, the solicitor—I do not think that it was arranged that Mr. Jenkinson should write to the creditors generally—I do not know whether he had written before—Mr. Jenkinson was Mr. Foot's solicitor—from Messrs. Pawson's counting house we went to the bankrupt's warehouse, where they gave me up the keys, and I put a person in possession under the deed—I went to the warehouse for that purpose—my assistant went with me, and I there met one of the warehousemen of these wholesale houses, I forget which, standing at the door, I think he was from Ellis and Everington's or Pawson's—I do not know his name, he had been in—the bankrupts did not in my presence, at Messrs. Pawson's or at their own warehouse, ask permission to send for their solicitor—I did not hear any one, either from Ellis's or Pawson's, say that there was no necessity for it, and that they would protect the bank<lb></lb>rupts—nothing of the sort was said to them in my presence before they executed the declaration and the assignment—they assisted me in examining their books for about a week or ten days, and their clerk also—they rendered roe every assistance in their power, as far as I could form any judgment—I am not aware that they had bought and paid for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of cane in Oct.—they did not tell me so—no doubt there was as much as 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of cane on the premises, but I do not know when it was bought—cane is used in making parasols—I have no doubt there was an invoice of this cane, but I never saw it—I have not looked over the invoices.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have mentioned that you took down the stock from their own statement; had you any other means of testing the value? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A reference to the invoices would have tested it—I requested one of the creditors to test it, but I did not do it myself—I only took the value of the stock from their statement—the stock realised about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,100l,—I did not ascertain the result of the running account with Ellis and Everington, the books were in a very confused state, and they had much difficulty in giving information on any point—they did not tell me what the balance was between them and Ellis and Everington—I took down on that paper their statement of what they had sold to Ellis and Everington, and of the loss they said they had sustained—I did not examine the books, they were read to me from the opposite side of the table—there are two kinds of pledging, one by which they pledged goods, and the other what they said was a sale—I have not seen the word "pledging" at all in the books (<hi rend="italic">referring to the books</hi>)—there is the word "borrowed" in the cash account—I do not see the word "pledged"—it simply says "borrowed," without any name to it, "59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." and various sums—I have not seen any stock book showing what became of the stock when it went to the pawnbrokers—I also find the words, "loam re-paid"—I likewise find the word "silkman," and against it, 163<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that sum is under date, 9th May, 1851—there are two other entries of</p>

                  </hi>. I am an official assignee of the Court of Bankruptcy.

I know Lyons—on 25th Sept he came into the warehouse, and was shown a parcel of glace silks by Mr. Churchill—he was also offered a parcel of figured silks—he bought one piece to take home, to try if it was suitable for parasols—there was seventy-nine yards of it, at 21 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which came to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was sent home to him—it was on a Thursday, and I did not see him again; but on the Saturday I saw some more goods sent to the entering-room, to be sent to him—they were the figured silks which had been shown to him on the Thursday—there were 6,316 1/2 yards, and the piece which we sent before—I made no arrangement as to what account that was to go down in with Lyons—it is the course of our business, when we are sending out goods, to send them first into the entering-room—these goods were so sent from our room.</p>

Ellis and Everington to take them back—the figured silks were of a variety of colours—they were thin silks—I do not know the amount of goods purchased of us by the defendants.</p>

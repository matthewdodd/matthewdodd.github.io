Sears and Co.—the firm, I believe, consists of two persons—I knew French some years ago, but had lost sight of him several years—early in April he came into the Duke of Clarence public-house, where I was, and said that he wanted about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of wine—I took him over to my stores, and introduced him to my stock-manager, Mr. Vickers—some wine was tasted, and an order was given to the amount of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that he was a provision—dealer, and wanted it for captains, to facilitate business—Mr. Vickers asked him for a reference, stating that the terms were cash and discount, or a bill at three months—when we left the stores I told him that it was a larger amount than I felt justified in executing, and he said that he would leave it in my hands to reduce it to the amount previously stated, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we went to the Duke of Clarence again, and an arrangement was made that I should meet him at the Black Prince, Waterloo-road—I did so on Wednesday, and the first thing he said was, "What is the reason my order is not executed?"—I said, "You said that you could give a reference, and we have had no name give to us"—he said, "Oh, my dear fellow, I can give you forty," but he mentioned no name—he asked me bow I should be situated the following morning, and I appointed to meet him at Aldgate Church—I did so, and we proceeded to High-street, Whitechapel—he did not mention the name of any reference during the walk, but when we got within a few steps of the premises of Merry and Nutter, I saw a person of the appearance of a gentleman, standing on the steps, leaning against the doorpost, with a pen behind his ear—French said "There is Mr. Henry Nutter; wait while I speak to him"—he went up to the person, topped with him half a minute, and then turned back to me, and said, "Mr. Nutter will tell you all that you require."—I went up to the gentle-man, and said, "Mr. Nutter, I presume?"—he nodded—I repeated the ques<lb></lb>tion, and he said, "That is my name"—I asked him if Mr. French was trust<lb></lb>worthy to the amount of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Perfectly"—I said "He might be, in the provision line, but would he be for a luxury?"—he said, "What do you call a luxury?"—I said, "Wine"—he said, "Perfectly, for we as fre<lb></lb>quently owe him money as he does us," that he was perfectly solvent, and we need not have the slightest fear—I returned, and made a report to Mr. Vickers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the stores of Levaux &amp; Co. King's-Arms-yard, Tooley-street—about 8th or 10th April, French came with Fitehett—French proposed to buy some wine, and said that his object in coming to us was, that he should get something good for the particular class of trade which he had, the provision trade; as it was to give to parties with whom he was doing business, to tempt his customers to business—he mentioned captains—he gave me an order amounting to about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that I could not undertake it unless he gave us satisfactory references—he said that he should be able to give most satisfactory references—on 6th January, I desired Fitehett to inquire into the character of the supposed references, and some days afterwards he made a report to me in consequence of which I allowed the goods to be delivered—it had been reduced to 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time—he gave me this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) when he was intro<lb></lb>duced—Bell is the person to whom the goods were delivered on 16th April—he produced a card similar to the one French gave me, in consequence of which I gave directions to the warehouseman—I did not see the wine delivered, but two dozen only were delivered at first, as I was very busy—I was present the second time Bell came, but did not see any part of the goods delivered to him—I saw a bottle of wine at the police-office—I did not taste it, but from its peculiar structure and seal I had no doubt it was mine—after the order was executed, French came again, and we arranged to take a bill at three months, on the presumption that the references were right—the bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was drawn in our counting-house and forwarded on the Tuesday to the address on the card which French gave, and it after<lb></lb>wards returned accepted—we acknowledged it, and afterwards received back from the Post-office this envelope of our letter, marked <hi rend="italic">"Gone away; not known where.</hi>"</p>

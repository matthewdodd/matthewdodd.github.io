            . I was night constable. The prisoners were searched in my presence; the handkerchief was in the seat of Turner's trousers - he had only one handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Turner. He took it out of the side of my pocket, Witness. I felt he had something very bulky, and told him to unbutton his trousers; he rather shifted it round to the side of his trousers - it was not in his pocket at all.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>
               <p>Turner's Defence. I left home to go to a stationer's in Tooley-street, and in the dark part of the bridge I kicked something - I found it was this handkerchief; I went after one gentleman, and asked if it belonged to him; he said No; I then met Reardon - two gentlemen came and took him; they then said they might as well take me.</p>
               <p>Reardon's Defence. I met this young man on the bridge, and asked how he did - he did not tell me he had found the handkerchief.</p>

               <p>How did you know them to be your's? - By a bit of skin being cut off the neck.</p>
               <p>Do you cut the skin off the neck of all you kill? - I do, all that I leave at that slaughter-house; I swear the two sides to be mine.</p>
               <p>Did you find the whole, or only a part? - I found the whole in four quarters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. This was not an intire sow? - No, Sir, the intrails were taken out.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you sell a dead sow with the intrails? - No, I sell only the hog or sow dressed for sale; I buy a live hog or sow, and kill it and sell it as other pork butchers do.</p>
               <p>Suppose you sell a sow dead, do you call it pork or a dead sow? - I call it a dead sow, because she was too heavy to be called pork.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This cannot be called a dead sow, being robbed of its intrails, it is no longer an animal; the feet and ears, head and entrails were all cut off; therefore it is no longer an animal; if you were to bargain with a man, would you ask for a dead sow? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Should you think that I performed my contract to sell you a sow without a head, ears, feet and intrails; was it a part of a dead sow, or a whole dead sow? - It was only a part of a dead sow.</p>
               <p>When had you seen this last? - On Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Did you cut it up yourself? - I took the entrails out myself, when I first saw it; the two fore quarters were found upon the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Did you put any mark upon it? - I did put my name upon it.</p>
               <p>Was the whole of it in the watch-house, or only part of it? - We pursued the other two men, and they each dropped a part, but we could not take them; but brought the other two quarters to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Where did you shew the prosecutor these parts of the sow you found? - In the watch-house; he said there was a bit cut out of the skin of the neck, and out of the hind quarter and off the tail.</p>
               <p>Court. How did you mark them? - With a pen and ink.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they the same you took to the watch-house? - Yes.</p>

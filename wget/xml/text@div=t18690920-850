I am principal entering-clerk in the employment of Messrs, Boyd &amp; Co.—on 13th September, about 4 o'clock, the prisoner came into the room—I asked him who he was waiting for?—he said, "Goods for Messrs, Gall and Anderson, of Camden Town"—I asked him to sign the book, and he signed in my presence—"Gall &amp; Co., Camden Town. D. Jones."—I asked him if he had an order, and he produced this, "High Street, Camden Town. Please send by bearer, two pieces Irish linen. Gall &amp; Anderson. To Messrs. Boyd &amp; Co., Friday Street"—I asked him whose writing it was, and he said, "Mr. Anderson's"—I asked him how long he had been there, and he said "Seven months"—I asked him to go up stairs with me, and took him into the private counting-house—before that he said they wanted the goods particularly, and had sent him down instead of the porter—I shut the door of the counting-house and went down stairs—he came out and said we could send the goods up; he did not care about waiting—I said, "That differs from what you said down stain" he then said he would go to Messrs. Leafs and come back again—Itold him he could not go—he said "Why not?"—I told him I did not believe the order was in Mr. Anderson's writing—he snatched the order from me, and tore it in half—I sent for a policeman, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

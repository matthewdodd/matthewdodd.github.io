             sworn. - Q.Where do you live? - A. In North-row, Grosvenor-square; the prisoner lodged with me, but not his wife and child: On Saturday, the 4th of December, she came, with the child, and slept with him at my house, and I saw them all three together on Sunday morning, when they breakfasted with me and my wife, between nine and ten o'clock; after which we had each a glass of rum, and I saw him, his wife and child go together form my house at about ten o'clock; I did not see him again til the evening, about half past eight, after I came from chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any enquiry after his wife and child? - A. Not that Sunday, but the Sunday following he did; I had been to Highgate, and I believe he had been to Barnet; on his return he called for me at my mother in-law's at Highgate; her name is young; I believe he had called for me there once before in the summer; as the prisoner, my brother-in-law, and I were coming to town the Sunday after the prisoner's wife's death, he asked me if his wife had been at my house; I replied, no, not as I knew of, for I had been out in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his wife usually call upon him in her course of the week? - A.sometimes on a Saturday, and sometimes on Monday or Tuesday, but generally twice a week for some little matter of subsistence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they live on good terms together? - A. It appeared to me, when I have heard his wife speak, that they were not on good terms,and from him the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they lived together at all during the time he lodged with you? - A. No; he lodged with me about half a year, or three quarters of a year; the good woman wished to be taken home as his wife, I have no doubt; and I verily believe that was the sentiments of her heart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. If I understand you, his wife used to come and sleep with him on Saturday nights? - A. Yes; she did not sleep many times at my house, it might be three or four times; she used to come about six o'clock to receive a little money, and stand in the street till such time a she left his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she had been addicted to drinking? - A. I never saw her in liquor; I have seen her but few times.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps no at all previous to her going to the work-house? - A. I believe never.</p>
               <p>Q. What her habits of life were you don't know? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. you have said, they left your house on the Sunday morning, and he returned abut eight in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He said nothing about his wife? - A. No, not till the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there had been no rumour that she was lost? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he enquired whether you had seen her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As she was in the habit of coming to see him on a Saturday night, he was surprised at not seeing her? - A. I cannot say whether he was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his business? - A. A barnessmaker.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he went to his work regular after the Sunday you last saw his wife? - A.Exactly; he came constant to his home, and went constant to his work.</p>
               <p>Q. And as soon as he had an opportunity of speaking to you at Highgate, he asked you if you had seen his wife? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Then you only speak from a recollection that it was dark at the time? - A. Yes; it was not quite dark, there was a kind of fog coming on.</p>
               <p>Q.Might it not be the effect of the fog? - A. It must be half past four I am certain; because my mistress came into the tap-room for a candle.</p>

               <p>Q.Do you know where Mr. Fillingham lives - was not by his house the nearest road? - A. Yes; but they did not go across the fields to Mr. Fillingham's house, they kept along side the canal.</p>
               <p>Q. The way they went, was not there a path by the canl, and a paling? - A. Mr. Fillingham's paling is about ten feet from the water.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is a person who goes that way obliged; to walk inside or outside the paling? - A.Outside; but nobody has any busness along there, for there is a couple of gates put up with bushes on them to prevent any body getting over.</p>
               <p>Q.Is there not a large stump of a tree place by the gate, upon which persons step and get over? - A. No; but there are plenty of places where they may get over into Mr. Fillingham's fields, but that is not the road or path.</p>
               <p>Q.You cannot say whether they went over his fields or not? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.Which is the proper road for travellers, or which people usually take? - A. The towing-path. They had got past the path that goes to Mr. Fillingham's when I last saw them, but had not got to the gates with the bushes, which was about two hundred yardsw distant.</p>

               <p>Q. Did either of them appear to be the worse for liquor? - A. Not the least that I observed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks of violence, either on the mother or child? - A. Not the least; I had a surgeon to examine the child.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the child's arm broke? - A. No such thing, there was not the least bruise.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the verdict of the Corner's Jury? - A.Accidental death.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you taken a view of the place in which this act is supposed to have been committed? - A. Yes, I know it very well.</p>
               <p>Q.Describe whether going round by Mr. Fillingham's house is the shortest way to London or not, from the Mtre? - A. A considerable deal; if you go round by the towing-path, you must go by the canal all the way; it is a very short distance from the canal to Mr. Fillingham's house; between the rail and the side of the river it is impossible to walk with safety, it is so slippery it is likde soap: it is a very little way to Mr. Fillingham's, which is a good road, and then pass the house into the Harrow-road.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Can you state the distance from the Mitre tavern to Whetstone? - A. I suppose ten miles.</p>
               <p>Q.How fae, going by the lanes? - A. I cannot tell which way to go by lanes; there may be a shorter way through that part of the country, but I should think that would be seven or eight miles, and from Whestone back again about nine, altogether about sixteen miles.</p>

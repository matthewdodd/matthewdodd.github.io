               <p>I am a widow; on Wednesday the 12th of June last, I lost seven yards of thread lace, about four or five in the afternoon; I had been robbed the week before; the same thieves that robbed me before, came to me again; I lost it in <placeName id="t17860719-68-crimeloc335">Rosemary-lane</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me pick it off the stones? - No, I saw him open it.</p>
               <p>Did not you say it was the woman in the brown gown that took it? - No, that was another man.</p>

               <p>I had been into the fair, and bought this coat and hat, and I found the lace on the stones, the prosecutor came up to me and said it was hers, and I gave it to her, and she went to the stall and stood there a few minutes, and came back again and seized me by the wrist, and said it was taken by a woman, and I must know the woman, I had no man or woman with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at No. 2, Church-street, Cumberland-street, Shoreditch. The prisoner is my wife—we have been mar<lb></lb>ried nearly two years—on the 27th of June I was in the lower part of the house with Timothy Murphy, who lodges in the house—I heard the prisoner come into the passage, and go up stairs—it was nearly twelve o'clock at night—I followed her up stairs, and on entering the room she asked me where Brown Betsey was—that is my niece—I told her she was not troubling her, and she ought to let her be—she asked me then to give her the money she had lent me in the morning, which was 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave it to heir—there were a good many words passed between us which I cannot recollect, and then we pushed each other, and she took up a saucer which was on the table, threw it at me, and struck me on the head twice—I caught hold of her and shook her—she caught hold of me by the neck-handkerchief, and took up a poker from the fire-place, and when I was in the act of getting her hands clear out of my handkerchief, she hit me with the poker on the head several times—I used her rougher than I should wish, on being in the predicament I was in—I several times asked her to let me go, and she would not; and when I got her hand clear of my handkerchief I had both hands at liberty, and pulled the poker away from her—my head was cut in three places—I threw the poker out on the landing, or down stairs, I caught hold of her, and put her out after it—I pushed her out, and she fell outside the door—she went down stairs afterwards—I went down after her—she got a policeman—he was standing at the door when I came down—I gave her into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Bunhill-row. On Sa-turday night, June 27th, I was sent for to the police-station—I examined the prosecutor's head, and found three serious scalp wounds—they were serious combined, each wound of itself was not serious, but from the number they were serious, if not dangerous—one on the forehead laid the scalp bare about an inch and a half—the one on the back of the head was not so large—the third was a punctured wound on the top of the head—he was much excited, which I think was from the contest—he did not appear intoxicated—if he danced and drank afterwards, that would be calculated to increase the danger—when I saw him again the symptoms were augmented, but next time the wounds were nearly healed—I do not think it would require great force to inflict the wounds—it was merely the skin laid open—I should say the man's scuffling would much impair the power of the party as-saulting.</p>

On the 21st of February I received information from another servant; I sent for an officer (her box had been examined previously by my wife and a servant). I desired her to go up stairs, and open her box; she took the key, opened it, and I found the articles stated in the indictment in it, and a purse containing 1 l. 2 s. 6 d. As I came to each article she said she had purchased them out of the shop, and put the money into the till. It is customary, when shopwomen want things, to have them put down to them - she had a bottle put down against her wages: when I came to the gold ring, she said a friend of her mother's gave it to her.</p>

She had run up stairs, and locked her box, on hearing she was to be questioned; it is impossible for me to ascertain whether they have been paid for.</p>

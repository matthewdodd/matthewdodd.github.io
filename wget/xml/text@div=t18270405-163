            . I am a silver-smith, and live in Pump-row. On the evening of the 27th of February, about seven o'clock, I heard a rumbling in Mr. Pearce's house, which is next to mine, and had been left closed at 5 o'clock that afternoon; my wife had been out on an errand, and when she came home Henry Pearce was at the door; we inquired of him if he had been into the house, he said No- I then came out and looked through the key-hole, and saw four lads in the shop, scooping up pearl-ashes into bags - I knocked at the door, and then the light disappeared; I went to my own back yard, but there was no one there - they then went to the front of the house, and went back again and got into another house - I sent round to North-street, to tell the persons there, if they got into their back yards to stop them - I went into the house, and found a hole in the roof - we found they had got up there from the garret cieling to another house, and from thence into the street.</p>

I was coming out of my own house, and saw the persons round the door of No. 13; I was informed some thieves had been in that house and got out at the top - I crossed the way to see if I could see them running along the gutters, and saw four boys run along the road by me, the prisoner was one, and I laid hold of him - I took him back to the crowd, and he was recognised as one of the boys who came from No. 10 - he said he was running after a coach.</p>

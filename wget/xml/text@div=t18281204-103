            . I am a pawnbroker. I have a gown, a spoon, two sheets, a flannel waistcoat, a pair of stockings, and a piece of linen, pawned with me by the prisoner at different times, from the 16th of September to the 8th of November; I shewed them all to Mr. Smith, who claimed them.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my service to nurse my wife, and to do domestic work; she was in my regular service from the 4th or 5th of September, to the 14th of November - I had the greatest confidence in her; I have looked at these articles, and, to the best of my belief, they are mine - I can swear to this spoon, and these sheets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you present when she was taken up? A. Yes, Sir; Mrs. Smith is very ill, and has been in a bad state of health for years; she has kept her bed from the 4th of September - the prisoner did say Mrs. Smith sent her to pawn them, and that she had given Mrs. Smith the duplicates, but my wife denied it; the prisoner did not deny pawning them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prisoner ever taken to your house? A. No; the articles were pawned in three different names.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Smith knew of my pawning the things, to get various little things which Mr. Smith did not allow her, grapes, pastry, and liquor; if I had had millions of money, I might have laid it out for her; I laid out all my wages. and when I had no more, I thought it no harm to take various things to get them, till we could redeem them.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. I have every thing that is necessary in my house as a medical man, and many of these things were taken when my wife was not able to turn in her bed.</p>

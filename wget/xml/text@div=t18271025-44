On the 24th of September, about twelve o'clock at night, I put a pocket-book, containing all this property, between the sacking and clothes of my own bed; I went to bed then, and am sure it was secure; my wife got up at half-past nine o'clock to let Hurran into the room, to light the fire, as usual; my wife came to bed again, and we both went to sleep; I awoke at half-past ten o'clock, and found myself very cold, and on looking about, I found the window sash was open; we sleep on the ground floor; I called Hurran to shut the window, but received no answer - she was not in the room; I then thought I had been robbed- I opened my pocket-book, which still remained there - it was at the foot of the bed - any one could take it out; I opened it, and missed these notes and gold - the notes were taken from the middle of others which they were folded in, so that at first I did not miss them; Hurran had given us no notice that she was going; I immediately went to Watts' house, in Palace-street, Westminster; nobody was at home; I made inquiry, and saw Watts in the evening at her own house; she came home about eight o'clock- I said, "What have you done with your sister, and the money she has stolen?" she said she knew nothing about her, or the money; I sent for an officer, and in a small bundle, which she had in her hand, we found a pair of stockings and a new pair of boots, with three sovereigns in the toe of them; I asked how she came by that money; she said, "You can't swear to sovereigns;" I said, "But I can swear to one of the stockings, which the money is wrapped in, for here is the fellow to it;" she began to cry; I said if she would tell me where my property was I did not want to hurt her; I went next morning, with an officer, to No. 133, Bethnal-green, in consequence of what she said to me; it is a private house; Rogers lived there; I asked Rogers where my 20l. note was; I did not say who I was; he said he had changed it next door, at his cousin's; we went there, and found it - it was my 20l. note; I went down to Manningtree, in Essex, on the 26th, and found Hurran there; I got from her part of the change of the 20l. note; I had before that said if she would tell me every thing, I would forgive her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you besides a teacher of self-defence? A. I attend sales, and deal in jewellery or furniture, or any thing; I keep no shop or warehouse to deposit my things - I put them where I think proper; my wife hired Hurran as a servant, in my presence - she was to have wages; we did not ask her character, or where she came from.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do not ladies and gentlemen come to your house? A. Yes; I was never here before - I have once been in a Court of Justice for assaulting an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I caution you, will you swear deliberately that you was never in a Court of Justice but once, and that was for assaulting an officer? A. Yes, I do; I swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in a Court of Justice in Surrey? A. Yes; I was taken up in a waggon coming from the races with a party of six - a party of smashers; there was a parcel of bad money in the machine, and they called me a party concerned; I was tried and imprisoned twelve months, but I was innocent.</p>

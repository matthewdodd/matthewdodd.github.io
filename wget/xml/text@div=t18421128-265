                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Pimlott, my brother-in-law, at Camden-place, Camberwell. The prisoner was servant there—on Friday evening, the 21st of October, about half-past eight o'clock, I went up stairs to take her some gruel, and found her lyng on the bed, with some of the clothes on her, and her own clothes on—she had complained of pain in her stomach before that—I told her she had better undress, and get into bed—see did so—I stopped till she was in bed, and saw blood on her clothes—I said, "Ellen, you are unwell," which is a term females use—she said she was—I said, "You appear to be a great deal so"—she said, yes, she was—I then went down into the parlour, to my sister, and told her what I had seen—Mrs. Long the charwoman, came in—I went up afterwards, but know nothing more—I did not see her after eleven o'clock—I saw her again next morning in bed, and took up a band-box, which was on another box in her bed-room—the band<lb></lb>box felt very heavy—I said, "Ellen, what have you got in this box? stones, or what?"—she said, "I have got gowns and petticoats"—I took off the lid, took out a straw bonnet, and under that thought I saw something like a human body—my sister came into the room, and told Mrs. Long to examine it, and I went from it—I saw her take out the body of a male child—my sister said, "Oh, Ellen, how could you do such a thing as that?"—I did not hear any reply—I did not see her boxes examined, and saw no baby linen found—she was first taken ill about four or five o'clock—she had done her work up to that time—I had observed nothing to induce me to think her in the family way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a charwoman. On this Friday evening I went to Mr. Pimlott's house, and went up to the prisoner about ten o'clock in the evening, and found her in bed—I had never seen her before—I asked how she was—she said she was better—I asked how long before she had been unwell—she said two months when she was all right—I observed spots on the floor, and under the carpet, and said I thought it was longer than two months—I have had twelve children myself, and from what I observed I thought there</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Camberwell. I went on Friday evening, at ten o'clock, to Mr. Pimlott's, and saw the prisoner in bed—I asked how she felt—she said, better—I asked the cause of some blood on the floor, which had been pointed out—she said she had been unwell, and it was two or three months since she had been so before—I said it was unusual to lose so much on being unwell suddenly—she said * * * * * * I requested her to show me her breast, which being very dark round the nipple, with the enlargement of some glands, and the appearance of milk on pressure, I told her I felt sure she had been pregnant—nothing more passed that night—I imagined at, that rime that it was an early stage of pregnancy, and that she had miscarried—I gave directions for her treatment, and went away—next morning, at ten o'clock, I was sent for, and went into her room—she was still in bed—I was shown a bundle, which was placed on the floor, and opened—it was a full-grown male—its countenance was distorted—the pupil of the eye dilated, the mouth slightly open—the tongue; protruded, the hands were clenched, and the neck had round it what appeared to be a green ribbon, tied round more than once in a knot—it was tight—the navel string was un<lb></lb>divided—the precenta and membranes attached to the other extremity of it—I asked her how long the child had been born before the after-birth followed—she said about five minutes—I examined her person, and found she had been retently delivered of a child—I examined the child on Sunday morning, the 23rd of October—(<hi rend="italic">The witness here entered into a more minute detail of the circumstances, and, upon his cross-examination, stated that he was unable positively to depose that the birth had been complete before life was extinct, and that the ribbon might have been put round the neck in the agony of labour, she being at the time in a state of unconsciousness.</hi>

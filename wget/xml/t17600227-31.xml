Seeing the prisoner take one down, I went out at the door and saw him with it under his arm. I ran and took hold of him, but he drop'd the coat, and slip'd from me. I ran after him and left the coat on the ground. I took him again, and turn'd about to see for the coat, but it was gone.</p>

               <p>Holgate. I am; and he also own'd he took it, said it was of a blueish colour, and beg'd for mercy. I took him before justice Welch, and when the justice asked him what was become of the coat, he said he could not tell who had it.</p>

On Monday, the 14th of last month, I put 3 guineas, 2 half guineas, and 4 quarter-guineas in a silk purse, into a little loose drawer, in my bed-chamber; I went up for half a guinea to change a guinea on the Wednesday following, and missed the purse and money. Before I came down, the prisoner had put on her hat, and was gone out of the back-door; we inquired about, but could hear nothing of her, till the Friday morning, when a man came and told me, his daughter had been with the prisoner at Gravesend, and she was come home again, and had left the prisoner there.

            , and got a warrant, and took horse, and got the warrant backed by the Mayor of Gravesend. I went to the Three Jackdaws as directed, there they informed me she was at a public house hard by, where we found her in bed fast asleep; I desired the Constable to secure her pocket, there was this handkerchief, (producing one) my property; we found also 18 d. in her pocket, and here is a gold ring, which she owned before the Justice she bought with part of my money; (producing a gold ring.) these are all we found, (She owned to the taking every thing.)</p>
               <p>Latina Turner. The prisoner came to me on the Wednesday, and asked me, if I would go out with her, and said, she would not keep me out above a couple of hours. She took a coach, and we went to the Golden Lion in Kent-street; then she said, there was a young man at Gravesend which she wanted to see, she persuaded me to go there with her. I went with her, and staid there till Thursday. I was very uneasy, because my father did not know I was gone there. I set out on Friday morning for London; when I came to Billingsgate, I was informed, she had robbed her master, then I went and told where she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid your reckonings?</p>
               <p>L. Turner. She did; I saw some little pieces of gold which she had, (a silk purse produced in court) I saw this in her possession at Gravesend.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my purse which the money was in.</p>
               <p>L. Turner. She told me, a young fellow that she went down to see, sent her up a guinea to buy this gold ring, I was with her when she bought it, it cost 12 s. 6 d.</p>

               <p>She knows I had the money two or three days before I left my master's house. I spent some of the money in her father's house, I sent for two quarterns of rum there, and changed a 1 s. and 9 d. piece, when I paid for it. I was the only servant, except a boy, in my master's house. I was up first; there was a club on the Saturday night, and on the Sunday morning I was going to open the door, I trod upon something; I took it up, and heard it chink; I kept it till Tuesday before I used any of it, then I changed one of the 6 s. and 9 d. pieces.</p>

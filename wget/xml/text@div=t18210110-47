I found the street-door and windows fastened. My fellow officers lifted me up to get in at the window, but my foot slipped, and I fell down; the prisoner immediately jumped out of bed, came towards the window, and from under the window, inside, I saw him take a brown paper parcel and throw it towards the stair-case, I was half in at the window then, I called to my brother officers to break open the door, the prisoner was then on the stairs with his shirt on. They broke open the door, and I called to Vann, to see what lay on the stairs. Vann immediately brought me a brown paper parcel - it contained a quantity of notes. I asked him how he came by them? he said</p>
               <p>"I know nothing of those notes." I asked him who lived there? he said nobody but himself, and that young woman, who was his house-keeper (there was a woman in bed with him). I pointed to a looking-glass over the mantle-piece, and said,</p>
               <p>"Whose is that?" he said his, and all the furniture was his. I marked the notes and paper which enclosed them (looking at some notes,) these are them, they were tied up in three rolls - there were two rolls of twenty each and nineteen in the other.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Armstrong, he got in at the window. We broke the door open below, and saw the prisoner in his shirt on the stairs. By Armstrong's direction I found a brown paper parcel on the stairs, and gave it to Armstrong, it contained three rolls of notes tied up close with fine thread. He said the place, was his, and he paid 4 s. a week for it.</p>

               <p>Thomas Grant. I had just received 3 Shirts, 4 Stocks, and two Night-caps, ty'd up in a Linnen Handkerchief, as this Man came begging to the Door. They lay at a little Distance from the Door on the Counter; I was engaged in Business with my Back to the Linnen, and the Man was advanced almost within the Door: I was busy, and not very watchful. I told the Prisoner there was nothing for him, but I was mistaken as it happen'd. He went away; about 4 or 5 Minutes afterwards, I mist it, but thought the Servants might have taken it away. Upon enquiry, I found it was gone, and imagined that this Man must take it. On the Monday following he came again, and I seized him with one of the Shirts on his Back, which he resign'd, and then asked me to forgive him.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner own'd his taking the Goods, and said by way of Excuse, that he wanted a Shirt, therefore he took them: That he was in Liquor and had forgot the Door, else he would not have came there again, and that he gave this Shirt back to the Prosecutor with a very good Will, and in a very good natur'd Manner. <rs id="t17360115-3-verdict17" type="verdictDescription">

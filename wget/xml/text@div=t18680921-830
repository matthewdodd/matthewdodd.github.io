Sept. 5. My dear William. I have been anxiously waiting to hear from you, or to see you. You are very welcome to anything and all that you have of mine. When I asked for to have my letters returned, I did not mean what I said. It was said only when I thought you were cold and unkind to me. I did not deserve it. I have not called upon Mr. Haynes, as my brother-in-law wished me to do. My family have no right or power to control me or my affairs. My husband left me everything he possessed, and the right of doing what I thought proper with it, and I shall write to Mr. Haynes to-day, and tell him so. I will wait here until three o'clock, and if you do not come to me I will leave town without yon. Perhaps if I do it will not break your heart. Do not mention the patience of Job when you think of me. I am afraid to go to Rachel's for fear of Mr. Bayer. She told me yesterday that he had an execution against me.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Attend to this:—"36, Davies Street, September 17. My own dear William. I am happy to state that your kind message has made me much happier than I was yesterday, for I scarcely ever remember spending so wretched a day. Just think, my love, how could it be otherwise, when, instead of our being in Paris, I am in these miserable lodgings, and you, my darling, are ill in bed? The old saying stands good, "True love never runs smoth;" however, as you assure me you will endeavour to leave town in a day or two, I will not, my dear, annoy you by telling you how grieved and disappointed I was at our journey being put off; but, my dear love, when you are convalescent we will make up for lost time. I received a note from my daughter this morning. I enclose it, and the one I have written in reply, which you can peruse before it is posted. Saturday evening that beastly Pike followed me into Madame Rachel's, and tempted me to purchase the diamonds. He wanted me to sign an I 0 U for 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with<lb></lb>out giving me the jewels, but I was not such a fool to sign without having value in return. My refusing to sign seemed to displease him rather. I trust, my dear love, that you will never put your pen to paper for anyone. Do not forget last Friday. I hope you will always remember that before you ever put your name to a bill. I thank you very much for sending the four letters to Wales as you promised. My dear love, you must not be angry at the little I send you. If yon want any more I will bring it myself. Will that please you, my darling? I have not heard from Mr. Cope or Mr. Moon, and I do not wish to hear from either of them. With my very fondest and dearest love, believe me, your affectionate and loving, Mary Tucker Borradaile." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is true, the daughter alluded to is my daughter Florence—I swear that I never enclosed her letter to Lord Ranelagh, but Madame Rachel dictated that; I trusted her—I think I have been a very great fool to write those letters by her dictation—this letter looks like mine—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "7, George Street, Hanover Square, September 19th, 1866. My dear William. I did not get to my lodgings until past twelve o'clock. I took apartments at 43, Davies Street. I had my tea</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186809210060"></xptr>
               <p>there, and then went out to take a walk and look for you. The woman at 36 detained my luggage, as you are aware. Madame Rachel sent the money to pay my bill. The woman watched me from her house into the house nearly opposite, where I had taken apartments at the engraver's, and what she said to him goodness knows; but this much I do know, she told him I had a lover, had ordered shirts for him, and had not paid for them; that I wanted to remove my boxes without paying my bill; and, in fact, scandalized me that the engraver refused to admit me into his house at twelve o'clock at night. My luggage was detained in one house and I was left without a lodging, and all on your account. Do I deserve this from you, my love I Had we left town last Thursday this would not have occurred; but as you say you were ill, it would grieve me to doubt you. As you are well there is no cause for any further delay. I went to Madame Rachel's, and Mr. Swisson took for these apartments. I send you a copy of Haynes's bill, and you will compare them with the bills you have, as he has not given me credit for as much as I have paid him; but your solicitor cut see to that. I did intend to call upon him this morning; there will be no necessity for my doing so, as you have all my bills and receipts, and Rachels accounts, which you will see are correct. The one thousand pounds paid from the Funds and one from the Reversion is what I promised Madam Rachel, and you will agree with me that she ought to be paid if anyone is; and, my darling, if you are a good boy, and do as I wish you to do in future, I shall be able to pay every bill without anyone's interference or assistance. I love you still, with all your faults; but remember, my own darling, that you must never sign another bill before you consult me; or, my dear, it shall have no money to go about with, as our kind friends and relatives predicted With fond and dearest love, believe me, your very affectionate and loving, Mary Tucker Borradaile.")—I ordered the shirt fronts, and here is the bill of them—it is very likely Lord Ranelagh may have wanted them—they were sent to 28, George Street, but I would not take them in—the bill is from Regers &amp; Co.—(<hi rend="italic">Dated August</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi>)—I think it is in the Hay-market—I never paid it—I think it was in July—this letter looks rather different to my writing—it looks as if it had been written with a steel pen, but I suppose it is mine—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "7, George Street, Hanover Square, Sep<lb></lb>tember 22nd, 1866. My dear William. I am quite ready, if you will kindly send me word what time you wish me to be at the station, so that we shall not keep each other waiting. I do not wish to leave town on bad terms with Rachel: it would not be policy on our part; but Mr. Haynes sent her a letter, which he had no business to do, and which seems to have made her furious; but, however, we are on very good terms now. I have done all I promised her I would do, and I have just written to her. With my fondest love, believe me, your affectionate and loving, Mary Tucker Borra<lb></lb>daile.")—It does not look so much like my writing as some—Madame Rachel told me she was eighty, and I afterwards heard her solicitor, Mr. Roberts, say that she was sixty-eight—she has a child seven or eight years of age, but I always heard them called her grandchildren—this letter looks like my rifting—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "7, George Street, Hanover Square, September 29.

               <p>said to you, in return I told her it was a great liberty of her for to interfere between us; that you were not accountable to anyone but myself for my money or anything else belonging to me. Do not fear, my love, that Mr. Haynes will ask you any questions as regards our private affairs. I am sure, if he did, you would not answer him, as it is not my wish that you should do so. You can come with me to Grindlay's on Monday, between one and two o'clock. Send me word what time will suit you best. And now, my own darling, I hope you will not give me any further cause to fret and grieve; for if you keep your promise with me on Monday night, and tear yourself away from the little lady with the golden hair—which Rachel says any lady can obtain for two guineas—I promise you never to refer to the past. With my fondest love—and, indeed my dear, you do not know what a pain I have in my face all the time I have been writing—believe me, your affectionate and loving, Mary Tucker Borradaile.")—I never used anything that the "little lady" used, I never used anything but the <hi rend="italic">Auricanus</hi>, that is merely to make the hair brighter—there is a little lady with golden hair, it is not myself—I do not call myself very little.</p>

Mr. Richards came in at the time Rachel was speaking of you not in very respectful terms. She wished Mr. Richards to write to you or to Mr. Haynes to compel you to return me my property and money at once, and I told Madame Rachel and Mr. Richards that they dare not do any such thing. How dare they take such a liberty? Therefore, my darling, whatever you hear from either of them, you will treat it with the greatest indifference. I will comply with your wishes to-morrow, but pray, my dear, do not let it be at that horrid place where the poor man was killed. If you keep me waiting I will scold you well, and you must remember, my love, it will not be the first time you have kept me waiting.

You have not taken any trouble to connect our affairs, and I have been foolish enough to allow you to be my master and lead me like a child; but am I to believe that the woman you travelled with, and who you introduced to me as your sister, is your mistress? I am not surprised at your forgetting me, as I have forgotten myself; there is one thing you must remember, that I am the widow of a Colonel, and though I have degraded myself and family by having had anything to do with you, I am still more humiliated by being introduced to such people as you associate with. I have not one person in London to speak to, and I dare not return to Wales: but I can live at Paris upon my pension, and I would have shared a crust of bread with you. I ask you again, for the last time, to return me my letters and all my property; and although I am determined to have my letters returned, the longer I stay in town the more I am involved on your account. Allow me to sign myself the last time, M. Tucker Borradaile."—"7, George Street, Hanover Square. November 4, 1866. My own dear William. Your letter pains and shocks me. What has led you to suppose that I should press you so? Far from it. Had you been present at the interview at Haynes' on Friday, you would not have sent me such an unkind letter. It is cruel of you—I who have gone through so much for you. It was Rachel, who did what she had no business to do. She told Mr. Haynes that you had all my money, which was no secret; and, in consequence of my having given her authority to do so, she showed it to him; and what could I say?—what could I do? Mr. Haynes agreed with Rachel that what had been done had been sanctioned by myself. Rachel and myself had a terrible quarrel, but we are now friends. She has promised to place all the accounts before Mr. Haynes, and I will ask him to settle up all accounts between myself and Rachel, and he can arrange much better than we can. Rachel told him that you had the money I had in the Funds. I do not wish you to leave England without me, and I feel assured you could not be so heart<lb></lb>less as to do so. I did ask for my letters to be returned; and what then? it is no crime, I did not wish that vile woman to read my letters, and I think you are still corresponding with her; if so, it is cruel, but indeed I trust that you have given her up. I have just come from church. I wish I was with you. With my fondest and dearest love, believe me, your affec<lb></lb>tionate and devoted, Mary Tucker Borradaile. P.S.—I am glad to hear your sister is better. I will write to her to-morrow."—"Wednesday Evening: My own dear William. I thank you for the pretty little machine; it will pass the time away when we are free from intrusion. Whilst you are smoking or reading, I can be making a pair of slippers, a smoking cap, or pair of braces. You will spoil me, my darling, if you pet and flatter me so much. Granny has told me to-day of all the pretty and naughty little things you have been saying of me. Mr. Haynes has behaved exceedingly well in doing exactly as I desired him to do, and he has not annoyed me in any way. What I wished him most particularly to do was to settle Bayer's bill, pay my eldest brother 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., pay Cridland his bill, give Rachel the undertaking for 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>; and should not the reversion realize a sufficient sum to pay my debts, I told Mr. Haynes that my friend would make up the deficiency. My habit, my love, was sent home to<lb></lb>day. You must excuse all blots, and wishing fondest and dearest love, believe me, your affectionate and loving, Mary Tucker Borradaile."—"Monday, March, 1867. My own dear William. I did as promised. I wrote to Messrs. Lowless, Nelson, &amp; Goodman, and</p>

               <p>informed them of the arrangements I have made with Madame Rachel I am quite as anxious to get away, my love, as you are. You say nothing will change your love or unbounded confidence. Your letters are safe, and I have kissed them and read them very often. My darling, we are one. All my thoughts are bound up in you, and I have no one to care for me but you; and I love you all the more for it. I have given you all that woman holds dear; therefore you must not doubt me at the eleventh hour. Show your letters, indeed! What woman could go through such an ordeal? Did I not forsake my only child for you? And with all the threats that my family and the lawyers held out I never compromised you, my own love. Rachel called upon Mr. Haynes to-day. Mr. Robinson, his clerk, told her that he was ill in bed. Rachel assures me she took the mortgage with the intention of giving it to Mr. Haynes. Rachel told Mr. Robinson of the arrangement I had entered into with her. You are aware that I lose my pension if I marry. This, the enclosed, is the arrangement for Grindlay. I leave every<lb></lb>thing to you, my darling. I have no one else to guide me but you, and, situated as I am, I have done all for the best; therefore, my dear, you must not be angry with me. I thank you for the pretty comb which Rachel says she has, but which, like many other pretty things, I have not seen. She says the veil is a gem. So very kind of you, and thoughtful of you. For<lb></lb>give my suspicions of you. I want nothing but your love, and for what you have done for me to-day, I feel assured I have it. With my fondest and dearest love, believe me, your affectionate and loving, Mary Tucker Borradaile.")</p>

You will break a blood-vessel some day, and there will be an end of my poor dear William; and then what am I to do? Frank told me all If anyone has cause to fret and fume it is myself. Read my sister's letter; I have marked where she says I shall tire out Lewis and Lewis's patience. My darling, do you not think I have tired many other lawyers, but I hope it is all over now; indeed, my love, it is time it should be. Why should you upbraid me for economising? I am trying to save every sixpence, living in a garret, and for you—not for Randall, or any other man that has shared my affections. I wish to say nothing to you but what is kind. You know my great love for you, and why, my darling, do you doubt me? I have written to Rachel to-day, to ask her not to answer my impertinent questions. She growled like a bear. I think she would have much pleasure in seeing you transported. I think Frank tells her every<lb></lb>thing, and shows her my letters. Rachel is like a witch—there is nothing</p>

I cannot thank you, but I will Kiss you, or you shall Kiss me which I shall like better, my love. I did reply to the last letter but one which I received from you. How can you think after all the proofs that I have given you of my love, that I should shows your letters to Cridland or to Mr. Moon? I love your letters too much to show them to anyone, particularly to lawyers. I should indeed have been sorry if you had gone to Ireland—such a wretched place. I think you were very clever to get out of it so well. Let Stevens fight his own battles. I am sick of the name of Fenians. What good, my darling, can you do by mixing yourself with them, or having anything to do with them? It is a loss of time and of money. I am sorry that Stevens ever had a pound of mine. How could I have been such a fool to have allowed you to squander the money in such a hopeless cause! However, my love, I am very glad that you have given up all thoughts of ever joining them again, and that you will leave everything to me for the future, and, with economy, we shall manage to live independent of the world, as I consider our income a very good one. I will do all I can to save money, and, my own love, you must do the same. My pension is not due to me until the 1st of April. I can get it before we leave. I do not like to rebuke you for spending too much for me, but Mr. Harrison may bring it.

If you look at the enclosed bills, you will see that I am not the extravagant person that your sister says I am. I bought Florence a pair of boots and three pairs of stockings, not before she wanted them. Your sister ought to see that your stockings are mended. I cannot see why she cannot mend them herself, and put some buttons upon your shirt; it would be better than gossipping with the woman in the room next to her. Send all your clothes that want mending to me, and I will mend them. Florence's boots I bought at Marsh's, in Oxford Street As you want boots, we will go to Battersby and get them, which is a shop lower down the same side Oxford Street. I am surprised that your flannels should be worn out—you have not had them six weeks—it is bad washing. There is a man in a court in Regent Street who mends gentlemen's coats and trousers. My darling, we must economise. They have deducted, I think, 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound out of my pension for the Abyssinian Expedition, which I think very unjust.

I called upon her to-day, and asked her to return them to me. She told me she would do nothing of the sort, that she would send them to Mr. Cridland. I must have the letters; it is of great consequence for both of us. When I returned home I found Cridland's clerk, with the enclosed letter. I send you my love in the envelope. I wonder what the lawyer would say to this. I do not want to vex you. Mr. Cridland's clerk asked me for ten guineas for counsel's opinion. I had not the money. I told him to take it from the Reversion. By this you will see they are determined to make me go into Court on Monday, where I hope, my love, I shall never see you. If it had not been for that, I should not have been subjected to all the troubles I have had. Why should I tell you so many times that, come what may I never will compromise you?

Dear Madame Rachel As you are so well acquainted with my private affairs, and, like many others of your ladies who depend upon your honour, I think it would be unwise of you, to say the least of it, to speak of what no one has a right to interfere with but myself. I have said so repeatedly to my own child and my relatives, I should not have been subjected to all the troubles and annoyances that I have endured, if Mr. Cope had not taken the liberty of exposing my affairs to Mr. Moon, and in a letter which I wrote to that gentleman I told him so. That I am mistress of my own actions, and if I thought proper to place my affections on a man who has not a shilling in the world, and if he wanted the hair of my head he should have it, I am at liberty to do so. My family are annoyed with me for my giving him money. Do you suppose that man, if he has one spark of honour, would keep my money or property. Dear Rachel, you are mistaken in thinking so, and so are my family. Be assured, Rachel, if you will be quiet for a day "or two, I shall have more money than I want, and it will be your own interest to say as little about it as possible, and I will see you are righted. I will keep my promise with you, for I never break my word. Dear Rachel, will you kindly give me the letters that my friend left at your house for me when I was in Whitecross Street, as I want them; and if I have said anything to offend you I am very sorry for it I will not compromise my friend, whatever may be the result It would be dangerous to tell you that I am going to Paris, but you have children of your own, and you have not the heart to injure me that people say you would do. You have been very unkind. If any one suffers by this affair it will be myself. I am glad to hear the bills are not in the market that I gave you. No doubt you will be glad to hear that the 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that my friend has will be returned to you on Tuesday. You say you have no money of mine. You must not be hard with me. I will pay you by instalments. Thank goodness, my affairs are in a little better state than I thought they were. Please send me my letters. Believe me, yours sincerely, Mary Tucker Borradaile."—"7, George Street, Hanover Square, September 26. Dear Rachel. I arrived here between six and seven o'clock yesterday evening. I called upon you to-day, but you were engaged. I left a pretty little album, with some photographs, for your dear little Elsie, and a nice little cross for Leontie. I cannot tell you how grieved I was to hear of your sad accident, and so was my friend William. He will call upon you to-morrow; pray be kind to him for my sake; you know how much I love him, dear Rachel, and I never thanked anyone who would wish to separate me from the only man I love.

If you are asked any questions about my affaire please say you know nothing about them. I send you a pretty little book for Harry, as he was disappointed of the cake I promised him.

I would give you 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and indeed 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I had it. Indeed, I scarcely know what to do. I received such letter this morning from Wales, I am nearly distracted. I have written to-day to Mr. Cridland and to Mr. Haynes. I have enclosed you the copies. It is to satisfy Mr. Cridland, who writes every day to my brother by the morning post. Mr. Cridland and Mr. Haynes are become very great friends. I thought it advisable to write to both. You understand the motive. You have children of your own. It is to save my daughter's name, that her mother may not be disgraced in the opinion of the world. You know it will not do to have my name mentioned with Capt. W. Edwardes. It would be ruin to myself and my daughter. I still feel assured you will not refuse giving me my letters. I will never give you cause to regret having done so. With kind regards, I am, very sincerely yours, M. Borradaile."—"7, George Street, Hanover Square, February 20, 1868. Dear Madame Rachel.

You shall not be made the victim to serve other people, as you have kept my confidence. I shall re-pay you as a lady ought to do, in consequence of the annoyances you have been subjected to through my unfortunate affair. I have written to Mr. Cridland, and told him about the cruel affair that took place between Lord Ranelagh and my dear husband, and you will see Mr. Cridland will keep it secret. I wrote it in haste. I only told him a part. You may remember that I told you some years past, when I returned from India, the unfortunate affair. If Lord Ranelagh had not mentioned William's name in the presence of Mr. Cridland, I should not have mentioned the sad affair. By referring to the card enclosed you will see that the dates are correct. With kind regards, yours very truly, Mary Tucker Borradaile. The brewer's daughter has sent to tell me that Lord Ranelagh is to give her away to-morrow."—"7, George Street, Hanover Square, February 21, 1868. Dear Madame Rachel. I sent you two letters yesterday, one in the morning and one in the evening, the latter containing a letter from Mr. Cridland.

Madame Rachel had proposed giving the letters either to Mr. Cridland or me—I think Mr. Cridland asked her for them, but she never gave them—I did not know that they were my letters—she had my authority, and I wished her to give them up very much—that was two or three months before the criminal charge was made—(<hi rend="italic">Upon</hi>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How often did you go to Mr. Haynes with Madame Rachel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four or five times—we never went into matters of account in his presence, we went to get him to arrange the thing amicably—I went two or three times to Mr. Haynes to try and get my clothes and money, and Madame Rachel went with me, but the accounts between us were not referred to; I was kept quite in the dark—I wrote this letter to Messrs. Grindlay dated, March 26, 1867, but I do not think this enclosure in it is my writing—it is not like my writing—I did give a charge on my pension, and Madame Rachel got it in the way I told you—(<hi rend="italic">This letter informed Messrs. Grindlay that the writer had engaged to pay Madame Rachel 150l. a year out of her pension, and was signed Mary T. Borradailc</hi>.)—I mean to swear the enclosed document is not my writing—I think Madame Rachel's grand-daughter, Miss Leontie, writes like me—my pension is 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I enclosed a card to Mr. Cridland, but not a letter—(<hi rend="italic">The letters of December 3rd, and December 13th, to Lord Ranelagh, were here read</hi> (See p. 358,) <hi rend="italic">also a letter, dated Saturday, to Dear Tom, which stated</hi>: "I shall go the Argyle Baths. I shall wait for you at the public-house at the back, I do not mean the coffee-house; I will ask them to let us have a private room.")</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you arrived in London on the occasion you have referred to in your examination, did you come to the Great Western terminus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from Cheltenham; I arrived in the evening, and intended to go to the Great Western Hotel—I could only get a room on the first-floor, which was too expensive—I inquired of some one about, and was recommended to Lovejoy's—I stayed six days there—I think it is a perfectly respectable place, and certainly I did not use it for any but respectable purposes—from Lovejoy's I went to a coffee-house on account of a dispute with Lovejoy, who, having changed me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, two days after said he had given me 2</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">l</hi>. too much—he had not done so, and I told him so, and had a dispute, so that I left at 10 o'clock at night—I inquired of a druggist next door, for a fresh lodging, and a railway porter took me to Francis Street, where I had a room, for which I paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day, I think—no one visited me there, and there is no justification for the imputation of my living in an improper manner at either of those houses—if there was anything wrong, I do not know—I went to Madame Rachel—I don't recollect writing the letter giving an Account of my financial position.; there was no necessity to write to Captain Edwardes on that subject—I never wrote a letter from Francis Street—I can only account for Madame Rachel producing all the letters which I supposed delivered to Lord Ranelagh, by supposing that she kept them—I had not the least idea they were in her possession until the last trial—she told me about letters being in her possession, but I did not think she meant mine—I only knew of two being in her possession, except two which I re-copied—Madame Rachel's establishment consisted of herself and her daughter,</p>

               <p>who she told me was past 50—Madame Rachel told me she was over 80—they were made up, I suppose—Miss Leontie, her granddaughter, was always there—I have seen her write, and I should know her writing—this letter signed "William," I do not think is her writing—Madame Rachel dictated to me of an evening, after the shop was shut up—a servant named Henry, and her granddaughter have seen me writing letters there, never staying in the room, but going in and out—Leontie has seen me writing in the room, I have also written at 50, Maddox Street, which Rachel told me was her daughter's house—during most of the time I was living at 28, George Street—I never saw any gentlemen there, except Mr. Cope and one or two solicitors—Leontie was generally at Rachel's, and always when her grandmother was out of town—Henry took one of the letters I re-copied, which was ad<lb></lb>dressed to Captain William Edwardes, from me to Madame Rachel—on my solemn oath, I never had an interview with any man but Lord Ranelagh at Madame Rachel's, and I never walked about the streets or went to coffee-houses with any man—I had a fever in India—before she dictated the letters she used generally to give me whisky, which I have never drunk before or since—I do not think there was anything in the whisky, because she used to drink it herself—I never took spirits before, except brandy and soda-water, by the doctor's advice.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In point of fact, you do not know whether it was whisky or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was told it was whisky, and I heard her send for whisky—some<lb></lb>times she has been without, and I do not know where she got it from.</p>

               <p>to the door—I do not think I described him, there were several men there, and I did not go in—Madame Rachel never blamed me for spending money on a paramour—when I mentioned not seeing more of Lord Ranelagh, she said the marriage was to be by proxy, and the proper mode of doing it was by letter, as she had married two parties in the same way—there is not the shadow of foundation for the statement that I have been living with any man, the letters are those of a self-confessed idiot—I never should have written them, except for Madame Rachel—I have been a prudent, virtuous woman all my life, and I cannot account for these letters at all—I never lived with O'Keefe—I know no half-military, half-sporting man, with a moustache—I do not recollect the letter in which that reference is made—I know no such person at all—O'Keefe called on me in Paris to know where I was living—I don't know Stephens, I have seen an elderly man come into the shop, who Madame Rachel told me was Lord Ranelagh's servant—I took no interest in the Fenians—I know no one in Ireland—I don't remember writing, "I am sick of the name of Fenians"—I can't explain it, for I know nothing about it—I recollect this about leaving Charing Cross early to-morrow; it was Rachel's dictation; I asked her the meaning of it—I can't swear this letter is in my handwriting—I have no idea who wrote this letter with a monogram, as it was not Lord Ranelagh—the letter from Lord Ranelagh, as I thought, which urged me to sign the paper, referred to the 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bond—I wrote ten or twelve letters addressed to "Tom"—there are others than those pro<lb></lb>duced, some Mr. Cridland would not give up, because they only related to my late husband—Rachel got the last letters of my late husband; she asked me to read them to her; she got hold of about four—I wrote to "Tom," because Rachel said, "We have had enough of 'Dear William;' we will write to 'Dear Tom' now"—I can anly account for the allusions to "William," in the letters to "Dear Tom," by Rachel telling me it was either to create jealousy, or to screen Lord Ranelagh—Miss Leontie saw me writing some of those letters—I have seen her about the Court in some of the passages during this trial—I know no William, and can convey to the Jury no meaning in the allusion to "Dear William" losing money at horse-racing—I know nothing of the cough mixture in connection with Lord Ranelagh, except that he came to the shop one day, looking very ill, and Rachel said he had a cold—there were no accounts between me and the prisoner—I never owed her a penny—she once gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for my lodgings in Davies Street for a short time; beyond that I never had a farthing from her—the account produced at the last trial, which appeared to be in my handwriting, I don't remember at all (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can't swear to this being my writing; part of it is not like mine—I have no recollection of writing any of it—it says, "Received, 13th June, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that is an absolute falsehood: also the entry, "Received 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Sept. 1"—all the entries of my receiving 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., altogether amounting to 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., are false—if it is in my hand-writing, I can't account for it—Rachel said there was an account, but I never knew what it was until it was produced at the last trial—the figures in this account I can swear are not in my handwriting—not a sixpence have I re<lb></lb>ceived in any way, except the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., she lent me—Madame Rachel is not a per<lb></lb>son to give money—I solemnly swear I have not received a farthing of that money—it was produced by your friend on the other side, on the last occa<lb></lb>sion, to vouch that I owed the amount.</p>

Hamilton, not my costs, but money paid—it was for mantles, dresses, &amp;c., supplied in May, 1866—the next is Mr. Pike 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the forfeit on a deposit for some diamonds—Mrs. Borradaile had given Mr. Pike an acceptance for 1260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for some diamonds, and I induced him to take them back, and receive 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I remonstrated with her for buying them—they had not been delivered, but he held her promissory note—the next sum is 10th September, 1866, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Bayer, she owed him that for lace—on the same day here is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to an attorney for the costs of action for the balance of an account for lace; I have the invoice here, it was originally 384<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that accounts for 544<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—then 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid by Mrs. Borradaile's request to Madame Rachel; the order is here, I would not have paid it without—of this 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I paid for a cheque for 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 24th April, and one for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 24th March, and had debited her with a quarter's rent, and there was a balance of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which I have paid other things for her since—I had received the 1300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in March, and the conveyance is dated 15th April, 1807—these cheques are payable to order, except one for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is payable to self, the largest one, which is for 272<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., is on a slip of paper, payable to bearer, and is not endorsed; Madame Rachel wanted to send some money to Paris that day—she could not write, and she</p>

Read</hi>: "47<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, New Bond Street, Sep<lb></lb>tember 4, 1866. Sir. It is my duty to inform you that after you left town yesterday I was given to understand by Mrs. Borradaile, who had taken her leave of you when in the cab to return to Wales, that she had given you her word of honour not to visit or hold further communication with me until she had consulted Mr. Haynes. She further added that it was your orders she should at once remove from George Street, and that you understood she would do so. I explained to her this morning the importance of her consulting her solicitor, for her own sake as well as for mine, after what she said about me in your presence yesterday; but she refused, and up to this time—my messenger from Mr. Haynes has just come to say she has not been there to-day. How far her assertions are to be relied on, after that, I leave you to judge. Please to remember that she said the people of the house</p>

               <p>and myself had formed a league against her. So far from that being so, I beg leave to assure you I don't know the people. Mrs. Borradaile requested a youth in my employment, last night, to obtain a lodging for her, and at her desire he got apartments in Davies Street, and she went there. She is aware that there is a judgment against her on a bill of ex<lb></lb>change which she gave to a dealer in lace in Oxford Street She asked the man on Saturday to renew the bill for a fortnight; but it appears he won't agree. Mrs. Borradaile called on me again this morning, when she asked me questions again concerning Lord Ranelagh; but my reply, as in your pre<lb></lb>sence, was that it was her own invention, and all false. I don't forget your kind remark that there are two sides to a question. Enclosed I send you a true copy of a letter sent by Mrs. Borradaile to her lover. It will be for you to judge and draw your own conclusions from it. The original you are quite welcome to, with others which have been sent back. Mrs. Borradaile has led me to suppose for six months that she was to be married to her cousin, Captain William Edwardes.—Believe me, yours truly, Rachel."</p>

               <p>and decidedly no; I know nothing whatever about it—I was not in communi<lb></lb>cation in Paris with Mrs. Borradaile about this prosecution, but in London—I only had interveiws with her twice in Paris, and I recommended her to leave Paris in order to put an end to certain scandalous reports which had been whispered about—I was not aware that there were civil proceed<lb></lb>ings between her and Madame Rachel—I was informed of it after I re<lb></lb>turned from Paris—I did not suggest to Mrs. Borradaile that she would be able to make terms better, if in place of civil proceedings she tried criminal; nothing of the sort—I recommended her, in Mr. Cridland's presence, to take criminal proceedings, because I considered it a very serious case, but I never spoke of terms—I believe I said that it would be the best way to recover her property; and I believe I said that it would be better than civil proceed<lb></lb>ings for getting her money.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. D.

Sutton well, and have known her for a very long time; she knew Mrs. Borradaile, and gave me a letter of introduction to her at Paris—I have heard that she made Mrs. Borradaile's acquaintance in Whitecross Street—I believe she was in London about the time this charge was made, and I think I saw her, but I have seen her so frequently, that I cannot say—I have no doubt of it; I saw her at various places, sometimes in my own house—she was not living in the same house, but she used to call once or twice a week on business. Mrs. Borradaile has been to my house once or twice, and I think Miss Sutton has been there once; when she has been there, I am not quite sure—I have no house in Paris, I had a house in Hans Place, London, for fifteen months—Miss Sutton took charge of it for eight days, while I was in Paris, and then I sent for my own servants; it was a furnished house—I know a Mrs. Donoghue, the widow of one of the proposed bail in this case; he was bail for a short time—he has died since he was proposed bail—the widow lives near the Olympic Theatre, Wych Street, I think—I went there to ascertain whether Mr. Donoghue was proper and good bail, and I</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Hunt and Roskill—about the commencement of November, the female prisoner came there with another person, not Pearce, and I showed them some jewellery; among other articles I particularly recollect an emerald bracelet, a stock one, value about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the emerald was worth about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they moved to the other side of the shop and saw some more bracelets—after stopping there about half an hour looking at various things, they put two bracelets on one side and said that they would call next day and decide which they would take—we never saw them afterwards—on, I think, the following day or very closely after they had been there, I saw the case in which this bracelet ought to have been, and it was not there.</p>

I am a lapidary, of 46, Clerkenwell-green—I have known Pearce some two years and a half by the name of Bingfield—he called on me some time about November and showed me an emerald about the same size as this, and two pearls about the size stated on the bill that was issued—he took them back at the time; he afterwards brought them back and I entrusted the emerald to Mr. Gregory to sell on commission.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector</hi>). On 23d April I went with some other officers to Albion-road, Stoke Newington, about 8 o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing—Sergeant Tanner knocked at the door, and it was opened by Pearce—I said to him, "I wish to speak with you," and accompanied him down stairs into the lower room, where I found Laurence; I said, "We are police-officers, what is your name?"—he said, "My name is Pearce"—I said, "Have either of you been to Brighton to-day?"—they both said that they had not—I said, "I wish you to go a little way with me for some people to see you"—Laurence said that she wanted to go up stairs, I asked her what for; she said, "To get a pair of boots"—I accompanied her into the top room of the house, but she did not find any boots; we returned to the lower room again where Pearce was; I told Laurence to put on her things and she commenced dressing, I believe she had got her bonnet and shawl on—I noticed something strange in her movements, she kept her back turned towards me, which made me suspect she had got something in her hands which she wished to conceal—I said, "What have you got in your hands?"—she immediately put them under her cloak and said, "Nothing"—I said, "Let me see"—she repeated that she had got nothing—I said, "Let me see," and took hold of her hands; she struggled to disengage herself and screamed—Pearce then seized the poker and made use of an expression as to what he would do, but Sergeant Tanner closed with him, and Laurence threw up her hand and said, "There now, you see I have got nothing in my hand"—I looked down by her feet, saw this ring which Mr. French has spoken of and picked it up—these two other diamond rings were lying close by and were picked up by Sergeant Tanner—I did not see any rings on the floor before—I took the prisoners to the Kingsland station and said, "I now charge you both on suspicion of stealing a diamond locket from Mr. Emanuel in Hanover-square, and some bracelets from Messrs. Hunt and Roskill in Bond-street"—they made no reply—Laurence had this pair of diamond earrings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in her ears, aud holding them and the three rings in my hand, I said, "Have you any objection to tell me how you became possessed of these?"—she declined to do so—I said to Pearce, "I am going to ask you a question, you can do as you like about answering it; some time back you sold a large emerald to Mr. Hannaford of Clerkenwell-green, have you any objection to tell me how you became possessed of it?"—he declined to tell me.</p>

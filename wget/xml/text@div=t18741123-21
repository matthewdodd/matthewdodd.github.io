                  </hi>. I am a porter, of 10, Upper Key Street, Spitalfields—on 19th October, about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I was just going in at my door, and as man named Furze came up, and said "<hi rend="italic">Zeekey</hi>, have you got a pair of sparring gloves?"—the prisoner, whom I had never seen before, came up afterwards and said "Your name is <hi rend="italic">Zeekey</hi> Hart?"—I said "Yes"—he said "I have been looking for you; you take this in remembrance of me, for striking my brother"—(I did not know his brother)—he pulled out a knife from his right trousers pocket, I think, and struck me with it just over the eye, by the side of my temple—I fell into Furze's arms, and said "I am stabbed"—the blood poured down, and the flesh hung down right over my eye—I got up, and as I went to the station fell down again, and they had to put me in a cab, but I was thrown down before that by one of his <hi rend="italic">pals.</hi>

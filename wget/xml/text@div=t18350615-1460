                  </hi>. I am the wife to Holt Currie, a dancing-master, and live in St. Martin's-lane. I took the prisoner into my service—she had been there two days—on the 4th of June, I received three sovereigns and one shilling, which I placed between the bed and the mattress in my bed-room, at nine o'clock in the evening—the prisoner was there then—I went down to my sister's and left the prisoner in the room—I returned at half-past nine o'clock, and the prisoner had left without giving me notice—she never returned to my house—I went and took her at her lodgings—I said, "Mary, how came you to take this money?—she said, "I have not got it. my daughter has got it,"—she went out after her daughter, but did not find her—she came back and spoke to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 158.) I went with Mrs. Currie in search of the prisoner. She accused her of stealing three sovereigns—she said she had not taken it, that her daughter had got it—she blew out the candle, and went in search of her daughter—she then came back, and said "I will give you a sovereign to let me go"—she put a sovereign into my hand—she then ran off—I followed, and took her—I found in her hand a purse, containing three sovereigns, one shilling, and three farthings.</p>

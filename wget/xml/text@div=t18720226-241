                  </hi>. I am a shirt-maker, of 36, Milton Street—Schofield worked at my house as a carpenter, in November, December, and January—he had access to my stock—Hewell on several occasions brought him his tea—these six petticoats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine, and were taken from my stock; they are worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Lambert, of Old Street, a pawnbroker—I produce these six petticoats; two were pledged by the female prisoner on 28th November for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one on the 29th for half-a-crown, a gown and a shirt on the 5th December, a petticoat on 5th January for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and another in January for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—five of the petticoats were pledged by Hewell, and one by Schofield.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi>). On Friday, 2nd February, Hewell came to the Old Street Station, and said that she wished Schofield to be appre<lb></lb>hended for stealing some lead piping from Mr. Bond, of the Green Gate, public-house—I found that to be false, and then she said that there were some things that he had stolen from Mr. Benson's, and gave me these tickets;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187202260022"></xptr>
               <p>she said she had received them and pledged them—I let her go, and kept the duplicates; she was drunk—I afterwards went to 6, King Street, Bath Street, where they lived, and took Schofield—he said that it was all through that drunken beast of a woman that he had done it, and he was glad it had come to that, and that he took the goods for her to wear; she heard that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi>). I went with Miller to King Street; I told Hewell I should take her in custody on the same charge—on the way to the Station she said "We have had a quarrel; I am very sorry for what I have said and done"—I found on her five other duplicates not relating to this.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hewell's Defence.</hi> These things were brought home for his children, not for me, and I had to cut them out; I said that I could not do it, and he said, "You must do the best you can with them." I did not consider I was receiving them as stolen goods, or I should not have pledged them.</p>

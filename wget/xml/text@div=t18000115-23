               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I take it you have told us the whole of your story? - A. I may have omitted some trifling thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not point to a person who, he told you, had employed him? - A. No such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What does C B L mean? - A. It is the mark of a foreign fruit that I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call yourself? - A. A <rs id="t18000115-23-viclabel120" type="occupation">warehouse-man</rs>

               <p>Q.There are many other warehouse-men in London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they might have some of the same kind? - A. No; it is impossible and improbable; all the fruit that has arrived in this country has been under my care; and I am confident there is none of it in the hands of any other person; all the fruit that comes to London I take an account of, as cooper to the fruit-trade.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you part with any of these barrels? - A. No, it was not sold.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you mean to say that all the foreign fruit that has arrived in this country, came to your warehouses? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that no other person in the trade has received this season any fruit with that mark? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this barrel of fruit arrive in this country? - A. A very short time ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take an account of fruit that arrives at Liverpool or Bristol? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then might not fruit that arrives there find its way to London? - A. It is not at all likely, because at Liverpool they received their fruit much later than we did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, in Archer-street, Haymarket. On 14th July the prisoner came to my shop for a "London Journal"; I served him—he gave me a bad shilling—I turned round for the purpose of getting change, and at the same time I put the shilling between my teeth, I found it was bad—I said to him, "This is a bad shilling"—he said, "I am sure I am not aware of it, I took it at the Bull's Head"—I went with him to the Bull's Head; I said to the barman, "This person has been round to my place, and tendered me a bad shilling, which he says he obtained from this house"—the barman denied all knowledge of him, and said he had no bad money from there—the prisoner said nothing—I saw a constable passing, I called him, and gave the prisoner into custody—I gave the shilling to the officer at the station—the price of the "London Journal" was a penny.</p>

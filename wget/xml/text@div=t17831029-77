               <p>"76 l. 18 s. Peton and Swift." I am sure of the draft, here are the initials of my name, which I wrote immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Prosecutor. Was there any particular crowd in going into the play-house? - Yes, I believe the play had begun, I felt my pocket-book about an hour before I came from the Castle in Wood-street, I had not drank I suppose more than half a pint of wine, I believe I did not lose it going in; I did not get into any company there, I stood in the pit, whether I lost it in the house I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did you examine your pockets when you came out of the play-house? - I did not, I then went to Medley's coffee-house in the Strand, to spend the evening, I staid about an hour and an half, then I came home to the Blossoms-inn.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to nobody coming home? - There were many girls that laid hold of me, some by the sleeve, and some by the coat; I talked with one of them, she was a west country girl from Exeter; I did not stay with them any considerable time.</p>
               <p>You could not part with your country woman immediately? - I staid with her a minute or two, we were not familiar at all, she asked me to give her a glass of wine or to sleep with her.</p>
               <p>You refused all her solicitations? - I asked her why she gave herself to this way of life, I said it was a pity, she said she was in and could not get out.</p>
               <p>The minutes might slip fast away; had she any west country women with her? - Not as I know of, there were many women round her; I do not know exactly whereabouts it was.</p>
               <p>You did not keep your hand in your pocket all the time I suppose? - No, I did not put my hand in my pocket that night.</p>
               <p>Did you find any more of your country women going home? - No, nor no other women.</p>
               <p>Was your coat buttoned or not as you went along the Strand? - I do not know, it was very hot in the play-house, I remember unbuttoning it there, but whether I buttoned it after I cannot tell; I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any reason to fix upon any place where you lost it? - I have not, I look upon it that when I was with the women, was as likely a time for my losing it as any in the course of the evening; it was rather past twelve when I left Medley's.</p>
               <p>You do not remember seeing the prisoner at the play-house? - I do not remember seeing him in my life till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On the Saturday morning a woman brought the note to me, and asked me to go and receive it; accordingly I went with it and they stopped me: here are gentlemen that can prove where I was that evening, the woman could not read I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. What woman was she? - I believe she was an unfortunate woman, she said she would meet me at twelve o'clock.</p>

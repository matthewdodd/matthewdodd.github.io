             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. Relate what you know of the robbing Rose's house? - Between the hour of seven and eight last Wednesday was three weeks, I was going to my mother's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190030"></xptr> house in Holborn, I met Nicholson, he asked me where I was going.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I take the liberty of submitting to your Lordship, that there is no evidence against Nicholson.</p>
               <p>Court. I hold, that it is regular to hear an accomplice in any stage of the prosecution, whether afterwards it deserves credit, will turn out upon the whole evidence, in which, to be sure, care will be taken to separate, but I cannot at present, cut the evidence to pieces in the course of the narration.</p>

               <p>Kendrick. We went up Brook-street, and went to the Barley-mow in Gray's-Inn Lane; coming up Holborn, we met Francis Hill at the corner of Gray's-Inn Lane, and he says, where are you going; says I, nowhere in particular; says he, if you will go with me down to the house where I lodge, the landlord is out of the way, and we can break open the place and get all the property out; I asked this Nicholson whether he was agreeable to go, and he said yes, and all three of us went as hard as we could down to the house; when we came there, there is a kind of a yard about three yards from the street-door that goes in with a little gate-way, and this Hill told us to stop there while he went to enquire whether the landlord was at home; he went upstairs and came down again, and said, no, there is nobody at home, let us go in, and immediately all three of us went up to the parlour door, the lower part, and we all three of us shoved the door open by the force of our hands.</p>
               <p>Was the door only put too, or locked? - It was fast.</p>
               <p>How did you get the door open? - By the force of our hands, but I could not see then whether the lock was broke; afterwards, says I, we want a candle; Hill went up immediately to Cadwell and says, have you got any candle, no, says she, have you got the parlour door open; says he, come down stairs and he (meaning me) will give you a halfpenny to buy a candle; she came down stairs and I gave her one, and she felt in the dark; it was a new halfpenny by the roughness; she said it was a bad one, and I gave her another, then she returned with a candle and she came into the yard and said, here is the candle, do you want it lighted, and Hill said, what do we want with a candle if it is not lighted, and she went over the way and lighted it, and came and gave it to Hill; she went up stairs; then we all three went into the room and shut the street door, and the parlour doors, then we opened the drawers and took out all the property that is mentioned in the indictment; I packed them up in three bundles; after we packed them up in three bundles, we packed one up in this, Nicholson's apron, and another in a black petticoat; I cannot tell what the third was packed in; we each took a bundle and called Cadwell to take the candle, and I said to her, put one of these bundles in your apron and come along with us; she declined doing that, but took the candle, and told us to wait a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs; the other two men went out, and I waited a few minutes for her coming down, and she did not come down, and I went away and pulled the street door after me, then we carried the property into Leather-lane and into Holborn, and we went to a coach that was in the rank, and put the property in, and carried it to the Windmill-inn, in St. John's-street, Smithfield, and sold the property for thirty-six shillings to one Mrs. Carter that lives up in the gallery; after we had sold it, I happened to put a silk handkerchief that belonged to some part of the property, in my coat pocket; coming down Snow-hill, I felt in my pocket, and said, here is a silk handkerchief that belongs to part of the property; Nicholson said, go in and pawn it; I declined it, and he went in and pawned it at one Mr. Cordey's on Snow-hill, for eighteen pence; and he came out and brought out three six-pences, and he gave us six-pence apiece and kept six-pence himself, and we went to Holborne and we met Cadwell, and we asked her to have something to drink; we told her where we were going, to the Barley-mow, and she came in half an hour, and the landlord would not let her in, he gave her a glass of gin, and she went out, and we never saw nothing of her till she was apprehended; after that we sat there and had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190031"></xptr> some stakes and beer, and we thought it time to come away; I still had the money in my pocket the things were sold for, and going towards Drury-lane, there was a tallow-chandler's shop open; there was a candle in the window, and they desired me to give each of them their share, and I took out the money by the light of the candle, and gave each his share; then we went down Drury Lane and had a pot of beer and smoked a pipe; then we all agreed to go to Nicholson's lodgings, in Baldwin's Gardens; we all went there, and went to bed; the next morning we got up and went to a public-house, and had some purl, and so it passed for three or four days, till Sunday came, then I was apprehended in bed.</p>
               <p>Where was your home? - No. 12, Ely-Court, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Kendrick, you tell this story as easily as a man can read a chapter in the bible, as if it was to your honour; how long have you been engaged in this business? - About a twelvemonth, as far as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Is it not more than a twelvemonth since you was taken up with Berwick Mayton? - He was capitally convicted for privately stealing, I was neither a witness or anything else.</p>
               <p>How often have you been in custody since? - I cannot tell, that is an odd question to ask.</p>
               <p>You are as often in custody as out? - No, not quite, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Give a random guess, we will not quarrel for a dozen times? - I cannot give no random guess, I may have been once taken up or so by a warrant.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that you have been much oftener at Bow-street than once? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you never been a witness against your accomplices? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you keep that handkerchief on purpose for them to pawn it? - It was all a random affair, I did not like to go into that shop.</p>
               <p>Why did not you like to go into Mr. Cordey's? - I declined doing it, I had no reason.</p>
               <p>Was not your reason for not going in, that they might not be evidence against you.</p>
               <p>Who proposed going to Mrs. Carters? - We all know the place because Nicholson, I believe, had never been employed in any such thing before dealt had been about six months.</p>
               <p>A ready receiver for anything you carried to her? - I believe so, I believe she does in case we have anything of that kind to give her, I never sold her none.</p>
               <p>You only deal in this sort of way? - I do not know what sort.</p>
               <p>I suppose if there had been any plate in the house it would have been all the same? We should not have left it behind, Mrs. Carter lives there now, if she was not left behind, I did not squeak after I was taken, I stood out a week, and then I should not have squeaked if it had not been for other people, I thought this woman would have done it,

               <p>Is that your practice to take in things without making any memorandum who takes them; how many people are there in your shop? - Three, two of us take in the things; there are so many persons we see in a day it is impossible to know one single person.</p>
               <p>That I grant you, but you might put in a memorandum upon it? - Sometimes I take them in, and sometimes the other man, and if we are busy, we tell the boy to write the bill.</p>
               <p>Court. The trade must be suppressed if it is carried on in that manner, it is making the pawnbrokers shops, a nursery for thieves? - Mr. Cordey sent me voluntarily to come.</p>
               <p>Jackson. My Lord, I went to tell them to come voluntarily, or if not, I should take out a summons.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very easy to make the initial letter of the person's name that takes in the things, then you would always know? - We lent eighteen pence upon the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hill. I leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Hill called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Nicholson. I leave it all to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Nicholson called eight witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cadwell. I know very little about it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Cadwell called six witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

I am a warder in Millbank Prison—on Saturday morning, 30th January, shortly after 6, I saw the deceased in one of the passages of the prison—he was getting a tub down with some cleaning flannels to clean the passage—shortly afterwards I saw him lying on the floor, with the prisoner standing over him—he had one knee on his body, about the middle of his stomach, and he struck him a severe blow in the body with his right hand at the same time—I ordered the prisoner to his cell—he went—I picked the deceased up, and called another person to support him—I locked the prisoner up, and then led the deceased to his cell—he was bleeding at the nose at the time I took him up—he was not bleeding more than usual after a blow—I left him in his cell—I saw him again about half an hour afterwards—he was bleeding from the nose then—it was nothing more than an ordinary bleeding—he took his breakfast after this—he drank his cocoa, and returned his loaf to the kitchen—I saw him again about half-past 7, when I gave him his breakfast—he made no complaint then—I asked him if he would go to the surgeon—he said, no, he would rather stop in his cell—I saw him again about twenty-five minutes' past 8 when I went to his cell—he then complained of pain across his to stomach—I brought him down to the principal officer to take him over to the surgeon—he was able to walk with assistance; I had hold of his arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident surgeon at Millbank Prison—on Saturday, 30th January, I saw the deceased man Daley, a little after 9 in the morning—I found that he had had a severe contusion between the eyes, involving the upper part of the nose, and lower part of the forehead—I also found that he was very faint and exhausted from loss of blood—he was not bleeding then, but I saw that he had been bleeding—there was some coagulated blood upon the nostrils—I judged from that that he had been bleeding from the nose—he seemed to be suffering from a nervous shock—I saw him several times in the course of the evening—about 5 next morning I was sent for—I went immediately, and found that he was dead—I made a post-mortem examination on Monday morning, 1st February—I then found in addition to the contusion on the forehead, contusions on the fore-part of each thigh, contusions of both shins, and on the top of the left foot there was also an abrasion on the back of the right-hand, and a slight cut at the back of the right shoulder—there was also a contusion on or near the left temple—on opening the body I found there was blood effused into certain bony cavities at the back of the nose, at the lower part of the forehead—that was caused by the rupture of blood-vessels—that was one of the results of the blow on the nose and forehead—I also found a large quantity of blood in one of the intestines—he had swallowed that blood—it had passed through the oesophagus—it was not the result of any injury of the intestines—I carefully examined the intestines—my impression was that there being a discharge of blood from the nose, he swallowed it; there was no rupture of the intestines—the other parts of the body were healthy, but they were very pale throughout from loss of blood; in my opinion the cause of death was the loss of blood and the shock to the nervous system—the loss of blood arose from the injury to the upper part of the nose, and the lower part of the forehead—his brain was quite healthy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a prisoner in Millbank Prison, and came from there this morning—I knew the deceased man, Daley—I remember the Saturday morning when this affair took place—about a quarter past 6 that morning, I was taking a table and bucket into my cell; at that time Daley passed behind me, carrying a tub—he was going towards the centre—just after he had passed, I heard a noise that attracted my attention—I turned round, and saw Hayes strike Daley first with his left fist, and afterwards knock him down with his right—Daley bled at the nose from the blow—I did not hear that he cried out—I ran up to Daley, and called out for Hardiment, the warder; he came up—I heard him ask Hayes what he had done this for, but I did not hear the answer; upon that the warder locked Hayes in his cell—I assisted the warder to take Daley to his cell—he was bleeding as a person ordinarily would from a blow—he was left in his cell at that time—I saw him again about an hour after—his nose was still bleeding—I saw him again at half-past 8 that same morning—I went to him then, as I thought I heard some one groaning—I told Hardiment, and we went into his cell and asked him if he was worse—he said, "Oh! I am fainting"—he was holding his handkerchief to his nose at the time—both the blows struck by Hayes were in the face.</p>

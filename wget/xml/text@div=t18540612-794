                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward George Keeler; he keeps the King's Head, at Ebury-bridge, Pimlico, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. On 3rd Jan. I was in my bar; the prisoner came in about half past 3 or a quarter to 4 o'clock—there were three others who came in, and were at the bar—the prisoner went into the parlour, and as he passed he asked for a glass of brandy and water—I took it to him, leaving my sister in the bar parlour—I had a cash box in a drawer in the bar, with from 77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it—I came back from giving the prisoner the brandy and water, and my sister was there in the bar parlour, and the three men were there at the time—the prisoner then came to the door of the parlour where he sat, and asked for a cigar, which I carried him—I had to leave the bar, and when I left it my sister followed me out, and went to some part of the house—when I left the bar the other three men were there—the prisoner paid me with three penny pieces—when I came back, the three men were still there—the cash box was perhaps two yards and a half from the door—one step and a reach would have reached the small drawer where the cash box was—when I was serving, the drawer was behind me—it was at the back of the bar—when I went with the cigar, one of the three men was standing close to the entrance by which I came out of the bar, and by which I should go in—the beer engine forms the post to the door, and one man stood against the engine—the three men went away in a very short time after I returned—the prisoner went out first, and the other three followed him out, singly—when the prisoner came out of the parlour I noticed him parti<lb></lb>cularly, because he kept his eyes fixed on me all the way he went—that was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185406120097"></xptr>
               <p>about two minutes or two minutes and a half after I got back to the bar—I had seen the cashbox and the money in it, about half an hour before the three men came in—I had remained in the bar during the whole of that time, and I can say that no one touched it till I went with the brandy and water—I missed the cashbox in about an hour and a half after the men went away—I had remained in the bar the whole time, and I can undertake to say nobody could have taken it without my being aware of it—there were two or three persons came in, who went in the bagatelle room—they came in for the balls, which were kept in a drawer over the one where the cashbox was—I did not see them take the cashbox.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Richard Wilson and another—we are wharfingers in South wark—Byrns was in our employ, and Atkinson was employed occasionally—we have bacon and pork cuttings—they are our property exclusively, and Byrns, who has been eight or nine years in our service, knew this—it is our custom to sell these cuttings at different times, and at the end of the year we make our men a present out of the produce of them—that is at our discretion, and that is all the inter<lb></lb>est the men can have in them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carter in the employ of Mr. Poulter—I went to the prosecutors', which is called Carpenter Smith's Wharf, to fetch some goods on the 8th of September—after I had got my load Byrns asked if I would take a bag up the lane (Atkinson was close by at the time)—the bag was lying there and I agreed to carry it—both the prisoners to<lb></lb>gether put it on the cart, and I went with it—Atkinson came after me, and when I got to the end of the lane, he took the bag on his back off the top of the barrels, and went away with it—it was just such a bag as the one now produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cooper in the prosecutors' service. On the 8th of September I was on their premises—I saw both the prisoners there, and I saw Poulter's cart on the wharf—I afterwards saw Atkinson down Mill-lane with a sack, which I believe was the sack produced, on his back—I spoke to him—he took the sack to Mr. Lucy, who is a dealer in fat—I cannot say positively whether the prosecutors' men have any right to dispose of the cuttings, but I believe they have not—I have the power to have them removed and to sell them—I have done so, and sent the money to the counting-house—I had authority from my master to sell them, but I had no authority to sell these.</p>

On the 8th of September, about half-past six o'clock, Atkinson came to my place—I asked him what he had got, he made no answer, but just stepped in and heaved a sack off his back—Garratt came to the door, and said, "Well done, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>!"—I said, "If this belongs to you, take it away, I know nothing of it"—I do not know whether this is the bag, it looks like it—no one took possession of it—it was in my place—when Garratt said, "Well done, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>!" he put his hand on the bag—I gave him a knife out of my pocket, and he cut it open, and it contained bacon cuttings—there was no other bag on my premises containing cuttings—there was plenty in tubs—the bag re<lb></lb>mained there till next morning—when Garratt came up, Atkinson walked away—he did not say a word.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Malkin. The prisoner came on the 15th to the lodger; he came again on the 16th at a quarter after seven o'clock; I let him in. He said the gentleman ordered him to come at that time. I made the water for him. I said it was hot. He put his fingers in and said it was not hot enough. He put it down again on the trivet and said, by the time I had been up stairs to call the gentleman, it would be hot enough. I went up stairs and came down again immediately. I found the water thrown down in the passage and the street-door open. The spoons were taken off a shelf in the kitchen. At eight o'clock the other hair-dresser came, who I thought was gone away, which surprised me.</p>

On the 17th of February, about nine o'clock at night, I met the prisoner, Smith. I went with her to a court in Whitechapel - I had been drinking, but knew what I was about. I did not like the appearance of the place, and wanted to go out - She wanted some gin - I said I had no money - She said I should not go out till I either paid for the room or treated her-she had locked the door - She opened the door, and three more women rushed in-Watson was one of them-she said, pay me for the room - I refused-all four of them closed round me - I held my watch ribbon - They tried to get it-one of them said, "it is of no use-down with him." They laid me flat on my back-one held my legs, the other my arms, and another my mouth, while the fourth took my watch from my fob. Three of them then got away. I caught hold of the other, but she escaped also. I called out stop thief, and murder. She struck me several times on my mouth, and knocked me down. I was covered with blood (it was in a dark court.) One woman came to my assistance. I gave information at the watch-house. I do not know the other two prisoners. She did not force me into the room - She asked me to sit down - I refused, and she pushed me down - She would not let me go. I went willingly with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear before the Magistrate, that she forced you into the room against your will - A. Yes, she asked me to come with her.</p>

I live next door to the house. I went down, and saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner, Williams, who goes by the name of Poll Chapman. She lived on the first floor in that house. She said, let me go. I have not robbed you. He said, you are one of them. I went to get the patrol, but could not. I returned, and saw her throw him down, and run away. I afterwards got the watchman - He went to the house with me, and we found the door locked. Before that, I went into the room, and got the prosecutor's hat and umbrella out. The hat was on the table, and the umbrella in the corner.</p>
               <p>MARY SOLOMON. I lived in George-court, Brick-lane, at that time. I heard the cry of murder. I went out with a light, and saw the prisoner, Williams, run out of the door of the house where the robbery was committed. I lifted the man up - He was bleeding very fast.</p>

            . I am a patrol. The prosecutor and Bolt came up to me about nine o'clock, and he said he had been beaten and robbed. Bolt said she knew them. We went to look for the prisoners, but could not find them. The next morning, Watson, Smith and Williams, were brought to the watch-house. I found the prisoner, Levy, standing at the watch-house bars talking with the prisoners. One of them asked her where the key of her door was; she said somebody had got it, but I could not hear what name. One of them said, "what have you done with the watch." She said, "I have sold it, to be sure." There was nobody else in the watch-house. She turned round, and saw me, and I took her. Cokely was with me.</p>

On the 8th of December, about eight o'clock in the morning, a man said he had found some leather secreted in the stove. I examined it - it was folded in a handkerchief. I brought it into the shop, replaced it again, and when the prisoner returned from breakfast charged him with stealing it - he denied it for half an hour. I said I was convinced he took it - he said he knew nothing of the handkerchief. I turned to one of the other men, and asked him if he knew anything of it - he said he had seen it in the prisoner's possession several times. I asked him if he still persisted in denying it; he did so, and I gave him in charge; he then acknowledged taking it. I had made him no promise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Did he confess immediately after denying it - A. It was a quarter of an hour after. He was eight years in our service, We detected him in stealing candles about two years ago.</p>

            . On the 8th of December I went to work about eight o'clock in the morning, Burgess was then at work. I went to the shed, the prisoner left the place where he worked, and went to the stove - I came down, found him there, and behind a parcel of skins I found this leather, wrapped in a handkerchief. I informed Mr. Rose. When the prisoner returned from breakfact he went to the stove, and I saw him bend his body back towards the leather. Mr. Rose and the constable came up almost immediately, took the leather from the stove, and asked who knew anything of it. Burgess said he knew nothing of it. I said I believed the handkerchief was his, as I had seen him with it many times - he still denied it. Mr. Rose gave him in charge - he was handcuffed, and as he was being taken from the shop he said it was his first offence, and desired Mr.

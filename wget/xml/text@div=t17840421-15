            ? - Yes; the prisoner met me in Tooley-street, on the 24th of March, I was in a hurry, going upon some business in the street, and he stopped me; he said Mr. Smith, how do you do; I said I was very well; he said, Sir, do not you remember me; says I, I do your face, but not your name; God bless me! says he, do not you, my name is Frazer, I was cast away with you on board the L'Hector; I recollected the face of this man, and I knew there was a man of the name of Frazer on board.</p>
               <p>Did he say his Christian name? - He said his Christian name was John, he told me that he was come up from Portsmouth, and I think he said he belonged to the Ganges, and that he coul d not get the wages there of the L'Hector, and could not find any of the officers to give him a certificate, that he was starving in the street, he lay with an old shipmate at Deptford, and had not money for a pint of beer; I told him he must go out to the captain, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270050"></xptr> he lived at Richmond, he seemed to be very willing to go, and walked with me as far as the end of Tooley-street; I directed him the way to Richmond, and he told me, Sir, says he, I have not a halfpenny in the world, and the boatswain and other of the warrant officers have given the people certificates, and they have got their wages, and if you give me a certificate it will be the same thing; I said, no, they will not pay it on my certificate any more than on your word; he said, Sir, for God's sake give me a certificate, and if they will not pay me on that, it is only going to the captain at last; from my own good nature and humanity together, and the man's being cast away with me, his request being so very small, I went into a shop, and I wrote him that certificate.</p>

               <p>Then you are now satisfied that this is not Frazer, but Boyle? - That he went by the name of Boyle; the person of Frazer I do not recollect, he was wounded in the action with the frigates, after he was wounded, he was incapable of duty, therefore, in the middle of our distress, I saw nothing of him, but this man I perfectly remember.</p>

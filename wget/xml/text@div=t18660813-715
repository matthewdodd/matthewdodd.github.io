I am a brickmaker, and live at No. 2, Latimer Road, ammersmith—on Wednesday, 25th July, I was at a public-house in Latimer Road—Burgin was there—two men went out to fight—I heard Burgin say that he had fought, and who he had fought, and he could show them how to fight—he was talking more to himself than anybody else—he was drunk and excited—about half-past five o'clock John Fisher came in—Burgin was then sitting on a form talking about who he had fought, and Fisher said, "You had better let that alone; you are getting too old for it"—Burgin then got up and struck Fisher in the chest—Fisher said, "What is that for? I don't want to fight"—Burgin was going wrangle again, and got up in an attitude of fighting—they closed and got entangled—they fought one round and were parted by two men—I then went away—I returned some few minutes after seven, and Fisher was then on the green senseless, with blood all over his face.</p>

I am a blacksmith, and live at Notting Hill—on 25th July I was at the "Britannia" public-house, asleep in the parlour—I was awoke by a noise—I went into the bar and saw Burgin in a scuffle with Fisher—the landlord separated them—Burgin put ten shillings on the bar, and said he would fight Fisher and give him sixpence a round to fight—he threw his cap on my feet, and I kicked it back to him—he said, "What did you do that for?"—I said, "What did you throw it on my feet for? If you throw it there again I shall kick it again"—he deliberately picked it up and threw it with full force at my feet again—I kicked it back again—he then got up and was going to strike me—he said he had fought bigger men than me, and he could fight me—the landlord put him down and told him he had better not fight me, he would get in the wrong—he pulled his things off and went out to fight—his wife came to prevent</p>

               <p>him, and I said, "Take him away, I do not want to fight him"—he pushed his wife on one side of me, and rushed at me and struck me on the forehead, and then I knocked him down—after we had had three rounds he said he would give me in the best man, but he said, "I will go in and leather the old b—"—he went inside and began telling Fisher that it was him that set me on to him—Fisher said that he had nothing to do with it, he would fight his own battles if he wanted to fight—Burgin challenged him again, and at last Fisher said, "You will let me leave off when I have had enough "—and they went out and fought, I should think for upwards of half an hour—I saw Fisher fall several times, and ultimately he fell and was not able to get up again—he was picked up, and I heard it hallowed out that it was all over—Gadsden said he would spend a shilling apiece if they would leave off—Fisher had not put me on to Burgin in any way.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>). I am the prisoner's brother—on 25th July I was fetched to the public-house by my little girl as I was having my tea—when I got there I found a ring was formed, and my brother was fighting with Fisher—I do not know that there was any difference in size between my brother and Fisher—I caught hold of my brother's two arms, and said, "Tom, you are too tipsy; you shan't fight"—he was very tipsy—Gadsden turned round and hit me in the mouth, and made my nose and mouth bleed—I was obliged to let them continue the fight—I stood by and saw several rounds, but not to look at them, because I dare not go nearer than I was—I heard Mrs. Fisher say her husband was to show his temper out of doors the same as he did at home—I was examined before the magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>). I was at the public-house when this happened—I did not see the beginning of it—when I went in I saw Burgin with a black eye, and Fisher also—I heard Burgin say to Fisher, "Fisher, it was a very unmanly trick of you to put a big sober man on to a drunken man," that was alluding to Watkins—Fisher said, "I did not"—Burgin said, "I am man enough to fight you, I will fight you if you like"—Mrs. Fisher said, "You show your temper at home, go out and fight him;" she said that, I believe, once or twice—Fisher then said, "Well, Tom, I will go out and fight you; you will let me leave off when I have had enough, will you?"—they then went out to fight—Fisher went out first—they pulled off their clothes, and fought on the green—there was no particular ring, only a crowd of people—I did not see Gadsden do anything—they fought about twenty minutes—I saw Fisher knock Burgin down five or six rounds with his left hand—I heard Gadsden say that each man should stand three pots of beer and turn it up—Burgin then went up to Fisher, and said, "Fisher, how is this to be?" holding out his hand—Fisher said, "No, Tom, we will finish it"—I think that it was three rounds after that that I saw Fisher fall—he fell backwards against the wall—he afterwards fell on his back—that was about two rounds before his death—as he was going back his heels caught against a piece of loose wall, and he fell—he did not fall on his head that time—the last round Burgin was coming up to fight him, and he said, "Get away from me, I know my game," mean<lb></lb>ing to hit him with his left hand—he ran back as fast as he could, and his heels caught against the ground and he fell—he was no particular fighter—he was a better man than Burgin at the first starting—I saw him fall—he never spoke afterwards.</p>

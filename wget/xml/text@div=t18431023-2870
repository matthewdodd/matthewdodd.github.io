                  </hi>. I am in the service of Ann Aldridge, a widow, of Orange-street, St. George's, Bloomsbury—she has a house and shop—I slept in the shop. On the morning of the 4th of Oct., about a quarter past five o'clock, I was awoke by the smashing of glass in the fan-light over the shutter—I saw a man's arm at the fan-light, taking out the flutes through the glass—there is a range of panes going along the top of the shutters, about four inches wide, to throw light into the shop—I should think it was about three feet from the door—the flutes were hanging inside, underneath that pane, about an inch from where it was broken—I went up to the window, and shook the framework of the glass inside—the man withdrew his arm, and dropped, taking with him the flute—I heard something fall heavily out<lb></lb>side, as if some one had fallen down—I awoke the inmates of the house, and in about five minutes opened the door—I did not see any one outside—this flute produced is Ann Aldridge's property, and one of the flutes that was missing—here is a silver key, which I have every reason to believe to belong to this part of the flute—this was dropped inside the window—it is marked "W. M.," and the flutes are marked, "William Millhouse"—we clean them with rouge, and the rouge is on them—flutes are mostly cleaned with whiten<lb></lb>ing—the three flutes are worth about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece—the glass was quite sound when I went to bed the night before—I was the last person is the shop.</p>

On the 4th of Oct., about half-past two o'clock, the prisoner came, and asked if I bought old silver, and how much an ounce I would give for it—I said I could not tell till I saw it—he produced this broken piece of a silver key—I asked what it belonged to—he said to an old flute—I asked him if he had the other part with him—he said it was at home, at No. 29, Edmund-street—I said I would step round to Edmund-street, and if he produced the other part, and lived there, and it was all right, I would buy it of him—as we were going he said the reason he broke the silver off was that the other end of the flute was lost—I went to No. 29, Edmund-street, with him, and then he said he lived at No. 29, Northampton-street—I went there—he made me stop outside while he went in—I stopped in the passage—a woman came into the passage—he came down again, and said if I was not satisfied with what the woman said, he would call his mother—I</p>

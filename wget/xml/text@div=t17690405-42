On the 4th of March, about four in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop for some lawn. She was very difficult, asked for several sorts, and looked over a great many parcels. At last she fixed upon one, and ordered me to cut some off. After that she went out of the shop. When she was gone, I looked to see if she had taken any thing. I missed a piece of lawn. I followed her into Bedford-Bury, and there I took her. Under her cloak she had the piece. (Produced in court.) It is my property, and was lying by her when she was in the shop. There are twelve yards of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am an unfortunate woman of the town. The prosecutor met with me in the street, and took me to the Turk's Head, in James-Street, where he treated me with wine. Some familiarites passing between us, and he having no money, ordered me to come to his shop. I came, and he gave me this piece of lawn.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was you ever in company with the prisoner at the bar at any tavern?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the same defence she made before the Justice. Upon my oath I never was in company with her in any room but in my shop in my life. I never saw her but once before,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050027"></xptr> to my knowledge, which was in my shop, and then I believe she robbed me. There is not a word in her defence true. I never was in a tavern with her; I never drank wine with, nor gave her this piece of cloth, or any thing else.</p>

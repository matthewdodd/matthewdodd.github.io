               <p>Q. Did you look to see how the people had got in? - They came in at a back window that is on the stair case.</p>
               <p>Q. What appearance was there that any body had got in there? - One pane of glass was broke, and they put their hand in and took out the staple, and that window was open when I came home, the window is almost one story from the ground, there is a wash-house underneath, and a water-butt, so they got on the water-butt, and then on the wash-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see whether there was any appearance of feet? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Clarke. Did you see how the people had got in? - There was the marks of somebody's feet on the water-butt; they had broken some of the laths of the railing which parts one yard from the other, the water-butt stands in the next yard close against the wall, from whence they got up to the wash-house apparently, and broke the pane of glass, and did the business, the wash-house being low.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get the double lock open? - They forced the screws out, one screw was forced out into the middle of the room.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Sharp.

               <p>Prisoner Wilson.

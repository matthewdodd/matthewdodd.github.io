            . I live in Golden-lane. I was at the Golden Anchor on an errand, and saw the prosecutrix come for change for a 5l. note - she held it up in her hand - Norris went behind her, and snatched it out of her hand - Edwards was close behind him; they both ran away together; I am certain of their persons; I knew them both well before, and have no doubt whatever of them - I ran after them, but they got out of my sight - I did not call Stop thief! as I thought I should catch them, and knew I should know them; I knew their names - they have lived in the neighbourhood a long time - I told my father their names directly I got home.</p>

            . I keep the public-house. Edwards came on the 23d of September for change for a 5l. note; I could not get it as it was up-stairs, and I had no one to mind the bar; she went out, and came in again, and two or three customers came in at the same time; she held the note up with her finger and thumb, and a bit of the note out; she was standing with her back to the door, and a person, in a light coloured jacket, came in, and snatched it out of her hand; but it was neither of the two prisoners; I do not know the man who took it, but it was neither of them - I did not see Sophia Fordham there - I have a strong suspicion who it was - I saw him walking from the door; there were not two of them; there was only one - I do not know whether Fordham was there - I did not see any girl run out and give an alarm; the first thought that struck me was, that it was her son who took it; I have seen the two prisoners before - they have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260100"></xptr>at my house - Fordham lives in the neighbourhood; her father is an officer; I believe the prisoners lived in the neighbourhood - I am not acquainted with their friends - I did not tell the Magistrate that I had some suspicion of a person; but I have seen a chap since brought up for some offence; I do not know what, and have now some suspicion of a person.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Norris that evening from my daughter's information - she described him - I have known him for years. I took Edwards about twelve o'clock next day; he had a blue coat on. Norris was in a corderoy jacket and trowsers; we took him to the watch-house; he was talking to some woman there, and said there had been a to-do about a 5l. note at the bottom of Golden-lane. I know they frequented the Golden Anchor public-house all day long, and have moved them from there a hundred times - Edwards had changed his jacket for a coat.</p>

            . I was with Fordham, and took Norris - Edwards was taken next morning; he had a blue coat on; I had seen Norris at the Golden Anchor scores of times; Edwards had changed his light coat for a blue one with a man named Bone.</p>
               <p>NORRIS' Defence. I was at the house having a pint of beer; Fordham came in; I said to Mrs. Jones, "What does he say?" he said there was a 5l. note lost; "Is there?" said I, but no one took me; as I returned from the play, Harrison dragged me into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>EDWARD'S Defence. I was at the corner of my own court; one Bone came and said, "Will you sell me your coat;" I said, No - he said, "Let me try it one;" he did, and then went into a public-house to light his pipe - he came out with a 5l. note in his hand, and said, "I have a 5l. note;" he ran against me, and ran away, leaving me his coat to put on.</p>

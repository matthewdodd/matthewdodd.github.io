I believe I was up last on the night of the 3d of August - I was as late as a quarter before twelve o'clock; the house was then secure every where, and my property was safe. My servant was up first next morning; one of my lodgers came and told me that my house had been broken open in the night. I came down and found the back door leading from the garden broken open - I believe it had been secure when I went to bed. I missed some spoons, some knives and forks, a tea-pot, a jug, and an apron, of my own property; two shoes and a desk, the servant's property, and two boots of Mr. Fairless, and one shirt of Mr. Matthews - that part of the property which was not my own, I do not know the value of. I afterwards saw the spoons shewn to me by the officers. I never saw either of the prisoners till they were before the Magistrate.</p>

I got up about six o'clock in the morning on the 4th of August; it was quite light. I cannot say how the back door had been opened - it had been fastened with bolts the night before, when I went to bed; but it was open when I got up - the front kitchen shutters were open, and one of the windows thrown up. I missed the property which my mistress has described. I did not find any phosphorous, but found some matches which were not there when I went to bed - they appeared to have been lighted - some of them I swept up, and others I have taken care of. I am sure I fastened all the doors when I went to bed - the desk which I lost was worth about 1 l.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. I heard of this transaction about half-past five o'clock on the morning of the 4th of August. I went in company with Yates to a house in Higham's-buildings, Bluecoat-fields, and saw the prisoner Barton in bed undressed - two more men were lying on the bed dressed. The two men walked out of the room; and Ravenor who was also in the room followed them. Yates followed Ravenor and brought him back to me with his hat in his hand - he had hardly left the room a moment. I put my hand in the hat, and found a silver table-spoon, a tea, and salt spoon, and part of a metal spoon. I then searched him and found in his pocket a bunch of phosphorous matches. I asked him how he came by the property - he said he found it in Stepney-fields. Barton said "Here's a pretty job you've done for me." I asked Barton if he lodged there - he said Yes, and paid 8 d. a night for his bed. Yates then examined Barton farther.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. What kind of a morning was it? A. It was light. I do not know whether it had been raining in the course of the night - it was dry when I saw the prisoners. Barton was undressed - the others went away.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the place in question, between five and six o'clock in the morning with Gray. I saw the persons in the room, and knowing two of them in particular I said "Gray its not all right;" I then saw a pair of women's shoes under the bed. The other two, whom I knew, then walked out - Ravenor followed them, and I said to Gray "I think there's something in that boy's hat," for I heard something chink. I then went after him, and took hold of his hat, and two silver spoons dropped out of it. I took him back to Gray, who took the rest of the property. I then searched the bed, and found an apron on the top of it, which has been identified. I then asked Barton what he had got in his pocket - he said, nothing he was afraid of. I searched his pockets, but found nothing relating to this. I asked how he came possessed of the shoes, and he said Ravenor put them under the bed.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>RAVENOR'S Defence. As I was going over Stepney-fields, I saw a bundle lay, and I took it up and opened it. I found the matches, these spoons, and an apron. Two boys called out, "That is ours." I said it was not theirs or it would not have laid there - they followed me, and I went to ask Barton to let me in, as it rained very fast.</p>

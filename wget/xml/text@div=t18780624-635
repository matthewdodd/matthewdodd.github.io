                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Bartley, a solicitor, of Maryle<lb></lb>bone Road—on 12th September the four prisoners called there—Pedrolli, who had been a client before, introduced the others, and said that he had bought some property of them and wanted it transferred—Mr. Bartley was out of town—an assignment was produced of a house 173, High Street, Newington, and the transfer of the goodwill, lease, and stock-in-trade from Giovanni Moriggla to Pedrolli, of 173, High Street, Newing<lb></lb>ton, for the consideration of 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and an assignment of 25, Albion Terrace, Newington, from the two Moriggias for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to O'Connor, who was described in the instructions as of the City Road Basin, and of 1A, Kempsford Road, Surrey—they wanted it next day as one of the Moriggias could not say on which day he was going to Italy—I told them they could not have the assignment till 4 o'clock next Friday, the 14th, but they pressed me to get it ready by 10 o'clock—they gave me the title deeds and I took them down to Folkestone to be examined by my prin<lb></lb>cipal, as I could not send them by post—I got the assignments made on the 14th at 4 o'clock—in consequence of this letter which I wrote them Giovanni and Pedrolli and O'Connor came to the office and executed them—the deeds were left with me to be stamped, and that Carlo might execute them, as he could not attend that day—he called on the 15th and executed the assignments and the deeds were left with me till the 17th, when Carlo called and removed them and the assignments—the costs had been paid on the 14th—I read the deeds to the defendants in English, and they appeared to understand them—O'Connor paid 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in our office on the 14th; part of the consideration money, and he told me that the balance would be paid.</p>

Pedrolli was introduced to Mr. Bartley by Mr. De Bella, a client of respectability, who we knew—instead of employing a conveyancer, it being a simple matter, I went down to Mr. Bartley at Folkestone and he did it himself—I carried out what was required—O'Connor paid 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I understood that the rest had been paid beforehand—Pedrolli paid nothing in my presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>.

               <p>I lost a shirt buckle the 29th of April, between four and five; I was in my shop, the prisoner came to look at some plated shoe buckles; I shewed him some, he fixed on a pair, and asked for some knees to match them, I turned round, and he got a silver shirt buckle over his little finger, he had not time enough to hide it, I saw him put it into his waistcoat pocket; I shewed him a pair of knee buckles that would match them, he said, these will do, make out a bill, and I will call again, and he put down two shillings; and I said, there was no occasion for that, he took it up again, I said, you'll please to give me my silver shirt buckle out of your pocket; he said, your shirt buckle! and out he ran, I ran after him, and several more; before I could get to the turning, he came upon me, says he, you may search me if you please, and see if I have got any thing of the kind; I said, I suppose you have hid it now; and I offered five shillings to any body that would find it, and some persons went to look, and found three of my silver thimbles, and a person brought the shirt buckle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. What is this value of it, without fashion? - I suppose about seven pence.</p>

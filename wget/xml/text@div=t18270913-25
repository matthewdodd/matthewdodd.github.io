            . I am now blind. I lived with James Jones as his wife, for twenty-three or twenty-four years. On Sunday, the 27th of May, we were living together at Mr. Burgess', No. 9, Long-alley; he is a <rs id="t18270913-25-deflabel159" type="occupation">tailor</rs>

We were very comfortable all day Saturday and Sunday; we breakfasted and dined together - I had no dispute with him at all - I think I laid down about half-past one, it might be a quarter of an hour later when he came and struck me - I looked up when I heard him stir - he had been very bad in his head a month before Christmas, and he went to Bethnal-green mad-house about a week after Christmas - he used to get out, and walk about, talking all manner of stuff, and he would get out of bed in the night; we were then taking care of Mr. Payne's house in Earl-street, for six months; he was sent to the mad-house from there - I got an order from the churchwardens to have him out of the mad-house, when he had been there a fortnight, as I thought he was not well used; he was not discharged as well (he came back to Mr. Payne's); he seemed unhappy when I went to see him, and said he could not eat anything that was in the house; he was very ill in his bowels after he came out; nothing but blood came from his bowels, and all like pieces of flesh; two doctors attended him; he had got well enough to go out before this happened - Mr. Bracker, the tailor, of Bell-alley, employed him; he only worked a little at a time; we worked at home - I used to fetch and carry it home - I had given him a sovereign on the Saturday, to go and buy something for dinner, and when he came in, I asked for the change - he said he could keep it as well as me - I did not care how long he kept it, so that he did not go drinking with it; he gave me 6s. of it in the afternoon, and 8s. on Sunday morning; he said he should do no good with it, and when he got a little liquor, he gave away a shilling among half-pence.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you know how old he is? A. I dare say he is full seventy-two or seventy-three; we always lived very happy together. I am sure I saw him come to me with the poker - he would not go out to drink sometimes for three or four months: he was a very bad temper when he got drunk: he has been flighty ever since I knew him, whenever he got beer - he had no money in his pocket when I gave him the sovereign - he said he had a few halfpence; he had not been drinking the night before, but I knew he had that morning. I had the care of Payne's house, and I always took the work home, and received the money for it every Saturday. He had earned the sovereign.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he been doing when he was sent to the mad-house? A. He got drinking a little gin, and that drove him raving mad; he got a mob round him, and they were afraid he would do some mischief; I applied to the churchwardens to take him to his own parish, and me to mine, about five weeks before this happened; as I was afraid of personal violence - our parishes are only a mile apart. The churchwarden promised to come, and the very Monday after this happened he came to take him away. I had not changed my mind about his going - I thought if he was not able to work if I was down there I could assist him.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you, during this five weeks, think it unsafe to leave him at large? A. I did go away from him once or twice, but he was so unhappy I was obliged to go back to him; I left him because when he was in that way, he was so hot in his temper, I did not know what might happen. I thought he was attached to me, and wanted to see me again; I had said nor done anything to provoke him - he had no accident with his head while I knew him, but I have heard that he had, from his brother, who is dead. He had a daughter living in Peter-street, Sun-street, and a brother in Rosemary-lane; he always treated me kindly - we were affectionate together. I did all I could to make him comfortable. I have only one child. I am quite blind.</p>

            . I am one of the house-surgeons of St. Bartholomew Hospital. This woman was brought there on Sunday, the 27th of May - I examined her about four o'clock that day - there were four wounds on her head, and a contused wound across the nose, and a contused wound on her left hand, which fractured two of her fingers - the contused wound across the nose had deprived her of sight; two of the wounds were on the back of the head, and two on the left temple - they had the character of incised wounds. I should have said those four wounds had been done by a cutting instrument she has lost her sight from a rupture of the coats of the eye: the crystal fluid has escaped. I do not see the least probability of her recovering her sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Should you have called them incised wounds without the word "character" if you had not heard how it was done? A. Yes; there was a slight confusion, but not sufficient to call them contused; they had more the appearance of incised wounds - it is possible they might be made with a poker and yet have the character of incised wounds - I should call them cuts.</p>

            . The prisoner and the prosecutrix lodged with us for a month or five weeks. On Sunday, the 27th of May, I saw the prisoner in the morning, about nine o'clock, and saw him go out of the street door, between two and three o'clock; he said, "I have done for her:" I understood him to say so - he was talking to himself, as he went out - he did not address himself to me. I, my little girl, and my son went up to her room, and found her sitting on the bed, with her face covered with blood, leaning against the wall, with her hands up, wiping down the blood; she was so covered with blood I could not see her face till she wiped it down: she said something to me; Rice, a lodger, came into the room. My son took up the poker, and looked at it, in consequence of what she said - there was a little blood and hair on it, and it was bent. I sent for a surgeon, who washed her head with sponge; I saw it bleeding very much, and a place on the side of the head, which looked like cuts, bled. I did not see the prisoner again till he was taken. I had observed nothing particular in his conduct while at our house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to him when he used these words? A. I was in my room, but the door was open. I saw him go along the passage, and thought he went rather quicker than usual; my room door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130033"></xptr>opens into the passage; the surgeon who came was somebody from Mr. Robarts, of Sun-street; he cut a great deal of hair off.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear any noise or cry to lead you up stairs? A. My little girl called me, and as I was going up, I heard the woman cry; all the four wounds on her head were bleeding.</p>

            . I was at my father's, and saw the prisoner going out at the front door, about half-past two; I think the words he said were, "She has got it now - I have done for her." I heard a faint cry a few seconds before that, and thought it was a neighbour beating a child; I ran up stairs, and saw Mrs. Jones sitting on the bed, with her head against the wall; the bed was on the ground - she was covered with blood; I could not discern her features; there appeared three or four cuts on the head - they were clotted with blood, and her hair matted together; I could not tell whether they were cuts.

On the 28th of May, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I was at the corner of Lamb-alley, Long-alley, and saw the prisoner coming towards home; as soon as he saw me, he turned back again. I had heard of this, and went after him - I overtook him, tapped him on the shoulder, and said,"Old gentleman, I want you;" he said, "Is my poor wife dead?" I said I did not know, but I believe she was; he said he was most sure she must be, and said, "The Lord have mercy upon me, I am done for - and I hope the Lord will receive her soul; but she should not have aggravated me so - I did it in the heat of passion." I asked how he could be so cruel as to beat her so; he said he did not know, he had done it in his passion; I asked if he had done it all with the poker; he said, Yes; I asked if he had not a knife; he said he had done it all with a poker. I then took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a smith, and live in Earl-street. The prisoner and his wife took care of my house from the 1st of September to April, this year. I believe, at times, he was decidedly insane; shortly after he came to my house I went into the kitchen one morning - he asked how I did; I said I had a giddiness in my head; he said he had been affected many years in his head, and told me a story about his walking over different bridges; and said, "I was very ill a long time, but once, when I got to the centre of London-bridge I met the devil, I took him in my arms, and threw him over into the water;" I said, "If you killed the devil, how did you feel then?" he said, "I was quite well then, and came home to my work;" I considered him then not right in his head; I had him sent from my house to Warburton's, about the beginning of January, which was some time after this conversation; he used to talk irrational and incoherent, for a fortnight or three weeks before I had him moved; I had seen him decidedly deranger, and was afraid to keep him in the house - his wife tells me he expressed a wish to kill his brother - and I have heard him say very bad things about his brother; I was obliged to keep his brother down in my shop on the morning he was taken away; it is my full impression that at times he is insane.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see him after he came from Warburton's? A. He returned in a fortnight or three weeks to my house, and stopped till April; he was extremely ill in bodily health, and had a doctor attending him daily; he talked rational when he came back, but I avoided his company then; I was always afraid of him, as he still talked strange things, which made me sure he was out of his mind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was you under the same impression as to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130034"></xptr>the state of his mind, when he left you in April? A. Yes; I did not think him in his right mind; he was always very fond of this woman, and she of him; they seemed to live comfortably together; when he was taken from my house, he said, "Mr. Payne, I hope you will take care of my wife"- I then thought she was his wife.</p>

            . I am churchwarden of St. Andrew by the Wardrobe. I first saw the prisoner on the 3d of January. Mr. Payne applied to me to have him taken care of; I saw him, and, supposing him in an unsound state of mind, I got Mr. Houghton, a surgeon, to examine him; he gave me a certificate previous to sending him to Warburton's; the woman applied to me afterwards for an order to get him out, which I complied with; he came out very ill; Mr. Houghton and Mr. Burn attended him for about three months; about three weeks previous to this affair, the prosecutrix applied to me, saying he had gone into his old condition, and wished him returned to Bath. I went the same day, and saw him on his shopboard; he said, "Sir, you see in what state I am, and I wish to get to Bath." I considered him insane at that time.</p>
               <p>MR. HOUGHTON. I am a surgeon. I attended the prisoner on the 3d of January; I found him looking very wild, and talking incoberent; I questioned him; I considered him certainly of unsound mind, and certified that he was fit for confinement; that was the honest persuasion of my mind. I saw him on the 17th of January, on his return from Warburton's; the last time I saw him was on the 30th of January; I then thought his mind in some measure improved, but he was evidently still labouring under delusion.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are these delusions the test of insanity? A. Certainly; I have heard the woman's account of his bowel complaint; its being attended with bleeding would be very beneficial to his state of mind; it would improve it; and on his getting stronger, the delusion would be more likely to return.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Stanwell—the prisoner Bollingbroke had been in my service about seven months. On the 24th of April I searched a bag which I found on my premises—it contained about a peck and a half of split-beans—I left the bag there, and sent for a policeman—I have seen the bag since—this is it—I know the bag, and I can swear to the beans that are in it—I have a sample here in my pocket, taken from the same bin as they were—they are mine.</p>

I was on duty at Stanwell on the 24th of April—Mr. Freeman gave me some directions, and I put two scarlet beans and some paper pellets in a bag of beans that was in the loft—I then got into some adjoining premises, and between nine and ten o'clock I saw Bollingbroke come out of the bakehouse, and go up to the loft—he came down again, and looked up and down the yard—he went into the stable, and then up in the loft, and brought out this bag—he came to near where I was, and put it over the wall—he then went into the stable, remained there about a quarter of an hour, and then went into the bakehouse, and in about a quarter of an hour I saw Lay come from her house, go and take the bag of beans, and go towards her own house—I told Mr. Freeman what I had seen—I then went to Lay's house—I found her and Bollingbroke sitting there—I asked her what she had done with the beans—both of the prisoners asked me what beans I meant—I told Lay the beans she brought out of the garden, and it was no use her denying it, for I would find them—I took the candle to go into the back place, and Lay said she would show it me—I found the bag with the beans in it, and the scarlet beans and the pellets—both the prisoners asked me not to say anything about it—in going to the station, Bollingbroke said he had lost 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a beer shop, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he had got from his matter, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he expected to get from Lay.</p>

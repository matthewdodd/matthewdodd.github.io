I was in the bar of the public-house—there were half-crowns, two-shilling pieces, shillings, and sixpences in the till—I put two florins in the till—I marked both florins first, and then shut the till up—the prisoner sub<lb></lb>sequently came into the bar a few minutes after the half hour—he was left in the bar alone for about an hour—At 10. 30 I examined the till; the prisoner was then in the bar—I found one of the two florins that I had marked was missing; this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I had emptied the tills, with the exception of a shilling in each till, which we leave in every two hours—after doing so, I spoke to my master; he was then going out—next morning, Sunday, Mr. Whale came into the bar with Inspector Turk—my</p>

               <p>master said to the prisoner, "George, I want to speak to you," and called him up stairs into the sitting-room—he asked him if he had any marked money about him, and he said not that he was aware of—he then asked him if he had any objection to let him see what he had—he said No, he had no objection—the four of us then went up into his bedroom—the prisoner had a box there, and he unlocked it and took out a purse containing some silver and a half-sovereign, amounting to something over 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that money was examined, but we did not find the marked florin amongst it—Inspector Turk asked him if he had any more money—he said "No"—afterwards we went to his cupboard, where his clothes were hanging up, and took some money from his pocket; five two-shilling pieces—he said he had forgotten that he had that—the cupboard was not locked, nor the bedroom door—another young man, the second barman, slept in his bedroom, but he was not in the bar on that Saturday between 9.30 and 10. 30—the Inspector examined the five florins, and found the one produced—I identified it as the one I marked—the prisoner said, if it was marked, I must have put it there—after some little talk, he said he had borrowed the money in his pocket from his brother the Sunday previous.</p>

I keep the Barley Mow—on Saturday morning, the 2nd of August, Long made a communication to me—on the following Sunday morning I brought Inspector Turk into the house—I said to the prisoner I was very sorry he had been doing wrong, and asked him if he had any objection to tell me what money he had got—he said "No"—I said "Well, will you show it to me?"—he said "Yes, you can see it if you like," and he walked up to his bedroom, unlocked his box, and took out a purse—he said he bad got about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him if he had any money anywhere else—he said "I forgot; I have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my trowsers pocket that I got from my brother last Sunday, but that I can account for"—he took the money out of the pocket, and one of the florins was marked—he said "I do not know anything about it; if it is marked it was put in my pocket; I did not put it there."</p>

            . I am a constable of the West India Docks. On the night of the 21st of May, I was on duty. There was a watchman of the name of James, who told me of a noise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Then you go down, and send up James.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JAMES. I am a watchman in the West India Export Docks. On Sunday night the 22nd of May, I heard a noise a little before ten; it was a noise, as if somebody was being severely beaten. I listened again and heard it repeated. At first it did not appear to be so far off as the ship William. I then went towards where I thought it came from, and there I heard it for twenty minutes of time continued; I then was almost convinced that the noise came from the ship William; but that ship not being in my division of the watch, I took no further notice of it. I communicated what I heard to Parsons, and somebody else, when they came round; there were some ships at anchor round the William, there was one at her head; another at her stern, and three or four between her and me; perhaps she might be two hundred yards from me or more.</p>

            . I am a constable in the West India Docks; I remember the night of Sunday the 21st of May; I was on watch between twelve and one. I stood by the side of the ship William, in consequence of hearing, as I thought, some noise proceed from her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where was she - A. Close to the quay. I stood by her a little time, and all was perfectly quiet. We then went our rounds, and had proceeded about between three and four hundred yards from the vessel, when we heard the noise on board the ship again, I mean the ship William. We saw the prisoner sitting on the side of the ship, as if he intended to jump on shore. His legs were hanging outside; It was high water, and the deck of the ship was considerably above the quay; from seven to ten feet higher than the quay. The prisoner was shouting out murder. When I first heard the noise, it was loud and violent. When we saw the prisoner he was using expressions that we could not understand. When we came near to him, we heard him scream murder; and he said, he was in hell and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210020"></xptr>devils were tormenting him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Before you heard him use these expressions could he see you - A. He might see the light; but I should explain to you that when we heard the cry of murder, there was a number of ships in a line between him and us, and at different distances; as we walked along he might have seen us through the spaces between the ships; but that would depend upon our situation.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first heard the noise, could he see you - A. I do not know. He could not, unless he saw between the opening of two ships, because there was a corner; but when we got within thirty yards of him, he could have seen the light distinctly. We went up close to the side of the ship where he was sitting in the situation I have described. He was crying out murder! saying he was in hell, and the devils were tormenting him. We desired him to go on board the ship; he did, and we followed him. He said he had killed one of his tormentors and wounded all the rest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What state of mind did he appear in - A. In a very disturbed state of mind. We held the light up to look at him, and saw he had no coat nor waistcoat on, and his hands and face were extremely bloody. We asked him where the people were that had been tormenting him. He said if we would go with him he would shew us. We looked all over the upper deck, the hatchways were all closed up. We looked all round the forecastle, but we could not find any person on board but the prisoner. Not finding any one, we asked the prisoner where the man was that he had murdered; when pointing to the fore peake, he said he is down there, I threw him down there - that is were they keep the coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there any coals there - A. I don't know; there was a great deal of rubbish below. I desired my partner, Winnel, to go down with the light. He went down; I saw him shake his head; he said, it is so, here is the man, and he is dead enough. I told the prisoner to go down into the fore peake. He went down and I followed him. When I went down, I told my partner to see if life was extinct. We told the prisoner to lift the body up for it was jammed up in a corner. He lifted it up perfectly unconcerned. There was a great deal of blood, and I thought the throat was cut; I felt, but it was not; the body had on a worsted shirt and a pair of duck trowsers. His neck was quite cold, but his head, and other parts of his body were warm. We found a very large wound on the back part of his head, and his arm was very much bruised. He had only one arm. We saw a great quantity of pieces of wood lying about some might be four inches square; there was part of a broken handspike, there was particularly the piece, I observed with nails in it. These pieces of wood were in the fire-peake. I should have said in the forecastle where the body appeared to have been thrown from down into the peake. There was a good deal of blood, I can't say how much there was. There was some human hair sticking to a piece of wood with the nails in it. That piece of wood was covered with blood.</p>
               <p>COURT. Can you judge whether the blood which was on it spurted on it, or whether that was the piece of wood which inflicted the wound - A. We did not examine it close enough to be able to say. We asked the prisoner, how he came to murder the man, and what he had murdered him with; he said the man would not let him go up the ladder, and he fetched him a rap with a piece of wood. He then began to relate, that he had written a letter to his wife that evening, I asked him where it was; and he said it was on the cabin table; I asked him where the key of the cabin was, he said the keys were in the deceased pockets I told him to go and fetch them, and he did. He unlocked the cabin door we went in and found the letter as he described on the table.</p>
               <p>(The letter produced.)</p>
               <p>That is the letter. We then took the prisoner into custody, and took him to the watchhouse, he seemed to conduct himself orderly there. I saw him at his examination before the magistrate. He there seemed much confused, and in the same state he was on board the ship. I saw him on the Tuesday following, he then seemed perfectly sober and sensible. He said he did not recollect me, he did not know me. I asked him how this unhappy affair happened. he said he did not know he did it; he had not the least animosity towards the deceased. He said he had been many a voyage with him; I told him I had that letter which he had written for his wife. I asked him if I should write a copy of it, and send it to her; he said no, he did not wish that I should; and he hoped I would give that letter to him. He gave me directions to write another letter to his wife, together with her address.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Now during the time you were on board the ship did he seem prompt and ready in his answers, or did he hesitate at all - A. I don't recollect that he hesitated at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did he appear, in the same disturbed state of mind the first time he was before the magistrate as when he was on board the ship - A. He seemed perturbed then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he as deranged before the magistrate as he was on board the ship - A. He said but little; but as far as we could judge he was perturbed. I was before the magistrate with him the second day but not the first. On the Thursday he appeared to be as sensible and as collected as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you stated that murder was shouted out - A. Shouted out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are we to understand that it came from a disturbed mind - A. Very much so. He said he was in hell, and with devils.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then appear disturbed - A. He appeared very much disturbed.</p>
               <p>Q. He killed one man, and wounded all the rest; but there was no rest to kill - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. From the manner he delivered these expressions what was your opinion of him - A. At that moment I conceived the man not at all right.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever entertained a different opinion from the opinion which what you then saw gave you - A. I have. There was one circumstance he stated on coming to himself; on the Tuesday morning, that he had not known where he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you think on the Thursday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210021"></xptr>morning that he was seen in his mind, and do you still continue to think so - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you saw him in the watchhouse, was he then composed - A. Something more so than when he was on board the ship.</p>
               <p>

            . I am a constable of the West India Docks. On the 21st of May I was on duty in company with the last witness. I had heard a noise before, and when I heard it again it was about half past twelve; according to my judgment it proceeded from the William; I was about three hundred yards from her; I had a light in my hand. The prisoner was sitting on the side of the vessel about midship. When we walked up along side, he reached down to take the light; I bid him go on board again, which he did. We went up the side, had went over to the gangway, and asked him what was the matter. He said, that the devil, and captain Derby, theives, and spirits were in the ship, and that they had been tearing his heart out. That the devil had been running after him through the ship, and wanted to put him on a spit and roast him; he said he had killed one man, and wounded all the rest; we asked him where they were, and he said they were all below. I saw that all the hatchways were locked, and we were obliged to go down the forecastle. I told him to come down, which he did, and my partner after him. I looked all round the forecastle and down the hold, with a light, but could see nothing; I asked him where he had put the man he had murdered, he said, he had put him down that hole, pointing to the forepeake of the ship, where they keep the coals; that place is very small, the body was down in the hole, it was up in one corner of it, and could not have been there without somebody going down and putting it there. According to my opinion, he was murdered in the forepeake, and not in the forecastle. I did not see any blood in the forecastle, but a drop or two on the blanket. The deceased had but one arm, was small made, and by no means so stout or strong as the prisoner. He had no coat on, but a kind of canvass jacket and trowsers; I went down into the hole, the prisoner was there with me, and I said you have murdered the man; he composely said, to be sure I have. At the place where the body had first lain, before it had been removed into the corner, there was a great deal of blood on the coals and sticks. I think the man was thrown down into the hole and then murdered there; there was a great deal of blood on the wood; there was a great many pieces of wood, and it seemed that the wood had been divided by the body falling head first, and then the body was stowed away up in the corner; the body was two or three yards from where it was first thrown. The prisoner was in the hole with me, and so was my partner; I sat down, for the place would not allow me to stand up; I told the prisoner to bring the body over to me, he did; and brought the head close to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. In the situation in which the body was would it have been seen in open day - 
               <persName id="t18150621-43-person395">A. </persName>
            You could not see into the hole at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then the body was in a place in which it would have been visible in the day time - A. It was, I took notice of the hand-spike; I saw the other piece of wood with nails in it which was covered with blood; I did not take notice of the nails in it at first; but afterwards I did; according to my opinion, I should think the wound was inflicted by the sticks, and not by the fall; indeed he told me so afterward.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say this place was very small, was there room enough to give the blows in it - A. The place was very narrow; they might have been given with a small stick. I subsequently asked the prisoner what he had killed the man with, and he said with some pieces of wood. He seemed composed, and all the question I asked him, he answered me without hesitation.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you told him he must go along with you, what was his answer - A. He said very well, and seemed quite content; we asked him how he came to commit this horrid murder, he said he had written a letter which was on the cabin lable, and which would tell us all about it; we found the cabin door was locked; we asked him where the keys were, he said in the cooks (meaning the deceased's) pockets. He went back to the forecastle, and felt in the deceased's pocket; they were not there; he then moved the chest and took the keys from behind it; he gave us the keys, neither of us could unlock the door; he took the bunch of keys which consisted of nine, and found out the right key, and unlocked the door; we went into the cabin and there we found the letter as he had described.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did he appear composed at this time - A. Why sometimes he did, but at other times he used very queer expressions. We read the letter, but found it contained nothing relative to the murder. We took him out of the ship, and took him to the watchhouse; as we were going along the watchman were crying two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. As you were going along, did he appear aware you were taking him in custody, and that he was under restrain - A. I think so, certainly, we took him to the watchhouse, and went away, and returned in about an hour with Mr. Gibson. The first words he said when we came back, that the devils and Captain 
               <persName id="t18150621-43-person396">Derbyshire</persName>
             were in the watch-house, and that he could have no rest there; we stopped with him, and took off his coat to show our master and the watchhouse keeper the blood on his shirt; he looked at me very earnestly in the face, and said, what the devil, have you been telling him what I have done; and seemed well aware that he had done something amiss. He was locked up that night, and I did not see him until the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The last witness was with me the whole of the time, he might have heard the expressions relating to Captain Derbyshire's ghost, he used it several times. Latham might have heard him say that the devils wanted to roast him on a spit, he used all these incoherent expressions more than once and Latham had as good an opportunity of hearing them as I had. At times the prisoner seemed very perturbed in his mind, seemed very much deranged, and looked very wild.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these expressions seem to come from a man in his inward reason - A. Why sometimes I thought he was out of his mind, at other times he answered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210022"></xptr>me so composely; that I thought he had plenty of reason. The ship was close up to the side.</p>

            . I am beadle of the parish. The prisoner was delivered to my care.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. During the time that he was under your care, how did he conduct himself generally? did he seem out of his mind - A. At times he conducted himself as if he was out of his mind; at other times not, Some times he appeared perfectly in his sound senses.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at any time enabled to judge whether he knew he was in custody - A. Certainly he did.</p>
               <p>JOHN PARSONS. I am the witness, who in consequence of some communication which I received of a noise on board the William, went on board about half past eleven. I looked down into the forecastle, and called below; a person answered, whom I afterwards discovered was the deceased. I asked who was making the noise below; is it any one hurting the one armed man; the voice replied no; it is the one armed man you are speaking to. Immediately there was a confusion on the occipital bone, and on the left side, there was a second fracture on the parvidal bone, which had penetrated the skull, and entered the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge whether these wounds were inflicted by a fall; or by blows - A. One fall would not have made all the wounds. There were other wounds in the front of the face; one under the right eye, and several other small ones. The lacerations on the head were great, but the fractures small; the one on the parvidal bone as if made by a nail driven in. It might happen that a fall head foremost down this hole upon a heap of scraggy pieces of wood with nails in some of them, might occasion both wounds on the head, and even the bruise on the arm. But I don't think such a fall could have occasioned the wounds on the face at the same time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you think that the wounds were inflicted by such an instrument as this, (shewing the witness the piece of wood with the nails in it) - A. I do. There were several dents on the face, which appeared to be inflicted by such an instrument as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210023"></xptr>20th of May last, between eleven and twelve, he wanted to go to sleep on the bench in the bar; he said, he had been to the Swan with Five Necks, and the Crown, in Ladd-lane; I thought by the manner in which he came in, that he was not right in his mind; he said a great many things that I could not understand.</p>
               <p>HARDY ROBINSON. I am clerk to a cheesemonger, in Newgate-street. I observed the conduct of the prisoner at the Dolphin; at first I said he was more I have than fool, his conduct was very strange; he said he had come to town by the Liverpool mail, and that he had heard some people at the Crown conspiring to take away his life, and that they had followed him to the Dolphin; he insisted on having a bed, I told him I thought he was more knave than fool; he said, do you think I am come here to deceive you. He represented himself as Captain 
               <persName id="t18150621-43-person398">Foy</persName>
            ; by his conduct I think he was out of his senses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you mean to swear that he was in that state of mind, as not to know right from wrong; or that he did not know it was harm to cut a man's throat - A. I do not mean to swear to that.</p>
               <p>JAMES CROOKSHANK. I was at the Dolphin and I observed the conduct of the prisoner, and thought he was out of his senses.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Mill-place, Commercial-road, Captain Derbyshire lodged with me. I never saw the prisoner until he called at my house on the 21st of May, at about half past seven, He seemed very much agitated, and was talking to himself when he was in the room, before Captain 
               <persName id="t18150621-43-person400">Derbyshire</persName>
             was up; Captain Derbyshire got up, and they breakfasted together; Captain 
               <persName id="t18150621-43-person401">Derbyshire</persName>
             went into the kitchen to be shaved, and the hair dresser left his hat in the room with the prisoner; the prisoner fastened himself in the parlour, and would let nobody come in, I went to the door, and begged him to open it, he said, he would not until Captain 
               <persName id="t18150621-43-person402">Derbyshire</persName>
             came, but afterwards he did. When we went in, he had the poker in his hand, and was muttering something to himself; I went up to him, and took hold of his hand, and asked him to compose himself; he muttered a great deal, and said, I had secreted a woman in the house. During the time I had this conversation with him, he seemed to be a deranged man, and out of his senses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. He came to breakfast with Captain 
               <persName id="t18150621-43-person403">Derbyshire</persName>

               <persName id="t18150621-43-person405">Derbyshire</persName>
            's, for the purpose of shaving him; I went into the room where Captain

             and the prisoner were, and observed the prisoner's conduct; he was murtering something to himself; and all on a sudden; he jumped up and wanted me to sit down; Captain 
               <persName id="t18150621-43-person407">Derbyshire</persName>
             went with me into the kitchen where I shaved him; but when I was going away, and wanted to get my hat the prisoner had locked the door, and would not let me in; I was obliged to go away without my hat, and come for it in the evening. From what I saw of the prisoner. I thought he was out of his mind. When he was in the room by himself, he talked a good deal about murder.</p>

            . I never saw the prisoner until I saw him on board my ship, which was about ten o'clock on the morning of the 21st; I and Giles Everest were in the yard when we saw Foy in the parlour, and they told me to go into the parlour to see that he did not break the glass, I went in, and moved the chair beside him; he started up immediately, and took the poker; we made to the door, for we were afraid he would strike us; he talked a great deal about a woman, and said there was a woman concealed in the house, he heard her voice. I knew Uraner Urwin; the prisoner saw Urwin in the morning when he was on board, and they were quite friendly together, and had no quarrel at all. From what I saw of the prisoner's conduct, I judge him to be out of his senses.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a public-house in Wapping-wall—Charles M'Carthy is in my employ as a coal-whipper. On the night of the 2nd of November, I saw the prisoner and another person at my house—I did not know the prisoner before, but I am sure he is the man I saw—they had some porter and gin—the prisoner attempted to go into the parlour—I prevented him—M'Carthy was in the tap-room at the time, and went out to shut the shutters—he had the shutter hook in his hand, which is used to pull the shutters up and down—the prisoner went out immediately after M'Carthy, and in about ten minutes I heard what I thought were blows, close by the house, near the window—I went to the door, and saw M'Carthy down, and the prisoner leaning over him—I saw the prisoner strike M'Carthy more than once—he got up, and I asked him to give me the stick, and not strike him again, but he followed him to the door and struck him several times—I cannot swear he struck him while on the ground, but I saw his hand move—he struck him with part of the window stick when he followed him—I cannot say what part—this is the stick—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I cannot say whether he used the hook part—I asked him to give me the stick—he said he would not—M'Carthy came towards me, and the prisoner followed him—after he arose I saw him strike him on the head, I should think four or five times, with the stick, but I do not know which end of it—it was broken in two in the pri<lb></lb>soner's hand—it was not broken when M'Carthy took it out—a man named Haley was in the house, and went out when the prisoner did—he was present when I went out, and was stooping over M'Carthy at the same time, but I did not see him strike at all—M'Carthy came into the house—I then spoke to a gentleman, and closed the door and fastened it inside—I opened it again, and the prisoner came up again—I said, "That is the man," and the gentleman took hold of him as he turned into the house—we fastened him in, and sent for the police—this stick was picked up in the street, and given to me by Mr. Goodman, immediately after the prisoner was taken away—it was stained with blood on the wooden end—I saw no blood on the hook end—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was sent for about eleven o'clock, and found the prisoner at Mrs. Punshon's house down on the floor, in front of the bar, and two or three persons holding him—I saw M'Carthy there—he was cut, and covered with blood on the head—there was also a quantity of blood on the table and on the floor—his head was tied up—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I attended at the station-house on the morning of the 3rd of November, about one o'clock, and found Charles M'Carthy there, and examined his head—there were two wounds, one in length about an inch, and depth a quarter of an inch, and the other not quite so much—the skin was broken in both of them—they appeared to have been given by a hook—one of this kind would produce such wounds, and I conceive a stick alone would not—there was a bruise more inclined to the right side.</p>

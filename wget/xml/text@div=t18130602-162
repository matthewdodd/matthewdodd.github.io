               <p>Q. Was you pocket picked of a handkerchief - A. Yes; about twelve o'clock in the day on the 18th of April. There was a crowd assembled to see the Prince Regent going to chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before you missed your handkerchief had you seen it - A. About an hour or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners there - A. I did not notice them. Johnson tapped me on the shoulder and said, that I had my handkerchief taken out of my pocket. I looked in my pocket directly, and my handkerchief was gone. I turned round directly, and saw the prisoners in custody of Johnson and Humphreys.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they produce the handkerchief to you - A. They did, at the watchhouse; that was the handkerchief that I had in my pocket that day. It was a silk handkerchief, worth five shillings.</p>

            . I am a city officer. On Sunday the 18th of April, I was in the park; the Prince was going to chapel. I saw Mr. Williams there. I was watching the prisoners; I saw them near Mr. Williams near half an hour. They noticed Humphreys; they were attempting some time; they saw Humphreys; they drew back to the wall; at last Kay backed himself towards the prosecutor, and put his hand behind, and pulled his handkerchief half out; Hibbert got close up to Kay, and finished taking the handkerchief out. They were a long time doing it. They were noticing Humphreys as much as the handkerchief. Hibbert put the handkerchief into his bosom. I laid hold of Hibbert. Mr. Williams claimed the handkerchief.</p>

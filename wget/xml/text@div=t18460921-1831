                  </hi>. I am porter at the Eastern Counties Railway. On the 21st of Aug. I was employed at the station at Witham, in Essex, and put. two bundles of sacks into a truck, to be forwarded to Bishop's-Stortford—they would come to London first, as Bishop's-Stortford is on the Cambridge line—they were nearly new sacks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter, in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. On the 20th of Aug., between six and seven o'clock, in the evening, I was on duty at the luggage—warehouse, Brick—lane station, and saw a bundle of new sacks tied up lying on the Colchester side of the platform—I was ordered to watch the property there—I saw the prisoner, who was porter there, go to the bundle, and draw out one sack, fold it up, and place it behind some old boards four or five yards off—he returned and drew another sack out, rolled it up in the same manner, and put it behind the boards which concealed them—he then went to his work—I gave information, and watched till I left work, between six and seven—I saw nothing more done to them—I left Clare there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gate-keeper at the goods station of the railway—Sparls gave me information—I went to the platform, and saw two new sacks behind some boards, rolled up—I left them there, and went to my gate, which the prisoner must pass to come out—about twenty minutes past three in morning, the prisoner came on duty—he had no business on the platform till eight in the morning—he should go to Shoreditch station at this time—he returned in a minute or two with a new sack rolled up under his arm—I am what he had there—he said, "Only a sack"—(I had seen him go to the platform where I had seen the sacks)—I asked him for it, he gave it me—I told him it was the very thing I had been watching all night, and was very sorry to we him with it—he said I might let him <hi rend="italic">go to</hi> his work, it would be no harm—he said he wanted the sack to carry fish with—I have carried fish myself—we use the old coke sacks for that—I never heard of new sacks being used for that purpose—he had no right to take sacks from bundles at the goods station—he might as well take a bundle of silk—they were there as goods in our custody as carriers, to be delivered <hi rend="italic">to</hi> a person—they are not used for any purpose—we use sacks belonging to the company—these were about half a mile from the fish place, and there were plenty of sacks there—I detained him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it not his duty to come to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, to report himself on duty before he went to work at Shoreditch—he would have to carry fish in the morning—they make a sort of hood of sacks to prevent the wet getting on their necks—an old sack answers the purpose—coke—sacks are dirty—they are about as thick again as this—new sacks are generally too stiff—when I carried fish I found the sacks where they generally lay—tie men help themselves to sacks at the fish place.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am manager at; the goods department in Brick-lane—I saw the bundle of sacks the morning after the robbery—they were tied up as sacks always are for transit, and could not be mistaken for anything but transit—the people are not allowed to take anything from that platform—there are always coke sacks at the fish-place at Shoreditch, half a mile from where these sacks are—the coke sacks are tarred, which makes them water-proof—the water would run through these sacks in carrying fish.</p>

            . I am the widow of the deceased, William Robinson - the prisoner is our son. I live in Great St. Andrew-street, Seven-dials. My husband was a <rs id="t18280221-29-viclabel149" type="occupation">shoemaker</rs>

On the 2d of January my husband had been out all day, drinking - he was very much intoxicated; he went to bed about ten o'clock; my son and grand-daughter slept in the same room as us; she is not the prisoner's daughter - he is single; I helped to undress my husband, and put him to bed- he was seventy-two years old; I was not undressed myself; the prisoner was also very drunk; Mrs. Coray had helped to undress him, and was getting him to bed; he could not undress himself; he got into bed, and as he was shifting his shirt, one of the wrist-bands stuck, and he tore it; my husband said, "That is right, tear it all to pieces;" the prisoner replied, "I would not mind tearing yours;" my husband jumped out of bed, and said to him, "Come on," and put himself in a fighting attitude; my son got out of bed, naked as he was; their beds were so near each other we can scarcely pass between them - they began fighting; I held my husband back as well as I could; my husband struck the first blow, I must say; he did not advance to strike - they did not move, but were in the small space between the beds; my son had used no bad language- my husband said, with a bitter oath, "Let me get at the shovel, and I will cut his head open;" he got the shovel, and stood with it in his hand; I was trying to get it from him; he struck me, and gave me a black eye, which was bad for three weeks, because I endeavoured to restrain his violence; my son was at the door, where we keep a washhand bason; he threw the bason towards his father, to knock the shovel out of his hand - it bounced against the marble mantel-shelf, broke, and cut his father's arm in three places; I am confident he did it to knock the shovel out of his hand, for he was very fond of his father; but his father was a desperate temper, when in liquor; it struck the mantel-piece first, and bounded; my husband's arm was naked - his shirt was off; he took it off to fight, I suppose, for he went to bed with it on; the pieces of the bason cut his lip and his left arm in three places, below the elbow; my son only threw it once; the arm bled a great deal; we sent for a doctor, who had no dressings with him, and said we had better take him to the hospital - he walked to the hospital the same night; my husband persevered with the shovel very much, after the blow - he tried to strike my son, and said he would do it, and then he sat down, and smoked his pipe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did not your son visit your husband, and pay him every attention? A. Yes, and showed sincere sorrow; he cried bitterly, and said, "I wish it was my arm instead of my father's;" as we went to the hospital my husband said, "Don't cry, Mary - my arm is not hurt much" - he lived sixteen days.</p>

            . I was in the house when the prisoner came home; he was very tipsy, and so was his father- the father was just getting into bed when the prisoner came in; I helped the prisoner to undress - I got every thing off but his shirt, and left him to change that; I then went down - I was fetched up in about two minutes- the basin had then been thrown; I saw the father take up the shovel again: he wanted to get at the prisoner, and said he would split his skull open, but his wife kept hold of his arm; the son showed no bad temper in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210043"></xptr>presence: they got him out of the room, to keep him from his father, who was a desperate temper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the son show any disposition to get in to hurt his father? A. No.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon of Middlesex-hospital. The deceased came there about one o'clock in the morning of the 3d of January - he had two or three wounds in the arm, one at the elbow-joint - it was a cut about three inches long: he had lost a good deal of blood, but it had stopped then - he could not see: he lived till the 18th, and died in consequence of those wounds; there was a suppuration and tendency to mortification; no pieces of the bason were in the arm - the suppuration arose from the injury done to the elbow-joint; I have not the slightest doubt of the wounds causing his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they such wounds as must necessarily have been made with a bason - might it not be by his raging about with the shovel? A. I should think they were done with some cutting instrument - he might hurt himself with the shovel, but I should think that not so likely.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What did the wounds appear to you like? A. I should have said they were inflicted by a knife or some cutting instrument; I should not think they were done with a fire-shovel - I think it more likely to have been produced by the broken bason than a shovel: there were three wounds - the one in front was the worst. A consultation was held as to whether amputation should be performed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, regretting the cause of the accident - stating himself to have been intoxicated, and that his father, who was also intoxicated, challenged him to fight, and threatened to split his skull, and seeing his life in danger, he endeavoured to disarm him of the shovel, he had no idea of inflicting any personal injury, but acted in self-defence, his life being in danger. The prisoner received a good character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 29.</p>

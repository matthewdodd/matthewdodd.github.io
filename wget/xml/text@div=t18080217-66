               <p>Q. On the morning of the 16th of January, in consequence of any suspicion, did you and Mr. Nevitt, your clerk, conceal yourselves in your warehouse. - A Yes, we got up about half past six in the morning, the bell rung at seven o'clock; we concealed ourselves in the warehouse before any person entered in the warehouse; after the bell rung, I heard two men stop as I conceived, they came close to me in the warehouse, there were two men stood by me for sometime, I did not see them; they said in a sow tono of voice, do not make a noise, fetch or get a light were the words added to that; I do not know which of them proceeded to the counter, at no great distance I heard the reel distinctly, and they cut some twine; from thence they went from me some considerable distance back wards; I perceived Hickey our servant going first, coming back.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any person entered but these two before mentioned. - A. No soul; and on their returning I observed Hickey first, Tobin followed him with the bags on his shoulder, they came nigh the door; I then remained sometime thinking to let them go out of the door; I heard the key put in the lock, and when the lock was sprung, I imagined then it would be time; I came from the place where I was concealed, towards the door; I saw Hickey as it were with the door in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Tobin. - A. I cannot say, I saw Tobin directly; on my running forward, Hickey, the short man. ran into the street; I followed him and ran I think better than a mile after him; he ran down Watling street, turned up Queen street, then into Pancrass lane; at last in the Old Jewry, there he was stopped by Mr. 
               <persName id="t18080217-66-person606">Bradshaw</persName>
             I was close to him; he was then taken to the Poultery Compter. I found Tobin in custody of our other servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Have you no other partners but those you have mentioned. - A. None.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You say Tobin had been in your service before. - A. Yes, about a fortnight before; I saw Tobin the day before he asked for Hickey, he had about three hats on his head, and about half a dozen pair of small clothes on his arm; he enquired for Hickey; I asked him what he wanted with Hickey; he said he wished to see him; I asked him what it was for; he said that he knew; I told him I presumed he knew where he lived, to go there; no, he said he did not; I then told him he might find it out; he then said I was a d - d impudent fellow; I said it was of little consequence he might go; I did not recollect him then. I knew him the next morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You live in this dwelling house yourself. - A. I do; the warehouse is under it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any internal communication to the warehouse. - A. There is an internal communication to the warehouse; you may come in the warehouse two ways from the house, and from the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you pay the rent yourself for the warehouse or only the house. - A. I pay the rent of the house and the warehouse as it were together, they are under one lease; the firm pay the taxes jointly, and I pay the rent; the premises are easy rented.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. You are clerk to Messrs. Berger. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you conceal yourself in the warehouse of Mr. Bergers. - A. Yes, I concealed myself in one part of the warehouse, and Mr. Berger in another; after the bell rang, I immediately took my station in the warehouse; I was not in a part to see any one; I heard two men come into the warehouse to that part where I was; I heard them talk in a low tone, I heard the voice of Hickey distinctly, which I knew; when they came to that part of the warehouse where I was, they unlocked the accompting house door, and proceeded to unlock an inner door, which they had not the key of; unless the key was given to them by the servant, it was impossible they could get the key out of the iron safe; they must have another key.</p>
               <p>Q.The proper key was locked up in the iron safe. A. Yes. After they got in at the inner door, something heavy I heard drop in a bag; I knew vermilion was deposited in that place, I thought it to be vermilion; I heard something else rustling, I could not tell what it was; it was as though they were taking something else away; after which they came out of the inner door, turned the key of that and were proceeding out of the warehouse by Well court; there are two entrances to our warehouse, they got the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. As they went by you could not you see them. - A. No, but I heard them open the door to go out; after the door was open, I heard the prisoner Hickey<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170040"></xptr>say to the other, stop, we must not go there, there is something a stirring; the door was then shut to. They then proceeded towards the door going out into Bow lane. When they got a short distance from me, as I thought they would not perceive me, I followed, and I perceived the prisoner Hickey at the door, with the door partly open. I spoke to Mr. Berger; I supposed the other was gone off. We both rushed to the door; in our haste we passed the prisoner Tobin, and left him behind the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hickey escape out of the door. - A. Yes; and Mr. Berger and myself followed him out into the lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn back. - A. Not till I got to the Crown tavern in our lane, then I turned back; I heard a noise behind me, I turned my head round, and Tobin was in the act of coming out of the warehouse. I pursued him down Bow lane, crying stop thief; he was secured by Mr. Christopher Dodson in Chapside. I took him back to our warehouse. Mr. Berger secured the other man; we took him to the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find that which had been brought out of the accounting house. - A. Behind the door, out of which Hickey ran, was the vermilion and the other articles; the vermilion is here. (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. What is that. - A. Two bags of vermilion, weighing thirty pounds each.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them. - A. From fifteen to ten pounds; the two sticks of verdigrease about forty nine shillings; eleven pound weight of bronze, seven pounds; they are the property of Messrs. Berger and sons.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag is not their property. - A. The small bag is Mr. Berger's property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. At the time you apprehended the prisoner there was nothing found on him. - A. No, he had dropped the bag, which noise I had heard.</p>

               <p>Tobin's Defence. My lord - on this morning, as I was out of employment, I went to look after employment, any where, where I could get work; I had lived with Mr. Berger three weeks; I went as far as Watling street, I met a porter, he told me I might get a porter's place in Barge yard; I talked to him a great time; I came into Bow lane, and had turned up to Bow church, when the alarm was given. I was stopped. The day before I called at the warehouse to speak to Hickey; Mr. Berger asked me what I wanted with him; I told him I wanted to speak with him; he said, you rascal, go about your business, or else I will kick your a - e. I had two hats in my hand at the time, and two or three coats. I knew that Hickey was at dinner at that time.</p>
               <p>Hickey's Defence. On the 6th of January I came to this warehouse door to work as usual; the servant came down stairs and gave me the key of the accompting house and the warehouse. After going into the warehouse I unlocked the accompting house door to light the fire there; coming back again to get some wood I thought some of the men came and knocked at the door; I went down to the warehouse door, Mr. Berger run down the warehouse as if he was mad; I ran out of the door, he ran after me; upon which I was stopped and brought back.</p>
               <p>Tobin called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Hickey called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

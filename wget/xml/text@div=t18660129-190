I am a railway carrier—I received some goods which came to London by the Midland line for 40, Milton-street—the prisoner was my carman—on receiving money for goods it was his duty to pay it to the Midland Railway on his return—if he was too late for that he ought to have paid it into my office—the instructions are that no man shall go away with the money in his pocket—he had a way bill which specified the parcels he had to carry, the people to whom they were to be carried, and the amounts received—he ought to lodge the way bill when he pays the money, but he did neither—I saw him next morning and asked him if he had any sheets or money belonging to the railway—he said, "No," and mumbled something about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in Tottenham Court Road—I made further inquiries and found he ought to have received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on a parcel—I said, "Is that all you have to speak to me about?" and he said, "Yes"—his wages were 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—he has never accounted to me for this 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or produced the way bill, but he took it to the Midland Railway a week or two afterwards and offered to pay it at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence</hi>. I lost the money. I went to the Midland station, offered them 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and asked to be allowed to pay the rest at half-a-crown a week. I did not know what to do to make the money up; I pledged a bed and sent my wife to pay the money to Mr. Hudson, but the foreman refused to receive it, saying he had no orders. A policeman came at nine o'clock and I was locked up.</p>

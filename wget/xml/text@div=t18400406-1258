I am a baker, and live in Shoe-lane—the prisoner was my servant—on the 13th of March I sent him, among other places, to Mrs. Norie, in Bear-alley, with fifteen loaves—he brought word back that they wanted ten more, and in the afternoon I sent him with ten more—he came to the counter and had them booked—here is the book in which they are entered—on the Monday morning he was to take their bill—on the Monday I gave the bill—shortly after breakfast Mrs. Norie sent to my shop and said they had not got the bill—I questioned the prisoner, and he said he supposed he had left it at another customer's—I made out another, and in the course of the day they came and said there were ten loaves too many—the first opportunity I had, I questioned the prisoner about the loaves, and he said, "I suppose I forgot to book them"—I said, "Very well, go in the evening and set it right"—he went out and did not return.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take any? - A. He was one of them; when they took the cakes, they all ran away towards London; I then ran after them for my cakes; they threw some of the cakes on the ground, and while I was stooping to pick them up, this boy took 2 s. worth of copper out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of what you are saying? - A. This boy and another took 2 s. worth of penny-pieces and half-pence out of my right-hand coat pocket; there was one before me and one behind me; I could not resist; the prisoner was behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say, whether the prisoner put his hand in your pocket? - A. No; I cannot say which it was of the two; when they took them out they again ran away towards London; it was about four o'clock on the 14th of April; a butcher's boy was near enough to see them; he went and told my master, and Mr. Bindby, the younger, pursued them; I did not know the boys before.</p>

            , jun. sworn. - The last witness came to me, and said my boy had been robbed, and the boys were just gone past our house towards London; and as soon as they had got from the new row of houses, they made off for Bethnal-green; I pursued them immediately; he described one of them as a shortish lad, and having a leather cap on: I pursued them from Lilly's description; I went about a hundred yards, and there I saw two boys in a field, walking towards Bethnal-green; there is a path in the field; before I overtook them, I run about four or five hundred yards; seeing a man on the left, I called out, stop thief; they both ran directly; I soon overtook this one; he made a stop, and walked before an elderly man, apparently to me a bricklayer's labourer; he seemed to shelter himself before this man; I took this one, and the other ran away; when I brought him back to my father's house, I took him to the constable, and there he was searched; the butcher's lad said he was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lilly.) You saw the prisoner at the bar when Bindby was taking him to the constable? - A. Yes; I know him to be one of the boys that was behind Humphries.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep barrelled oysters in your cellar? - A. No, they are always kept in the shop; they must have been taken from the cellar where the oysters are washed, and then packed and secreted; the oysters that I had in the morning were Whitstable Natives; I am sure it is my barrel; I have not opened the barrel, and the direction upon it I believe to be his own hand-writing, (opens the barrel); these are Whitstable Natives.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those the best sort of oysters? - A. Yes; they have been packed ever since the 10th of last month.</p>

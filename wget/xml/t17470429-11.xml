               <p>Rhodes. My Daughter said she should not go out till we had look'd over and over, which we did at nine o'Clock; when we missed it, we went to see for her Pocket about eleven o'Clock at Night, where we found it. I must say this, I keep a Bottle of Rum, and she had laid hold upon this; I had a very good Character of her from Newington Causey .</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 1773). On 1st April, at about quarter past 11 o'clock at night, I was on duty in Liverpool Street, and saw the prisoner and three more men loitering about in the neighbourhood of Bell Square, Blomfield Street, about twenty-five or thirty yards from me—they stopped</p>

               <p>against the door of No. 1, Liverpool Street, and two of them turned round to look after me—they then all four went in the direction of Rose and Crown Court—I went round my beat; and came to the bottom of Liver<lb></lb>pool Street again, and saw one of them, not the prisoner, standing at the same corner—he saw me, and went into Rose and Crown Court—I followed him, and then saw another man meet the prisoner—that was on the boundary of the metropolitan district, and I drew the attention of Wake<lb></lb>field, a metropolitan constable, to the prisoner—I went to follow the other one, and afterwards found the prisoner in custody of a metropolitan con<lb></lb>stable, and assisted in taking him to the station—I searched him, and found these three keys and two padlocks (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); one is a skeleton key—I call it so because I never saw one like it; there ought to be another ward—I think it would open more locks than a key of the ordinary make—one key fits both the padlocks—there was a padlock on the door of No. 1, just about the size of this; and if it was broken off, this one might be put on so as to deceive the police, and conceal what had been done—the prisoner gave me no address.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, C</hi> 133). I was on duty on 1st April, about half past 11 o'clock in Rose and Crown Buildings, Blomfield Street. Tottingham told me something—I went up the court towards Bell Alley, and he followed me—I saw the prisoner look round the corner very quickly, and withdraw himself—I ran after him, and saw him stoop and place some<lb></lb>thing in a doorway; it made a great noise against the door, and rattled like iron—I took him within a yard of the door, took him back, and found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we took him to the station, and afterwards went to a house at the corner of Liverpool Street and Blomfield Street, and found three marks on the door and one on the shutter; those on the door exactly corresponded with the end without the claw of this <hi rend="italic">jemmy.</hi>

Q.</hi> Did you try it with the marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and it fitted exactly; many <hi rend="italic">jemmys</hi> are smaller than this—I am sure the marks were fresh—the shutter was forced open an inch or two, by the same instrument apparently—Bell Alley is at right angles to Rose and Crown Court; there is a public house at the corner—I was twenty or thirty yards from the corner, when I was in Rose and Crown Court—I was eight or ten yards from the prisoner, when I ran after him—he was about two yards from me when he put down the crow bar; he took it from under his cuff—I could see him withdraw it, and saw that it was dark, like iron in his hand, before he put it down—he turned no corner, and I did not lose sight of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of No. 1, Blomfield Street, at the corner of Liverpool Street; nobody sleeps on the premises.

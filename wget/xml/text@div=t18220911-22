            . I live at Bethnal-green. On Sunday, the 11th of August, about a quarter before 10 o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18220911-22-crimeloc117">Church-street, Bethnal-green</placeName>

Greenwood coughed, and Ramsay immediately made a rush, and snatched at my seal, ring, and key, which were attached to my watch and chain; he separated them from the chain, and in trying to get them away, he struck me a blow on the side; this was before he got them; he pulled twice to get them. Ramsay ran down the court. I hollowed, Stop thief! and Greenwood came up and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n his eyes, I'll have him;" and ran down the court. The officers then came up and asked if I was robbed. We went to the

            , and went in search of them at several houses - among others, to the George in George-yard, where we found the prisoners. I will swear they are the same persons - I could see them plainly by a strong light, and am positive of them. When I went into the George, I looked round, and saw the prisoners and another man sitting on a settle in the bar. The officer told me to go into the tap-room, to see if they were there, but I still kept my eye on the prisoners in the bar. I found the bar door bolted, and told the landlord to open it. Ramsay threw down his pipe, and was going out - he was stopped by the officers. I told him to put his hat on, and said I was certain of him - he said I accused him wrongfully. Greenwood did not attempt to escape. I am quite certain of them, on my oath - they were taken about an hour or an hour and a quarter after the robbery. We found nobody at the other public-houses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PLATT. Q. Do not they call the court Brick-lane - A. I do not know; it is the court next the

            . There was a gas light on the other side of the way, which enabled me to see. The transaction did not last long, but Ramsay overshot the court in running, which gave me an opportunity of seeing him - the light reflected in their faces, and I saw Ramsay as he came towards me; and he could not get my seals at the first pull - I looked him in the face while he was taking them. I described them correctly before I saw them in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate you thought you knew Ramsay's back, but would not swear to him - A. I said I would swear to his person altogether. When I went into the bar a second time, Ramsay was putting down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110010"></xptr>his pipe and walking out - I said,</p>
               <p>"Stop that man." I said nothing else till he said,</p>
               <p>"You accuse me wrongfully." I then desired him to put on his hat.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Was the light so situated as to throw a strong light on the passage - A. It was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you looked behind you before the robbery - A. No; I observed Greenwood's red hair; the light was very strong. I looked at him as he passed me, thinking he might have come to assist me. I know it was him who coughed. One of my seals was found in the court they ran down.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and went over to Ives, and accompanied him to the George. We found the prisoners there, with another person. As soon as we got in, Ramsay went out at the bar door - there are two or three doors in the bar. Ives told me to bring him back. My brother officer stopped him at the tap-room door. He told Ives he charged him wrongfully; he had said nothing but</p>
               <p>"Stop that man" - or I must have heard it. Greenwood kept his seat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who went into the room first - A. A patrol and I, then Ives, Goddard, and Wood. I had my staff - Ramsay knew me perfectly well. We took all the three men, as we always do on finding them at such a house as this where thieves resort - Ives only gave the two prisoners in charge. Ramsay got up to go away before a word was said by any body.</p>

            . I am a constable. I accompanied Ives to the George - we went into the tap-room, and were turning round to go into the bar, when Ives and Gibbs saw the prisoners and another man seated in the bar. Ramsay got up to go out. Ives said,</p>

               <p>"You accuse me wrongfully; I know nothing about it." Ives said,</p>

               <p>"Stop that man."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. More might have been said without your hearing it - A. I am positive nothing more was said - I was close at Ives's elbow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He only said,</p>
               <p>"You accuse me wrongfully" - A. That is all, my Lord; he was going out of the door when I stopped him - he had not began to run - he said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want? you accuse me wrongfully." We dragged him in, and he said a second time to the prosecutor,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller and publisher, in Paternoster-row. The prisoner was in my service two years—if he sells books it is his duty to enter the transaction in a book, and put the money into the till—this is the book he kept—on 23rd Aug. there was only himself and myself to the shop—my other assistant had a holiday on that day—my custom is to take the money out of the till, and to compare it with the book at the end of the day, to see that the amounts correspond—on 23rd Aug. here is an entry of one copy of "Hentrey's Botany," 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—here is no entry of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180072"></xptr>
               <p>two copies, nor no other entry of that book on that day—if the prisoner had received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for two copies it was his duty to enter them—on 7th Sept. I find three lines of entries of the "Micrographic Dictionary"—here is one copy, two copies, and two copies; here is no entry of three copies—supposing the prisoner has only entered two, when he should have entered three, it is a loss of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to me—I afterwards spoke to the prisoner about that other copy—the second entry in this, "One copy, two copies, and two copies," is mine—the others are his—on 7th Sept. here is no entry of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for four Micrographic Dictionaries, and one of "Hanstead's Scenery"—here is one copy of "Hanstead's Scenery," entered separately, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—four copies of the "Micrographic Dictionary," and one of "Hanstead's Scenery," are not entered—I had requested my brother—in—law, Mr. Nesham, and Messrs. Hamilton and Adams to make purchases at my shop—when I bad dis<lb></lb>covered these deficiencies I spoke to the prisoner on the following day, 8th Sept.—I sent for a policeman, and I said to the prisoner, "Mr. Mollyneux wants you"—he hung down his head, and said nothing—he came from behind the counter, and went out with the policeman—they stayed a short time in conversation, and came in again—I then told the prisoner he had been robbing me—I said I would show him what it was, and I showed him the book—I told him that he had on the previous day sold three parts of the "Micrographic Dictionary," and there was no such entry—I said, "I find an entry of one and two, and two, but no three"—I said, "I can't charge you with robbing me of more than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., because I find an entry of two, but you must have robbed me of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is all"—I said, "Nonsense, I know better; you sold on that day three copies of 'Han<lb></lb>stead's Scenery,' which I can prove, and there are but two entered; how do you explain that?" to which he made no reply—I think I mentioned to him the different transactions, but I should not like to say—the prisoner then said he should wish to speak to me—the officer said, "Anything you have to say to Mr. Van Voorst must he said in my presence"—we went up stairs, and the prisoner said he hoped I would forgive him, on account of his poor mother—I said, "That was for you to have thought of, not me."</p>

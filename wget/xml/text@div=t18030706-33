I had been to Mr. Henley's for three pair of stockings, and saw her with two men behaving rather rudely in the street. I stood on one side because I would not interrupt them, and she would not let me pass one way or the other, they took up the whole pavement, and I stood in a nook for them to pass; the prisoner caught hold of me by the shoulder, and by the cheek and hair; she fetched blood of me in several places; I had no bonnet on; then the men that were with her snatched at my parcel, containing three pair of stockings.</p>

               <p>Q.What did she say to you? - A. We never spoke to each other; she got my head down between her knees, and then it was that the men snatched the parcel from me.</p>

               <p>Q.Did the men say any thing? - A. No; I called out for help, and Mr. Paulin came to my assistance; the prisoner was taken into custody, and the men made their escape; I picked up one pair of stockings under the prisoner's feet, after the constable had taken her, Mr. Paulin picked up another pair of stockings.</p>

               <p>Q.How came you to be carrying stockings at that time of night? - A.My mistress sent me to Mr. Henley's for a pair of stockings, and he sent three pair for her to take her choice; they were for my master.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - A. I never saw her but once before.</p>

               <p>- PAULIN sworn. - On Saturday evening I was standing at my own door, No. 78, Whitecross-street; I saw the prisoner pass by with two men, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, and in a moment I saw an interruption in the street; I heard the girl cry out, and I went to extricate her from her situation; she is a servant within a dozen doors of me; the prisoner had hold of her hair, she was pinned down by the prisoner's two hands; she cried out, for God's sake, Mr. Paulin, take the bundle, and I picked up one pair of stockings; I saw one of the men strike at her; the other man ran away upon my coming up; I laid hold of the prisoner, and had a very hard matter to get her hands from the other's hair; I did not see the bundle in the girl's possession; in the scuffle the girl picked up another pair of stockings; the third pair was looked after, but could not be found; the stockings that I picked up I gave to the fellow-servant of this girl,

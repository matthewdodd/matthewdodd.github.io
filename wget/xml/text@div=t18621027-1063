                  </hi>. I am a music-seller of 36, Bishopsgate-street—on the evening of 13th September, about a quarter-past 6, I was in Bishopsgate-street, standing by the corner of Great St. Helen's; the prisoner rushed past me—I heard something snap; I put my hand in my pocket for my watch and it was gone—I pursued the prisoner down Bishopsgate-street—finding that I was overtaking him, he doubled, and ran down Great St. Helen's, went round the court, and in coming back I caught him—when he ran round the court he ran up against some man—I held him till the officer came up—I had never lost sight of him—I have never seen my watch since; it was worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—he denied taking the watch and that he was the person that had run.</p>

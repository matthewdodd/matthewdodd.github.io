                  </hi>. I am in the service of Alfred George Kennedy, of Lime Grove, Lewisham. On 5th Oct., between 10 and 11 o'clock, I was at work in the garden—from information I received, I went round to the front of the house—the front door was open—it was not open when I left it—I missed this scarf shawl from the passage (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw some footmarks on a stone against the front door—they were not very large; like the toes—I had last seen the scarf hanging up in the hall about half an hour before—I saw two lads walking, dressed in black coats and caps—I only saw their backs—I went after them, and they ran away directly they saw me—they were a long way before me, and I lost sight of them—the prisoners are about the height of the boys I saw—I found a police officer, and told him—we went to Lewisham Bridge; near Hanover Street we met two boys—they were dressed like those I had seen in the field—they both turned round, and ran away—the officer ran after them, and we took them—I am sure the prisoners are the same persons—James said he would not go—he got hold of the policeman's leg, and threw him down—the policeman had hold of the other one—James got his coat torn down the back—they both got away—I did not see them again until they were in custody—the next morning I went into the field, and found this scarf shawl about 150 yards to the left, away from the direction in which the boys ran—it was under a hedge in a ditch—it was not in a place where people often walk—I believe there was no footpath there—it would take two or three minutes to go from the street door to where I found the scarf—when I looked out in that direction I saw two persons; I was not able to see them until they got some distance up the field, so as to be in a straight line—I could not see the shawl from the house, because of the ditch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Phillips, who lives next door to Mr. Kennedy's. On 5th Oct., between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning, I was up stairs, in the front of the house—I saw the two prisoners—they came through the Grove, from the direction of Mr. Kennedy's house—I saw them about 10 o'clock, first, coming up the Grove; they passed our door—I saw them about five or ten minutes afterwards; they then went into the fields—I saw one lying down, and the other leaning against a post—after a short time they went away towards Lewisham; James walked first, and the other walked behind him—in consequence of what I saw, I spoke to Hammond—he went into the fields where the prisoners were seen going—I know where the scarf was found—Hammond pointed it out—I saw the prisoners near there—one of them was stooping while there.</p>

I was on duty at Lewisham—Hammond came to me—I accompanied him to Lewisham Bridge—we there met the prisoners—they turned round, and ran down Hanover Street—I overtook them—when I caught them, James asked what I wanted with him—I had them both, one in each hand—I told them they were charged with stealing a shawl at Lewisham—James said he had not been there—Sheffard stooped down, caught hold of my legs, and threw me down—James pushed my shoulders—I let Sheffard go—he went off, hat returned just as I was in the act of getting up, and seized James—his coat was torn, and he slipped away—when I charged them, they both said they had not been at Lewisham that morning—I afterwards went to the field, and Hammond pointed out where the scarf was found—there is no thoroughfare through the fields.</p>

On 13th Oct I was on duty at Greenwich police station—the prisoner James came to the door of the station, and said very abruptly, "What is it you want me for?"—I asked him to be kind enough to step in, and I would show him—he came in, and I produced the printed information—I asked him if he could read—he could not, and I read it to him—I told him I should take him into custody, as he was charged with stealing, in the company of George Sheflard, a scarf shawl—he said that he knew nothing about it, he had not been there at all—I asked him why he ran away from the constable when he was taken into custody—he said that he did not go away from him, but he let him go—I asked him where he had been in the interval—he said at Croydon Pair—I then locked him up—about 3 o'clock on the same day I went to Lewisham, to apprise the parties that James was in custody—when I came back, Sheffard was waiting at the station—he asked me what I wanted him for—I produced to him the printed information, and he read it—he said that he knew nothing at all about it: he was not at Lewisham—I asked him why he ran away from the constable, and he also said he did not run away, but that he let him go—he said he had been at work at different places—I then locked him up.</p>

I live with my mother, at 45, Prusom Street am turned 11 years of age; the prisoner lived there with my mother—there were some other children—my mother was passing by the name of Harriet Jeffrey—on Sunday morning 10th August, about 9 o'clock, I was in the bedroom and heard them rowing in the kitchen—I heard my mother scream out—I went in and she showed me her arm, it was bleeding—the prisoner was there and he put the teapot on the ground and smashed it, he then kicked it and it caught my foot—I asked mother what was the matter, and she said that he had hit her on the arm with the teapot—I then went and put on my clothes—I saw my mother during the day and she complained of her arm—on that same night I saw the prisoner hit her at the side of the head with his fist—next day she complained of pain in is her side and also on Tuesday and Wednesday; she was in bed all day on Wedneadij and appeared to be ill, the prisoner was always hitting her before that San<lb></lb>day—I have not seen him do anything except hit her.</p>

I am the wife of James Ashmore, and lived at 6, Prusom Street—I knew the deceased about 12 years—she was former!; married to a man named Donnelly; the last witness was one of their children; she afterwards married Jeffrey, and after his death the prisoner went to lodge with her and they lived together as man and wife for about three years—she has one child by him—J have seen him ill-use her; about three months ago I saw him kick her off the street door step—on Sunday night, 10th August, she came to my house with her child in her arms and complained of his ill-usage; she complained of her bowels and the pit of her stomach—the prisoner passed on the opposite side of the road while she was talking to me—he did not hear what she said to me.</p>

I am the wife of William Smith—I used to live at 45, Prusom Street—I knew the prisoner and deceased for about two yean—about two months before she died I saw him kick her in the stomach; he was wearing his boots at the time—she did not say anything at the time, she was in too much pain—the last time I saw him ill-use her was the Sunday before she died—he held her with his teeth by the side of the face across the bed, with an open knife over her and said he would do for her—she complained of pain in her stomach continually every day, up to Sunday, 10th August; on that morning I saw them struggling together in the kitchen—he had a large iron poker in his hand, and she had the teapot; he was trying to smash it—I passed through the kitchen and was going upstairs, I heard a struggle and she screamed out, "Now you have settled me"—I went back to the room and said, "What has he been doing now?"—she said he had both struck her and kicked her—he said nothing, but walked up into the yard—I saw blood flowing from her arm—she appeared to be in great pain in the stomach—that same afternoon I sat talking to her at the door of the house; she was sitting on the step—the prisoner came by with two other men; one of them asked her what was the newt in the papers; she said, "The news is that there is plenty of murders going about," and she pointed to the prisoner and said, "There is a slow cruel murderer!"—she said he could not stand up before a man, but he could hit and knock a woman about; that he had not only murdered, but</p>

                  </hi>, M.D., M.R.C.S. I live at 223, High Street, Shadwell—on Wednesday evening, 13th August, I was fetched to the deceased—she complained of great pain in the bowels, and said she had been sick all day—I prescribed for her—about 2 o'clock on Thursday morning, the 14th, I was again called—I sent my son, and she died in his presence—I made a post-mortem examination—I found a punctured wound about the left wrist, a bruise on the left hip, and a severe contusion, with effusion on the left side of the head—the externally surface of the body was unusually pallid—I found all the organs healthy and natural—the cavity of the abdomen was distended with fluid and coagulated blood—I found a rent of the spleen about an inch and a half long—the spleen was somewhat diseased—the rent must have been caused recently, before death, and must have been caused by considerable violence, and certainly not more than two or three days before death—the cause of death was hæmorrhage proceeding from the rent in the spleen—a kick would be a likely cause of the rent or a blow—there was a tumour attached to and proceeding from the spleen which was probably the growth of several months—that was not the cause of death; it was intact.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. The probability is that the hæmorrhage would ensue at once on the rent, but not necessarily; passive hæmorrhage might be going on for some time—the fact of a violent blow would produce syncope, and coagulum sometimes forms, which plugs the opening, and it is not until reaction comes on that the plug is removed and hæmorrhage returns—I should say that the rent was the result of one blow or kick—the disease would render it more liable to be rent.</p>

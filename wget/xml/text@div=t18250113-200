On the 23d of December, between 4 and 5 o'clock, the prisoner Moriarty came to my house for a pint of porter, which I served him with; he took that away, and came again for another pint of beer, which I served him in a quart pot. I asked him for the other pint pot, which he did not bring back. I said</p>
               <p>"Where is that pot, you have taken it away." He said he had not. He then came a third time, for half a pint of beer, and I said</p>
               <p>"You have taken that quart away." He said he had not. I served him with half a pint in another quart pot, he took that into the tap-room - I do not know where he had taken the others. He drank that porter. A person said to me</p>
               <p>"That man has taken the pot away." I have known him for these two years - he has frequented the house occasionally. I went to his house, in Fox-court, immediately, but the house was in darkness, and I did not go in. I came back for a candle to go to his house, but I thought I would go to Henry Worms's shop, which is a marine store shop, about sixty yards from my house, in Fox-court. I went towards the shop, and saw Moriarty standing there, shaking hands with Henry Worms, and heard Worms say to him,</p>
               <p>"I will make it all right." They could not see me. I then went into the shop, and told Moriarty they had got my pot. They said they had not got it. I told Worms I would search the place - and he said I should not do it. Morris Worms was then behind his father, and he took up the pot and ran to another shop, where they melt the mettle. I attempted to run after him, and the father stopped me, and said I should not go. I pushed him aside, and followed the boy, and saw him throw the pot under the grate - I took it up, it had my name and sign on it. I took Henry Worms out of the shop, and gave charge of him and Morris. I then went to search for Moriarty, who had left the shop, and found him sitting in my tap-room. I went for a constable, and gave him in charge. I have not found the other quart pot, or the pint. I then took Mr. Mayo to the house where Worms was in charge, and we went down to his shop - we found a very large fire, three melting pans, and some pewter, which had been very lately melted, in the pans.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How many pots were missing? A. Three, in less than two hours. I did not see any of them taken - I did not look in at Worms's window. I looked down a passage leading to his house. I could not see what was passing in the shop, but I saw Moriarty inside - the door was open - there was a light in the shop; I could not see who Moriarty was with, but when I went in I saw old Worms, he had his hat on, but he had not just come in, or I should have seen him - he told me he had just come in, and knew nothing about the matter. It is a private house, the shop lies back - there is a board up, with</p>
               <p>"Dealer in Marine Stores" on it; there is a back-room, which I call the other shop, where they do their business. Worms did not buy his beer of me, nor did any person in his house. The pot was found in the first room. Henry Worms stood before me, and Morris behind him - I saw Morris take it into the back-room, and put it under the grate - I heard him take it up from the counter. I took Morris because he had the pot in his hand, and the father, because I saw him shake hands with Moriarty. The pot was very good, I gave 1 s. 6 d. for it: when I exchange my old pots for new, I am allowed a half in exchange - in the state it was then in it was worth more than 1 s.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Andrew, Holborn. On the 23d of December, soon after six o'clock, Mr. Winder sent for me. I went into Fox-court, and saw a number of persons at Worms's door. Mr. Winder was there, and gave charge of Worms and his son, for receiving a pot, which he delivered into my hands. He said he had lost three within two hours, and if I went into Worms's premises he was convinced I should find the others. I went into the shop, down the open passage, and at the further end of the shop there was a strong fire, and three melting pans by the side of the fire; one, if not two of them, had pewter in them; which appeared to me to be recently melted, and felt very warm. I took the prisoners into an adjoining house till they were taken before a Magistrate. It is a marine store shop - no one can avoid seeing the name of Winder upon the pot, and the sign of the house. Here is the pot in the state in which I received it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the person who Mr. Winder desired to break some metal which you found there, and which was not pewter:? A. Unquestionably - it is what is called type metal, but I have no hesitation in swearing that the metal in the pans was pewter - it is my firm belief. I heard old Worms say that he knew nothing of the matter - he had but just come in, and if any one was to blame it was not him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WORMS, SEN. Q. Did not a woman in the house tell you I had but just come in? A. I have no recollection of that. I heard you tell the boy to say nothing but the truth, and that repeatedly.</p>

               <p>"Go away, I want to go out, and if there is any thing wrong come in the morning, and I will set it right" - he said he would not go; I said,</p>

I went to Baldwin's-gardens, and was detained there about five minutes - when I got home to my house, in Cloth-fair, my sister told me what had happened - there was some type-metal in my father's house, but it was not pewter - there was no melted pewter, and when I was there, there was a fire; it is the room in which my father eats, drinks and sleeps. I had called to borrow some money - there were two melting pans, and one ladle there - I did not examine the metal, but I sat so close, I could see that it was not pewter - I believe there was an ingot there - Winder was not there. I had a watch in my pocket, and I looked at it a few minutes afterwards, because I was under the necessity of parting with it, in Baldwin's-gardens; it was then about six o'clock - it is a good watch, and keeps time very correctly - I did not see the constable at my father's house, I cannot swear that there was no pewter there when he was there.</p>

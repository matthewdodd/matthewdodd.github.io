               <p>On Thursday night the 27th of May last, I was robbed by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>At what time of the night? - I cannot tell; in the course of the night.</p>
               <p>Did you sleep alone? - I went to bed alone.</p>
               <p>Did any body sleep in the room with you? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Had you the watch when you went to bed? - Yes, I put it under my bolster when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>At what time did you find it gone in the morning? - It might be between six and seven.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to suppose the prisoner took it? - When I waked in the morning I saw the prisoner in the room. She went out directly afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did she sleep in the house? - I learned afterwards that that was her apartment.</p>
               <p>Had you known her before? - No; I staid in the room till she returned, then I charged her with robbing me; missed my silver shoe and knee buckles, my money out of my pocket, and my watch. She seemed not pleased when she came back, at finding me in the room; I charged her with robbing me. At first she denied it, but afterwards she produced me my shoe and knee buckles, and said she hoped I would be contented; I charged her with my watch and money; she would not own to the taking of them; I went home and put some money into my pocket, and came back again to her apartment. There were some of her neighbours in her room when I came back. She sent them out of the room and shut the door and fastened it. She came to me then with seeming compunction for using me so ill, and told me she had taken my watch and pawned it for a guinea; and that if I would let her have as much money as she had spent of that sum, she would go directly and fetch me the watch. I gave her a crown towards the redemption of it; I did not mean to proceed any farther, if I got my watch. She went out, and would not let me go with her. Instead of redeeming the watch, I found her a little after spending that crown at a publick-house. I made a demand again of my watch; she made game of me, and asked me for more money. I went to one Master's, a pawn-broker, between the Bull and Gate and Little Turnstile, Holborn. I described my watch, and it was produced. His shopman,

               <p>That gentleman met this girl and I as we were going up Holborn; he asked if we could direct him to a lodging, he had no money but twopence halfpenny; he sent out his silver buckles to get something to eat and drink. In the morning he wanted his buckles; he said he could not go home without them; I pawned his watch, and redeemed his buckles, and gave them to him, and I gave him his change. After that he came in and wanted his watch; he flung the duplicate at me, because he said he had no money to fetch it; he came again, and I gave him his duplicate.</p>
               <p>Court to the prosecutor. Did you give her the buckles to raise money upon? - No, neither buckles nor watch.</p>

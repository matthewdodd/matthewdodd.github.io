The Prisoner in her defence pleaded, that the Prosecutor came in and called for a dram of Brandy, as he had said, and offered her Master a Guinea to Change; that her Master not having Silver enough, thought much of the trouble to get it changed for a Penny; upon which the Prosecutor pulled out a Penny, but told her Master neverthess if he would change the Guinea, he would spend a Shilling of it , whereupon he stept out and got it changed, and the Prosecutor in the mean time asked for a room; she told him, he might be at the end of the shop; he answered, that was not private enough, for his Master was but a few doors off, at one Mr. Beger's , buying a Horse, and his Fellow-Servant in the Field, and he would not have them see him there; whereupon he went up stairs, called for a quartern of Brandy, which she carried; that he pulled her upon his knee, but she got away , and went about her business, being then in walking the house; and that immediately he knocked again , and she going up, he called for another quarters, having as she thought, thrown down the sick (for the room was wet;) that he fell to her upon his knee again , but she would not fit; them he asked if they sold no better liquor, and if they sold no Solder, and called for a pine , which she carried and that she was force got down when he knocked again, and called for another pint , which she going to carry up , found him not in the room where she left him; and calling to her Master to know if he were not gone away without paying the Reckoning, the Prosecutor, from another pair of stairs, cry'd out, l am bere ; she goes up, ask'd him what he did in that room; he, calling her his Dear, said, he liked to fit there better, being it was more airy ; that she being in the room, he shut the door, attempted to throw her upon the Bed, and would have forced her to have let him lain with her; upon which she struggled with him, he got her down on the Ground, and pulling out a Penknife, swore he would stick her if she did not consent; that she crying out, her Master came up and rescued her.

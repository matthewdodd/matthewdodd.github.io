On the 6th of October, at night, he came in; I went round to cut the cheese - my back was then turned to the pork: when I had cut the cheese, I missed the pork from the pickling-pan - I opened the lid of his basket, and took it out, saying, "You are a pretty fellow, for I lost some pork last Saturday night;" he said nothing to it, but offered 1s. to pay for the goods, saying that was all he had.</p>

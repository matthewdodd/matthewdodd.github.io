                  </hi>. I am a clerk, living at 6, Gainsborough Road, Mile End—on 9th May, about 1.45, I was awoke by the police—I got up and went into the parlour with the policeman—the front parlour door had not been open for about three months, as we had a couch across it—it was open when I went in, and the couch was across the room—the house was fastened up and the property safe about 9 o'clock the night before—the parlour shutters and the window were open—I missed three table covers, a cruet stand, and a great coat—they were safe the night before—I found on the floor two pairs of sugar tongs, one of which was broken, it was whole the night before—these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—the value of the property I missed was about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Q.</hi> I suppose a great deal of violence roust have been used from the appearance of the premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think so—I went to bed about 11.10, every thing was safe then—I have not been shown the place where the prisoner was taken into custody, but I know it is at the end of the street—I have made no inquiry as to where he lived—Victoria Park is about half a mile from my house—a person going from Bethnal Green to Victoria Park would not go near my house—it would be quite out of the way.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 461). About 2 o'clock on the morning of 9th May, I was in the Gainsboro' Road—I saw the ground floor window of the prosecutor's house wide open—I went and woke him up, and he let me in—I found a cruet stand outside the window—the catch of the window had been forced back by some instrument—I should say a knife—the bar of the shutter was slightly bent—I saw the prisoner in company with a female, about 3.40, in the Grove Road—he walked a short distance and I watched him about—I saw him go to the prosecutor's house, and I placed myself in a doorway</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186806080018"></xptr>
               <p>and watched him—I saw him come to the area gate at the top of the street, near the prosecutor's house—he got down the area, took up this bundle, and put it under his coat—when he came up to me I stopped him—I took these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from under his coat—he said he picked them up only a short distance back—I asked him what he was doing down the area—he said, "I saw the things down there, and I went and picked them up"—I then took him into custody—when he was charged, he said it was a false charge—he asked me not to take him to the station or I should ruin him—I found on him 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a bradawl used in his trade I believe, and other things of no consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far from the prosecutor's house was it that you saw the prisoner at 3.40? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About forty or fifty yards—I had not seen the things lying in the area before I saw the prisoner take them—he was on the pavement when I first saw the bundle in his possession—I did not see him pick it up—the cruet stand was outside the window, not in the bundle—he gave a correct name and address—he has been in the service of a gentleman, named Mr. Bunting, for many years—he was living with his wife and family in Cutworth Street.</p>

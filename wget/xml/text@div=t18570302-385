                  </hi>. I was an inspector of police, but have now resigned. On 12th Jan., between 9 and 10 o'clock at night, I went to a cottage in Montague-place, Montague-street, Spitalfields—it consists of one room on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020025"></xptr>
               <p>ground floor—I found the door fast—it opens immediately into the one room—no one opened it, and I began to break it in—I made a hole in the middle of the door, that enabled me to look into the room—I saw the prisoner throwing things about the room indiscriminately—some of the officers who went with me, broke in the window, and while that was doing the door gave way, and I went in, and found the prisoner and two children—I found on the table which stood near the fire, twelve counterfeit shillings, one good florin, and one good shilling, a galvanic battery jar with solution in it, a cup with solution, and two shillings in the cup—I found a file with white metal in its teeth, an iron spoon used as a ladle, and a purse with four shillings and a farthing in good money—I also found some bottles—there is no internal communication between that house and the adjoining one—the adjoining house is unoccupied—the door of it was open; it is in a very dilapidated state—I went in it, and in a recess between the plaster and the brickwork, I found these two moulds, one for making florins, the other for making shillings—they were in the down stairs room on the ground floor—there were no persons in that house—I, took the moulds into the room where the prisoner was, and stated in her hearing that I had found them—she said she had a presentiment half an hour previous that I was coming, and she put the things away, and threw the galvanic battery down the privy—I said, "That is not correct, for I am sure it is here"—soon afterwards I saw another officer find the galvanic battery plates, wet, in a corner of the room—the prisoner made several observations, and said she did it to keep her children from starving—I accompanied her to the station, and on the way she said, "I am the wife of the man you took here on Thursday; what do you think he will get I do you think he will get off with four years?"—I said, "We are not allowed to answer any such question, or to give any opinion at all on such matters"—she said, "Well, I did it to keep my children from starving"—the children are, I think, one about seven years old, and the other about five—I took them in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the workhouse, and they are in the workhouse now—the man who passed as the prisoner's husband had been taken in the same place on the Thursday before, and he was at that time in confinement—I took away all I found in the house at that time, and made a diligent search, too, so that all that I found on Monday must have been brought in after his apprehension—I omitted to state that the florin and shilling which I found on the table were the pattern pieces from which the counterfeits had been taken.</p>

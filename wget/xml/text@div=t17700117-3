            . I am servant to Miss Ware. I was with her when she was robbed. We were stopped by four young men; it was on a Friday evening, about nine o'clock, not an hundred yards from our own home, as we were coming from town. When they came up to us, they asked for a little of our money; mistress said she had no pockets on; they searched her, and found she had not. It was the short man that took her cloak. Then they came to me, and asked for my money; I gave them a shilling and some halfpence. As they came up to us, one of them said, Shoot her! and when they went away, one of them said they would blow her brains out, because she said, Pray don't take my cloak. I took notice of their faces. I know Corby and Busby; Busby is the short one. I gave my money into one of the tall one's hands, but whether it was Corby, or one of the others, I cannot tell. It was Busby that took my mistress's cloak. I saw them the Tuesday se'nnight after at Sir

            . I keep the crown ale-house, in Brumpton-road. On Friday the 8th of December, there were four young men came into my house, and staid and drank till about nine o'clock, then they went away; and the next morning I heard of this robbery. I am sure Corby and Busby were two of them, and I believe Butler, the evidence, was one with them; I thought so when I saw them again at Sir John's.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170005"></xptr> My house is about 140 or 150 yards from the place where the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Busby. I was in that house with two other men; but I cannot say who they were.</p>
               <p>W. Butler. I am near 18 years of age. I am a plaisterer. The three prisoners were with me in Bow-street; but only Corby and Busby were with me in the Brumpton-road. We saw the lady; we went to her, and asked for her money; she said she had none: then Corby took her cloak from her. Corby had a broken pistol that would not fire; Busby had one that would. I had no pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else was with you?</p>
               <p>Butler. I do not remember any body else being with us. I was very much in liquor; so were they. She said she had no pockets on. I went to feel for her pockets, and found she had none. The other young woman was with the lady; we heard them squeak when we ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said, Blow her brains out?</p>
               <p>Butler. I did not hear it. I was very drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you acquainted with them?</p>
               <p>Butler. I met with them at the hole-in-the-wall, in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure there were but two with you?</p>

I turned round, and said, Go about your business. Upon that, he took the cloak off my shoulders, and passed it to a second man. The evidence, Butler, looks like the man that took it. The person that received it, came and gave me a violent blow under my left ear. They went off with it. It cost 12 s. but a little before. I do not know any of the prisoners.</p>

               <p>W. Butler. Cole, Bromley, and I, had been drinking together, and were going to Westminster, where I lodge. Going down Princes-street, we saw this gentlewoman; I ran after her, and laid hold round her neck; said she, What do you want? I said, I want to kiss you. She said, Go along. I took her cloak off and put it behind me. She went to catch at me, and I hit her once or twice. I seeing some people on the other side the way, I ran down Leicester-fields. The two prisoners were not with me then; they were in Princes-street. I carried the cloak to Westminster. After I got there, they came to me, and said, What did you do to the woman? I said, What is that to you? I hid the cloak in the house, and afterwards gave it to Peg Warden to pawn it for me. The two prisoners had none of the money; I had it all myself.</p>

               <p>eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was on duty in Aldersgate-street—I went to the Castle and Falcon tap-room—there was some alter<lb></lb>cation there—there were thirteen or fourteen individuals in the room, and a woman among them—John Childs, the deceased, was there, and the pri<lb></lb>soner, who is the landlord of the house—they were wishing him to stand half a gallon of beer—he said he would not, and he would not draw any more beer—he then took some pots off the table, went to the bar, closed the door, and put the light out in the bar—he then came into the tap-room, laid hold of the table which I was leaning against, and threw the pots off on to the floor—he was the worse for liquor—he was gathering the pots off the ground, and had some of them in his hand when I came out of the tap-room—as I came out I saw the deceased with his arm up towards the gaslight, and as I passed out at the door I saw the light go out—I have no doubt he turned the gas off—as I passed out of the passage the deceased passed me, running and laughing, and the prisoner followed him with a quart pot in his right hand, and three pint pots in his left hand—they passed me up the yard, and I saw the prisoner strike the deceased first with the quart pot on the back—he then made a hit at him with his left hand with the three pots, which missed him—the deceased turned round to look behind him, and the prisoner with his right hand struck him on the left ear with the quart pot that he held in that hand—the deceased then cried out "Don't murder me," and was in the act of stooping to pick up his hat, which had fallen off, when the prisoner made another blow at him with the right hand, and seeing a scuffle between them I ran up—he picked up his hat—the prisoner was aiming another blow at him with his right hand when I jumped in between them and re<lb></lb>ceived the blow on my right shoulder—he made another blow with his left hand which I caught on my breast—I got hold of him by the arm, and he struggled several times more to get at him, which I prevented—I had not heard the deceased say any thing to Philpot before these blows, not after he came out of the house—what was said inside I did not notice—I turned round to look at the deceased, to see how he was hurt—the prisoner then caught up the deceased's bundle, and made towards the house—the deceased called out, "Don't rob me as well as murder me"—I followed him into the house with the deceased, and told him the deceased gave him into custody, and as such he must think himself—he then had a conversation with the de<lb></lb>ceased—he seemed very repentant to him for what had occurred, and wished him not to press any charge against him, as he had nobody to take care of his house, except he called his wife up—the deceased said he would not, and they had some brandy together—the deceased was bleeding at the ear—I took him over to the hospital to have his ear dressed, and left him in the street afterwards—he said he was going home—they did not keep him in the hospital—they sewed the ear up with one stitch—I interfered as soon as I could—they were some distance from me at first.</p>

               <p>—they chatted together, and shook hands then—the prisoner appeared very anxious to know how he was—they went back to the public-house together, and drank half-and-half together—I did not hear the prisoner ask him to stay to breakfast, nor hear the deceased say, "I own myself in fault"—they staid together about twenty or twenty-five minutes while I was there—I believe the man lived twelve days after this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman, and live in Little Britain. I was on duty at the Castle and Falcon, between eleven and twelve o'clock on this night—I went into the tap-room, and they were all drinking toge<lb></lb>ther in good humour, when I came out—I went in again to call the policeman out, and said the sergeant was going by—the prisoner was then talking along with them—the deceased was laughing and joking with them also—I turned, and came out, and Childs, the deceased, came out laughing directly after-wards—the prisoner followed him with two or three pots in his hand—the de<lb></lb>ceased came running down the yard, and the prisoner after him twenty-five or thirty yards—he then overtook him, and struck him in the left side of the ear with a quart pot—he then up with his hand to strike him again, and the policeman rushed in between them, but did not reach him to hit him—the policeman asked him something, and he up with both hands to strike the de<lb></lb>ceased again, but he hit the policeman instead of him, with one hand on the breast, and the other on the top of the shoulder—they stood there talking a little while, and then went in to have something to drink, all of them, but what passed then, I do not know—I saw the deceased at the same public-house next evening, with his head tied up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The deceased was brought to St. Bartholomew's hospital on Wednesday, the 6th of March—he had a wound on the left ear, which divided the ear, and a slight bruise behind the ear—they might have been done by a pot—he was not drunk, he had been drinking—I dressed the ear, and did what I thought necessary—I pro<lb></lb>posed his stopping in the hospital, but he wished to go home—he seemed a respectable young man—I desired him to come again, but did not see him again alive—I assisted Mr. Lewis in making a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—he died from erysipelas on the head—that might have been occasioned by the blow on the head—he had no signs of erysipelas about him when he came to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

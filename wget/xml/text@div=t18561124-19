I keep a shop in Fore-street On Wednesday last the prisoner came there, and bought something of my foreman—I took up the florin that was put down—I asked the prisoner if she had given that to my young man—she said, "Yes"—I asked if she had got any more coin about her, because that was a bad one—she said, "No," she had not—I asked her where she lived—she said in Fleet-street—I proposed sending the goods for her—she said, "Never mind, I will send for them this evening; you can keep the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and the halfpenny, and the hose till then"—she then left—I followed her till I saw a policeman—she went into Moor-lane, and from there into White-street—she turned, and saw us pursuing her, and turned short round the corner, and went into the Five Bells public house—we went in after her, and I gave her in charge—I walked a few doors from the public house with the policeman, and then as I returned back to go into Fore-street, I called in at the public house, and received from the landlady four bad florins in a piece of blue paper, and a piece of printed cotton of the same pattern as the prisoner's gown—I gave them to the policeman.</p>

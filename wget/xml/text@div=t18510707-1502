                  </hi>. I belong to the Fire Brigade. On Saturday night, 31st May, I was sent for at 6 minutes past 11 o'clock—I accompanied Fogo to 52, Lime-street—I found the house full of smoke—I have looked at this model—I went in at the private door in Lime-street, which opens into a passage close to the coffee-shop—there is a door on the right at the end of the passage leading into the kitchen of the coffee-shop—when I got into the room behind the coffee-shop, I found there was fire burning through the trap<lb></lb>door—the flame was coming through, and the room was full of smoke—I procured some water, and put the flame out; and then, with the assistance of the other firemen, we got the trap-door open—it was shut down close—I have got the flap itself here; on the trap-door being open, there is a flight of steps leading down to the cellar—it is correctly represented on the model—there are rafters, similar to these, level with the trap-door—I opened the flap, put it back, and after two or three trials I got down to the bottom of the steps—it is a sort of step-ladder, fixed; as soon as we got the fire out, we made a search—there was a smell of camphine, or turpentine—I smelt that before I opened the trap-door—Mr. Fogo, our foreman, went down with me, and directly under the steps we found this wooden block and this iron-piping (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I found it in this state, under the steps, on the ground—there had been some earth thrown up from the bottom, which would raise the</p>

               <p>ground about two feet—the top of this iron-pipe was close to the wooden steps of the ladder—I also found this top, belonging to the pipe, lying very close to it, as if it had fallen off (the place from wall to wall is not above four feet)—it exactly fits the other part—I also found these two iron trays; one of them had cotton in it burnt to a complete tinder—that tray was on the left-hand going down the steps, underneath the steps, between the flooring and the joisting, and directly over the iron piping—it was blocked up with this piece of stone to keep it in its place—the other tray contains cotton, not so much burnt—that was under the wall, and also close to the joists—there is a cavity in the party-wall—the height from the earth to the floor is about four or five feet—there is camphine in this tray, and the other tray also smelt of it, but that was exhausted; the tray in which the camphine existed was further from the piping than the other—it was placed rather too far away, and right underneath, so that the fire could not very well have come to it unless it had burnt a great deal more; Mr. and Mrs. Strong live on the second-floor, over Mr. Taylor's room—their apartments are not shown upon this model——I also found this glass-bottle under the ladder, and a piece of wax-candle in the adjoining cellar, where a hole was cut through the wall—this piece of string, with a seal impression upon it, I found at the bottom of the ladder among the rubbish; and this gimlet was fastened into the trap-door—this is the under-side of it, and here is the gimlet with the handle burnt off—it was directly over the pipe and the ladder, and the string was under it among the rubbish—the trap-door is very much charred—the joists were also very much burnt, equally as much as this; not the whole of them, but the three nearest to the trap-door—underneath the ladder there was a hole communicating with the next cellar, and opposite that hole there is a door—that hole had, no doubt, been cut away by a chisel and hammer—the hole would let in a draught of air, and assist the flames—it was about two feet square—I got through it several times—if my attention had not been directed to the fire when it was, it would certainly have communicated with the rest of the building—there was nothing to prevent it—I should think the house would have been all down in 10 minutes, the second-floor as well as the first—I found this piece of wire at the bottom of the iron-piping in the draught-hole, and this burnt cotton was inside, down at the bottom of the pipe, and all round outside it, and some of it was lying on the earth below—it appeared to have been placed there—it could not have fallen there out of the trays—this cotton was all up the ladder, between almost every step, evidently placed there—at the bottom of the wooden block I found some melted wax, which I produce.</p>

               <p>me about it—there was a water-closet, not near there, but on the left going through the passage—I took that down—there were two leaden cisterns and service-pipes—I took them down, and also the pipe which served a water-butt—the water-closet was to be repaired and fixed at his own house in Lough-borough-park—it was a long way from the cellar-steps—when the water-closet was removed it left nothing but wood-work.</p>

                  </hi>. I and my husband, William Strong, reside at the house, 52, Lime-street, and had done so for two years. I was residing there on the night of the fire—some time ago there had been an Insurance Com<lb></lb>pany, called the Colonization Corporation, carrying on business there—the prisoner was a director of that Company—the business of the Company was moved to King William-street—I look after the premises there—I went there last Oct.—there was furniture in the house after that, of Mr. Huggins, in the first floor—Mr. Taylor occupied that room—there was no furniture in any other room, except half-a-dozen cane-bottomed chairs that were on the second floor—after the removal of the Corporation, some of the fixtures were taken down and removed by Mr. Wood—on the evening of 21st March the prisoner came and rang for a candle—I gave him a whole one—that was in the back-room, behind the coffee-room—I went up-stairs to my own apart<lb></lb>ment—I saw him again, in about an hour and a half, in the same room—the candle was then burnt down gradually, I cannot say how much—his clothes looked rather dusty and dirty, all white, like mortar and brick dust—I did not notice his hands—he rang the bell, and asked for water, a towel, and a clothes-brush, which I took down to him—it was in consequence of his ringing the bell that I saw him the second time—the hole in the wall between the two cellars was not there before the evening of 21st March—there is a door to that cellar, leading down the front-cellar staircase—that door was open before 21st March—I am not quite certain whether the key was in it or not; if not, it was on the bunch of keys, along with the key of the other cellar-door, which were removed that day—before then, that bunch of keys hang in the office—after that evening, that door was not opened—we found it locked up that night, and Mr. Huggins took the bunch of keys away with him that night—I have not seen them since—on the day of the fire I saw the prisoner at the house, about half-past two in the afternoon, on the first-floor landing-place—he rang the bell for me, and asked for the key of Mr. Taylor's room—Mr. Taylor was out—I went up-stairs and got it for him, unlocked the door, went into the room with him, and left him there—I turned back again to speak to him, and he was then going down the stairs leading from the corner of Mr. Taylor's room to the coffee-room—the trap-door is at the foot of those stairs—I went up-stairs again—I spoke to him at that time—he brought the key up to me about an hour after—I did not see him any more that day, but I heard his voice at half-past 4 in the afternoon—he was then on the first-floor lauding, talking to Mr. Taylor—at 7 o'clock that evening I went to the offices in King William-street with my husband—I came back at 10, and found my husband walking up and down outside—we went into the house—on entering I smelt something like the burning of turpentine or resin—I went and looked all over the premises—I Went down to the front-cellar, took up the sawdust and smelt it, but could not see or smell anything of burning—I did not know what it was, and I laid it to the drain, which had been stopped up—after that we had our supper—We did not smell anything after we got up-stairs—at 11 I went to my bedroom, and it was full of smoke—I ran down-stairs into the street, and called for the police, and my husband went for the firemen—the firemen afterwards came—on Monday</p>

               <p>morning I was sent for to the prisoner's offices, in Copthall-court, Throg<lb></lb>morton-street—he was not there—I spoke to the clerks, and as I was going down-stairs he came in—he said, "This is a sad affair, Mrs. Strong"—I said, "Yes, it is, sir"—he asked had I any idea who had done it—I said I knew no one that had been in the habit of being on the premises but himself—he asked could I not form any idea who did it, and what my real opinion was—I said I did not know, but whoever was guilty of doing it was worse than a mur<lb></lb>derer; they had better have come and murdered me in my bed than set fire to me—I asked him how the hole was made through the cellar-wall, and why that cellar-door had been kept locked for the last three months—he said it was made when the men were at work there—nothing else particular took place—there were so many persons coming in, I went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, living in Clarendon-street, Somers-town. I had offices, at 52, Lime-street, which the prisoner offered me the use of in Dec. last—he told me then that the house was to be pulled down, and that I might have the offices until that took place—he directed me to make plans for the rebuilding, which I accordingly did—I knew the prisoner when he was a director of the Colonization Insurance Company—I recollect the 31st May, the day of the fire—I was at my office the day before—the pri<lb></lb>soner came there that day about half-past 5 o'clock—he had a travelling-bag with him, and a parcel—I do not know whether the bag was a carpet or lea<lb></lb>ther one—it appeared full—the parcel was rather large, and in brown paper—I took it for a poker—there is a staircase leading from my office to the coffee-shop below, which at that time was unoccupied—the prisoner left my room by that staircase, taking with him the bag and parcel—I offered to help him down with it—he very courteously refused, and said he was taking those things down to put with some other things which he had down-stairs—I did not ask him what it was—I asked him if that was a poker in the brown paper parcel—he did not give me any reply—he remained down-stairs probably ten minutes—I left the room, and when I came back I found him in the office—I accompanied him to look over some property that was to be let—he left Lime-street about a quarter-past 6—he came again on the Saturday—I had in my possession some plans that had been made by another surveyor—they were valuable plans, but not plans that we should have adopted—a surveyor would charge probably 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—there was furniture belonging to the prisoner in my room—a large dining-table, and a small one, two easy chairs, and twelve mahogany chairs—the prisoner rolled up the plans, and was going to take them away on the Saturday, and I offered my boy to take them, which he did—I have known the prisoner for some time—I was not paying him rent for these offices—he allowed me to use them—he left about half-past 6 on the Saturday—I saw him again the same evening about quarter-past 7—he had not made any appointment to see me again—I saw</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 528). I went over the house, 52, Lime-street, on the Friday after the fire—the firemen were then there—I did not go over where the furniture was, only where the fire occurred—I found in the cellar some paper, and part of a newspaper, down the pit—the top of this funnel was given me by the fireman in charge of the place—we found a camphine can and four screws—in consequence of directions I received on 9th June, I went with Bailey to the prisoner's house, in Loughborough-park Cottages—(before that I had seen Mr. Kemp, and made inquiries)—I saw the prisoner—I had the block of wood and the iron funnel with me—it was about 7 o'clock in the evening—we waited till he bad had his dinner; we did not send word to him who we were—we were in plain clothes—as soon as he came in, we told him that we were two City-police constables—I asked him if his name was Huggins—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he had any pro<lb></lb>perty in Lime-street—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he had heard of the fire; he said, "Yes," and asked me if Mr. Marchant was my inspector—I said he was—he said, because he had sent for him or seen him, and he had had a conversation with him about it in consequence—I told him that had nothing to do with us at all—(Bailey was with me)—I then produced on the table, before him, this block of wood and funnel as it is now, and asked him if he could give me any account of these—he said he would answer no questions; he had been told that Mrs. Strong and others had been saying something about him, that he was a suspected party—I asked him three times distinctly if he would give us any account of this block and funnel, and he said he should answer no questions, as he was suspected—I told him he must consider him<lb></lb>self in custody—he said he did not understand the criminal law, he did not think we had the power; he could understand a summons, or a warrant from the Lord Mayor—I said we had sufficient power, and offered to show him our warrant cards to that effect; he then put his hat on, and went with us—I told him I must take him to London, and if he liked to satisfy my inspector about the block and funnel, that would be at his option—I took him to London, to the Fenchurch-street station—I stated to the inspector there what had passed between us; the prisoner said it was all true, it was the same as he should</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the prisoner's employment about five years—he was then living at Sydenham, with his wife and two children; for the first twelve months after I went, he was kind and affectionate to them; I never saw any quarrel—they removed from Sydenham, and I went with them—after that I observed symptoms of irritability in the prisoner: a noise, such as the shutting of a door, or a child crying, would cause him to shake him<lb></lb>self, and say, "Oh, dear, keep him quiet"—he was excited much in the same way as other people are—I remember, on a Saturday, in 1848, his coming home to tea an hour after his usual hour—I was then nurse—I only heard him rush out of the parlour, and his wife after him; she returned in five or ten minutes—he took nothing with him as if he was going a journey—I next saw him in a fortnight, or rather better—I went with Mrs. Huggins to Grays, on the Thursday after this happened—I did not see him there: he was not there while I was there—I staid there a week, and returned on the night he came home—I was in my mistress's bed-room; he came up-stairs, and I instantly went out, and did not hear a word spoken; I went to bed; I know they did not sleep together that night—next morning he went out to business as usual, and did not return till a week or ten days afterwards, when my mistress went out, and they both returned together in the evening—I have often heard the prisoner raving about the room in the night, and stamping and groaning very much—since he went to Grays, the tendency to irritibility has been much greater, and there has been a very great alteration in his conduct towards his wife—one morning I took him a cutlet for his breakfast, and put it before him; he instantly jumped up and down in his chair, and <hi rend="italic">twitted</hi> himself in his chair, and groaned very much; my mistress asked him what was the matter; he did not answer, but rose up and beat her most violently—I have witnessed that kind of cruelty to his wife rather frequently—about three years ago he behaved very cruelly to her; he threw a wet towel at her when she had scarcely been confined three days; and I have seen him throw knives at her—he has frequently complained about the meat, and said it was diseased, poisonous, and not fit for human beings, when we have all eaten the same, and known it to be quite good; we have had the butcher up to examine it, and he has assured us that it was good—we have returned several joints to the butcher because the prisoner said he would not have it in the house, and they have really had nothing the matter with them at all—he has repeatedly found fault with the butter, and I have taken it away, and brought the same butter back, and he has then accepted it as being good, and said nothing about it the second time—he did not always sleep in his own house; he slept</p>

               <p>in No. 2, an empty house, six doors off, only the room he occupied was fur<lb></lb>nished—this was between two and three years ago—it was after the Saturday in May—when he has gone away to sleep in the empty house, he has fre<lb></lb>quently come home in the middle of the night, after we have all gone to bed, and knocked us all up—his conduct, while strangers were present, was very kind and attentive; and always kind to his children and servants whether strangers were by or not—his violence was towards his wife alone—for about three weeks he would remain perfectly quiet, except being nervous, and then he would break out, and it would last about a week.</p>

I went there last Dec. twelve months—he has always behaved to me and my fellow-servant's with great kindness—he has behaved to his wife with the utmost cruelty—when I had been there about a fortnight, I heard him stamping and raging about in the dining-room very much—I heard him beating his wife, and heard him say, "I will kill you"—I opened the door, and asked what was the matter; as I went out at one door, he followed out at the other—he did not speak to me or my mistress—my mistress said, I am very glad you have come in; he would have killed me"—I have seen him beat her at other times—it has left bruises, from which she has been confined to her bed four days—I have seen him throw chairs and knives at her, and many other things—when he has been treating her in that way, he would tremble, his eyes would bolt as if they would leave their sockets, and he would growl like a savage dog—I never knew his wife say an angry word to him; she always studied him in every respect—I used to make my mistress laugh by saying that it was at the change of the moon that he conducted himself in that way, because I used to notice it every month for three or four days, when he would be in a very violent temper, and then he would be very calm again—for the first five months I knew him, he used to sleep in an empty house in the row, No. 2—I have very often been called up in the night when he has come from there, and asked for a cup of cocoa, and I have made it for him while he laid on the sofa; and he would groan and bowl like a savage dog—he would come in his night-shirt, with his trowsers and coat not properly put on, and a handker<lb></lb>chief round his neck—sometimes it has been a very wet, cold night, not always—he suffered very much from his head—my fellow-servant used to have to pump upon it every morning—he usually went out from half-past 8 to 9 o'clock—he appeared, as far as I know, to be very much occupied.</p>

                  </hi>., M. D. I am physician to the Asylum at Hanwell. For the last twelve years I have been entirely devoted to the subject of dis<lb></lb>eases of the mind—at the desire of the prisoner's family, I have had interviews with him since he has been in prison—after a great deal of conversation with him, I am, as a physician, of opinion that his mind is not perfectly sound, that his judgment is impaired—I have heard the evidence that has been given on his behalf to-day—assuming the facts to be true, they seem to me to describe the character of a man who is on the very verge of insanity; in a highly irritable state of brain, and who, now and then, seems to have been quite maniacal—examples are very frequent of a man's mind being impaired to a considerable extent, and yet he may be able to attend to his ordinary occu<lb></lb>pations—my experience has satisfied me of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person to have lived upon terms of the greatest affection with a woman for seven years, and then suddenly to change his conduct, and to treat her as the object of his most determined dislike, and to ill-use her, without any apparent reason; to what, in the absence of any explanation, would you refer such a change? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is one of the most frequent of the symptoms of insanity—an indisposition to take food on the ground that it is poisonous, is also a very common symptom of incipient insanity—insane persons very frequently exhibit a great deal of cunning and artifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the cunning and artifice that you say insane persons sometimes exhibit, generally tend to their own benefit, or their own injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Generally, to their own benefit—I do not mean to say that they are more likely to manage things to their own interests than sane persons; I mean that it is a very frequent symptom of insanity to endeavour to do things by cunning and artifice which do not require it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But suppose things do require cunning and artifice to do them effec<lb></lb>tually, and that they are done effectually, do you think it is evidence of sanity or insanity, which? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should find it difficult to say—I should not say that of itself it was evidence, either of the one or the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the subject of impaired mind, I suppose any false judgment, or wrong reasoning, is what you would call almost an impaired mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a matter altogether of measure; I do not think there is any clear and strong line of distinction that can be drawn to define the shades of it—I do not say that the mind of any person committing a crime is impaired; I should take each case by itself, and consider all the circumstances of the case, to enable me to distinguish whether it had passed the line or not—if a man, who appeared to be fond of his wife for many years, beat her frequently and violently, I should strongly suspect that he was mad—I should certainly inquire whether there existed a reason for it, before I should consider a man quite sound who acted in that manner—I should not consider a man quite sound that beat his wife, under any circumstances, not a <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi>; I should take all the circumstances into consideration, the station of the patient, his previous habits, and so on; and, of course, inquire whether any cause of quarrel existed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You do not consider, for a moment, that this man has not understood right from wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I imagine that his malady, like the malady of all patients, really and truly does impair their sense of right and wrong; but I feel this to be so important, this question is so often asked, and medical men think so much depends upon it, that, perhaps, you will permit me to say,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070071"></xptr>
               <p>that there are insane persons, and many under my care at Han well, who, I am sure, understand right from wrong, but who would commit the wrong, and who would say, "If I commit the wrong, you cannot punish me, because I am a madman:" therefore, we medical men do not consider that a question of distinction at all—I should question the power of a mind in the state in which the prisoner's has been, to appreciate right and wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You can perfectly understand my question) because, as you say, it is one that is so often put to you; do you mean that at the time he was beating his wife, or at any of the periods that have been spoken to, he could not dis<lb></lb>tinguish right from wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am perfectly aware that is the question.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If that is the question, it can surely be answered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it can absolutely be answered: I think it can only be answered in the manner in which I have answered it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINB</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You can give me your opinion, and I must trouble you for it: in your opinion, could he distinguish right from wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, sir, I do not understand rightly that question—if you mean positively absolutely, on every subject, I cannot answer you—I could not say that he was unable to distinguish right from wrong, but I say that his power of appreciating it is impaired; his power of reasoning accurately is impaired; the power of controlling or resisting a train of thought tending to criminal actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you apply that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think in many morbid states of mind, the patient is in that condition that ideas will present themselves in his mind having a tendency to crime, which he has not an equal and constant power of resisting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>, <hi rend="largeCaps">M. D</hi>. I am physician, to Bethlehem Hos<lb></lb>pital. My attention has been directed for a great many years to persons of unsound mind—I have had the management, and charge of the lunatics at Bethlehem Hospital for about seventeen years—I have had opportunities from my experience of paying attention to the subject of insanity—I have not had an interview with the prisoner—I have heard the whole of the evidence which has been given in Court to—day on the part of the prosecution and defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your judgment as to the state of mind of the person whose conduct is now under inquiry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not feel myself entitled to say that he is of sound mind—I mean that I consider he is of unsound mind—I find in my experience that there are persons who are of unsound mind, who are yet capable of attending to their ordinary business—I also find cases of persons of impaired, or diseased mind who are sometimes sane, and at other times have no power or control over their actions—change of affection is often the com<lb></lb>mencement of insanity—persons of an excitable disposition are frequently attacked with insanity, or persons of a nervous or melancholy temperament—persons</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070072"></xptr>
               <p>who have been afflicted with pains in the head, and who are ner<lb></lb>vous at sudden sounds and noises often labour under insanity—I have known instances where persons have become insane gradually, and at other times suddenly, and afterwards have been in possession of their reason—I have at<lb></lb>tended to the whole of the circumstances in this case—from the prisoner's condition and conduct previously, and from the evidence I have heard to-day, I think he was of unsound mind at the time this act is said to have been committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of unsound mind in all respects; incapable of distinguish<lb></lb>ing between right and wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not mean that—I am not here to decide the question of responsibility in an insane person, and therefore I can<lb></lb>not go the length of answering what lawyers frequently ask, is he capable of distinguishing between right and wrong; I mean to say his brain is in a disordered state, but I cannot define the degree of responsibility and con—sciousness which he possesses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will take it in that way; we understand from Dr. Conolly that many persons have not the power of resisting ideal that may lead in a criminal direction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I believe from what I have heard to—day, that on 31st May, Mr. Huggins was of unsound mind—I to not acquainted with any general definition of unsoundness of mind—there are three leading features in insanity, which sometimes exist together, some<lb></lb>times separately, and which are I should say, delusion, incoherent discourse, and irrational conduct—I do not think there is any description of insanity which embraces all those—I put the circumstances I have heard, under the class of irrational conduct—there is a disease which you may call a morbid state of the feelings—some persons call it moral insanity, others madness without delusion, and others call it incipient insanity—this gentleman I con<lb></lb>ceive has a morbid state of the brain which leads to complete insanity—I de not say he is quite raving mad—he is not that certainly at present, but he is in a diseased state of the brain, and that has been going on I presume for some time—moral insanity is principally in the early stages, some call it incipient insanity, and others lesion of the will—that is generally depen—dent upon a diseased state of the brain, existing at the time—there it sometimes a morbid disease which might terminate in complete insanity—in the course of disease of the intellect, there are several cases where the patient is devoid of reason—I think that stage would be brought about generally by external excitement, and by the progress of the disease which I conceive to exist in this case, I think it has been coming on for several years—I am not prepared to say that he arrived at one of those stages on 31st May, but the act seems to me to have been conducted in a very irrational manner, in an individual in whom disease was in my opinion progressing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have never seen him to exa<lb></lb>mine him at all, until you saw him in the dock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it is entirely from the evidence—I do not admit the definition of knowing right from wrong, I do not mean to answer the question in that way—I mean to say that hit knowledge of right and wrong was impaired; that he was not equally sensible of the distinction as a sane person would be—there is a state of disordered brain, in which persons may know right from wrong—in my opinion the prisoner's case is that of a person whose brain is disordered, and who does to a certain degree, know right from wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose you were to take into consideration a deliberate preparation for eighteen months to commit an offence, the commission of the offence, and then an avoidance of answering questions from fear he should get into diffi<lb></lb>culty,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070073"></xptr>
               <p>by saying that being a suspected person he would not answer any; would that be indicative of a sound or unsound mind; that is, of a person knowing right from wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His saying he would not answer any ques<lb></lb>tions is not anything at all; it very often happens that in committing crime, an insane person is quite sensible be is doing wrong—I mean to say, that on 31st May his brain was disordered in such a degree as to take away his per<lb></lb>fect knowledge of right and wrong—I am not aware that be knew the distinc<lb></lb>tion between right and wrong at the time he did it; I will not undertake to say on my oath, that he did not—I will undertake to say that he was in a diseased state when he did it, that his power of preventing crime was impaired, and that he did not possess that degree of consciousness and responsibility.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq., M. D. I am a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians—I have been practising medicine twenty—on e years—my atten<lb></lb>tion has for many years been given to diseases of the mind—I have not had an opportunity of examining the prisoner—I have heard the evidence that has been given to—day, und the mode in which this crime is stated to have been effected—at this time I cannot exactly say what is the state of the prisoner's mind, I only judge from the history of the case—assuming the facts stated on both sides to be true, I should consider that on 31st May, he was of unsound mind—I think that he bad a less power of judging between right and wrong than a sane person.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SKINNER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that deliberation in carrying out a series of acts, an evidence of unsound mind, with reference to the evidence you have heard to—day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have known many cases of unsound mind where the parties have exhibited great deliberation—I think it possible—I do not believe it is evidence one way or the other; if anything it would be favourable to soundness of mind taken singly—it is from the his<lb></lb>tory of the case I form my opinion of his insanity—I do not think any man of sound mind would make so many persons acquainted with his transactions—that is one reason, and from the history of the case it is very clear to me that he has been for a considerable time of unsound mind, from the delusions that are proved to have existed—I should think a pipe of that kind would not be made by a sane person for such a purpose of such a material—I think the thing might have been done more simply—I do not found my opinion on that solely—I should think a man of sound mind would not have taken such a course—I do not think that the act of beating his wife when they were alone, would indicate his being insane—I do not know whether it would favour the idea of sanity and fear of other persons opinions; I think it would—it is not upon that incident that I form my opinion—the delusion I speak of is respecting the food provided for him by his wife; and one ground of my opinion is his change of habit and manner from one of the most affec<lb></lb>tionate of men, and becoming, as the servant describes it, a brute—I am aware that husband and wife are sometimes at variance at the latter period of their lives, when they were not so formerly—I should be very much inclined to think that that was attributable to insanity, on such &amp; sudden change as I have heard described.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then taking what you suppose to be a sudden change of manner towards his wife, and his selecting the opportunity of beating her when alone, and the circumstance of the want of simplicity in preparation for the crime; do you believe that he was ignorant of the distinction between right and wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a great puzzle; I believe the greater number of lunatics----</p>

               <p>to make an observation instead of an answer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I suppose he did know right from wrong.</p>

I was a policeman at this time, <hi rend="italic">F</hi> 69; I am not now—on Sunday morning, 18th Sept., between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was on duty in Holborn; my attention was called to two men, one of whom was the prisoner, and a woman, standing in High Holborn—during the time they were standing there, I saw three or four men come out of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> coffee house opposite—they all assembled together—I heard one man speak in Irish, and say to the person with the prisoner, "Why, you b——, you can't fight"—I then heard rather a loud reply in a foreign language; I could not understand what it was, it was uttered by the prisoner and his companions—as some little disturbance was likely to take place, I went up to them, and requested them to be quiet, and to go home to bed—they all walked away together up Holborn, towards Southampton-buildings—just at that time a man and woman asked me to direct them the way to the Bank; I did so, and then turned myself round again to go up Holborn, and saw some persons apparently fighting together, some distance up Holborn—that was about fifty yards from the coffee shop—I hastened to them, and on getting up to them, I saw the prisoner and another man get up off the ground—the prisoner then ran to another man who was standing a little way off) that was Hart—a fight took place between them, and Hart fell down—the prisoner then got up and ran away—just at that time some person hallooed out," Oh, he has stabbed the man!"—I went up to Hart, he was bleeding very much from the head—the prisoner was at that time forty or fifty yards further up Holborn, just against Southampton-buildings—I followed him—he turned down Southampton-buildings, in company with a woman—on getting near to the prisoner, he turned round and saw me and several other persons following him—some persons then hallooed out," Stop thief!" the prisoner then ran off with great speed—when he got to the turning in Southampton-buildings, he turned to the left, and ran to the gates leading into Staples Inn; they being shut he could not get through, but he turned to the area railings of No. 28, Southampton-buildings, and made an attempt to jump over—in doing that his trowsers caught on to the top of the railings, and he fell to the bottom and was secured—he likewise broke a window—there was a hole in the knee of his trowsers, and a stab upon his person just opposite it—I believe it was a stab from the appearance of it—I do not think the area railings would do it; I took him to King's College Hospital—about two hours afterwards I went to the house, No. 37, Southampton-buildings, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>) in the area, it opens with a spring; there is some blood upon it, and a few hairs—the spring keeps it from shutting, it was open when I found it—the prisoner passed by that area while I was following him—neither Buckley or Hart passed by there, at least not to my knowledge.</p>

THOMPSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time in the morning was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As near as I could guess about 25 minutes to 1 o'clock; at least, to 2 o'clock, I mean—I was in company with my brother—I am working for Mr. Comitti, a picture frame and looking glass maker, in Fulwood's-grents—I do not know whether the prisoner is an Italian; I never saw him before—I did not know the man that was with him—I knew none of them—I have not seen the other man since—I was not before the Magistrate—I saw the prisoner taken into custody; I did not tell the policeman what I had seen—there was no policeman there at the time this happened—the policeman came when Buckley was standing in the road, and the people were hallooing out something about two men being stabbed—the policeman asked Buckley which way the man went, and he said, "This way;" and Buckley ran down Southampton-buildings along with the mob; he ran down to the bottom of the buildings, where the man was lying in the area—he ran down to the door—I distinctly saw that—I was by the side of him, running along with him—I did not know Buckley; I never saw him before—I was not in the coffee shop: I never use the house—I did not know the young woman who was with the prisoner—I saw her here yesterday morning—I first gave information about this to my brother-in-law, Mr. Comitti, whom I work for—another gentleman came up, and said, If you saw anything in it, you must do the poor man good; if you saw any ill-treatment"—I have not had a subpoena; I came up of my own accord—I was told by a friend of his that he was going to be tried—I have seen a solicitor in the case; I first saw him at Bow-street when the prisoner was examined—I was not in the court during the examination; I was waiting outside—I do not know whether the solicitor knew that—I had not seen the solicitor before then—a young man came and asked me about it—I was not examined as a witness before the Magistrate—when I first saw the parties fighting there was no one there but the prisoner, his friend and the young woman, and Buckley, and Hart; I cannot exactly swear there were no more, I did not see any more—when they were fighting they had got about thirty yards from the coffee-shop door, facing Gray's Inn-lane; at least, that is where they were wrangling in the road—where they were fighting was against the tobacco shop, against the shutters, in the dark—Hart kicked the prisoner as hard as he could about the head and body—I did not see any blood come; I saw him bleeding afterwards, when he was led away by two policemen—I did not see whether</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185311280060"></xptr>
               <p>there was any bruise on his head; I did not go near enough—I did not see Hart and the prisoner on the ground at all, Hart never fell—I only saw Buckley and the prisoner on the ground once, the prisoner limped away; he walked double when he got up, and when he got into the middle of the carriage <hi rend="italic">way, he ran away up</hi> Southampton-buildings—he began <hi rend="italic">to run</hi> before he got to Southampton-buildings; he limped as well as he could—I did not hear the cry of Stop thief 1—I did not follow him, I stopped by Buckley—I followed till he was taken—I never heard Stop thief I mentioned; I heard some <hi rend="italic">of</hi> them say, He has stabbed a man—as far as I saw, the prisoner ran all at one pace; he did not quicken his pace to my knowledge after he got into the Buildings, but I did not see him after he got into the Buildings—before he got to the Buildings he went on a kind of a run, a limp, between a walk and a run—the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> was so doubled up it was as much as he could do to feet along—I did not see any knife at all to my knowledge; I saw him use his fist—I saw nothing in his hand—I saw him when he got up and looked round; he was <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> up to the man then, and then he turned round and limped away—the men both fell together; they had hold of one another when they fell—they were about two feet from the kerb stone—the prisoner's back was not to the kerb stone, but to the shutters—there was only one young woman there, and she was along with the prisoner, screaming—there was a young woman along with Buckley, but she stopped behind when they ran.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you did not know the prisoner before; did you know either Buckley or Hart before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had never seen them before—they were equally strangers to me—I have seen Mr. Shane, the solicitor, of Bedford-row—I did not know the young woman who was with the prisoner—I believe her name is Coort; that is the same name as myself, but she is no relation of mine; I have not got any in London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you marry Mr. Comitti's sister, or he yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He married my sister; I have a brother in London, I call him a relation; but I mean in regard to a cousin, or anything <hi rend="italic">of</hi> that—I do not know how the prisoner is employed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> While the prisoner was going towards Southampton-buildings were there several persons following him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I never heard any shouting, only the police came up, and asked which way the man went, and then they all ran—when the prisoner got up he looked round, and saw Buckley fencing at him, and he made a motion with his fist, turned round, and limped away—he looked as if he did not know what he was doing, as if he was knocked any how.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of the last witness; I work with Mr. Comitti, in Fulwood's-rents. On 18th Sept. I closed icy master's shop, about 12 o'clock, or a little after, and my brother and I then walked down Holborn, towards the City—we stood for a short time at the corner of Gray's-inn-lane—I saw two foreigners and a young woman come out of Watkins' coffee-shop, and directly after I saw two men, one in a smock frock, and one in a flannel jacket, follow them out—they seemed as if they were going to make a quarrel with the foreigner—the foreigner turned round, and beckoned with his hand, as much as to say, Me no fight' as well as I could understand it; I cannot exactly say that he said that; I heard him mutter something, which I believe to be that—he then walked on a little distance, and one of the Irishmen, the one in the smock frock, was wrestling with the one in the flannel jacket, to get at him—there was a female along with them, but she ran away and left them—as soon as the one in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185311280061"></xptr>
               <p>smock frock got away from the other, he ran up, closed with the foreigner, and knocked him down—by the foreigner 1 mean the prisoner—he had not been down above a minute or so when the man in the flannel jacket ran up and gave him two or three kicks in the head and ribs, while he was down—I directly went up and said, "Are you not ashamed of yourself to ill-use a man like that?" and they directly complained; one said, "I am stabbed," and the other one said, "So am I"—the prisoner then ran away, up Southampton-building, limping, and he looked as if he was a regular wild man—there was a mob coming up—I have not seen Louisa Coort here to-day; she was here yesterday all day, and she was here last Session.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you worked for Mr. Comitti? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three years; he keeps three men, me my brother, and another—Fulwood's-rents is about 150 yards from the coffee-shop—it was ten minutes, or more, after I closed the shop that I saw this—it was after 12 o'clock when I closed the Shop—the prisoner seemed to limp along somehow—he was like a wild man, with the mob coming up to him; he thought he was going to get killed quite, I suppose, with such a mob after him—I did not see any one there at the first part of it, only me and may brother, and the parties that were <hi rend="italic">kicking up</hi> the quarrel—I was at Bow-street, but was not examined—I saw the prisoner taken into custody by the policeman, in Southampton-buildings, just up in the corner, where he tumbled over the railings—the prisoner came out of the coffee-shop about a minute or half a minute before the others—he had got about five yards away from the coffee-shop when this happened.</p>

On the 13th of this month, the prisoner came to my shop between two and three in the afternoon, she purchased a yard of print, I was in the shop. I perceived her to be a very knowing young woman. I left the shop, and watched her through the counting-house window: she pointed to some prints on the shelf, and desired my young man to take them down; when his back was turned she pulled a print off the counter, and secreted it under her clothes; in a few minutes after that she bought a yard of print for 3 s. 2 d. and when she gave the young man the money, I went out and informed the young man. I did not say any thing to her then, but let her go out of the shop a short distance in the street; I then took her by the elbow, and asked her to come back. I asked the young man, if he missed any thing; I said, I do; and then she fell a crying. I took the print from her; this is the print, it is mine. I saw her secrete it under her clothes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went in the shop and bought a yard of cotton at 3 s. 2 d. that gentleman followed me out, and told me to step back; he asked the shopman, if he missed any thing from off the counter; he said, no, he did not; the gentleman accused me of taking a piece of print. I never was before a magistrate in my life before.</p>

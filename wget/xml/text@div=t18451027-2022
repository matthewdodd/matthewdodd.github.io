On Thursday evening, the 9th of Oct., I came in company with the prisoner—I have no recollection of the place, but I am told it was at the Chan-cellor's Head—I had been dining out with my friends, and was not quite collected—I was standing at the bar of a public-house between nine ana ten o'clock—the prisoner passed, and made some sort of light expression, and I dare say I made some reply in a similar strain—she asked me to accompany her to her room, and being a little elevated, it is most likely I was inclined to be a little moral—I had with me a silver watch, a gold-chain,</p>

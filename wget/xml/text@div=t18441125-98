                  </hi>. I am a green<lb></lb>grocer, and live in Great Chapel-street, Westminster; the prisoner was my errand<lb></lb>boy. Having missed money for the last five or six weeks, I had some money marked on Tuesday night, the 12th of Nov., and it was placed in the till on Wednes<lb></lb>day—on going out that morning, about ten o'clock, I received some money, and I then saw the marked money perfectly safe in the till—I returned home a little after eleven—I then missed one shilling and a four<lb></lb>penny<lb></lb>piece out of the till—I fetched an officer, and gave the prisoner into custody—he was searched, but none of my money was found on him—the officer then searched the parlour, but nothing was found there—I pro<lb></lb>ceeded with the officer to search the shop, and under the skirting in the shop, where the prisoner had been cleaning the window, was the shilling secreted, and the fourpenny<lb></lb>piece was at the back of the till, on a ledge—I gave the prisoner into custody—he said he had taken the money, but he hoped we would let him go, and forgive him—the shilling was one I had marked.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's—I found this shilling under the skirting<lb></lb>board—it has the mark which the prosecutor described—when I told the prisoner it was found be begged of his master to forgive him, and on the way to the station he said that he took the money, and begged I would speak to his master for him.</p>

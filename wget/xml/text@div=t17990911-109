            's; at the World's End, Little Chelsea. On Thursday, the 18th of July, I went to Turnham-Green, about two o'clock, and returned at seven in the evening, with a young man, who is here, that drove the Chiswick stage; we got to <placeName id="t17990911-109-crimeloc595">the Three Kings in Piccadilly</placeName>

When I got down I went under the gateway to make water, the prisoner came up to me, and said, lend me your bundle and umbrella, I will hold it for you; I gave it to him, supposing him to belong to the yard; he went up and sat down upon a bench under the Three Kings tap, I lost sight of him for a minute, I came up to the bench, and saw that the prisoner had no bundle or umbrella, he told me it was safe; I asked him what he would like to drink for his civility, in taking care of them; we had part of a pot of porter together, which I paid for: I pulled out my watch, and said, now it is time for me to go home, and asked him for the bundle and umbrella; he said he would see me d-d and blasted before I should go home, and he would not give it me. He then appeared to be drunk; I did not observe it before. I asked him what he meant, and made my way towards the gateway; he followed me, and just under the gateway, he laid hold of me side-ways, and slammed me right up against the gateway; he then forced my watch out first, and then pinned me against the gateway, and ran away up Piccadilly. As soon as I recovered from the alarm, I ran out and called watch! stop thief! I lost sight of him among some postillions or coachmen, and I did not see him till the Saturday morning, when he was taken up. I was in pursuit of him all the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Where did you live last, as a stay-maker? - A. At Mr. Button's, Paradise-row, Chelsea; I left his service about four months ago.</p>

               <p>Q. The gateway of the Three Kings must have been as public a place as any in London, at that time in the evening? - A. Yes; it was not dark, it was dusk.</p>

               <p>Q. Where there not twenty? - A. I suppose they were all such sort as himself; I did not go into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. In the judgment of charity you supposed them to be all thieves? - A. I did not know; I thought it was best not to go back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suppose the landlord a thief? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suppose your comrade, the coachman, a thief? - A. No; he was gone home with his coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no other coach there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to the Three Kings on the Friday? - A. No; I was in the neighbourhood enquiring for him. I took him just by there, on the Saturday; he was attending the coaches at the Gloucester Coffee-house, next door to the Three Kings.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken to Bow-street on the Saturday and discharged by the Magistrate, was he not? - A. Yes, I was to get another witness; and I took him again, on the Monday, before Sir

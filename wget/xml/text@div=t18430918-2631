                  </hi>.

On a Thursday, about the 11th of August, she came to me with this note in her hand, and asked me to cash it—she owed me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at that time—she showed me the note, and asked me if I would let her have a few shillings for her husband to go to see his mother before he went on board ship—I said I could not advance her any—she brought it again at one o'clock on the following day, asked me to cash it, and said that her husband expected to go on board ship in three or four days—I said I was obliged to borrow part of the money, and had promised to</p>

               <p>pay it back in three or four days—I gave her 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she offered to give me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for cashing the note—I deducted the money she owed me—I received the note from her—it was for the note that I gave her the money—she gave my husband the note—I was present—he laid the money on the counter—my husband gave me the note—I kept it—I took it, believing it to be a good advance note of the ship in which she said her husband was engaged—when she brought the note she said nothing about what it was—my husband laid it on the counter, and said she had better go to the Jews with it, for he did not like the look of it, or something of that kind—she said it was quite good; it would be payable three days after the ship sailed from Oravesend—there was nothing further said then about her husband or the note—I went afterwards to the owners with it, and after that saw the prisoner—I saw her several times—I said I had been to the owners, and also to the captain at the London Docks, and the captain said he knew nothing about it; he had never signed his hand to any note—she said she had been to the London Docks, and they would not allow her to go in—I asked her if she had seen her husband—she said he had been out on the Monday morning, and she had never set eyes on him after—I said I could not rest till I had seen further into it; that I felt very uncomfortable about my money; it was a great deal of money for me to lose, as I borrowed part of it to advance it—she said it was a good deal of money, but it was not in her power to give me any of it—I said I would go down to the West India Docks to see if I could hear anything of him there—the prisoner said it was not worth while to trouble further, for as soon as he got another ship she would give me the money—I had her taken up about three weeks after—as I went to the station with her, she said I might have let it rest a short time, till she could see whether her husband could get another ship—she said something about making it up—she was taken to the Police-court next day—the ship I wet down to was the <hi rend="italic">Bangalore</hi>, in the London Docks—the agents are Phillips and Tiplady—I know nothing of them, except from the note—(<hi rend="italic"> The note was dated Aug. 10, 1843, and was for </hi>6<hi rend="italic">l., payable to M.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Phillips and Tiplady, ship-brokers, George-yard, Lombard-street. They were brokers for the ship <hi rend="italic">Bangalore</hi>—the captain is James Tobson Smith—I know his handwriting, and have seen him write—no part of this note is his handwriting—he signs his name James R. Smith—part of this note is printed—it is customary to have them printed in this way—the captains find them, or any one can obtain them from the stationers—we should not have paid that note, if it was a true one, unless we had a list of the crew from Portsmouth; and if the name was in that we should then have paid it; that would satisfy me that the person had sailed in the ship—the notes are issued by the captains three or four days before they sail, when the articles are signed by the crew—I have a list of the crew on board the vessel, signed by the captain—I should not have paid this note, from the appearance of it altogether, not even if the name had been in the list, because it is decidedly a forgery, and we should know it imme<lb></lb>diately—it is of the usual form, except the signature—if such a note as this had been signed by the captain I should have paid it, if I found the man's name in the list—the body of the note makes no difference, if the signature is genuine—I believe there is another ship named <hi rend="italic">Bangalore</hi>, but not of which Messrs. Tiplady are brokers—the other ship's captain is named Smith—I do not know his Christian name—I do not know whose handwriting this paper is in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to John Chapel and Co., ship-brokers—there is a ship called the Bangalore, which they are brokers for—the captain's name is Thomas Smith—she sailed to India about the 25th or 26th of July from Gravesend—I know the captain's signature—I have seen him write frequently—no part of this note is his handwriting—the signature is not his certainly—it is the usual sort of advance note that is given to sea<lb></lb>men—it would be purchased at the stationers', or given to them by their agents—I can tell by reference to the list of the crew, when they were shipped on board the vessel—I know nothing whatever of it of my own knowledge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 95.) The prisoner was given into my charge by the prosecutrix for uttering a forged note—I told her what it was for—she said if her husband would not go in the <hi rend="italic">Bangalore</hi> he would go in some other ship, she had not the means of paying the money at that time, but as soon as she had the money she would pay her—she said that several times—Mrs. Thomas gave me this note—it has been in my custody ever since.</p>

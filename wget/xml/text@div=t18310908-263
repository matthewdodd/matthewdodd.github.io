               <p>WILLIAM WEBSTER. I live at Waltham Abbey, Essex. In the month of January last I went to an eating-house, in Shoreditch, and in a short time the prisoner came in; he ordered some dinner, and soon afterwards another person came in - the prisoner and I had spoken before the other man came in; we all sat there in coversation some time, and then went to a public-house opposite <placeName id="t18310908-263-crimeloc1345">Shoreditch</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Were you ever in London before this? A. Yes, many scores of times; I had taken part of the money that day - I think it was near two o'clock in the day; I think it was about the 28th of January - I mentioned my loss to the landlord; I did not go to any magistrate in London - I never mentioned it to my wife; I told nobody of it but my brother-in-law, and the publican, until after I found the prisoner - I am sure I am not mistaken in him; he told me he was a drover, and he was dressed like one, but at the races he was dressed quite like a gentleman - I had not been drinking before I met with him; I might have taken a glass of ale.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long were you in company with the prisoner? A.I think an hour or more in the eating-house, and an hour or more in the public-house; we were in constant conversation - I noticed his voice and features; I have no doubt at all he is the man, though he was very differently dressed - when I seized him, he said, "What do you want me for? I have done nothing;" I recognized his features - I do not know what became of the farthings; the publican said he did not know him - I was quite sober; after he had thrust it in, I felt to see if it was safe, and felt them, as I thought - when he was gone I discovered they were farthings.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.The farthings were in the paper? A. Yes; I cannot say whether it was the same paper the sovereigns had been in - they were both brown paper.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at Enfield races on the 21st of July - the prisoner was given into my charge - he struggled very much to get away; there were two or three attempts at rescue - I found on him a good sovereign, a had one, and a sixpence; he denied the charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent of the charge.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES McCABE. I am a surgeon, and live in College-street, Westminster. To the best of my recollection I have seen the prisoner, at least I think he is the man, whom I attended from the 12th of January to about the middle of February; he was very ill - he might go out, but I think it must have been with very much pain; his complaint was the hydrocele, attended with much inflammation, for which I applied leeches twice - he might perhaps limp across the road, but I think he was not in a condition to walk the streets - I attended him at No. 12, Edward-street, New-street, Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to attend the prisoner there if you reside at Westminster? A. I was solicited to do so by a person named Webb, a silversmith, whom I attended for the same complaint, in Weymouth-terrace - I will not undertake to swear the prisoner is the same person - he was then dressed very shabbily; he wore a dirty flannel jacket, and had whiskers - I speak to his person generally; if I were to examine him I could speak posilively.</p>
               <p>SUSAN BARNARD. I am a widow, and live in St. John-street, Brick-lane. I have known the prisoner for four years, and worked for him - I attended him in January, for an illness which he caught at his brother's funeral, and Mr. McCabe attended him; his brother was buried on Tuesday, the 11th of January - he had died the 31st of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080121"></xptr>December; I was called to attend the prisoner on the 12th, and I applied seven leeches, and next day seven more - he did not go out till the 15th of February, when he took his own little boy with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know any public-house in shoreditch? A. No; when he went out he was dressed in corded trousers, a blue coat, with gilt buttons, and a black waistcoat.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.Do you know the eating-house where he went to get his meals, when he was well? A. No - I have one other brother, who is apprentice to my uncle; he does not live with us - we have not seen him these three years.</p>

            . My husband is a journeyman cabinet-maker. I know the prisoner - I was sent for to his house the beginning of January; I remember his brother's death, and I made the morning - I took it home about the middle of January; I went two or three days afterwards, to make some alterations, and then Mrs. Haylock wished me to stay and work there, and I was there for a fortnight- I did not see the prisoner - they said he was ill, and the doctor attended him; I saw some gruel there, and I know leeches were fetched on two occasions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am conductor to one of Smith's omnibuses, which runs from Kennington-gate to the Barnsbury Castle, Islington. On Thursday night, 23rd June last, the prisoner got into my omnibus at the corner of White Lion-street, Islington, which is a very unusual thing—he rode about 100 yards up the street, and then said, "Do you go to Hornsey?"—I said, "No, Sir"—he then offered me a shilling in payment—I found it was a bad one—I gave it him back, and then he gave me a good shilling, and I gave him change.</p>

                  </hi>. I am conductor to one of Hughes's Islington omnibuses. On the night of 24th June, about 10 minutes past 8 o'clock, the prisoner got into my omnibus at the Obelisk, in the Blackfriars-road—he got out at Fleet-street—he gave me a bad shilling—I told him it was bad; he said it was not, it was good—I called a policeman and gave him into custody, with the shilling—about a week before that, I was with my omnibus at the Angel at Islington, and saw the prisoner and another man standing together there; the other man pointed to me, and the prisoner came and got into the omnibus—he rode to the Post-office—he then gave me a bad shilling in payment—I detected it, and told him it was bad, and that I thought he had given me one a few days before; and if he came again I should give him in charge—I returned the shilling to him—I am certain it was a bad one—he did not say anything; he gave me a good one, and cut down Cheapside as quick as be could—I am certain the prisoner is the man—I believe him to be the man that got out of my omnibus one day before that at the Obelisk, but I am not certain—he gave me a bad shilling on that occasion.</p>

On Friday evening, 24th June, a little before 9 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and Hawkes having some dispute—I went up to see what was the matter, and Hawkes handed me a shilling, and asked my opinion upon it—it was a bad one—I returned it to him—after the prisoner was gen in charge, I picked up another bad shilling close to the spot where he have been standing—I marked it, and gave it to the constable.</p>

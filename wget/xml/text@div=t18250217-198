            . I am an attorney. On the 19th January, about half-past seven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner, in company with another lad, looking through the window of a house in the Curtain-road - it is a kind of broker's shop - I stopped nearly a quarter of an hour on the opposite side of the way, behind a timber carriage, till about a quarter past eight. I saw their hands repeatedly at the window, as if they were marking the window with their fingers, in the same direction as it was afterwards cut. I suppose they went to the window twenty times; if they saw a person approach, they walked away. I saw another person join them two or three times, but he did not stay with them. About a quarter past eight, I saw the boy who was with the prisoner, go away - he ran up the Curtain-road - I went in pursuit of him, and met the prisoner at the bar standing by an alley, near the shop window - I passed the alley, and then returned, and took the prisoner: I am certain of his person. Taylor had been watching with me; he passed the window two or three times, and had a good opportunity of seeing them. I gave the prisoner to Taylor, and went in pursuit of the other down the alley, but I lost him. I came round to the prosecutor's house, and found the prisoner there, and a number of other persons - he was charged with a robbery, and was endeavouring to conceal his hands. I took hold of his hands, and found one of his fingers cut, and the blood running down his finger - I asked him how it was done; he said, he had cut it with a knife. Some person asked him, where the knife was; he said, he had left it at a public-house, in the opposite corner of the alley.</p>

            . I have heard Gray's evidence; it is all correct. I passed the prisoner several times, and saw him very clearly - I saw him with his hand in the window: I went over to Gray, and told him; a boy then went over and interrupted them. Two of them then made off, and the prisoner went into a court. Mr. Gray took the prisoner, and gave him to me; I took him to the shop: he said, he had cut his hand with a knife, which he had left in the public-house twenty minutes before - he afterwards admitted, that he had cut his finger with the glass.</p>

            . I am a headborough. About half-past eight o'clock on the evening of the 19th of January, I was sent for, and went to the house with the prosecutor. I found the prisoner there with Gray and Taylor. I took him into the parlour, and said, "You have got into a fine mess;" "Yes," he said, "I have; but, if you will not take me to Worship-street, I will take you to where the candlesticks are, and you shall have all the property returned." I then tied his hands, and took him to the watch-house - he then begged very hard to go with me, but I would not let him. I said, if he would tell me the number, I would go - he said, "I know why you won't let me go; you are afraid of a rescue."</p>

            . I am the wife of William Townley. On the 19th of January, I placed a candle and a candlestick upon a fender in the shop window. There were six pairs of brass candlesticks there, beside one odd one, two pairs of snuffers, and two trays: the glass of the window was quite whole at that time. I left the shop, and went down into the kitchen, leaving no one in the shop. I returned about a quarter past seven o'clock, or not quite so late, - I went to snuff the candles, and did not then observe any thing wrong or missing. I heard a knock at the shop door, between eight and a quarter past eight o'clock. I went up, and Mr. Taylor brought the prisoner in, and told me to take charge of him, as he had been robbing my window. He did not say any thing - I went and looked at the window; it was cut in two places: three pair of brass candlesticks were taken out, and an odd one; also one pair of snuffers and one tray: they were my husband's property.</p>

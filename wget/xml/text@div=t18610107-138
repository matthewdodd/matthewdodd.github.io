                  </hi>. I am barman at the Queen's Head, Marsham-street, Westminster—on Saturday, 22d December, between 5 and 6 in the evening, the two prisoners and two other men came in there—one of them called for a pot of porter—the female prisoner paid for it with a good fourpenny piece—the porter was drunk by three of them, and the other one had a glass of ale—they all left in company—they had been gone about half an hour, when Dyer came back alone—she called for half a quartern of gin—I served it—it came to 2 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a bad shilling—I told her it was bad—she said, "I don't think it is, try it in the detector"—I said I was sure it was bad, and asked where she got it—she said, "I might have got it here when I was here before"—I said, "You did not have it here, because you paid me with a fourpenny bit, so that you had no change"—she said, "Give it me back," and I said I would not—she was then going to drink the gin, and I said, "Don't drink the gin, you have not paid for it"—she then said, "I will pay the gin down," and put a farthing on the counter, and picked it up again—she opened her right hand, and I saw another shilling in her hand—upon that I sent for my master, and a policeman was sent for—my master went round the counter to detain her—just after that, and before the policeman came, the other prisoner came into the public-house, and Dyer said, "Here is my husband; let me go and speak to him"—my master said, "If he wants to see you, let him come here"—as the constable came in, I saw the man go up towards the woman—when he did so, she turned round with her back to him, and I noticed her putting her hands behind her—his face was towards her back, and his hand held out—I went between them, and touched the back of the woman's hand, and a glove dropped out from her hand into mine—upon that my master said to the policeman, "Look out, she is passing something to that man behind"—I said, "She has made a mistake, for she has given it to me"—the constable then took her to the station, and I followed with the had shilling, and the glove with something in it—I did not open the glove till I got to the station and then I found sixteen counterfeit shillings and a half-crown in it—they were taken possession of by the constable, and I gave him the had shilling I bad taken from the female prisoner—the male prisoner came to the station while I was there—I heard the inspector say to him, "What relation are you to this woman?"—he said, "She is my wife"—he was then detained—I have no doubt of his being the man who was in the public-house.</p>

I was sent for to the Queen's Head on 22d December—I found both of the prisoners there—the man was on the left of the woman, a little behind her—she had her back to him—he was facing her back, and I saw her put her left hand behind her with something in it, and I saw the man's arm go behind her, but could not see his hand—I saw his arm move, and saw something dark in the woman's hand—the landlord shouted out, "She is putting something behind her," and Lesson shouted out, "I have got it," or something like that, and held up a glove—I took the woman to the station—the man came there in about a quarter of an hour—I heard him say the woman was his wife—this is the glove with the sixteen shillings and a counterfeit half-crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found ten of the shillings wrapped up in separate pieces of paper, and six more wrapped up in another long piece of paper separately—the half-crown was wrapped up in a paper by itself—this is the bad shilling that was given to me by Lesson (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—after the male prisoner said that the woman was his wife, the inspector ordered him to be detained, and directed me to lock him up—while I was locking him up he denied all knowledge of the woman, and said he had not been at the Queen's Head—I said he was the man I did see there—I searched him and found a florin, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, all good money—2 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on the woman.</p>

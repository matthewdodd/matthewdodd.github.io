             sworn. - Q. Do you live near the prosecutor? - A. Almost opposite: On the 28th of July, between six and seven o'clock, I was going up stairs, I looked out of the window, I saw two men at the gate trying to open it, and one said to the other, cannot you open it, and the other presently said, hang it, it is broke; in about ten minutes after I looked through the window again, I saw the prisoner at the bar, (he was one of the two men I had seen before,) he was then by himself, leaning on his arm, looking over his left shoulder, at the one pair of stairs window in Nichols's house; the window was open, and when he saw me he drew back; I made no alarm, not knowing the family were out. About four o'clock I was going for a pint of beer, I saw the prisoner at the bar and another man walking together up and down the street before Nichols's gate; I saw them as I went for the beer, and as I came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a person that you had ever seen before? - A. No, I never saw him before that day; I am positive I saw him in the house, and I am positive that he is the person I saw walking with the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Nichols when he came home, or did you afterwards see the gate open? - A. I saw a crowd about the house, and the alarm was given that the house had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoner again? - A. On the next day, when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. At the first time you saw, or you supposed you saw, the prisoner, his back was towards you - was it not? - A. Yes, his back was towards me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that when you were going for the beer? - A. The first time I saw him was when I was going for the beer, I saw his face then perfectly, that was about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When you saw him at the gate, his back was towards you? - A. Yes, but he turned his face about.</p>
               <p>Q. To give you an opportunity of knowing him - have you heard any thing like a reward, and that you will be entitled to a share if this person is convicted? - A. No, I never heard of a reward.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day Mr. Nichols's house was broke open, and whether you had been by that house in the course of the afternoon? - A. Yes, I passed it between five and six in the afternoon; I spoke to Mrs. Nichols and her husband before they went out. In the course of an hour I passed the house again, I saw then two young men standing at the gate, one something shorter than the other, they were trying to open the padlock at the gate.</p>

In the evening I went to the Belvidere, there I saw the prisoner at the bar in the bowling-green, and a person of the name of Gale was with him; Goodall, who is a witness, said, that is the man I saw in the street; when he saw me, he walked out, and when he got to a turning that goes to White Conduit House, he walked as fast as he could, and seeing Stanton come up to me, he ran into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180015"></xptr>fields; we pursued, and took him; Stanton knows no more than I do.</p>

When they had robbed me, they went out, and I went home. I went to Payne the constable, and he desired me to come to him at ten the next morning; I did, and we went to the house and saw five or six women sitting; Payne asked me if I knew any of them; I said no, only one, which was the woman who had the knife. Payne locked the door, and went up stairs, where he found the two prisoners, one in bed, and the other standing by the door; I told him the woman that stood by the door was one of them; he made the other get up, and when I saw her, I told him that was the other, and we secured them. When we came down, the other had made her escape out of the window.</p>

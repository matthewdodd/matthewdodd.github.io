                  </hi>. I am a cow keeper, of West-street, Hackney, and am in the habit of sending Neale, who was in my service, to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael O'Brien, and daughter of Mrs. Ann Eagle, a cow keeper. I lodge with her, and partially manage the business—I was in the habit of receiving grains brought by Mr. Strong's man—we always paid for three quarters, between Christmas and March—on 19th March I paid Neale 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for grains left on the 14th—he gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has no date—I have other receipts for other weeks, but some have been destroyed—they were always for three quarters—it was Crampton's duty, when the grains were delivered, to help to unload them, and to see that the proper quantity was delivered—on 14th March I asked Crampton how many grains there were—he said, "Three quarters"—I said, "How many does the cart hold?—he said, "Six"—I said, "I thought there were more in the cart than were taken out"—he said, "The man would rather give a shovelful or two more than less"—Crampton ordered the grains—he used to say, "We are going to have some grains in the morning;" and the last time I told Neale to leave three quarters, because I knew that there had been only two left—this was not in Cramp<lb></lb>ton's presence.</p>

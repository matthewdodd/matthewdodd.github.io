But however, I began to struggle with him; upon which Sanford left my Wife, and made an Offer to fire at me, but his Pistol would not go of; which so enraged him, that he broke it with beating me about the Head. By this Usage, I received so many Wounds, that I bled as much as two Horses. In the mean time my Maid ran away, and alarmed the Neighbourhood; and Sanford perceiving she was gone, he jumpt over a Bank and got off. I still had hold of Little; but in the Struggle he unbuttoned his Coat and Wastecoat, slipt himself out of them, and ran in his Shirt after Sanford. This is the Coat and Wastecoat that he left in my Hands; they are both very bloody, for I threw 'em over my Head to keep off the Cold. This was corroborated by his Wife and Maid. Little going Home that Night to his Father, and being without his Coat, some Words passed betwixt them; and he began to abuse his Father very grosly, for which he was sent to Bridewell; where, by the Rumour of having lost his Coat, he was quickly found out by the Prosecutor. But in regard that he has given Information of several Robberies, he was not now try'd for the other Facts in which he was concerned with Sanford.

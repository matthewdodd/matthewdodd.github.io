               <p>The prisoner at the bar brought me a pair of gold China pheasants, on Wednesday morning the 4th of March; I live on Holborn-Hill; I buy and sell birds; he said, that the person they belonged to, would not take less than 30 s. for them, he said they was not his, he was selling them for a person; I asked him to let me look at them, he took one out of one side of his great-coat pocket, and the other out of the other; I said, you have not come honestly by these birds, and I will take you to the Compter; he was had up three times, and no person appearing, he was discharged; some time afterwards Mr. Jervois's servant came and owned the birds, and I informed the officer, and he was taken into custody; the hen pheasant died.</p>

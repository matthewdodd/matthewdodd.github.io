About 1.30 a.m. on 2nd June I was on duty at Hamilton Terrace, and saw the two prisoners jump over a wall in front of No. 84—I went towards them, and on seeing me they ran off towards Hall Road—I sprang my rattle and pursued them, and met them being brought back by two constables—on the way to the station I saw Leftwich drop these two jackets, and Doughty this waterproof—I saw these two waterproofs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) taken off Doughty at the station.</p>

Early on 3rd January I was on duty, heard a rattle spring, and saw the two prisoners running—I stopped them, and asked them what they were running for—seeing that they were exhausted and out of breath we took them both in custody, and then met Mossman—Leftwich threw himself down—I searched him at the station; he was wearing these two waterproof coats under his coat, and this ring on his finger.</p>

I was with Curtis, and assisted in stopping the prisoners—I saw this waterproof taken off Leftwich—I then went to Hamilton Terrace, and in the area of No. 34 I found this third waterproof lying outside the window, and an iron bar close by the door-step—I examined, and found that it fitted the socket of the window-sill from which it had been wrenched—the window was open—there had been two bars, but one was gone—I saw Leftwich searched and two waterproofs taken from him—I was present when Doughty was searched; he also was wearing two waterproofs under his coat.</p>

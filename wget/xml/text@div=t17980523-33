               <p>Q. You cannot swear positively to them? - A. Yes, I can; by their being my own manufacture, and by the make and shape of them; and there were some pieces that were broke from what was left in the cask, which tallied exactly; the moment I saw it, I said, this comes out of such a cask; we have lost a great deal of late. The prisoner has lived with me, I believe, near twelve months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You manufacture yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a very considerable manufactory? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a partner, I believe, in the business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at home when you went to his lodgings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were his lodgings? - A. The officer and my foreman can tell more about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got those other pieces, that you say tallied with these? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it possible for a man to swear to one piece of pearl-ash for another, merely because it happens to tally? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You send a great quantity of pearl-ash about town? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am foreman to Mr. Kent's factory: I had some reason to believe my master was robbed; I missed a great deal of pearl-ash; I have frequently seen my master's property in the prisoner's pocket; when I have not seen it, I have seen his pockets loaded; I was afraid to take him, there being three men together, going out to breakfast; I was afraid of being knocked down; I told my master of it, and he got a search-warrant, and went to the prisoner's house.</p>

             sworn. - On the 17th of this month, Mr. Kent came to the Shadwell-office, and got a warrant; I went to the prisoner's house, and was directed to the upper story, I went up, and there was a woman there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner acknowledge that they were his lodgings? - A. He told me they were; in the afternoon, after he was in custody, in that room, I found this property, this bag was lying in the room, and this pearl-ash, in this cloth, lying on the bag, (produces them); I asked his wife to open a trunk, and she gave me the key out of her pocket, I found nothing else; I took the prisoner in the evening working at a rope-ground, at Stepney; I took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Kent.) Was not he in your service at that time? - A. In the morning he was, but had absented.</p>
               <p>Rogers. The prisoner said, that the former foreman had given him little quantities of pearl-ash for his own use, and he thought he had a right to take them, because the other foreman had given them to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. He said, the apartments you were at were his? - A. Yes; I pointed out the garrets and asked if they were his; and he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say whether he had apartments in the house, or that the apartments you were in were his? - A. He said, the garrets, were his; the doors were both open.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other lodgers in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, he thought he had a right to take some, because the former foreman had permitted it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him, did you not tell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230028"></xptr>him it was a trifling thing, and he had better tell the truth? - A. By no means, I would not say such a thing.</p>

             sworn. - I was with Rogers, that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Silverwood.) Look at these pearl-ashes, can you undertake to swear that those are part of Mr. Kent's property? - A. It is impossible, the air has taken them; I could have sworn to them at the time that they came out of a Russia butt that held about eleven hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that the ashes brought from the prisoner's to Mr. Kent's were his ashes? - A. I have no doubt of it; when I put them together they tallied exactly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kent. The officer was present when they were compared.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Rogers.) Did you see them compared? - A. Yes; Mr. Kent put them together, and they seemed to match exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have lived with Mr. Kent about six months; a fellow-servant told me it was very common for the men to have a little pearl-ash for their own use; Mr. Silverwood and I have had words several times; those were not my lodgings that these ashes were found in.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Kent.) Q. Did you ever give them leave to take any little quantity for their own use? - A. Never in my life.</p>

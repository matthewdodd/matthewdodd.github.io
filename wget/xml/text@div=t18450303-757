                  </hi>. I was one of the turnkeys of the House of Correction, at Little Ilford, on the 19th of Oct. last—the prisoner was in the infirmary of the prison—I saw him there as late as five o'clock on the afternoon of the 19th of Oct.—the iron gales of the infirmary yard were locked—I cannot speak to the outer door of the infirmary—the infirmary is part of the prison, with a yard attached to it—the gate and wall is intended to secure persons from getting out—I never saw the prisoner out of prison.</p>

I am governor of the House of Correction at Little Ilford, Essex—the prisoner was in my charge there—I produce a certifi<lb></lb>cate, under the Statute, of the conviction of the prisoner—I got it from Mr. Clark's office—the prisoner was introduced to our prison under the sentence referred to in that certificate—I have here the order which states that he was to be kept there for six months—he had been ill and was removed into the infirmary—on the 19th of Oct., about nine o'clock at night, I went into the infirmary and missed the prisoner—I did not see him again</p>

               <p>till the 17th of Feb., when I saw him in Whitechapel—on seeing me he ran away—I pursued him, apprehended him, and took him back—his term of imprisonment would have expired on the 18th of Feb.—his jacket was produced to me afterwards—I do not know where it was found—the prison dress was sent back to me in a hamper by the railroad—(<hi rend="italic">the certi<lb></lb>ficate being read stated that Lawrence Phillips and John Fell were convicted on</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th Aug.</hi>, 8<hi rend="italic">th Vict., of larceny from the person, and sentenced to be confined six months</hi>)—the infirmary gate was not found open—it was locked—I saw some scratches on the corner of the wall.</p>

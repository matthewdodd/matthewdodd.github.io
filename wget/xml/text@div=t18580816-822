                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Williams, who keeps the Crown public-house in Kent-street, Southwark—on Thursday, 8th July, between 1 and 2 o'clock, the prisoner came into our house with two other women—they called for a quartern of gin—one of them put down a shilling; I cannot say which—I served the gin, and gave 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—the prisoner took it up—I put the shilling in the till; there was no other shilling there at the time—I did not try the shilling; my husband did with his fingers, and found it was a bad one—he put it into a wine-glass, where it remained till the Saturday morning, and then I gave it to the constable—I saw the prisoner the next day, Friday, at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—when she came in I recognised her directly—she was alone—she called for 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin—I know her by her asking for a pin—she tendered a new shilling; I took it up and felt it with my fingers; it was a bad one—she asked me for a little beer—I said, "Do you know what you gave me?"—she said, "Yes, a new shilling"—I said, "You shall have your change when my husband comes in"—she said, "All right"—I said, "You were here yesterday"—she said, "Yes, I was"—I said, "You know what you gave me then?"—she said she gave me nothing—then I called my husband—she remained 3 or 4 minutes—she only sipped the gin.</p>

On the 3rd of May, about a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner take a book from a kind of shelf in front of my father's shop - he ran across the road, and turned down Gray's Inn-lane; I told our shopman, who went after him.</p>

I went to Mrs. Bligh's house with the shopman, but we could not find the prisoner; I went into the yard, and saw some glass and mortar had been broken off - I went into the adjoining yard, and found the prisoner in a privy; I afterwards went and got this book from near the top of the bed at Mrs. Bligh's - he said before the Magistrate that he had been out of employ five months, and distress drove him to do it; it was the first time, and should be the last.</p>

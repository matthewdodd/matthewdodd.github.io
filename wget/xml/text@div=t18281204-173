On the 8th of November, I had twelve bobbins of silk, a handkerchief, and some money, all tied up in a bundle; I was coming from the warehouse with it under my arm, about eight o'clock in the evening, and it was drawn from me; I was rather fresh - my master was out, and I had been drinking; the prisoner picked me up, and took me to the White Horse public-house, and, having been drinking a little, I lay my head down, and went to sleep - when I awoke. I missed my bundle; she and the bundle were gone - I suppose I slept three hours; I went there about eight o'clock, and came away about eleven or twelve.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met him in Shoreditch; there was a mob round him, I went to see what was the matter, and this man had fallen down and cut his face, and his master's silk was one way, and the money the other; he said he lived in Globefields and said, "My good woman, I wish you would see me to the White Horse public-house, in Wheeler-street, my wife is there." Witness. I had fallen down, but my property was all tied in a bag; she told the people she was my wife - I did not open my things.</p>

            . I am a weaver. I saw the prosecutor and prisoner come into the public-house that evening; the prisoner called for a quartern of gin, and the prosecutor desired her to pay for it out of his handkerchief, which she did; I cannot say whether the prosecutor drank any or not - in a few minutes, I saw him lying on the table, fast asleep; I saw the prisoner afterwards pull the bundle of shute and money from under his arm - she took the silver from among the copper and kept it in her hand, and left the copper in the handkerchief; she afterwards went out, brought in the quartern of gin, and took the copper to pay for it - I went away in a few minutes.</p>

I did not pay for a pint of beer at all - the man paid for it, out of the handkerchief; I paid for the quartern of gin with my own money - when I took the bundle, I put it down by his side; I met him on the Sunday morning again, and said, "Good morning, how did you get home;" I then met his wife, and she said,"Can you make up any money for my husband's loss?" I said, "What do you mean? I cannot make it up" - she said, "If you do not make me up some money, I must put you in the watch-house;" when I was in the watch-house, I heard the man had got his property, and that the landlord had made him a present of 5s. - the Magistrate said I had better come before a Jury of gentlemen, to have myself righted, for what one could not swear another could.</p>

I saw him thrown down and stopped - I did not see the things taken from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Were you not intoxicated? A. I was not so drunk but I could see what I was about. I was walking steadily home; I had been at a public-house, where I had a bottle of wine, a glass of brandy, and one glass of brandy and water, of which three of us drank; we came out of the house about eleven o'clock, and my companions went up Holborn, and left me; we were not turned out of the house - there was no disturbance; some of the party sung, but I was unacquainted with them. I was robbed just by the house; there were several persons passing, and I might have spoken to some of them - when I came out I did not go to a cook-shop door with those persons - if I was at the door they might have come up to me, but I did not notice that there was a cook-shop; I cannot undertake to say I had not lost them before - I did not take notice of any persons near me, but I was pushed against another man. I am quite certain I ran after the right person with my chain - I had seen him in the public-house, and knew his features well - I was not in company with him; I did not know the prisoner was near me; I might have spoken to him in the house, but not afterwards. I did not speak to him and two or three other persons in the street, before I was robbed. I do not recollect calling at a cook-shop - I will not swear I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you mention before the Magistrate that the person who took it had been in the public-house? A. I believe not - I was not asked the question. I had not known him before he was in the public-house; he had sung a song there.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 3d of May I was on duty in Cow-cross-street, between eleven and twelve o'clock; I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running - he passed me, and was stopped in Cow-cross, by two young men, who were standing near Sharp's alley; they threw him on the ground. While I was taking him to the watch-house I saw the prosecutor. I found these seals about an hour afterwards, on the spot where the prisoner was when he was on the ground - no other persons were there but those who threw him down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there not a general confusion, and a great many people running? A. There were some other persons there. I do not know the two men who stopped the prisoner - I was very near him when he was stopped. The prosecutor was not perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say there was a general confusion and several people? A. Yes. I saw the prosecutor running after the prisoner, but the prisoner was first - I am quite sure he was before any other person.</p>

            . Between eleven and twelve o'clock on the night in question, I went to the cook-shop for 1 1/2lb. of beef sausages - there were ten or twelve persons there; some of them were very respectable - the prosecutor was one; when I came out I saw him and some others pass me; I turned my head, and saw the prisoner was one; there was a great shout and noise. I turned round by the oyster-shop - the prosecutor ran up against me, and nearly knocked me down - he sang out Stop thief! I saw the prisoner there, running, and several persons cried Stop thief! I took no notice of them, and they dispersed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prosecutor in the cook-shop? A. Certainly I did; there were several persons in company - I cannot say how many; the prosecutor was there when I went in, and staid about two minutes; there were a number of persons running all ways - they appeared in sport.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were they all laughing together at the time the cry of Stop thief! was raised? A. Yes - the prosecutor did not say, in my presence, that he had lost his watch chain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came out of the house - it was late, and I was in a hurry; there were a great many persons on the stones; I ran down Cow-cross, because I thought the door would be shut - there was a cry of Stop thief! and two gentlemen came and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

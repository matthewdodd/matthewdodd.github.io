There were two one-pound bank notes, and my pension-ticket; he moved it from the bottom of my pocket to the top, to take it away; I seized the pocket-book in one hand, and him in the other. He had hold of the pocket-book in one of his hands when I seized him. I had got hold of him; he struck me; I cried out watch. Three men immediately rushed upon me, to endeavour to rescue him from my hold; this they could not do. I gave the prisoner into the hands of

            . I heard the cry of watch, this Saturday night; I came up to where the prosecutor and the prisoner was; the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner. He gave him into my charge; I took him into custody to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Saturday night that this happened, I had been to the Play with my sister, before the Play was quite over, I left her to go home, I was going to meet a young woman. Going through Wellclose-square, three or four men were wrestling one with another, this gentleman was among them; there was another gentleman looking on, as well as me; he turned round to me, and said, you are one of them; he laid hold of me, and I laid hold of him, the same as he did me; I said, do not tear my clothes. Mr. Jackson came up, and asked the charge; he said, two or three men had assaulted him, this was one of them that tried to get the bundle out of my hand; he never mentioned his pocketbook. A gentleman came into the watchhouse; Mr. Jackson asked him what he had to say; he said, he had seen the whole of it. Mr. Jackson said, I believe you are concerned with this party; no, said the man, I am not; he gave Mr. Jackson his address. Jackson gave me no address. As soon as I said he was no good, but a pick-pocket, he walked out. I am innocent of this affair.</p>

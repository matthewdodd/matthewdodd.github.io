I live at 33, Little Camera Street, Chelsea—I am married—the prisoner Strickland is related to me—I know Emmerson, who is a single woman, by her living with us—she brought the child when it was five weeks' old and suckled it nearly three months, and afterwards it was fed from a bottle—she used to go out to work about half-past in the morning, and return about the same time at night, and during that time Strickland minded the baby—last summer I took the child to St. George's Hospital, and the doctor examined it—there was something the matter with its person, and he gave me some violet powder and I was told that I need not bring it again—on the Sunday before taking the child to Dr. Bonney, Mrs. Strickland said to me, "Look at Erny's arm"—I did so, and said I thought an abscess was forming; that was the first time I noticed anything about the arm—my sister and I then took the child to Dr. Erskine—the baby had sores coming over him—I only went once—I don't know how many times Strickland went with it to him—the child got better—it was very delicate and small.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 320, King's Road, Chelsea, and am a registered medical practitioner—on Monday, 23rd February, the prisoner Emmerson brought her child to the dispensary—she directed my attention to its right arm; I examined it and found the bone in the middle of the upper right arm was broken—she said she did not know it was broken—I think some days afterwards I looked at the other arm, the child was in a state of great emaciation—the skin of its thighs had a bluish appearance as though it had recently been raw, the same with its buttocks down to the knees—I examined the child, thinking that the excoriation had arisen from disease—I told the mother that it was brought about by neglect and not by disease of any kind—to the best of my recollection, she said it was well cared for—I said that I thought so seriously of it that if the child died I should direct the Coroner's attention to the matter—I can<lb></lb>not call to mind whether she made any answer to that—the skin of the child was in folds from the rapidity of the emaciation—I put the arm in splints, gave the mother a powder, and told her to take it home—I first sent for the relieving officer, Mr. Faryon, and spoke to him about it—I told the woman to bring the child every fine day, and she did so, with the excep<lb></lb>tion of two or three days—the child improved, I should say it increased in weight—I did not notice any bronchial affection—I think I saw that it was running at the nose—it died on the night of 15th March—I had seen it that morning and found out in the mean time that the left fore arm had been broken—I spoke to her about it and she told me she did not know there was anything wrong with it—when I first saw the child it required great care and attention, it wanted proper feeding and nursing—as far as I</p>

               <p>could judge that was the cause of the state it was in—the emaciation was not to be accounted for by any disease—that was the opinion I formed at the time—I made a post-mortem examination on the 18th the morning of the inquest—I examined the right arm, that was still un-united; the fracture had existed some weeks—the left fore-arm I cut down upon the bone in order to discover the reason of the deformity, which was quite apparent—I found that the radius had been broken at that point, and had healed in that distorted manner; that might have been ruptured five or six months and never properly set—I examined the lungs, there was no disease except congestion of the lower portion of both lungs, evidently recent—there was no tubercle—there was no food in the stomach—there was mucus in the bronchial tubes—one or two of the mesenteric glands were slightly enlarged, but not sufficient to account for the wasted state of the body—I could not see any fat in the body—the external appearance I should say was that of a well-formed child—there was no enlargement at the end of the bones which characterizes a scrofulous child; the uninjured limbs were straight, I they would not have been if it had been naturally a scrofulous child—I can only conclude that death arose from want of proper food, there was no disease that I could see.</p>

The fracture of the hummers might be caused by a child falling out of bed—the usual way of a child getting a fracture is by being taken hurriedly up by the arm—I could not say that I saw the child half a dozen times before I noticed anything the matter with its left arm; it could use it—I saw its arm uncovered, and the fracture was perceptible at once—I have been in Court this morning, and heard that it was taken to the hospital suffering from disease of the parts—that is a disease very uncommon in a child of such tender years—disease of the urinary organs is almost unknown amongst children—excoriation of the buttocks is a sign of neglect—I saw no disease of the lungs or any bronchial affection about the child when I first saw it—I told the Corner that there was slight bronchial catarrh; that was the result of cold in the head—there was mucus in the bronchial tubes—the immediate cause of death was pneumonia, congestion of the lungs—that might be caused by cold—east winds are likely to give cold—east winds did prevail for a few days about that period—a child suffering from congestion of the lungs would be pre<lb></lb>disposed to another and more serious attack—it would not tend to emaciate the child; it would not affect the nutrition of the body—I have heard this child described as always weakly and delicate, and one that did not thrive on its food, but it certainly increased in size during the three weeks it was under the care of the relieving officer.</p>

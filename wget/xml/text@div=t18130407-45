               <p>Q. When was it you lost the property - A. On the 26th of February last, about nine o'clock. The said warehouse, No. 45, Little Moorfields, was forcibly broken open. On the outside was a strong staple padlock that was forced by a crow, I suppose, or by an instrument of that description.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the padlock fastened - A. About an hour and a half before it was done; when we shut up. Two packages were stolen, one package contained ninety-five pieces of cambric muslin, and the other bale contained ten pieces of woollen cloth. The muslin was worth sixty pounds, and the other twenty pounds and upwards. I have never found any of the property.</p>

            . On the 26th of February, just before nine, I went down Little Moorfields. I saw a parcel come out of Mr. Dawson's warehouse, and the prisoner crossed over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the package - A. No. He asked me the way to Fore-street. He took hold of my head, and turned my head towards Fore-street. I shewed him the way to Fore-street. He took hold of my head, and turned my head towards Fore-street. I could not see which way the package went.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a package was it - A. A large package.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was carrying of it - A. I don't know. I could not see the man's face that was carrying it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the package came out of Mr. Dawson's warehouse where was the prisoner - A. He crossed over from the warehouse to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether he came out of the warehouse or not - A. No, I did not. He came right from the warehouse to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner alone - A.There were seven or eight men altogether. They appeared to be in company together. I only saw one package.</p>
               <p>Q. When he turned your head towards Fore-street did you go towards Fore-street - A. No; I crossed the way to go to the engineers.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he leave you - A. As soon as ever the package was gone out of my sight, and then I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070035"></xptr>went into the engineers, and when I came out I saw nobody. The prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MINCHIN. I am engineer to Mr. Dawson. My house is 45, Little Moorfields. I saw the prisoner two nights prior to the robbery walking to and fro before my house in Little Moorfields. I took particular notice of his person. I saw him between eight and nine at night. I am sure he is the man.</p>

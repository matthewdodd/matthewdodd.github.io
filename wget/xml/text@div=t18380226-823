On the after<lb></lb>noon of the 14th of February I was in the tap-room—the prisoner came in—there was another soldier there—I saw the prisoner carry a bundle out under his arm—upon that I rose up, and saw my shoes were gone—I had put them in one corner of the tap-room—I spoke to the policeman in con<lb></lb>sequence, and he took the prisoner—these are my shoes—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I can swear to them—I saw them in the handkerchief which the prisoner was carrying—the prisoner said he gave a pot of beer for them.</p>

I was at the Red Lion and saw the prisoner and another soldier there—I saw these shoes in a handkerchief which the prisoner was carrying under his arm when he was taken—it was a light coloured handkerchief that the prisoner carried out of the house, and the shoes were found in a light coloured handkerchief—it appeared to me to be the same.</p>

               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">SENT</hi>. I am a sergeant of the Coldstream Guards. The prisoner was on parade at four o'clock on the 14th of February, and quitted from ten minutes to a quarter past four o'clock—the parade was at St. George's barracks, Charing-cross, not a quarter of a mile from the Red Lion in Jennyn-street—it takes us every night from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour to dismiss—there would be no difficulty in the prisoner being at Jermyn-street at a quarter past four o'clock—I have known the prisoner about five years—his character has been exceedingly good in the regiment—he was never under any charge of dishonesty.</p>

I have known the prisoner some time - we had lived together on board ship, twelve months ago last December; I met her at a public-house on the 27th of March, and went with her to <placeName id="t18310407-147-crimeloc816">No. 1, Elbow-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. You had known her some time? A. Yes, and was on friendly terms - I think she did say before we went to bed, that she wanted to go out to get something for Sunday; I was not perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WHEELER. I am an officer. The prosecutor said he had been robbed - I told him to stand at the door; I then went up and found the watch, in the drawer in the prisoner's room where the prosecutor had been - I met the prisoner coming home in the morning; I asked what money she had - she said none, and seemed all in a tremble; when she saw the prosecutor she said, "Mr. Wardell, you don't think I mean to rob you;" when she got home she gave me the sovereign and a half out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She was coming home when you met her? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not take it with the intention of robbing him - I went to get some tea and sugar; I got a drop of ale, and fell asleep.</p>

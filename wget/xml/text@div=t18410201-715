                  </hi>. I am single, and out of a situation—I live with my aunt in North-street, Whitechapel. On the 18th of January, I went to the Mechanics' Institution, in Circus-street, Marylebone, about ten o'clock in the evening—I took off my cloak, and placed it on a bench near my side—the prisoner was near me—I missed it shortly after—I told the landlady—she asked the prisoner to bring back the cloak that she had taken away—the prisoner said she had seen no cloak, and knew nothing of it.</p>

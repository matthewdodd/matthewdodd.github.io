                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, in partnership with James M'Gill, at No. 1, Bread-street, Cheapside, in the dwelling-house of Mr. Thomas Nutting. On the 10th of June, about half-past one o'clock, I saw Runxtmann and Loenthall at our warehouse, which is on the first floor—they inquired the price of various goods there, silk goods chiefly—Loenthall spoke to me as well as he could in English, and said it was difficult to buy a large parcel of goods, not understanding the English—he said he had got a carpenter at home who spoke English and German well, but he was sick—he laid his head on his hand and made all manner of motions—I showed him the commoner sort of goods—he objected to them as not being good, and required them to be weighed, and the boy was sent down into the shop to weigh them—he then inquired the length and breadth of the goods—he gave me his address, and I wrote it down, and required him to write his name himself—he told me his name, but I could not understand what he meant—he agreed about the discount, and kept me in conversation along time, during which Runxtmann went down stairs—when Loenthall went, I put on my hat and followed him—when I got out I saw Loenthall going up Bread-street to Cheapside—I then saw him cross and join Guttschalk, about seventy feet from the warehouse—they walked towards Lawrence-lane—Runxtmann crossed over and joined the other two—they had some conversation at the corner of Trump-street—by the time I got to the corner of Trump-street, they had got down King-street, and were on the cab-stand—Runxtmann got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and Loenthall went up King-street towards Cheapside—at that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184406100168"></xptr>
               <p>moment a policeman was passing—(I had lost sight of Guttschalk then)—I told the policeman to stop the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, as I believed there was a man in it who had robbed me—I went after Loenthall to Ironmonger-lane, and stopped him—I rubbed my hands down his pockets and about him—he exclaimed, "Me no thief"—I did not detain him—I followed the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and saw the policeman had stopped it—I went up and told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to drive to the station—the policeman and Runxtmann were in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I got on the box, and saw Runxt<lb></lb>mann turning these goods out of his pocket on his right-hand side, as the policeman sat on his left—these are gentlemen's silk handkerchiefs—they were on our counter the moment before the prisoners came in—we had only had three dozen of them in, about two hours before—I went to the sta<lb></lb>tion, and saw Runxtmann searched—I saw a piece of paper taken from him, on which was an address written in pencil—we went first to an address which Loenthall had given me, in Osborn-street, Whitechapel, and no such person was known there—we then went to the address which was found on Runxt<lb></lb>mann, at No. 5, William-street, Cannon-street-road, St. George's—when we got there I saw Loenthall coming round the corner of the street, and, of course, I seized him—he had got a large bag with him, as much as he could drag—I gave him in charge to the policeman, and we took him to the same station where Runxtmann was—I gave a description of Guttschalk, and at eleven o'clock at night I saw him at the station—he asked if I knew him before—I said no, I did not—he said, "I will prove to you that you do know me; I have been to your warehouse to sell pens"—I said I thought that accounted for how the other prisoners found out our warehouse—he said he had met these prisoners; that they came with a recommendation from Hamburg, and he bad introduced them to different places, that it was not likely that he should in<lb></lb>produce them to persons who had been customers to him, and who knew him, if he thought anything wrong of them; and be likewise said he could prove he was at home at his dinner at half past one that day.</p>

            . I am a labourer. About nine o'clock at night on the 18th of May, I saw two men pass me, they were together; they turned down Artillery-place-one of them gave some clothes to the other-the prisoner is the man that received them. I followed him, and went in front of him - He dropped several of them. I called him, and told him he had not come honestly by them; he said he had received them from his brother. I told him his brother might have tied them up better. He then threw them down, and said I might have them if I had a better right to them than him; another man said he would hold him while I got a constable-when I returned he was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I first saw him about two hundred and fifty yards from the house. Artillery-place is a thoroughfare. The things were in his hand - He dropped the curtain.</p>

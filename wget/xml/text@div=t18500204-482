                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Irwin; we keep a general shop at Woolwich. On 22nd Jan., about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, who is a private artilleryman, came into my shop—he asked for half-an-ounce of tobacco—he put down a penny and a halfpenny—I said it was another farthing—he then asked me if there was a lion on a shilling—I said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185002040075"></xptr>
               <p>I never took notice—he asked me to look, as he had laid a wager about it—I took out my silver in my hand—he put his hand in nine, and said, "There is one, there is one"—my money seemed to get less, and I thought he had robbed me, and asked him to open his hand, and a sixpence dropped from it—he then said, "I want the change for my shilling"—I said he gave me no shilling, he gave me a penny and a halfpenny—he said he did, and he would fetch a policeman—he ran out; I and my little boy followed him; he kept putting his hand to the back of his collar—I lost sight of him—he was afterwards brought back by a policeman—I counted my money after<lb></lb>wards, and one shilling and two sixpences were gone from it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The sixpence in my hand was the sixpence you gave me in part of my change; it would be a very curious thing if I could take a sixpence out of your hand, and you not see it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You said you would give me your watch to compromise the matter.</p>

I saw the prisoner running; some yards behind him a boy was calling, "Stop thief!"—the prisoner turned down an alley—I searched about the place, and could find nobody—at last I found a back-door open—I called, and a woman came with a light—I found the prisoner crouched down in a corner—I told him to come out, and told him what the boy had told me—he said I was a liar—he kicked at me, and called me all the names he could think of—he was taken into custody; I asked if he had any money—he said, "No"—when he was searched a sixpence fell from his stock.</p>

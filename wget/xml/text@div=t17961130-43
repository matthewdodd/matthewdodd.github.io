            , patrols, as a suspicious person; I searched him, and took out of his pockets, three pint pots, and two quart pots, I believed they were the property of Mr. Rickson, and I told the patrol to go to Mr. Rickson in the morning. (Produces the pots).</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Rickson's name on them? - A. Yes; I kept the prisoner in custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are all mine, my name is in full length on one of them, the others I know by my cypher, I have no doubt about their being mine.</p>
               <p>MARMADUKE MILLER sworn. - Thomas Pack and I apprehended the prisoner, by hearing the pots rattle in his pocket, as he passed by at the end of Conduit-street, in Bond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Carnaby street? - A. About 400 yards; it was about a quarter or twenty minutes after two o'clock in the morning, we followed him, and took hold of him, and asked him what he had got in his pockets, he said, nothing; I took hold of his left side pockets, and gave his coat a shake, and pots rattled, which convinced us, that he had in his pocket something which he should not have.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Rickson.) Q. You told us the prisoner came into your house between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, how long did he stay? - A. Till between ten and twelve, or it might be something past twelve, but I don't exactly know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the pots right the morning before? - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in the prosecutor's house about ten o'clock, I called for a pot of porter in the tap-room, I left a soldier about half to drink, I enquired what noise was in the parlour, they told me a club, I said, of what cast, they said, shoe-makers and mechanics, I said, if it is no harm to go in, I will go; they asked me to sit down, I called for a pipe of tobacco, which was granted me, they asked me to introduce a song, which I did, I staid there in company with them; I saw several pots under the seats, but did not take any notice of them; Rickson's house was the last house I was in; the door was fastened, I asked them to let me out; going along the street, these men came up to me; (if I was guilty, I should have endeavoured to run away); they asked me what I had got in my pocket, I said, rather saucily, what is that to you; they said, you have pots in your pocket, they shook my pocket, and the pots sell out; I don't know who put the pots in my pocket, if I had been guilty of any thing like that, I should never have lived where I have, in many gentlemen's houses; I have been trusted with chests of plate; I have been in the public line myself, my friends keep a brewery in Northampton, I have been keeping the house for them, and came up to London again to stay a little while.</p>

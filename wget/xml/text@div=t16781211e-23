            , who also was by, swore, That Watson, when he came in, run him down into a Chair, and the other run him through. That Russel came in with his Sword drawn, and they were heard from without to swear, they would kill any one that opposed them. Stephens, a Chirurgeon, proved, that he died of the wound.</p>
               <p>Russel the Prisoner, in his defence, said, That the Plaintiff in the Action calling them up stairs, told them, they must look to themselves, for there was a Young man intended to kill them. That upon their coming in, the Young man made at them with a bright thing, like a Spit or a Sword; and in his own defence, he retreating back, doth not know how the Boy was wounded.</p>
               <p>Watson for himself said, That being ordered by the Plaintiff to Arrest Dorothy Midgley, when he came to the door, he heard the Boy say, I will run my Spit in some of your guts; but putting him aside, he Arrested his Prisoner, and heard some body cry out, I am killed; upon which he run to him, and opening his breast, there he found a great wound, and gave him some Brandy to drink, and covered him with a warm Napkin. That the Defendant Midgley came to him, and cut him over the face with a Pot, and asked him what he staid there for, he had been the death of her Mother and her Brother. That about five years ago he had arrested her Mother and she died in Execution; but he denied any hand in this Murder.</p>
               <p>The Plaintiff in the Action said, She did employ Watson to Arrest Dorothy Midgley, and that he went streight forward to her, his brother being by; and that a Fellow came in and wounded the <rs id="t16781211e-23-viclabel113" type="occupation">Boy</rs>

That it was onely a piece of a Curtain Rod the Boy had in his hand, but neither struck stroke with it, nor run at them.</p>
               <p>Then the Writ and Warrant to justifie the Arrest were read, whereby upon the Return it was found, that they had returned a Rescous by the Party that was killed, which the Court told Watson was a great Evidence against him. Whereupon directing the Jury, they were told, that there being no provocation, the Law implied the malice to make it murder. But how far the persons accused were guilty, was left to them to consider upon the Evidence.</p>
               <p>Then the Jury withdrew to consider of their Charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Thomas key, He keeps the Island Mills, by the New Cut—it is a manufactory for shop and pipe-lead—on the 12th of April we had three hundred pigs of lead, with the name Wm. Blackett sunk in on the bottom of them—that denoted the mine—there was a small peculiar mark on them, which I had never observed on any before—it was on the end of each pig—on the 13th I missed two—we buy about four tons of lead a week of Phillips who car<lb></lb>ries on business in the Whitechapel-Road; which is about a mile and a half from Limehouse, where our place is—we received a large quantity of lead, from Mr. Phillips on the 22nd of April—I was present when it was turned out and weighed—I observed among it some pieces of pig-lead, which attracted my attention—I put the pieces together—they formed two entire pigs within 10lbs. or 12lbs.—one pig weighs about 1 1/4 cwt.—there was no name on the pigs—it was all beaten out—there was the appearance of something having been beaten out—there was a small mark at the end of every pig that we put on—on two of the end pigs, there was one small mark—it was the particular mark that on the three hundred pigs—Bromley is in Phillips's employ—I sent for the prisoner on the 24th, and he came on the Monday following—I threatened to send an officer if he did not come—I met him at Phillips's on Monday morning—he came to the mills at the time appointed, and I showed him these pieces of lead—I told him I had received these pieces among a quantity of old lead, from Phillips's shop, and asked him if he knew any thing of them—he said, "No" I asked him to meet me at Mr. Phillips's, which he did; I asked Phillips, in the presence of Bromley and Levy, whether he had bought these piece of lead that he had sent to me of Mr. Levy,—he told me, "Yes"—Levy said he did not sell them to him—this is the lead—I have no doubt it is my master's—it is worth between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are the marks upon it—the name of Blackett is beaten out—when these pieces are made up they almost make up a whole pig within 10lbs. or 12lbs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mrs. Phillips. The Prisoner is a marine store dealer, I believe—he came on the 16th of April and brought some old lead—I took it in—Phillips and Saunders were on the premises—he brought between 3 and 4cwt. of old lead, and three pieces of pig lead were mixed with it—it was weighed, emptied out of the bag, and put into the hole which is a receptacle for old lead—there was other lead there of various sports—there was no pig lead except what Levy brought—that was the lead that was afterwards taken to Mr. King's on the 21st or 22nd.</p>

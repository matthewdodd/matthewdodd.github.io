               <p>EMMA WEIGHTMAN. I was with the prosecutrix; she had a veil on her bonnet; I did not see the prisoner take it, because there was a crowd, but I saw him tucking a black lace veil into his bosom; I heard Proctor say "I have got the man."</p>

I live in Fore-street; I had been at the King's Arms with Miss Wilson - I never told Mrs. Hoyle that the veil was a white one; I slept at a friend's that night; I did not return home till ten o'clock in the morning; I was sober when I went home - my landlady did not turn me out on account of my drunkenness. I never told her I should get 5 l. by it; I state, positively, I never had any conversation with Proctor, in the presence of Mrs. Jones, on this business.</p>

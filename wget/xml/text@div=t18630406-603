                  </hi>. I live at 35, Berner's-street, Russell-square—about half-past 6, on 17th March, I came home, lighted the gas, and then bolted the back-door—in consequence of something that was told me I went up stairs; when I got upon the third floor I saw a light—I pushed open the door, and saw some one behind it, and the moment I went in I received a blow, and the light was knocked out of my hand—I was in perfect darkness—I had a tussle with somebody, but could not say who it was—the person cried out, "Pat"—I held him a very short time afterwards, and he said, "So help me God, I will kill you if you don't let me go"—I let him go; he ran down stairs, and I ran after him; when I got to the front door I saw my wife there, and seeing the door open, I thought he had gone out, and I went out, and the door closed—he just opened the door, and then closed it again—my attention was attracted by some one looking through the blind—I got over the area railings in the front, and caught the prisoner at the back door—he said he had come to see if he could render me any assistance—I did not see him actually come out of the back door—there are two doors, a glass door we keep shut by day, and a wooden door we shut at night—he had the inside door open, but not the outside, which is merely fastened by a little hasp—I had no opportunity of noticing the man I tussled with in the room—I thought when I got hold of him that he was about my size, an near as I could judge.</p>

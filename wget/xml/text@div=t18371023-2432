                  </hi>. I am footman to a lady living over the water, and have lived with her nearly three years. On the 18th of September last I was walking in Walcot-place, leading from the Asylum in Kennington-road, to Westminster Bridge—the prisoner came up to me, and said, "How do you do?"—I told him I did not know him—he said he was certain that he did knot? me—I told him, he did not—he then said he had seen me several times about the neighbourhood—I said it was very likely, for I was very often that way—he said he knew me when he was in town before—that he had not been long from the country this time—we walked on some little distance together—he said he lived with his uncle, who kept a grocer's shop near the Obelisk—we had a little more conversation, but I do not know all that passed—we walked as far as Prince's-square, which is About five minutes' walk from where I first met him—we had continued walking on—it was from half-past eight to nine o'clock in the evening—he then asked me if I would have a glass of ale—I said, "No"—he asked me again, and I said, "No; "and the third time he said I had better take a glass of ale, it would not take above a minute—I at last consented to do it, and we went into a public-house together, called the Prince of Wales—he called for a pint of ale, and paid for it—while we were drink<lb></lb>ing the ale, he said he wanted some money—I asked him what he wanted it for—he said he wanted a sovereign, and he must have it; and if I did not give him one, he would follow me home, and charge me with having committed s----y----I told him I had not got any money—he said, it was no use my saying I had not got any, for he must have it, and would have it, and he had got plenty close by, ready to swear to whatever he said, let it be whatever it would—we then walked out of the house, and got into Prince's square—he then said he must have a sovereign, and that he would not leave me till he did have it—I was very much frightened, and gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had a gold pin in my shirt—he said he must have that too—that was worth about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "You have got a handkerchief, and must have that too"—it was a silk one, and was in my pocket—I gave him the pin and handkerchief—he then left me, and I went home—I saw him again on the 12th of October, in Blackfriars-road—there was another person with him then—I saw him again on the 14th, with two others, at my mistress's house, but he came alone—after seeing him there, I applied to the police, and he was taken into custody that day in Prince's square—I gave him the money, pin, and handkerchief, because I was afraid that he would follow me home, and say what he had threatened—when I met him on the 12th, in Blackfriars-road, he said he would follow me home, and threatened me with what he had the day before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who brought the ale in to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The landlord—it was paid for at the time—I believe the landlord went out directly he got the money—I did not notice him standing about the door—I do not think our conversation was very low, but was not loud—it was a small tap-room—I do not think the landlord returned into the tap-room after taking the money—there was nobody in the tap-room—I do not know whether any person was sitting near.</p>

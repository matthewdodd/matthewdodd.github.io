The prisoner was in my constant employ for six months, up to the time in question; and for two days after; these two musical-boxes were lost from a private room on the first floor in my house, facing Watling-street, occupied by Mr. Upham, who was stopping at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is Mr. Upham's name? A. John Constantius: he is not here - he is at my house ill in bed at this time - I had seen the boxes - I am quite certain the prisoner was in my employ at the time - I do not pay him wages; my servants are paid by the persons frequenting the house: he was a <rs id="t18281023-54-deflabel335" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were never present when Mr. Upham gave the boxes to him to take to Mr. Dulin? A. I was not. I never stated so - if that is put down in my deposition, it is a mistake - I might have said Mr. Upham was in the habit of employing him as a messenger.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is nothing of the sort in his deposition.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM EPHRAIM DULIN. I only know that I have never received these boxes since they were delivered to Mr. Upham - I know they were delivered to him - I delivered one of them to him myself, at the Crown tavern, kept by Symonds; the value of that one was twelve guineas: it was on a Saturday in September - they are manufactured abroad, but I sell them - I saw another one in his possession at that time; they were merely sent to him on approbation - I have not seen either of them since.</p>

            . I am housemaid at the Crown. I was in the room where Mr. Upham used to sit, at the time the prisoner took the boxes out - they were musical-boxes, and came from Mr. Dulin; I saw the prisoner go out of the room with them about eight o'clock in the evening, or a little after - I never saw him after; I do not know the day of the month - it was in September: he was taken up three weeks or a fortnight ago last Friday; he took them some weeks before that - I never saw him again; they stood on a table - Mr. Upham had left the house when he took them, and was not expected to return; I did not see Mr. Upham again till three weeks ago, and when he inquired for the boxes I said I had seen the prisoner take them; my fellow-servant has seen them since me, but they have not been found - I have lived at Symonds' about fifteen months, and am still there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mr. Upham is in town? A. I do not know: I have come from Mr. Symonds' to-day - I saw Mr. Upham a few days ago: he may be ill in bed there now, but I have not seen him for some days: I believe he is in the house - he was there on Saturday, but I do not often see him; I did not see him on Saturday, but I made his bed then - I do not recollect seeing him yesterday; I do not always see him, though I make his bed - he had been in bed, and was not well on Saturday - he was not in the room when I made his bed; he never dines in the coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the boxes wrapped in paper when you saw them? A. Yes - he did not take them out of the paper, but I heard him say they were musical boxes; I did not look at them, I understood they were Mr. Upham's, and were going to Mr. Dulin's, to be repaired; Mr. Upham had left the house about half an hour when I saw them - I did not state to the Magistrate that he had left three days.</p>

            . I am servant at the Crown, and have lived there nearly four months. I saw the prisoner bring two musical-boxes into the kitchen - they were kept in the room Mr. Upham used to be in; when he brought them into the kitchen they were in paper - I asked him what they were: he said they were musical-boxes, and that he was going to take them home presently - I did not know where he meant by home; I have not seen them since: Mr. Upham had left the house on the Monday, and I think this was Wednesday - it was on the same night as Mr. Upham went - I am positive of that; I heard the prisoner say they came from Mr. Dulin's, and he was going to take them home - I cannot say how long after this he was taken up; I was examined at Guildhall on a Monday - I do not know how long ago; I asked the prisoner to let me look at the boxes - he said he should not, for he was going to take them home presently, and went out of the kitchen; I tore the paper, thinking I should see them, and saw them, but could not see the music; I had seen Ford take one up stairs, playing, under his arm, a day or two before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About how long before? A. I cannot say, to be positive; I live at Mr. Symonds' now; I cannot say where Mr. Upham is now, whether he is in Devonshire or not. I am the kitchen-maid - it is a large house; I do not know whether Mr. Upham is there or not; it is impossible for me to say - he has been sleeping there for the last few nights.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not one of you say it was three days after? A. My fellow-servant, whom you will hear presently, contradicts me; I did not hear Nicholls tell the Magistrate she saw them in his possession three days after Mr. Upham left; she was at Guildhall twice - I was only there once.</p>

            . I am housemaid to Mr. Symonds.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You clean Mr. Upham's room? A. Yes - I cleaned it this morning and saw him in bed - I clean it every morning before he gets up; he is a gentleman about twenty-five years old; I believe he went out yesterday for an hour in his own carriage - it was the same day that Mr. Upham left the house that I saw the boxes - they looked like mahogany to me; my fellow-servant was there; she did not take them out of the paper - they were covered with paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say it was three days after Mr. Upham left the house that you saw them? A. No, I said I saw the prisoner at the house three days after, not the boxes; Mr. Upham was not up when I came out this morning; he dined at home yesterday at six o'clock, and the day before; he dines in a private room, not in the coffee-room.</p>

            . The prisoner was given into my custody on the 11th of September, by Mr. Symonds, charged with stealing two musical-boxes; he said he knew nothing of them; I searched his lodgings, but found no boxes.</p>
               <p>MR. DULIN re-examined. The box I myself delivered to Mr. Upham was worth twelve guineas, the other twenty-five guineas - they were very large; I have seen Mr. Upham several times, but have not been able to find the boxes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What cases had they? A. Mahogany; they were very large - one played eight tunes, and the other four.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. SYMONDS. Q. The prisoner was absent for two days after this affair; did he return to your premises? A. He came to speak to one of my servants, and was taken up - that was the very day the loss was discovered.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he given you any notice of his meming to quit you? A. I discharged him two days after this happened - not for dishonesty; he was about nine months in my service.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He behaved well? A. Why, if I must answer you, I found two knives in his pocket, which shews a dishonest principle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. They were in the clothes I had on? A. No, in the clothes which were in his bundle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). Gentlemen, I may perhaps be permitted to state, that prior to my engaging to become a servant to Mr. Symonds, I was employed by Thomas Brandram, Esq., of Sise-lane, in the City of London, merchant, as his footman, for a period of two years and a half, whom, I have no doubt, will feel much pleasure in satisfying your Lordship and Gentlemen of the Jury, that I served him during that time with diligence, honesty, and good repute, which, I trust, will not be deemed undeserving of your kind attention and serious consideration. I acted in the capacity of a porter for my last employer, Mr. Symonds, in whose service I continued about nine months, during which time I made it my study and delight to make myself subservient to his interest, which I trust he will most readily admit. Gentlemen - With regard to the two boxes, which I am accused of having stolen, I can only say that I never saw nor had them in my possession after Mr. Upham left town, on the 8th of September last; and if that gentleman left them at the house of my late employer, Mr. Symonds, after I had given them to Mr. Upham, I declare most solemnly I was not aware of it; so far from attempting flight, I even went to Mr. Symonds' house, for the purpose of speaking to a waiter, upwards of a month afterwards, and was then given in charge.</p>

               <p>MR. SYMONDS. I never found anything amiss in his conduct before; I only discharged him for being careless.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Has he ever quarrelled with the other servants? A. I believe not.</p>

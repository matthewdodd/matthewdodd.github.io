               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How many heifers had your father? A. Three - I did not go in the field again till next morning - the gates were both shut, and had a lock on; but the lock was out of repair - I saw two footmarks in, and two out; there was two one way and two the other - there were the footmarks of two persons having been into the field, and two out.</p>

I have a small farm at Pinner - on Thursday, the 6th of February, I had three heifers in a field a little distance from my house - I remember their being missed - I went into the field, and saw footmarks of two persons going in and coming out of the field - I traced the footsteps of two heifers towards Harrow, down Mud-lane - they might go that way to Smithfield - I went to Smithfield, got there a few minutes past three o'clock in the afternoon, and found Turle in the Ram-yard - I know the three prisoners, and they know my farm - I had seen them in the neighbourhood shortly before - I never saw them together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw footmarks of two persons? A. Yes; I noticed there was two in and two out- I am certain both had gone in at one time and came out- they could not take step by step regularly as persons walking - they did not step, step by step, but side by side - they both went in together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the feet of different sizes or the same size? A. I cannot swear they were not the same footmarks of one person.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. They went side by side, as if walking in and out together? A. Yes; and the heifers appeared to walk in the same way - the footmarks were behind the heifers - I saw the footmarks of the same men coming in and going out, but the heifers only going out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen either of the prisoners with them? A. When I tied them up Armstrong was with them - I saw the heifers again the same afternoon after I had been to Guildhall - I was about the market most of the day - I had untied them in the morning when Lathbury bought them - that was about an hour after I had tied them up - Lathbury told me to untie them, and put them down the yard - that was in the morning - Element was not present then - it was market-day - there are not a great number of heifers on Fridays there - there might be one hundred, two hundred, or more - I had been employed tying up beasts, sheep, and calves, that day - I tied up no beasts that day, except the two heifers.</p>

               <p>Q. What was there particular about these two heifers? A. They were both white-backed ones - I cannot say how many white-backed ones there might be in the market; but these were in my hands, and I tied them up.</p>

            . I live at Pinner - I have known Armstrong for a long time - he bore the character of a very honest person.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you live at Pinner? A. Yes: at the Bell - I was at the Bell on Thursday night, the 6th of February - I saw Armstrong there - the two other prisoners were there too, at ten o'clock - all three together - I do not know where Element's field is - they left the public-house at ten o'clock - all the lot in the house went out together, as our house was to be shut up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know how far they live from you? A. About a quarter of a mile - they were at my house sometimes, not very often - several persons were in the house.</p>

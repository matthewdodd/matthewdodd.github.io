               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187004040056"></xptr>
               <p>that day—Cooper was not working for me on the premises that day—he had worked on the premises for his brother—his brother took the work—he worked for his brother—he ceased to do so on 18th September—he had not worked on the premises from that time till 8th October—it was the custom for tickets to be left with the bricks, and I signed the counterfoil—no ticket was produced when the action was tried—they stated they had it, and it was adjourned for them to produce it, and afterwards they did not produce it—I did not have 1000 bricks delivered to me on that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were indebted to Messrs. King, were you not; the sum they claimed from you in this action was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, very likely, for bricks, commencing in September and going on to 9th October—I am looking at the bill that was sent to me—there was a claim of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. made by them upon me for 500 bricks, delivered on the 2nd, 500 on the 22nd, 1000 on the 29th, 500 on 1st October, then the disputed 1000 on 8th October, and 1000 different sort on 9th October—I admit them all, with the exception of the 1000 on 8th October; but there was an overcharge of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I admitted every item except the one of 8th October—I had offered, if they deducted the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to pay them 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., taking off 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; then I left the money without looking at the tickets, as they told me they wanted the money by a certain day, and I had not examined the tickets when I left 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with my wife for her to pay them—that was in the middle of December—the account was sent in in the middle of December, the account you are now reading from—that contained the 1000 bricks on the 8th—I had never looked at it with the tickets; I had never seen the tickets—the counterparts of the delivery tickets were filed, and I had not examined them till after Christmas—I saw the account and left the money, less the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had not doubted the delivery of the 1000 bricks—the reason I doubted it afterwards was because I did not find tickets to the amount of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then I asked for this invoice, and compared them, and found I was deficient of the ticket for 8th October—I have got the tickets for all the others; they were all filed—my only reason at first for disputing this was because I did not find the ticket here—if I had found the ticket I should not have examined further—I understood that they refused to take the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was present at the County Court when Asser gave his evidence—I heard him say that be remembered on 8th October taking 1000 stock bricks to my premises in Bower Road, the Coopers were working there at the time; Charles Cooper received them from him, and assisted him (Asser) to unload them—Cooper, who took the contract, was his brother, for whom he was working—neither of them were working for me at that time—they were working for me; his brother was working for me under an agreement that I have here—Richard Coaper continued to work for me until 2nd October—Charles Cooper is the other defendant—I know he left on the 2nd because I have the receipt here for the money I paid him, and I paid him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for which I have not got a receipt, on 2nd October—I know it was on the 2nd, because it was the following Saturday night to a receipt I have here, and I paid him every consecutive Saturday night—the 2nd was a Saturday—I am certain it was the Saturday following the one for which I hold a receipt here—you will find the date of one is the date of the agree<lb></lb>ment—he worked one week before the agreement was made—I don't think the last here is 18th September—the date of the last receipt I have got is 25th September—that was a Saturday—next week I paid him the balance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187004040057"></xptr>
               <p>that was due to him, which was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me no receipt—I saw him on Monday, the 4th; he was then moving away his scaffolding from the place—he was there on the 4th, working for himself—he was there perhaps an hour; he had a carman to assist him, James Tarbard—there was a man named Lea there, not assisting him, and I was there—that was on Monday, the 4th—he did not come on Tuesday—I am sure of that—to my knowledge he had removed all his things away on the 4th—his brother was working under him—when bricks are left, the usual custom is that whoever receives them should receive a delivery-note, see that the bricks are right, and either sign the note or get it signed, and return it to the carman—I have the portion that is left—that is not signed—the port that is returned is signed, and the other left, and I file them—when I was in the way I signed them, and my son when I was not—if they are not there they are left till someone is there; but these bricks never have been Left—if I or my son were not there they would have been undelivered—they deliver the note before they un<lb></lb>load the bricks—it was impossible that they could be delivered and no one there—if nobody was by, the receipt would be left—that has never happened in my case, so far as I have been concerned, on my premises—I could not tell about other people—it has never happened that I and my son were not there, and they were obliged to leave the note till some subsequent occasion—I mean to swear that—if there was no one on the premises the tickets would be brought up to the house, where myself or my sons would be sure to be—they would be left until they had gone and unloaded the bricks, and they would come and receive it—if there was no one there to sign them, they would not leave them, they would be forwarded to me or my sons—they would receive the ticket—I know that they have not applied for the receipt-note for this 1000 bricks—they stated they had done so, and I have made every inquiry—I heard them state that they had done so, at the County Court, John Asser stated it, Cooper did not—Asser said that he had frequently applied for the delivery-note—he said he had come for it, and I bad sent him word that I was too much engaged to attend him, he must come another time—that was what Johu Asser swore—I hare a little girl with my wife, named Jane Greenwood; she is here now—she was not examined at the County Court—I am a cabinet manufacturer—in that part of the country building is included in that; we are builders and cabinet makers—I was building a workshop.</p>

King—they were for building a workshop—I know a person named Mary Ann Lea—I met her after the trial in the County Court, and she asked me for some money that was owing to her—I did not tell her that I was going to Mr. White's to find out something against Cooper, and if I did it would be very hot against him—she said "Do you really believe that your father had the bricks;" and I said I most certainly believed he did not have them—I did not say "Of course I believe so, but it won't do for me to say so, as you know how I am situated with him, and am obliged to hold a candle to the devil"—I did not make use of any such expression, it is a barefaced lie; if we were under the impression we had received the bricks at all we should not dispute paying for them.</p>

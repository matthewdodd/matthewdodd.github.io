                  </hi>. I live at 12, Henry-street, Portland-town, and am a carpenter—on 18th April, I was at work at Cornhill—I left there about 5 o'clock, and went by the 8 o'clock train from Fenchurch-street to Barking-road station—I then went to the Railway Tavern, opposite the station to seek employment—I went to find some previous shopmates—I stopped some time, and had a pint of beer there—I then went to another public-house—I can recognise French as being there—I can't identify Quince—we got into conversation and I treated them to drink—French offered me a lodging and I left the public-house in his company a little after 11 o'clock—soon after we got out of the house—as we were going round the corner of a short street, he asked me what I intended doing, or something like that—I asked him what he meant—he said they intended having what I had got—while he was saying this two parties came behind, and each took hold of one of my shoulders—French then came round, put his hand in my left hand trousers pocket, pulled it out with half-a-crown, and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I believe French then went away and left the other men behind—they pulled off my coat and I fell forward—they then ran away—I fell down and cut my thumb and put the joint out—I hallowed "Police!" directly, and ran to the road—a policeman came up and enquired what had taken place—I told him and</p>

On the 29th of July I went to bed at half-past ten o'clock at night: every thing was then safe - I got up a little before six o'clock in the morning, came down, and found the door at the bottom of the stairs fastened - we never fasten it; I then went up stairs to the back bed-room, looked out of window, and saw my kitchen windowshutters broken open, and the window open - the shutters had been forced by a crow-bar, about an inch in width apparently; the impression was about an inch long - I examined my house, and missed all the property stated in the indictment (enumerating it), the value of which was about 18l. or 19l.; I have since seen the tea-caddy and handkerchief. In consequence of information, on the night of the 1st of August I watched with the constable, and two witnesses, at a hay-rick in Mr. Boswell's field, at Brentford, and about ten o'clock saw two persons come towards the rick: we had been watching about a quarter of an hour - I believe the prisoners to be the two persons; I am certain of Farrow - I heard one say to the other."That gate is open;" they then said one to the other, "There is that box, you know;" they got over the rails, and into the rick-yard - Farrow went to the hole in the rick where the caddy was - he took it out, put it in again, and said, "Nobody has been here;" it was a light night - I am certain of Farrow; I knew him before; he left the caddy there, and then they went to where the phosphorus-box and centre-bit were; and when Farrow put his hand into the hole, he said, "D-n my eyes;" he took out his centrebit and phosphorus-box - they then went round to the back part of the rick; then came by, and passed me, got over the rails, and ran up the field as hard as they could - we all three pursued them; I do not know that they had seen either of us - and as I ran up the garden, I fell; and when I got to the garden-gate I found it shut - I saw no more of them that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You talk of the place where the caddy and phosphorus box were - had you been there before, and seen them? A. Yes, about a quarter of an hour before; and in consequence of finding them there, we were watching - I had not told other people that they were there; Dickinson and Theak, who were watching, had told me of it; I went to watch with them, and the prisoners were the first persons who came - I was stationed at the near side of the rick - it is a common hay-stack, with four sides to it; Theak and I were on one side, and Dickinson was more in front, so as to see the end, and the side where I stood - the caddy was at one side and the phosphorus-box and centre-bit, at the end - I could see the side and the end where I stood; I have known Farrow two or three years; it was a light night; I speak to their persons, not their voices - they did not see us they came towards us - I saw Farrow's face full, but not Craw's - I saw Farrow twice; he came twice to the side of the rick I was on; he came first for the caddy, then went round for his companion; both got over the fence, close by me, and ran up the field - I cannot say whether they saw me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What means have you of knowing Craw? A. I am not positive of him.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Mayo, a butcher. On the 1st of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I found a tea-caddy, phosphorous-box, centre-bit, and pocket handkerchief in the hay-rick, and took them to my master, and by his direction I brought them back to the rick, and placed them where I had found them; about nine o'clock one of our men went with me; he is not here - I joined the prosecutor and Dickinson to watch, two men came to the rick - I cannot swear to them; one of them took the tea-caddy out, and put it back again - the other one was a goodish bit from him at that time - I saw nothing more done to the rick.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you looked at them as hard as you could? A. Yes, as far as I could see them.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You did not know them before? A. No.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the night in question, I was watching with the prosecutor and Theak - I saw both the prisoners come to the rick; Farrow I can swear to, the other I cannot positively swear to: they came up about a quarter-past ten - the first word I heard Farrow say was, "There is the box, you know;" they came up to the rick, and one of them said, "This gate is open;" I had left it open myself on purpose - one of them then said "Let us go through this gate;" the other then said "No, we will get over this corner." I saw them go to three separate places in the rick, and put their hands in, but whether they took anything out, I cannot say - Farrow went to where the caddy was; they then went to where the phosphorus-box and centre-bit were, which was about the middle of the rick, at the back - one of them (I believe it was Farrow,) said "D-n my eye;" they went to the further corner, where the handkerchief was, and put their hands to the rick again - they made no remark there; they came back again to the phosphorus box and took that away - I saw them do that; they went out by the corner, where Attfield, and the boy(Theak) were; they walked down the field - I pursued them down the garden; I went rather fast after them, as Attfield did not pursue them; I followed them through the garden, till I came within ten yards of Mr. Boswell's garden gate - I there heard the gate go too; I heard them come out of the field gate, and stopped till they came by the gates - they walked; I went and looked in the direction they were going; they were still walking; one of them said to the other "Let us go and have a drop of beer here;" the other said "No, it is very bad;" I went in front of them, pulled out my staff, collared Farrow with one hand, and the other with the other - I holloed for assistance; I am certain I collared the two men who came from the rick, and have every reason to believe Craw was the other - I only lost sight of him in going down the field; I had lost sight of them at the first oaset - they had gone about five hundred yards before I collared them; Farrow, finding nobody come to my assistance, said "I won't be handled;" he directly caught hold of my staff with both hands, and tried to wrench it out of my hand - I was obliged to let go of the other to hit him, and both escaped for that night; I did not see either of them again till the 5th of August, when I saw Farrow at Brentford; I have every reason to believe he saw me; I was about a hundred and fifty yards from him- he was with two girls; the moment he saw me, he ran up Drum-lane - I followed him through the Lion yard, and as soon as he saw me he ran away; I pursued, and never lost of him for a quarter of a mile, then he turned down an alley; I pursued him - he went across the canal though the water, swimming part of the way - I went over the height, and was searching for him for a quarter of an hour, and then found him in custody; he was very wet all over - I am sure he is the man I had seen at the rick; I have known him from a boy, and am certain of him. I apprehended Craw last night at Hounslow, at the Cricketers public-house, about a quarter-past eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say the persons went to three distinct places on the rick? A. Yes. First to where the caddy was, then to the phosphorus-box, and then to the handkerchief; one of the witnesses could not see the last place; I am certain they walked away - they did not run till after I collared them; I never saw them run till after they got from me; I collared them in the road - I never said they went through a wood - they were in a field and I in a garden; I lost sight of them then.</p>
               <p>Q. And coming into the road, you found two men walking deliberately? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES ATTFIELD. This tea-caddy and handkerchief are mine, and part of the things taken that night; I saw the caddy in the house the same night; I am confident it was on the table in the parlour, as I passed through to go to bed; I do not know when I saw the handkerchief - it might be a few days before - the door opening from the kitchen to the parlour, was found open - whether it was shut the night before I do not know; I am certain I fastened the house up myself before I went to bed; I found the kitchen door put against the stair foot door to prevent my coming down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You lost a good deal of property? A. Yes. I have found nothing else; the robbery was committed on Tuesday, the 29th, or Wednesday morning, the 30th - the things were found in the rick, on the 1st of August; Farrow lives with his father at Brentford; his premises have been searched, but nothing of mine found: I am a stage-coach driver.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH DICKINSON. I searched Farrow's premises on the 5th August, when I apprehended him.</p>
               <p>FARROW'S Defence. I never went near any bay-rick; I went by a path, by a bay-rick; I was going to Ealing to see a young man, about buying some eels; I did not see him - as I came back I met a young man, a stranger to me; we walked together and came by the rick, but I did not see any rick; when I came to the White Hart public-house, Dickinson stopped me - I asked what he wanted, he would not tell me, and I walked away from him.</p>
               <p>CRAW'S Defence. I slept at Hounslow that night; they have made a mistake.</p>

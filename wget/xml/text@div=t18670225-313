                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at 14, King Street, Finsbury Square—the prisoner has been in my employ since 1861 as copying clerk—it was part of his duty to serve subpoenas—I was soli<lb></lb>citor for the plaintiff in the case of <hi rend="italic">Hastelow v. Stobie</hi>, in which a very large amount was at stake—Mrs. Ablett, Mr. Edwards, and Dr. Chandler were three of my witnesses—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mrs. Ablett on 4th December—I read it to the prisoner and asked him for an explanation—he referred to a list and said, "Why, sir, it is paid; I paid it myself"—I wrote an answer to that, which was thrown on the floor for one of the clerks to take out and deliver—this is a copy of the answer (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—there is a mark on this that it was delivered in the usual way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Hincks—I instructed the prisoner to serve subpoenas in the case of <hi rend="italic">Hastelow v. Stobie</hi>—I recollect giving him subpoenas to serve upon Mrs. Ablett, Mr. Edwards, and Dr. Chandler, with the amount that was to be paid—this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) he prepared under my direction—on 27th November he returned it to me with the names of Ablett and Edwards filled in as paid, and on the 30th with the name of Dr. Chandler as paid—it says, "Copy served oil Hannah Ablett, and paid her 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 26th November, 1866. J. Huds-peth;" "Copy served on William Edwards, and paid him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 26th Novem<lb></lb>ber, 1866. J. Hudspeth;" "Copy served on Dr. Chandler, and paid him 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 30th November, 1866. J. Hudspeth;" that is all in the prisoner's writing—I was present when Mr. Hincks read a letter to the prisoner from Mrs. Ablett, complaining that she had not received her money—he expressed surprise that the letter had been written, and referred to her receipt upon this paper—on the first day of the trial Edwards came to me and told me he had not been paid—I paid him.</p>

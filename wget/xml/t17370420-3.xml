About Three o'Clock in the Morning, March 11, she got in at the Cellar Door, under my Dwelling House, and left her Hoop Petticoat upon the Cellar Stairs, - here it is, my Lord; then she came up into my Chamber, - I can't say I saw her, because 'twas dark; but I heard her pull out three Drawers, from whence she took these Things, which I found again in her Lodgings; I swear they are mine; - here's the two Silver Salts, two silver Cups, a black Silk Apron, &amp;c. &amp;c. all these Things are mine, and I found them nine Days after the Robbery at her Lodgings. The white Hood and the Handkerchief I found upon her, and she own'd they were mine: I tax'd her with taking the Things, and she confess'd she had taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from whence she took them?</p>
               <p>Boreman. She took them out of the Drawers, by my Bed-side.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them last, before they were missed?</p>
               <p>Boreman. I saw them the Day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing of your own Knowledge, concerning the Time or Manner of taking these Goods?</p>
               <p>Boreman, I was not sensible of any Thing 'till she came to my Pockets for the Key of the Closet Door, where the Money lay; 'twas this that 'wak'd me: She opened the Closet Door, and took the Box that held the Money, and was going down Stairs with it; I heard her brush along, and being surprized I got up, and ran directly to the Closet, but the Box of Money was gone. I thought it must be some body that knew my Room very well; and I suspected the Prisoner, because she is a Person of a very ill Character.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take her up?</p>
               <p>Boreman. Nine Days afterwards: And the Moment she saw me, she own'd every Thing: She got my Hood upon her Head, and my Handkerchief about her Neck. The Prisoner Calwell told me, all the rest of my Things were in her Room, and there I found them: She gave me the Key her self to look for them. This Piece of Gold I had from him, he said he had it of Doll, and she own'd it was one of the Pieces she took out of my Room. And have not you lost some Cups and Salts, says he, I told him, I believed he knew very well what I had lost. Why, says he, I ask'd her, if she had not robbed somebody of that Portugal Gold, and those Things, and she told me a Parson had given them to her.</p>
               <p>Q. What Reason had you to suspect the Man</p>
               <p>Boreman. They liv'd together as Man and Wife in that Lodging, and I think the Cellar Door required so much Violence to open it, that it could not be done with her Hands alone.</p>
               <p>Felton. I'll ask no Questions; I only desire to clear this innocent Man.</p>
               <p>Calwell. I never wrong'd you of a Penny: Did you find any of the Goods upon me?</p>
               <p>Boreman. They were found in your Lodging.</p>
               <p>Calwell. 'Twas her Lodging, not mine: She was in Custody before any Thing was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she break any Doors in Order to get in?</p>
               <p>Boreman. She confess'd she broke open the outer Cellar Door, and got into the Cellar; then she came up the Cellar Stairs, and broke open the Door at the Top of the Stairs, between two and four o'Clock.</p>

The Captain insisted on knowing what Money he had in his Pocket, and he produced this Portugal Piece of Gold, and said his Wife was with Child by a Parson, and he had sent her Money to take Care of the Child, and this was one of the Pieces which he had from her. We asked him where she might be found; he told us she was at Mrs. Hamilton's in Thieving-Lane, and that we must enquire for her by the Name of

            ; afterwards he said, he took the Room for her in his Name, and that we must ask for her in his Name. The two next Witnesses. Row and Alexander went to see for her; they found her, and brought her to Captain Littleer's, where she confessed the Robbery, and own'd she got in at the Cellar Door: The Hood and the Handkerchief she had then upon her.</p>
               <p>Joseph Row, Serjeant. I was walking in the Park, and Capt. Littleer call'd me, and told me there was a Warrant against Calwell and a Woman, on Suspicion of breaking open a House. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173704200004"></xptr> said, I was sorry for that, for he had told me, he had four Pieces of Gold sent him from one Mr. Boswell a Merchant at Bristol. The Captain asked me if I knew where the Prisoner (Calwell) was? I told him I should see him on the Parade at 11 o'Clock, and would bring him before him. I found him at the Time I expected, and carry'd him to the Captain's House, who told him, He fear'd he was concern'd in a Roguish Affair, and, if he clearapos;d himself, he must declare where the Woman was. He sent us to a House by the Dead Wall in St. Martin's Lane, but she was not there; then he directed us to Thieving Lane; and lest the Woman should suspect the Occasion of her being sent for, I bid him give my Corporal the Ring off his Finger for a Token, that he wanted her to come to him, and so we sent him for her: He found her, and told her, if she would come to her Husband at the Captain's House, the Captain would give them a Furlow. When the Corporal brought her in, Mrs. Boreman was put into another Room, and the Captain asked her, if she was marry'd to Calwell; she said yes. Then he asked her how long she had been in London? and if she had ever been at Service? She said she had been 11 Months in London, but never had been a Servant. Then Mrs. Boreman came out, and said, she had been her Servant, and asked her how she came to rob her? Why, says she directly, The Devil put me to it. Mrs. Boreman asked her what she had done with the Plate? At first she would give no Account of it, but at last she gave us the Key of her Room, and we found there the Cloak and these Silver Things, and nothing else. The Mob and the Handkerchief she had on her at that Time, and they were then taken from her. Then the Captain asked Calwell what Money he had in his Pocket? and he pull'd out one of these 36 Shilling Pieces. Upon this we took them before Justice Hilder, and there she own'd the Fact, and said she had but five Pieces of the Gold, for the Bag broke, and she sav'd no more of them</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say she got in?</p>
               <p>Row. She own'd she broke open the House, and when she had taken the Money, she open'd a Ground-window, and jumping out of Window, a twenty Pound Bag fell into the Street, which was afterwards found by some People with a Candle and Lanthorn, who kick'd it before them on the Ground. After Justice Hilder had examin'd them, he committed the Woman to the Gate-house, and the Man to Tothill-fields Bridewell; they were both put into a Coach, and as they were going to Prison, they fell a fighting, and she call'd him Rogue, and swore she would do for him.</p>
               <p>Felton. Did I say I would do for him? I might have done for him, if I would have sold his Blood, as you and others would have had me.</p>
               <p>Calwell. Pray, Serjeant Row, have not you known me to have got Money by Recruiting?</p>
               <p>Row. Yes; but not in Town.</p>
               <p>Calwell. I have got 2 Guineas a Week by recruiting in Town.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the Doors fast when you went to Bed?</p>
               <p>Boreman. Yes, I saw them all fast after One o'Clock; then I went to Bed, and I saw them broke about Four.</p>

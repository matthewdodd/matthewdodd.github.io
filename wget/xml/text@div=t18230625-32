On the 13th of June, about eleven o'clock at night, when I came home, I went into the shop and found a piece of calico folded up in a peculiar manner, and thrown under a shelf, behind some list, where the prisoner worked; he was taken next day, and I went to his lodging at Acton's house, and found nine pieces of cloth doubled, they were cut out of cloth, and two pieces of calico, about a yard and a quarter each, one piece of the cloth had a customer's name on it; in Jones's writing.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had you been set to watch - A. No; I was down by the sky-light, cleaning a cupboard out; there were other men in another part of the shop. I told the prisoner that night what I had seen; he said it was false; he staid till near eleven o'clock, he usualy left at nine, but said he would wait till my master came home, but he did not. He came to work next morning; he desired my mistress to send for a constable to search him.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's mother. Knight gave me information. I went on the stairs to see if my servant was in the shop. The prisoner came forward and asked what I wanted; I said not him, and went back, but returned; he came forward and said "What do you want." I said "Not you, you have put something in your pocket," he said I might search him if I thought proper. I declined, but told him there was something I knew of; he said if he had known I was so mean as to watch him, he would have been more on his guard; I said I would have the shop shut up, and he might come and set with me or the servants, till my son came home; he staid till half past ten o'clock.</p>

            . I was shopman to the prosecutor. I lodge in the house; I saw the pieces of cloth produced by master, with the name of Tole on it. I believe it to be my writing, it is my business to cut the lengths for the garment, and then the prisoner cuts the shape. I had cut off cloth for a coat for Tole, (Looking at it.) I cannot undertake to say it is my writing, as it is a good deal rubbed, but I believe it to be mine; it corresponds with the rest of the cloth in make. I can trace the letters T. and 1 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear it is your writing - A. It is not plain enough. I have since given out more cloth for the collar of Tole's coat.</p>

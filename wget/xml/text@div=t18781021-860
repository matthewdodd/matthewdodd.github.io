On 23rd September, about 12 p.m., I was on duty in Exmouth Street, Hampstead Road, and saw the prisoner with this umbrella (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I questioned him as to how he came by it—he said that he was drinking in the Palmerston with a friend who was very drunk, and he thought he would take care of his umbrella for him—I took him there, he then said that it did not happen there, that he had been drinking with another man and a stranger, in a public-house, and he thought he might as well have it as anybody else, and he took the umbrella and triedto get the watch but could not—I took him to the station and then went after the prosecutor.</p>

I live at 232, Liverpool Road, and am a clerk—on 23rd September, in the evening, I was passing through Stanhope Street, and went into a public-house, where the prisoner and another man forced their conversation on me and asked me to have a glass of ale, which I refused, as they were strangers—the prisoner said "If you won't have one at my expense</p>

               <p>treat me," and I paid for two glasses of ale and left the house—I had not gone far down Stanhope Street when the prisoner knocked me down and attempted to take my watch and chain, but I held on to it and shouted "Police"—he ran off with my umbrella and locket, which was attached to my chain by a ring—I have not seen it since—this is my umbrella—I went to the station and gave information.</p>

It was a young chap who lives at No. 4, Old Pye-street, Westmin<lb></lb>ster; he is about seventeen or eighteen years old, 5 feet 1 high, wears a pilot jacket with a velvet collar, a black cloth waistcoat with lappets on the pockets, cord trousers, a blue cap, and silk neck-tie, and Joe Frits"—I took it down Friz—"he is about twenty-four years old, with a white slop, cord jacket, and velvet sleeves outside. He has been a soldier, and lives in Ann-street, and is known to Sheen, of Westminster"—I understood by that, Sheen the constable—"we were in Downey's public-house, opposite the bar<lb></lb>racks, and they <hi rend="italic">kidded</hi> me on to come up and beat the glass, and said if I was caught they would send me grub to-day and find me a <hi rend="italic">mouthpiece</hi>, and as they have not sent me any grub it is nothing but right I should <hi rend="italic">round</hi> upon them. Downey gave them half-a-crown before we started, and the stuff we got off was to be taken to him. I broke the window, the little chap whose name I don't know made a grab at the rings. He ran one way and I another, and Joe Fritz stood behind a lamp-poet when it was done. I was about half drunk when I done it. I get my living by selling papers, and can earn four <hi rend="italic">bob</hi> a day at that <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> and the little one got a diamond ring last night-week from a pawnbroker's in the Westminster-road; it was worth 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Downey gave them 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that—the little one said, 'If this job comes off all right, we shall get some new <hi rend="italic">togs</hi>, that is all'")—in consequence of that state<lb></lb>ment, I went to Westmimster, and saw Sheen, of the <hi rend="largeCaps">B</hi> division, and about 2 o'clock in the morning he handed Lane into my custody, in the Broadway—on our way to the station, Lane said, "I did not break the glass"—when I got to the station I found that his waistcoat answered the description that King had given, and the remainder of his clothing was new, the same as he has on now.</p>

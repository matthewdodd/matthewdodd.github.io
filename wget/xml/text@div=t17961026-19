               <p>I am a taylor; the prosecutor claimed three pair of braces which I bought of the prisoner at the bar, he told me he made them himself; the officer took them from me, I think it was about three months ago; I have bought two or three times of him, so that I cannot tell exactly the time.</p>

               <p>(Produces the braces). I have had them ever since; I had two pair of them of Thompson.</p>
               <p>Smith. There is nothing particular about them, but I can swear to the work of the holes; they are worked by a woman I employ.</p>
               <p>Briscoe. Before Smith went to the Grand Jury, he said he did not wish to find the bill, but he thought they would circumvent him in his trade.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Smith.) Is that true? - A. They asked me many different questions, and I did not know the nature of it; I thought he might go about so the shops.</p>

I worked for the prosecutor as long as I could get any money for wages, and I was obliged to pawn my cloaths; I bought this webbing to work over hours, to maintain myself, I could not get any money of him; I got me a fresh master, and therefore he took me up; I made some of those button-holes myself, and he owes me now above a guinea of wages.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Smith.) Do you owe him any wages? - A. No; he owes me one pound, and seven-pence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Sarah Young.) Has Smith paid you your wages regularly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Elizabeth young.) Does the prosecutor pay you your wages regularly? - A. Yes; every Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he pay his work-people regularly? - A. Yes; I never heard any complaint of any body.(The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character).</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts is your kitchen? - A. In a stone yard, a door opens in the yard to it; she threw the saucepan to the door when she saw me; I opened her apron, and took out three pint basons, two butter boats, and a cup and saucer; I asked her what she did there; she said, a lodger in the house had given her these things; she said, the lodger had put her in the yard to stop till she came down stairs, and they were the lodgers things; I said they were mine; I called the lodgers down stairs; she then denied knowing any of them; I went for a constable, and left her in the charge of the lodgers; I had detected her once before; I was in the kitchen half an hour before; I am sure they were there at that time.</p>

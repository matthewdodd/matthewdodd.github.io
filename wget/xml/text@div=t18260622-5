            . I am a chimney-sweeper, and live with my father, in John-street, Tottenham-court-road. I have known the prisoner a long time, by his selling dog's meat about. On Sunday afternoon, the 14th of May, about half-past five o'clock, he came to our house with this horse in a halter, and offered him for sale to my father, and said he would leave it on trial for two days, and if he liked it he was to give 8l. for it - he only asked that, and said he had given six guineas for it that day; I put it into our stable, and next morning rode it to Notting-hill, to try it - Milton stopped me in Oxford-street with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known him? A. A long time - he knew I could find him, and I found him at his work when I was stopped with the horse - I knew he occasionally jobbed in horses; we told him we should ride it to Notting-hill and Hammersmith, to try it; he did not object to that.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He knew you could find him? - A. Yes. He bore the best of characters; he has bought horses for me. Notting-hill is in the road to Isleworth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a needle-manufacturer, and have a warehouse in Nottingham-place, Ashley-terrace, City-road. I knew the prisoner for two or three years—he was in great distress, and I took him into my employ as col<lb></lb>lector and town-traveller at the commencement of Feb.—on the 22nd of Aug. I found there were several accounts not paid in—I told him I would get these accounts in myself, and when I started to get these four different accounts the prisoner called me out of my chaise and told me he had received them and used the money—I forgave him those accounts, continued him in my employ) and advanced his salary from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 80<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—on the 17th of Sept. I found that he had been embezzling again—I have customers named Jobsoo, Watkins and Belton—I never received from the prisoner 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as from Jobson, or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Watkins, or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Belton—on finding they had not been accounted for, and had been paid, I spoke to the prisoner—I asked whether he had received Mr. Jobson's money—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he was prepared to make it good—he said no, but he should in a fortnight—I gave him into custody, and then I found out these other accounts—it was his duty to come in and pay me the money he received every night—I went to Mr. Jobson, and he had paid him on the 2nd of Sept.</p>

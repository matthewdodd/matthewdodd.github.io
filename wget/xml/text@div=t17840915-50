            . The affirmance is, that the paper did not contain the true last will and testament.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. The act of parliament says, if any person shall take a false oath, to obtain the probate of any will or wills, in order to receive the payment of any wages; now this man goes to the proper officer, and there he takes a false oath, for the purpose of obtaining probate, which when obtained, is to enable him to receive the money due to the heirs of the deceased; whether therefore the true will or not is not material, the only question is, whether the oath was a false one, and taken for the purpose of obtaining probate; your Lordship recollects the case of Kimber, in Foster, where there was no such person as the Testator that ever had existence; and the Judges determined, that it was an aggravation of the offence, forging the person as well as the thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reeves said a few words on the same side; and Mr. Garrow replied, and contended, that this is not a will, but a paper, partly written and partly printed, purporting to be a will.</p>
               <p>The Court over-ruled the objection.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. This is not proved to be anybody's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Lucy. He at that time appeared to be under a great deal of anxiety, and said he was very sorry for what he had done, and wished to know if it could be settled; I told him I would serve him as consistently as I could with my duty as an officer.</p>
               <p>Court. Before you say any thing more, did you give him reason to hope, or suppose, that if he told you any thing, you would befriend him? - No, my Lord, not at all, I was very sorry for his unhappy situation when, I saw that paper he said he was very sorry for what he had done, and desired to know if it could be settled; I told him I was not empowered, and I would mention it to Mr. Murphy, which I did, upon which he wrote a letter to a person, and signed his name Kyrin Ryen: here are two papers that were found. He said he was very sorry for what he had done, as he had represented himself to be a man of property: I think the letter was to a person at Walworth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you got the letter here? - No.</p>
               <p>Then do not tell us any thing about it. How much did Mr. Murphy's bill amount to in this business? - I know of no bill.</p>
               <p>You was to consult Mr. Murphy about the propriety of settling of it? - No, Sir, I spoke to Mr. Murphy whether such a thing could be done to serve the man.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Quirk present at that time? - No; I know him.</p>
               <p>Was you present at any time with Mr. Quirk, or do you know of any offer being made by Mr. Murphy, that on payment of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150103"></xptr> this bill of fifty pounds, he should be discharged? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, now is the time for you to say any thing that you have to say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At this time I was so ill that I was not out of my room for two months and upwards; I have witnesses to prove that, if you will be so kind as to have them called.</p>

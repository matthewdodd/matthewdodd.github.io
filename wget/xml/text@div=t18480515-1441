                  </hi> I am a builder, at Clapham—Hillesley was my wagoner four or five months, and Dowding my gardener and odd-man. On 30th March I directed Hillesley to take the cart to Nine Elms; and on 6th April, in consequence of something I heard, I went to a stable on my pre<lb></lb>mises, and found a piece of copper, worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had not missed it; it had been in a closet or cupboard, in a shed, which was always locked—the padlock appeared locked and perfect—it was fastened by a secrew-staple, but a person could take it out and put it much in the same state that it was in before.</p>

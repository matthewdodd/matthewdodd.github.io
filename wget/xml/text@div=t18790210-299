                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Missing Letter Department of the General Post Office—on Saturday, 11th January, in consequence</p>

               <p>of complaints of loss of letters, I made up two test letters at the South Lambeth Sorting Office—I addressed one "Mrs. Watson, 79, Motley Street, Wandsworth Road, London," and the other "Mr. Tatlow, Tailor, 30, Robertson Street, East Wandsworth Road, London"—in the letter to Mrs. Watson I enclosed a sovereign and 55 stamps—I previously marked the stamps with the date with chemicals, and the coin with my initials—I posted the letters in the pillar box at the corner of Devonshire Road, Wandsworth Road, about 200 yards from the sorting office—I had given special instruc<lb></lb>tions about them and saw them cleared at about 6.10 by a man named Spear, head letter carrier—at about 6.50 I saw the prisoner leave the Sorting Office (where I had seen the letters taken) to go out on his delivery—I watched him down to his own house—I could not see if he had anything in his hands—it was contrary to regulation to go to his house before his delivery—he remained in his house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—after that I saw him pass through Motley Street—I saw him pass the door of No. 79 without delivering—he did not go into Robertson Street—I had given instructions to Spear at South Lambeth Office—I then returned to the office—I saw the prisoner there at about 8.20 and told him who I was—I said "Have you been into your house on the 6 o'clock delivery?"—he said "No," and I said "Did you do the Queen's Road delivery on the sixes?"—that is a techincal term for the 6 o'clock delivery—he said "Yes"—these letters would be in that delivery—I said "I saw you go down to your house; you remained there from 10 to 15 minutes"—he would have had to go out of his route to go to his house—he replied "Not so long as that"—I said "Did you give your wife anything?"—he said "No"—I said "Did you give her any money at that time?"—he said "No"—I said "Did you see a letter on the 6 o'clock delivery for Mrs. Watson, 79, Motley Street?"—he said "No"—I said "Did you see one for Mr. Tatlow, Tailor?"—he said "No"—I said "Both those letters are missing, they were sorted out for your 6 o'clock delivery, do you know anything about them?"—he said "No"—this conversation occurred at the post office about 8.20 the same evening—after that I went to the prisoner's house and saw his wife—that was about an hour and a half after the letters were entrusted to him—he had been home before he commenced his delivery—I am not able to say whether he went in afterwards, we lost sight of him—nothing has been found with regard to the letter addressed to Mrs. Watson—on the following Monday the letter addressed to Mr. Tatlow, Tailor, turned up at the S.W. District Office—when we went to the prisoner's house we were kept waiting at the door a long time—on going in I saw his wife—I saw a lot of postage stamps there that were unobliterated, and as if torn from envelopes and newspapers—the paper had been bodily torn off with them, and was still adhering—I also noticed embers of paper recently burnt in the grate—I examined them—I could make nothing of them positively—I went back again to see the prisoner—this was about 10.30 the same evening—I saw him in the sorting office, I had him detained there in the meantime—I said "I have seen your wife, she says you gave her some money; be careful what you say; what did you give her?"—he said "I gave her a sovereign and a few shillings"—I said "What did she do with the sovereign?"—he said "She changed it"—I said "I suppose it was to pay for the gin I saw upon the table?"—he said "Yes, it might have been"—I said "What change did she bring you back, was there a half-sovereign amongst it?"—he said "Yes,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187902100043"></xptr>
               <p>and I gave her another to put away; she wrapped it in paper"—I said "Where did you get the sovereign?"—he said "It is my Christmas boxes, I changed it from silver to gold to part it more easily with my partners"—I said "Where did you change it?"—he said "I don't know"—I said "Where did you get the second half-sovereign you gave your wife?"—he said "I don't know"—he was searched at the office and nothing found upon him relating to this charge—the letter addressed to Mr. Tatlow, Tailor, had two half-sovereigns and a sixpence in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were half-sovereigns in it—it was not delivered—it was found in the post-office with the contents the same—I opened it myself, and found precisely the same amount I had placed in it—it had not been violated—with regard to the other letter I marked the sovereign—I have since found out where it had been changed—it was too late on the Saturday night to follow it up—I did not know then—I did not ask his wife, because she denied having a sovereign—I did not tell the prisoner so—when I went at half-past 9 I saw some paper in the grate, which appeared to have been recently burnt, I should think within five or ten minutes before I came in, from its appearance—the prisoner was there at about 7 o'clock—he went home before his delivery—this was not his usual delivery—the house where he had to call was not empty; a policeman lived there—men are not allowed to call home on their beat—in a case of necessity it would be different—I am not in the office, and heard nothing of his having a telegram—the stamps found in the lining of his hat are not the stamps I put in the letter—I found no traces of them—I watched him through nearly the whole beat—Police-officer Smee was with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The stamps were found in the lining of his hat—some pieces of paper addressed to Derby and a post packet were also found—they form the subject of another inquiry—when I went to his house the landlady answered the door—it was seven or eight minutes before I could get into the room—they said Mrs. Adams was not at home—there was plenty of time for the paper to have been burnt—the papers seemed freshly burnt—they were not disarranged—I tried to take them up, but they crumbled to pieces—he was searched at 20 minutes past 8, an hour and a half after ho had finished his delivery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head letter-carrier at the South Lambeth Sorting Office—on the 11th January I saw Mr. Bradford post the two letters addressed to Tatlow and Watson about 6 o'clock—I afterwards collected those letters and brought them to the office—I sorted them to the Queen's Road delivery—I then saw the prisoner arranging his letters for delivery, and saw him pick the test letters out from the others—I was about a yard from him—my attention had been previously called to them—I saw him place the two letters on his right-hand side, and the other letters on the left—they were not tied—they were placed ready to be taken out on delivery—I swear the two letters were on the right—he pressed them with his finger—I. saw him examine them—I saw the address on one of the letters—I could read it distinctly—he took the two test letters up in his right hand in the sorting office, and the others in his left hand—he walked straight out of the office still holding the two letters in his right hand, they were not registered—it was a most unusual thing to do—they ought to stand in their order all in one hand—there was a large bundle, over twenty in number—I went out on delivery soon after—not with Adams—I saw him after I came back—I believe he brought some letters back—I had nothing to do with them.</p>

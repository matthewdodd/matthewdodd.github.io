On the 7th of October, I let a lodging to the prisoner and his wife, a room ready furnished at four shillings and sixpence a week, they continued with me until the 29th of October; when I found my property was gone, I went into the room on Saturday the 29th, and asked for the ironing-cloth; the wife was present. I took the ironing-cloth. I saw a blanket on the top of the bed instead of a quilt. I overhauled the bed; I found a pair of sheets were gone, a pair of pillows, and one pillow-case, that is all I missed; those things I let to them with the room for their use. I asked the wife what they had done with my property; she told me she knew nothing at all of it, I must ask her husband, she knew nothing at all of it; he was a lazy man, he would not work. When the prisoner came in I sent for an officer, and had him taken in custody. The pawnbroker produced my things at Shadwell office.</p>
               <p>MR. BRADLEY. I am a pawnbroker. I produce a pillow pledged by the prisoner on the 13th of October. I had another pillow, I delivered it to the prosecutrix.</p>

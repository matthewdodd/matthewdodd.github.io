                  </hi>. I live at 3, Henry-street, Ratcliffe, and am a rigger in the prosecutor's service, Mr. Henry Vane—his premises are at the corner of Noah's Ark-alley—on Saturday, 27th February, I locked the warehouse up—I was the last person there—I am quite sure that I made everything safe, and I saw the property there then which we afterwards lost, two bolts of canvas and twelve brushes—I am foreman of the works—I was not there first on the Monday morning; it was one of the young masters—he is not here—I got there at half-past 6—they opened at 6—when I got in I found the place had been disturbed; nobody else had noticed it—no one else has anything to do with the business—I noticed that the canvas and brushes were gone—there is an alley runs down the side of the wall of the premises, and a timber-yard, and anybody could get up if they were lifted by another person, or could get over by getting on to the wood, and there is a dog-hole there which the dog used to go through, and any man can get through that—I can crawl through myself and open the premises easily—there was no break<lb></lb>ing whatever—they withdrew the bolts and opened the doors—the door lead<lb></lb>ing to the wall in Noah's Ark Alley was opposite the White Hart public-house—I know Price, the potman there—on the Monday morning he pointed out the prisoner to me in the street, near the White Swan—I never saw him before.</p>

I live at Union-street, Narrow-street, and am in the prosecutor's service—on Monday morning, 29th February, I was the first person who went to the warehouse after the front doors were unlocked—I got there between 6 and 7, before the last witness—young Mr. Vane was with me—the door which leads into Noah's Ark Alley was unbolted—I got to it from the inside—I communicated that fact when I came out to break<lb></lb>fast at 8 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. On Wednesday, 2d March, about half-past 8 in the evening, I took the prisoner in Commercial-road, Ratcliffe—I told him I should charge him with being concerned with three others, not in custody, with breaking into Mr. Vane's warehouse, 12, Narrow-street, Ratcliffe, and stealing two bolts of canvas, and twelve brushes—he said, "I know nothing about it; if you wanted me, you could have had me before"—I said, "I have been looking for you since Monday"—I took him to the station—he was searched, and I found this knife and a key upon him—I examined the warehouse—there was room enough for a man to get through the dog-hole.</p>

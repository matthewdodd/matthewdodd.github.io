            . I am a labourer. I saw the prisoner near the Cannon brewhouse, with a great-coat and a portmanteau, going towards Sloane-street - it was on a Tuesday evening, about half past six o'clock; but I do not know the day of the month - he had another lad with him, who took the coat and the portmanteau from him. I had seen the prisoner once or twice before. I asked him where he was going - he said, he was carrying it for a gentleman's servant. "I said, I suppose you have taken it from some one;" he made no answer. I heard either him or his companion say, "We must go and get a knife;" they went up Sloane-street.</p>

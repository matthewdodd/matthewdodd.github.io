                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Railway Police Sergeant</hi>). The prisoner Gillies is in the employ of Messrs. Chaplin Horne—his van is No. 626—Billingsley is a van setter in the employ of the London and North Western Railway Company—in consequence of instructions I received I watched the prisoners, and on 13th March, about 7.45 I saw Billingsley go to Pickford's van 238, look at it and 'go away—he returned in a few minutes with Gillies, who mounted the van and examined the goods while Billingsley stood looking at him—Gillies came down and they had a conversation, which I could not hear—they went away and returned in about five minutes—Gillies again mounted the van and handed down this truss (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to Billingsley, who carried it a short distance to Chaplin Horne's van 626—Gillies mounted that van, received the truss from Billingsley and placed it between two casks in the front of the van, under the driving seat—I came out of my hiding place, Gillies jumped down oft the van—Billingsley said something to him which I could not catch—I followed them and stopped them as they were making their way into the street—Gillies said "What are you stopping me for?"—I said "I charge you with stealing that truss"—he said "You have got me, you may make the best of me"—Billingsley said "I was not there when you took me."</p>

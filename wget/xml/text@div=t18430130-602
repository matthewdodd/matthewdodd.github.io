                  </hi>. I am clerk to Richard Twining and others, bankers and tea-dealers, in the Strand. On the 10th of Jan. the prisoner came to the counting-house, and gave an order for some tea, which he said was for Captain Robert Lindsay—I wrote down what he said—this is the memorandum I made at the time, "Captain Robert Lindsay, Glenavon, Tairbach, Margan, Glamorganshire, South Wales"—when I had taken down the order he wished to pay for it, and gave me a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque on Robarts and Co.—this is the cheque—the amount of the goods he ordered was 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—at the time he produced the cheque, he said he had other cheques, but this being nearer to</p>

Vivian and Sons, Paul's-wharf—on the evening in question I gave the cheque, for safety, to another clerk, named Chalklin—I received it again from him next morning, and then, by Mr. Twining' sinstructions, gave it to Mr. Nash—I afterwards received some money from Mr. Nash—I put up the change, which was the difference between the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd and the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque in a piece of paper—the prisoner did not come for the change—after having sealed it in an envelope, and directed it, I left it myself at No. 28, Nottingham-place, I saw a person named Penn there, and left it with him—the goods have been received back from the wharf, at which they were left—he came with, the cheque about half-past six o'clock, after banking hours.</p>

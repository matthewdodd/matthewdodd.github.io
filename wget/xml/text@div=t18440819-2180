                  </hi>. I am a newsvender, at the Railway station, London-bridge, and live in Duke-street, Southwark. In March last I had a cash-box in my bed-room containing 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in gold, and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes, one of which was No. 61086—I took this memorandum from the note when I received it from a customer—I know Buckley—in Nov. last she requested me to lend her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, to relieve her from some embarrassments which she was then in, and she would pay me in a fortnight—I lent it her, but she did not repay me—in Dec. she met me in the Borough, and asked me for the loan of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get a shawl out of pledge, that she might be enabled to get a situation or earn a better living—I said I would not lend her any more money—she said, "I am really in the most destitute condition"—I said if she was so destitute, she might come to my house, and probably my wife would relieve her, by allowing her to remain in the house, and providing her with victuals—next day, when I went home to dinner, I found her there, and there she remained for five weeks, supported by us—in Jan. she obtained a situation as servant of all-work, in the Kent-road—my wife was very ill, and being in want of a servant, Buckley's sister, Brown, came to us immediately after she left—on the 10th of Feb. the sister applied to me for some money, which I lent her—I then prevented Buckley coming to the house, suspecting she had stolen a handkerchief of mine—she did not come to the house after that with my con<lb></lb>sent—at the time she was residing with us, her husband was in Ireland—he was a labourer—at the time I lent her the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, he was keeping a beer-shop in Francis-street, Westminster-road, and their means there were so insuffi<lb></lb>cient, that Messrs. Thone, the brewers, turned them out because they had not money enough to pay them for the beer—I heard that from Buckley—in March her husband was in the hospital—I was not at home on Friday even<lb></lb>ing, the 8th of March—I might have been out as late as eleven—I left my wife at home—a lady, named Thompson, was lodging in the house—in con<lb></lb>sequence of something her servant communicated to me, I made inquiries, and missed my money on Monday the 11th of March, between a quarter and half-past twelve—my wife first missed it—I heard that Buckley had been there on the Friday preceding—nothing was missed between the Friday and the Monday—the last time the cash-box was seen safe was on the Thursday—I know this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note now produced, No. 61086—that, with two others which have not been found, was in the cash-box.</p>

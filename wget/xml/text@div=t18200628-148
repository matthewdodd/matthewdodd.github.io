            . I am a watchman. The prosecutor said he was robbed of 10 s. and his handkerchief, and described the person. I took the prisoner about five o'clock. I found the handkerchief, and two half-crowns tied up in it, on her. Biles described the handkerchief before it was produced. She then said she did take it from his pocket.</p>

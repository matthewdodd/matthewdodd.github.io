On the 18th of October, I went to bed between eight and nine o'clock at night, my doors and windows were all fastened. I rent a little common land; mine is a lone house, and stands on the common. About twelve o'clock or a quarter past, three soldiers burst into the house. I heard them burst the staple from the lock, and immediately jumped out of bed. They first came into the room where my son George and servant boy slept. I heard them say, they were come for the blunt, and the blunt they would have, or they would have our lives - I understood them to mean money. I heard them rumaging my son's room; they then came to my room door - both rooms are on the ground floor - I held the latch of my door as fast as I could. My wife said</p>
               <p>"Let them in," I did so, three of them came in, and demanded my money; I said we were poor people, and had none by us. One said to the other</p>
               <p>"Tie the cord round his neck, and keep him down." My wife said</p>
               <p>"For God's sake do not kill my husband!" they put this cord round my neck (producing it.) and pulled me up by it till I was almost strangled. My wife said</p>
               <p>"George, there is a 1 l. note in the little tin-box, in the chest of drawers, give it to them." George went to fetch it to give them, but they had got it before - I had seen the tin-box in their hands, and heard them knocking it about, but did not see them take the note - it was in my room. They were not satisfied with that, but went up to my wife's bed side, and ordered her out, she got out; they turned the bed down, and between the bed and mattress found four 1 l. notes, and 7 s. which I had put there for safety, about a fortnight before. They robbed the house of 25 lbs. of bacon, two dirty sheets one silk handkerchief, one waistcoat, pretty near a quartern loaf of bread, one piece of soap, and about 4 s., besides that with the notes. They staid in the house about twenty minutes or half an hour; when they left I looked out of the window, and saw them all in the yard, putting their soldiers' great-coats on - I saw by the light of the moon there were five of them in all, four came into the house, and another stood at the door - they had flannel jackets on in the house - they had no light except the light of the moon, which shone very bright in at the window - it was a very light night. I took particular notice of them, and can swear to the prisoner being one of the men who robbed my home, and who ordered the other to put the cord round my neck - I am quite certain of it - I never saw him before to my knowledge - he was in my sight ten minutes, and stood by me while the others plundered. I was very much alarmed, but am sure I am not mistakes. I heard his voice, and was not a yard from him - our room is very small - he is taller than the others. I cannot speak to them, but I am sure of him - he had a flannel jacket on, such as soldiers wear - I observed no other part of his dress. There are a good many soldiers quartered at Hampton and Hampton Court - he was quartered at Hampton Court - the constable and I took him there; we also took three other soldiers and a hostler, upon suspicion - he was discharged before the Magistrate, and the other soldiers put into the guard-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not swear the hostler was the man who put the rope round your neck - A. No, I did not swear to the hostler. The three soldiers were taken before the Magistrate. I said the prisoner was the man who ordered the rope round my neck, and he said if I did not not stand still he would blow my brains out. I swear to his features, as well as his voice - he stood by the side of the window, and the moon shone right into the room.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I was at home this night in the first bed-room with the servant boy, my father and mother were in the next room. I heard the door burst open, it awoke me - three men came tumbling into my room, and asked for the money? I said</p>
               <p>"I do not know of any money in the house, for sometimes we have not got sixpence." They said they had come for the blunt, and the blunt they would have, or they would have our lives. I called out to my mother, and asked if there was any money? she said No, they then went to her room. My father held the door sometime, and then opened it, they went in, and my father said</p>
               <p>"What do you want, my good fellows?" they said they came after the money, and the money they would have. I got out of bed, and went into the room with them. They rummaged about my father's room sometime, and kept asking for the money, and began to tie my father down. A little short soldier put the cord round his neck, and the tall soldier told him to tie him down, he seemed to be the commander of them. The short one had brought the cord with him - they put it about his neck, with a slip loop, and drew him up with their arms. My mother said,</p>
               <p>"Don't hurt my husband!" She was frightened, and told me to go to the little box in the drawer, and give them a 1 l. note. When I came to look it was gone out of the box, and the things rummaged about. They had got it before; the box was opened. There were spoons and things in it, which were not taken. There were also some bills pinned together, which they took out. As they went out they saw by the light in the kitchen that they were not notes, and threw them down. My mother got out of bed; they rummaged the bed and mattress, and took four 1 l. notes and 7 s. from between the bed and mattress, the other one was rummaging my room while the others were in my father's. They took about 4 s. from a box in my room. I know the one who stood in my father's room against the window, it was the prisoner. There were two tall ones, he was rather the tallest - he ordered the man to put the cord round my father's neck. I was close to him all the time they were in my father's room, which was ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280024"></xptr>took particular notice of him, and am very positive he is the man. They all went out together. There were five of them when they got out, as I looked after them. They all appeared dressed alike, except one, who had white trowsers on - they had soldiers' clothes on. When they came into the room they seemed very tightly dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner was taken - A. I came to the house when they had got two, and knew the prisoner instantly, he was in the guard-house. I afterwards heard him speak, and knew his voice. I have not a doubt of his being one of the men. When I looked out of the window they had got their soldiers coats on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you could only swear to my voice - A. No. I said he was the very man before I heard him speak. I swear to his features.</p>

            . I am sergeant of the 21st regiment. The prisoner was a soldier in that regiment; we were quartered at Hampton Court inn - he slept in the same room with me. I remember the night of the 13th of October he did not sleep at his quarters that night - I am sure he was not there at nine o'clock. I did not see him till next morning at eight o'clock. I went to bed at nine - he did not come into the room that night - he could not without my knowing it - other soldiers slept in the room - he ought to have slept there. I heard him say he slept in the hay-loft over the stable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is a large inn, and draws no beer. I stopped in the tap till eleven o'clock, and the house being shut up I went with the rest of my comrades, and slept in the hayloft. A man will swear that I was in my quarters at the time, but he is not here. I wish to ask the sergeant if the prosecutor did not take up a man who slept in the room with him that night.</p>

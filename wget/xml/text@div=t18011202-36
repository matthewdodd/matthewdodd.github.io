Bank-note, three seven-shilling-pieces, half-a-guinea, and some silver, because I had just taken it; Mrs. Dyster got up again, and cried out, stop thief, he has robbed the woman; upon which a gentleman caught him, and brought him back; I am sure that is the boy, because he was right before my face; the box was never found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. It was very dark, and this happened momentary? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You never had seen the person who took the box before? - A. No; but his clothes were particular.</p>

            Had you any occasion to send any part of the 4l. away you had received? - A. No, I am certain of it, because I had been sending 16l. away out of my box before I received the 4l. that was in it.</p>
               <p>MARY DYSTER sworn. - My husband is a butcher, No. 165, Church-street, Bethnal-green:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020029"></xptr>I was at at Mrs. Tuck's, between the hours of seven and eight on the 24th of November, and I know all she as said to be true; I saw the person who took the boy going out, apparently that is the same lad, but I cannot swear to him; I only saw the back going out at the door.</p>
               <p>- MALLOWELL sworn. - I am a weaver, in King-street, Spitalfields; I was opposite to Tuck's shop, and heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner, with one or two persons behind him, as he was crossing to run down Old Nichol-street; I caught him by the collar, and another man immediately got hold of his collar, and begged me to let him go, for that he had him in custody; I said I should not, for I did not know what was the matter; he kept hold of his collar a little way, but I missed him soon; I did not first see the prisoner till he was about thirty yards off Tuck's shop; I believe he fell down, for I heard a splashing, and when I laid hold of him, he was all over mud; I took him back, and he was taken into custody; he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. There were several people running? - A. There were three or four behind, he was the first about four or five yards.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the first time you saw the young man you caught, and that was thirty yards from the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKERY sworn. - I belong to Worship-street; I was sent for to take the prisoner; Mrs. Tuck said, he was the lad; I searched him, and found in his pocket this piece of crape, a glove, a knife, and a penny piece.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. GUILTY, aged 19,</p>

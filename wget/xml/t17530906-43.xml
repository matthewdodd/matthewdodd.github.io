He lodged in the same house, and from that time he deserted his lodgings; he was taken up and confessed the taking the things to me and others, before we went to the justice of peace; he said he left them at a friend's house, and told us where he lived, I went there and found them accordingly, (produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Elison Mood. I have known the prisoner 32 years, and never knew a bad action of him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, living in Glasshouse-yard, Aldersgate-street. In April last I ordered fourteen tons of coals of the prisoner—the-price was to be 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am not at all acquainted with the prisoner—they were to be sent on the following Thursday or Friday—they came with these vender's tickets, which are dated 17th April—I gave the order direct to the prisoner at the prosecutor's wharf—the check produced was given for the fourteen tons of coals—it is drawn by my father, and it is made out to Messrs. Pegg and Co.—it was given to Alfred James, who is in Mr. Pegg's service—this bill was delivered previously; I do not know who by—I think the boy brought it the day before, and said if the money was paid the following day five per cent would be allowed—the amount is 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the date of the check? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The 16th of May—before the transaction we had a van for sale—we had had no dealings with Mr. Pegg at that time, and knew nothing about him—the prisoner came with a man named Wickens, who purchased the van—I should think that was a year and a half before I bought these coals—I cannot recollect whether I asked 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the van.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you afterwards agree to take 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to give Wickens an order for ten tons of coals? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave him an order for ten tons, which I received from Mr. Pegg—Wickens was the retail dealer, I believe—from that time I ordered coals at the same place—the bill for those coals was delivered to Wickens, not to us—I ordered the coals in question at Mr. Pegg's counting-house—I never had any dealings with Pegg till the dealing about the van.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With whom did you deal for these coals? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Pegg—I knew nobody else.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Pegg. I called on Mr. Ware with a hill, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for these coals, by the prisoner's desire—he told me if Mr. Ware would give me a check I was to take off five per cent, discount—I left the bill on the Thurday, and got the check on Saturday—I changed it, and received 2 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and the rest in silver—I gave the whole to the prisoner—in the course of the day he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for my trouble in getting the money—I have collected for him on several occasions—he once before paid me for collecting from the same party—that was the only transaction he paid me for, to the best of my belief—I showed the check to the prisoner, and got the money for it, by his desire.</p>

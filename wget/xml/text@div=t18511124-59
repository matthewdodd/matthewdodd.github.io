                  </hi>. I am the wife of Andrew Devonport, of 9, Harrow-street, Ratcliffe. On the evening of 28th Oct., I was going home,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185111240073"></xptr>
               <p>and met four sailors at the bottom of London-street, Ratcliffe—they were all very much in liquor, walking two and two, and the prisoner and the man who is dead were the last two—I had never seen the deceased before—I saw him afterwards before he died, and since he has been dead, and know him to have been one of the last two, and the prisoner the other—they were about a dozen yards from the other two—I did not see the prisoner do anything, I did not see any knife, but they were in a noisy, drunken state—one of the two last had a very thickish voice, like a foreigner, like a Scotchman—I think that was the deceased—I got a-head of them, as I was afraid they might insult me—I got to my own door, and then saw them go in at the wicket-gate at the coal wharf—that was the last I saw of them—my daughter afterwards asked me to come to the public-house to see a man who was stabbed—I went, and there saw the deceased—he was in a very weak state, sitting on a bench, and leaning forward—the prisoner was lying outside on the cellar-flap, incapable of taking care of himself, in a state of beastly intoxication—he was sick, and had not the power to discharge the contents of his stomach, it gurgled in his throat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-dresser at the London Hospital—the deceased was brought there on 29th Oct.—I found a wound in his back opposite to the fifth and sixth ribs, descending obliquely, and entering the thorax between the ninth and tenth ribs—the wound was about three inches long and one wide—such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) might have produced such a wound—he lingered till 4th Nov., when he died—I was present on 30th Oct, when he made a statement to Mr. Yardley, the Magistrate—it was taken down, read over to him, and he put his mark to it—he was then in a hopeless state—I had not told him so, but he seemed to be aware he could not recover—the prisoner was present, and heard the statement—the deceased was intoxicated when he was brought in. (<hi rend="italic">James Brebar's deposition read:</hi> "I was stabbed the night before last at 9 o'clock—it was dark—it was in a street leading to the Regent's Canal Basin—the man that stabbed me, a ship<lb></lb>mate, and two men, had been drinking with me at the Liverpool Arms—we were all coming away together, and the man that stabbed me asked me to go with him to his ship in the Regent's Canal, and as we were going along the street he pulled out his knife—I asked him what he was going to do with it—the prisoner is the man—he said, 'You will see what the mate will say to me when you get on board'—I said, 'If you do not put up the knife, I will not go with you'—the prisoner said, 'I will let you see what I will do to the mate with it,' and on that he plunged it into my back—I fell down, and was carried into the public-house—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner, not a word—I was a little the worse for liquor—the prisoner was much more drunk—before the prisoner stabbed me in the back he was flourishing the knife about—I am quite sure when he stabbed me he struck at me purposely—I have no more to say—we were in the same house the night before, and parted on friendly terms, like two brothers—there was no cause of quarrel between us."</p>

In consequence of information on 28th Oct., at half-past 9 o'clock, I went to the Three Foxes, and found the deceased there, with a wound in his back—I afterwards found the prisoner on board a ship in the Regent's Canal, in a helpless state through drunkenness—he recovered in two or three hours, and I asked him if he knew what he had been doing—he said he did not know that he had done anything—I got this knife from the captain of the ship—the prisoner belonged to the ship, but the deceased did not—it sailed next morning at half-past 2.</p>

               <p>in the evening, I was in Pump-yard, Ratcliffe, and saw four tailors, two a-head and two about a dozen yards behind—the deceased and a tall man, something of the prisoner's build, were the two last—the deceased had hold of the other man's arm—the deceased said, "You always stick up for me"—the other said, "And so I always will"—about a quarter of an hour after, I saw them go in at the wicket gate, and heard one of them say, "If you don't, you know"—I afterwards saw the deceased, who was wounded, and I after<lb></lb>wards saw him dead.</p>

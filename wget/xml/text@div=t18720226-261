I am the wife of William Frederick Reuss, of Elgin Crescent, Noting Hill—on 7th January I was aroused by the police, went down stairs and found the area door open, the shutters and window open, the hasp pulled back and the kitchen in great confusion—I missed spoons, forks, knives, coffee-pots, teapots, and things belonging to the servants, and upstairs a dressing-case was broken open and on opera-glass and some pistols were taken—this is my opera-glass (produced) I bought it in Vienna—some cigars which had been in this box (produced) were strewed about the room—here is a mark of blood inside the box which was not there before.</p>

On the morning of 3rd, January I saw this house—the glass of the window was broken—I pushed it, but could not get in, and went on—I was afterwards aunt to make inquiries—on 20th January I took the prisoner at the Elgin public-house, Noting Hill, and told him the charge—he made no reply—I said "You will have to go with me to the station"—we walked a long distance, and then he said "You have made a great mistake this time"—I said "I do not think I have, for I have found the opera-glass, pawned, no doubt, by you"—he made no reply—I said "And I know where you offered the other things as well as the opera-glass for sale previous to it being pawned"—he said "You are right; I am sold; who do you think sold them? why, Harry Ransom"—afterwards he said "Well, I did not do the job, but I had rather stand to it than <hi rend="italic">round</hi>"—I found this scarf (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) round his neck, ado took it oft—he made no reply, but at the Police Court, on the remand, he said "I can tell you where I bought the scarf, in the Edward Road, at the corner of John Street—a piece of skin, about the size of a pea, had been knocked off his left hand, and was healing up.</p>

            . I keep a horse and cart; I was employed by Mr. Riley, one of the assignees, to accompany him to No. 20, Nelson-square, Stoke Newington. On the 6th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I went with him, and rang at the bell. No answer being made, I got leave to go through the next house, and entered at the back door, which was open; I found a man, in a sailor's dress, cleaning knives in the back kitchen; the prisoner came down with a pistol in each hand, asked my name, and what authority I had there? I told him that I was regaining possession by a deed of assignment to the assignees. He asked where the authority was? I took the assignment from under my waistcoat, and showed it to him; he said I must give it to him; I said I must not part with it, nor would I, but if he would come down stairs, and lay the pistols down like a gentleman, I would read it to him - he was on the stairs, and I was on the kitchen floor. He said if I did not give it to him he would blow my brains out; I told him he certainly must, for I would not give it up to him - he then went up stairs. I then went, and beckoned to Riley, and he came in the same way that I did. As soon as he entered, the prisoner came down again, and was in conversation with him for a quarter of an hour; he said he had bought the things. Riley told him to act like a gentleman, and anything he could prove belonged to him, he should have.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it that he attempted to fire at you - A. He was talking about our going out for about ten minutes, and said he was master of the house, and that it became every man to defend his castle - he presented a pistol in his right hand, and fired it at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything to the man in the kitchen - A. He called out to him, Oliver, to come up - he did not go up; he immediately took an aim, and fired as quick as he could - he stood about seven stairs up, and I was about a yard from the bottom; I put my arm up, and felt something strike my wrist, which numbed my arm from my fingers to my elbow - I received no further injury then. He immediately presented the other pistol in his left hand, and fired it, he said nothing - I felt nothing from that - I found a mark on the kitchen door next day.</p>
               <p>Q. After the pistols were fired what was done - A. He ran up into the parlour, Riley and I pursued him - we entered the parlour, he then presented a naked sword at me; I hit his arm up, and Riley knocked it out of his hand with the tongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer him any personal violence before he fired at you - A. No, nor did I touch anything in the house - he was taken before the magistrate, and admitted to bail, being charged only with an assault; my coat and waistcoat were quite unbuttoned when he fired - next morning I found a ball in my left-hand waistcoat-pocket, which I produce; I showed it to my father, and accompanied him to the kitchen, and only found a graze on the door, apparently with a pistol ball, in the direction which he fired the second pistol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How do you live - A. By my horse and cart, at the Cock and Magpie, Kingsland; Riley asked me to go with him, and gave me the assignment.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pistols had you in your hand - A. None, I had one in my side-pocket, but not in my hand; I had put it there to be repaired - it was empty. The kitchen door stood on my left-hand, Riley was behind me; the graze was at the top of the under panel of the door. He took a deliberate aim at me - he was about four yards from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the magistrate about anything striking against your arm - A. Yes, there was no hole in my coat; the skin was grazed, and my shirt was a little bloody; Riley knocked the prisoner down, after he had attacked me with the sword - some blood came from his head - we afterwards took him out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever go by the name of Barlow - A. No; some people call me so, as it is my father-in-law's name.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you present any pistol at the prisoner - A. No; he got his head cut, by Riley forcing the sword from him - he threw both the pistols on the table.</p>

            . I am one of the assignees, and live in Finsbury-place. I never saw the prisoner until I went to the house with Dale to regain possession. Dale got through the next house; I remained in front, and saw Cooper in the parlour, he moved his hand at me, as if to say he would not come to the door. I went round, and entered in at the back; Cooper came down with a pistol in each hand, about five minutes after, stationed himself about the sixth stair, and demanded of me my authority for being there; Dale handed me the assignment, I showed it to the prisoner, requested him to lay down his pistols, and I would read it to him, and if he could prove that any of the property belonged to him, he should have it; Dale stood between the stairs and the kitchen door. Cooper took an aim at him; seeing the flash, and hearing the explosion, I ran to the kitchen fire, and took up the tongs - before I came to the door, the second pistol was fired.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the pistols pointed - A. Downward, in the direction Dale stood; he retreated up into the parlour, and we followed, When I entered into the parlour, he was making a cut at Dale with the sabre; I knocked it out of his hands with the tongs, and cut his head, which produced blood.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Dale produce any pistol - A. No; no violence whatever was offered to the prisoner, except what I did with the tongs.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you say regain possession, did you suppose force wanted to be used - A. Yes; Cooper asked me up into the parlour to read the assignment; I said I could not, but if he would come down, I would read it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Dale said nothing to him - Q. Cooper d - d his eyes, and Dale did the same - he showed me the mark in his arm.</p>

            . I live with the prisoner as his servant, and was in the house when this happened. The prisoner told me two or three days before, that if I went to his closet, not to touch the pistol case as they were loaded, for fear they should go off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I believe I am not of a vicious disposition; Dale entered the house with a pistol in his hand - I heard a noise, came down, and asked him why he was there? He produced his pistol, and said that was his authority. I then went up stairs, and got my pistols, which I had got at a distress for rent. I supposed that I had a right to the property, as I had paid for it; he took hold of my pistol. Dale d - d my eyes, presented his pistol at me, and turned his head on one side, as if he thought I should fire at him; I found the assignee there. One of them was armed with a crow-bar, and the other with the tongs; he said he would knock me down. I presented my pistols, and told Dale that if he did not remove his pistol, I would fire; he pulled the trigger of his pistol, but it did not go off. I then fired mine, but held it in a direction that it should not hurt him - the balls were so loose in, that they both fell out, and I picked them up. When Dale was at the office, he said if they had been loaded they must have killed him - I was bailed. An indictment was found against me at Clerkenwell, but I did not get out of the way; they said if I did not come to their terms, they would capitally indict me - I should not have fired if Dale had not presented his pistol at me. I had written to Mr. Gurney to tell him, that if they came I would give them plenty of powder to frighten them, but would not hurt them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HERRITAGE, clerk to the magistrates of Worship-street, was called on the prisoner's behalf, and read the deposition of Dale, which exactly agreed with his evidence.</p>

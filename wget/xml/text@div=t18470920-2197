                  </hi> I am in the service of John Simpson, a boot and shoe<lb></lb>maker, of Tottenham Court-road—Cooper was in his employ as shopman for about six months—Poole has been a workman two or three years—these boots are my master's who is ill, and cannot attend—this other pair of boots and shoes are his—I cannot say that they were stolen—they were not sold.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, E</hi> 114.) On Wednesday evening, the 1st of Sept., I was watching near the prosecutor's—I saw Cooper go from the shop and look in the public-house once or twice—Poole came out and spoke to him—at half-past nine I saw Cooper put the lights out in the shop—he then went to the public-house with something in a handkerchief and saw Poole—he gave it him—he put it into a bag and went into the public-house again—Cooper returned to the shop and then came and went to the public-house, and he and Poole went together to the corner of Little Queen-street—Poole stopped at any oyster-stall—I went up to him and said, "What have you got here?"—he said, "What is that to you?"—I said, "I shall take you into custody;" and I called another constable—Cooper ran up towards Holborn—I took Poole to the station—I found this pair of boots in the bag—I said, "You do not mean to say anything about these boots?"—he said, "I dare say you know all about it"—I went to his house and there found.</p>

               <p>thirty-one duplicates for boots and shoes, the whole of which were identified by Mr. Simpson after they were given up at the police court—some of then are produced here by the pawnbroker—I afterwards took Cooper—I found a duplicate at his place for a pair of boots which have been identified by Mr. Simpson.</p>

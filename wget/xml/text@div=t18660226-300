On Thursday morning, 1st February, I was on duty at Green-street, Bethnal-green, and heard the smashing of window-glass—I saw the prisoner running away, ran after him, and caught him—he said, "Hallo, what's up! I've done nothing," and tried hard to get away—another constable came up, and we took him back to the place from which I had seen him running away, which was Mr. Spiegelhalter's shop—I then called up the prosecutor, and asked him if he had lost any<lb></lb>thing—the shutters were down, and the windows broken, and the prisoner's hands were bleeding—the prosecutor said nothing had been taken away—I noticed watches handing inside the window—there was blood on the pave<lb></lb>ment opposite where the window was broken—the other constable inspected the inside of the shop, while I retained my hold of the prisoner—I after<lb></lb>wards took him to the station.</p>

About twenty minutes to 2 o'clock on the morning of 1st February, I saw the shutters down at 4, Green-street, Bethnal-green—I saw the prisoner run away, and Thurston after him—when he was taken, he struggled very hard to get away—we took him back to the house, and called up the occupier to examine the premises—we found a square of glass broken—the prisoner's hand was very much cut and several drops of blood were about—there were watches in the window, brooches, earrings, and so on.</p>

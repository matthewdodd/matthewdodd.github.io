                  </hi>. I am a boiler-maker, of 59, Old King-street, Deptford—on Sunday evening, 23d October, I was at the Dog and Bell public-house with Thomas Bell—I retired to the back yard—while there I heard Bell call out, "Help, Charley!"—I knocked at the back-door—the landlord let me in, and let me out at the side door, and I saw the prisoner and Bell struggling on the ground together—Bell said, "Help me, I am being murdered"—I laid my hand on the prisoner's shoulder, and said, "Allow him to get up"—with that I received a stab on my left arm, and on putting my hand up I felt the wet blood on my arm—I received another in the side—I fell against the wall, and the knife caught me in the left hip, and split my trousers up—the prisoner did that—I saw the knife, it was a pocket-knife—I could not swear to it—on receiving the stabs I ran out into the middle of the road, and saw a marine, and said, "Marine, see if he has got a knife, I am stabbed"—the marine ran and caught the prisoner, and struggled with him—he could not get the knife from him—the prisoner made his escape up Old King-street—I went home—next morning I went to a medical man and had my wounds dressed—I felt pain and inconvenience from them—I have only done one day's work since, and then I had to knock off, it turned to erysepelas in my arm—the wounds were very severe, the one on the arm especially.</p>

I am a labourer of 87, New-street, Deptford—I was at the Dog and Bell, on Sunday evening, 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> October—about 11 o'clock I went out for a purpose, and when I was going in again the door was locked, and the prisoner and Elliott were standing at the door—I pushed Elliott by to get in; he pushed me—the prisoner interfered and asked me what I was pushing him for—I asked him what he had got to do with it—he said he would soon let me see, and pushed mc down in the passage and got my thumb in his mouth,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186411210083"></xptr>
               <p>and kept it in for about five minutes—he hit me—there were scars—I called out to my friend Irving, and he came—I heard him cry out that he was stabbed, and I asked a marine to see if he had a knife—I did not see Irving stabbed—I did not see a knife in the prisoner's hand; it was dark—I suffered a little pain with my thumb—I was quite sober—I had had a pot of beer—the old man told me next morning that he had been robbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The reason I bit his thumb was because he had got hold of my coat, and I could not get away, and they kicked me on the head. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I had not got hold of his coat; I was on the ground and he was a top of me.</p>

I am a marine, stationed at Deptford Dockyard—I was at the Dog and Bell at 11 o'clock on this night—I went outside the door at shutting up time—I saw the prosecutor—he said he bad been, stabbed, and wanted me to see if the prisoner had a knife in his hand—I went up to him; he had the handle of the knife in his hand, and I had only the blade to get hold of, and I cut my hand with the blade—I asked him to give me the knife; he would not—I threw him on the ground, he got up and ran away—I saw the prosecutor leaning against some palings—he wanted some one to take him home, but my leave had expired, and I was obliged to go into bar<lb></lb>racks—I did not hear any one complain of being robbed—I did not see any old man there, nobody but the prisoner and prosecutor—the prisoner had been drinking, the prosecutor was sober, and Bell also.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody from information I received at 6 o'clock on Monday morning—I had seen he prisoner about twenty minutes past 11 running from that direction, and he then wanted me to take him to a doctor to get his head dressed—I said it was not my duty, if he went into that locality and got his head broke he must put up with the consequences; with that he went away—he had been drinking—he was bleeding from the head at the time—when I took him into custody he was in bed—I said, "I want you; you were in a row in Duke-street last night"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You are suspected of using a knife down there"—he said, "I don't know anything about using a knife, I was in a row and lost my hat"—I searched him, and in the left trousers pocket I found this clasp-knife—there was blood on the handle and on the point of it, and it is there now—it was very dark at 11 o'clock on this Sunday night, and it was rather a dark place where the row took place.</p>

               <p>been done with a knife, but the edges were ragged and irregular, and had more the appearance of a tear; there was was no wound there—the wound in the arm was dangerous from its neighbourhood to the principal artery—I should say the wounds had been given with considerable violence, and with a sharpish instrument—I think a knife might do it.</p>

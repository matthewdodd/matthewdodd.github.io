               <p>I am a poor working man; I did not see the man take the things; I heard the alarm, and I pursued; I did not loose sight of him from the first alarm till he was taken; Broderick pointed out to me the man I was to follow; he turned down the lane into Blue Anchor-yard; when I catched him, he begged I would let him go; he said, it was all a joke,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090061"></xptr>and then the constable came up and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Be so good to ask him whether he did not come into the place, where I was locked up, and said, he was very sorry that he had taken me, for he believed I was not the man that took them. - I said, I was sorry that I took him, because it hindered me my time in being obliged to go before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My lord it was between seven and eight o'clock, I was going to my work, going by the door the prosecutor he was reading the news paper, and he asked me if I wanted to buy any thing? I was rather in liquor, and he took hold of my arm, and I told him I did not, and he gave me a shove, and the trowsers were taken off the door, and the other gentleman called out to him the trowsers were taken off the door, the person ran down the street, and I went after them both, and went as far as this turning, and there we lost the other man, and they immediately laid hold of me, and they took me into a public house very nigh, and we had two or three pots of purl, we set there very near an hour and then he went and fetched this gentleman from across the way.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is not one word true; I did not drink a drop of purl with him, the constable took him into the public house he called for a pint of purl and drank it himself in the corner.</p>

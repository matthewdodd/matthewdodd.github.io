                  </hi>. I keep the Gordon Arms, 262, High Holborn—on Saturday night, 8th March, about 11.30, the two prisoners came into my house with two other men—after they had been there some time they began knocking one another's hats off, and scuffling about—I ordered the barman, Spence, to turn them out—I got over the bar to assist him; the two prisoners were then standing pretty close together—Dwyer had got a mark on his nose, and he said "This is a fine thing for me to go to work on Monday"—I said "You must <hi rend="italic">go</hi> out"—one of them kicked me on the leg, and I felt a jerk at my waistcoat pocket, where my watch was—I turned round, and said "I have got such a kick on the leg from one of them, and my watch is gone"—I went to Field, and said "You have got my watch"—he said "I have not"—some of them screamed out that the barman was being killed outside, and I went round to the door to go out—Dwyer was outside then, and Field was inside—two policemen came in and took Field—I saw his hand go, and I said "There goes my watch"—it was thrown on to the floor, and someone picked it up—I gave him into custody—I believe the policeman picked up the bow of the watch afterwards.</p>

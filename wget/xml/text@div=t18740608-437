E"—I saw the prisoner afterwards at Mr. Lewis's—he said "I have come to pay the money"—I said "That's all right, come in doors, for we are all here "—he went into Mr. Lewis's—he said he had got a friend, who he would go down and see, who would give me the money, and he would pay at 6 o'clock in the evening.</p>

I am manager for Mr. Walmersth, of Curzon Street—I have known prisoner a great many years in the neighbourhood—on the 30th April he came to the shop—he said he came from Mr. Warren to ask me to change a cheque for him—this is the cheque, dated 30th April, 1874, drawn upon the Birkbeck Bank by Edward Wilson. "Pay Mr. Wilding the sum of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I saw it was payable to order and asked him to write his name on the back, which he did—I paid it into the bank the next day with other money, and it was returned the following Monday marked "N.

Henry Yorke that was endorsed, and believing the prisoner was still in his employ—the cheque had not been returned at this time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside at 7, Stock well-place, Stockwell—I know Mary Ann Newton, she was my cook—she was in my service four years and three months nearly—she left my house in February last—I think it was on the Saturday the 21st—I did not find out the robbery till 14th March—she asked my leave to go and see her sick mother down at Yarmouth—she said she had had a letter saying that her mother was dangerously ill, almost dying, and that she was always crying for "Mary Ann"—she was away for three weeks—I next saw her on the Wednesday following, the 14th March, on that day I missed 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and all my trinkets, diamond rings, two gold chains, which Newton left the duplicates for, two gold rings, a gold eye-glass, and a purse—the notes were two tens, and the rest in 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—Newton was to come back the following Monday—she only went for two days, because I could not spare her longer—the money was taken from a drawer in my bed-room, which was looked—I can speak to that, and I found four false keys afterwards—I had seen the money safe a few weeks before the 21st, because I had it to buy some carpets for my house—I did not see it after Newton left—I kept the key of the drawer on my bunch of keys, which I kept in my pocket—I found some other keys in one of my drawers in my dressing-room—they were never mine—these are the keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have ascertained that one of them will open the drawer in my bed-room, in which I keep my money—this one will open the drawers in the wardrobe, in the dressing-room—some shirts were kept in that wardrobe—I missed them after I missed the money—I saw Newton at the police-court on 18th March; she gave herself up—previously to that the prisoner called upon me; I think it was on the Mon<lb></lb>day before—I first saw him, when he came to administer a prayer after the tea—that is nearly nine months back; in the winter time—it was quite dark, and I could not see him; it was before Christmas—my cook said it was cus<lb></lb>tomary to have a prayer after their tea, and would I have him up, and he came to my dining-room and prayed, and both the servants were there; that was the first time—I next saw him perhaps a fortnight afterwards, going down the stairs of my house, and I never saw him after that till Newton was taken in charge—when the detective was going after her, I said, "If you keep close to her, you will find Wycherley"—when he came to my house on the Monday, I said, "Oh, Mr. Wycherley, it is you, is it? I con<lb></lb>sider you are the rich uncle, and you know where Newton is"—I told him</p>

               <p>Newton had said something about a rich uncle—he said he knew nothing it all about her—I said that she had robbed me of a great amount of money and other things, and that he had changed a note in the Borough—he said, "I changed a note in the Borough, but I never had a farthing of the money"—I wished to know where he had changed the note, and he went out of my dining-room directly—I never saw any more of him till the Wednesday following, two days after—he came into my dining-room, and I said, "Well, Mr. Wycherley, have you got Newton?" and he said, "Yes; she has given herself up," or rather, he said, "I was going to give her up if she had not"—I said, "I think you are concerned with Newton, and you ought to be given in charge"—I made a move as if I was going to touch the bell, and he went out of the room directly—he said nothing more then—there was no conversation upon that day about the money that I can remember—I re<lb></lb>member a Mrs. Ballard's name being mentioned—that was on the Monday—I said to the prisoner, "You have been out with my cook, Newton, several times, to Mrs. Ballard's, and several times you have been walking out with her about the neighbourhood"—he said he went to do his duty, to adminis<lb></lb>ter the Gospel to Mrs. Ballard—I told him he knew where Newton was, and he said he would go out and try and find her—I did not ask him to find the money—I said he had got the money, I knew that—he said he had not; he knew nothing of any money, only that note he changed in the Borough—he did not say what sort of note it was—I did not see him after the Wednesday till he was taken in custody some two or three weeks afterwards—I have the numbers of the notes that were stolen, in my housekeeping-book—I have looked at these notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) before, they are mine, and the numbers are the same as are entered in my housekeeping-book.</p>

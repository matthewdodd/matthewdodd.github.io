                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 196.) On the 5th of Sept., I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, and saw White in Old Montague-street, with a bundle under her shawl—I said, M What have you got there?"—she said she had two bottles of wine—I said, "Where did you get them?"—she said she bought them at Bermondsey—I said, "Where are you taking them?"—she said to a friend—I said, "Let me see the two bottles"—she</p>

               <p>opened the bundle, and I found three bottles I said, "You have got three, how do you account for the third one?"—she hesitated, and said she intended to make a present of it to her landlady—she said it was brandy—it turned out to be wine—I took her to the station—the inspec<lb></lb>tor asked her where she got the wine from—she said she bought it at the Portugal hotel—we asked if she bought it at the bar—she said she bought it of Thomas Close, for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took one of the bottles to the Portugal hotel—it has the name of Edwards on it—I saw Mrs. Oliver there, and she identified the bottle as being one similar to her own—Close was there—I was in plain clothes—Mrs. Oliver told him to go with me—there was no charge made against him, and he did. not know I was a policeman—I at last took him to the station in Spital-square—he was some little dis<lb></lb>tance from White—Mrs. Oliver was to follow us to the station—before she arrived I heard Close say to White, "This is kindness"—when Mrs. Oliver arrived, the inspector said, in Close's presence, that White had said she obtained the wine from him—the three bottles were produced—Close made no answer—the inspector asked him if he wished to say anything before the charge was taken—he said, "No"—that was after White had said she bought it of him—I found in his pocket a piece of paper addressed to E. White—I saw him with his hand in his pocket—the papers were torn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of the Portugal hotel, Fleet-street. Close was in my service as under porter since 2nd of Jan.—on Friday, the 6th of Sept., the policeman came to me, and produced one of these bottles—I recognised it as one similar to my own by a name on it—in consequence of what he said, I desired Close to accompany him—I said, "I would wish you to go with this person, and wait till I come; you will probably have something to bring back"—I did that to throw him off his guard—I went to the station, and saw the two prisoners together there—the three bottles were produced—I know one bottle by the name of Edwards on the cork—he is agent for Allsop's ale—it is an ale-bottle, but now contains wine—I never used it for wine—I know this other bottle—it has the name of Powell and Co. branded at the bottom—we had a large supply of these, and are ten short—it contains brandy—I have tasted the wine—it has been mixed—the brandy is the same quality as I have in my cellar.</p>

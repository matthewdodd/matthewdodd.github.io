                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Royal palaces, under the Lord Chamberlain, and reside in Buckingham-palace—the prisoner was employed in June lust as a cabinet-maker in the Royal establishment, and has so been for two months this time—before that he had been employed for some time—I have looked at the pieces of silver produced, they form part of an equestrian statue—after this matter became the subject of inquiry, I ascertained that a statue of this kind was missing—I referred to my books and sought for the statue at the place where I supposed it was, and could not find it—it is a figure of Louis XIII and Marshal Saxe, one figure, with two shifting heads—the last time I saw it it was in a cupboard on the third shelf, on the right hand side, in one of the libraries used as a luncheon-room, on the ground-floor—the value of the statue is about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the vase about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are the property of the Queen—the vase was not missed until afterwards—it was kept in the library adjoining the luncheon-room—on Saturday afternoon, 14th June, I heard of this on coming to town—I went to the presses on the Monday—they were locked, as usual—there are two master-keys, which open all the presses—one key was kept in the office in the key-box—I found that key safe and apparently not interfered with—there had been some changes of the locks, I cannot exactly tell what it was, but when I came to search for these I found a lock off one of the other presses—a key made to fit that lock would no doubt pass the locks of the presses in which these things were kept—Mr. Collins, the foreman of the cabinet-makers, pointed out to me where he saw the pri<lb></lb>soner on the evening of the 13th, that is quite at the extreme end of the palace from the cabinet-makers' shop—one is at the north wing, the other at the south—I do not know how the prisoner was employed that day—if he was employed in the work shop it would not be in his way to leave to go up stairs—I have pointed out to Mr. Chappell the spot where the presses are—her Majesty occasionally resides at Buckingham-palace.</p>

I was on duty on Saturday morning, the 14th of June, at Bow-street, acting as gaoler—the prisoner was confined there on this charge over night—in the morning he asked me if I could send a note to his wife—I told him I would endeavour to do so—he asked if I could give him a piece of paper and a pencil, I supplied him with it, and he wrote this note, and requested me to send it to her—he wrote it in my presence—I took it to inspector Black, who returned it to me, and directed me to keep it—I have kept it in my custody ever since. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>)—"Dear wife,—I hope you will make yourself as happy as you can. Be sure you take this to Mr. Watson, and be particular in saying these words at the office when you are asked: I shall state, a foreign gen<lb></lb>tleman came to lodge with us about two years ago, and boarded and lodged with us, and to pay 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week; and he told us he must be off to France, as he had got some very particular business, and he would leave some old silver which he had by him, and if he did not return in three months, he should not come back to England, and we might consider it our own property. Be sure and bear in mind he could not give any reference, as we have been empty some time of any lodgers, and he was the only one we had at the time he was lodging at our house, and we had no servant at that time. Be sure and say I asked, if we got into trouble about selling it, to give the name of Mr. John Johnson, 54, Seymour-street; but don't be positive of the number of the house. Be sure and make away with the key and the other things, Mr. Watson put you in the way. Give the bearer 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Tell Mr. Watson be sure to go and see old Mr. Ladd, if he knows my face, as he took me from Pimlico to Long-Acre, who left my bag and the vase, and told him I should not be long: he will tell you what became of it. To Mrs. Taylor, No. 7, Gil<lb></lb>lingham-street, Vauxhall-road, Pimlico."</p>

Q.</hi> How long have you been a policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six years and eight months—I have frequently been called upon to perform the office of gaoler at Bow-street, where I have had prisoners under my charge—I had no particular fancy for this man—he knocked at the door of the cell, and I went up to him—he asked if I could send a message or note to his wife—I told him I would endeavour to do so—I did not intend to send it until after I had shown it to the inspector—it was for him to judge whether he would send it or not—I said nothing to the prisoner after showing it to the inspector—I lent him the paper and pencil—I did not take up the note and say, "Let us read it"—I swear that—I read none of it until he gave it into my hands—I left the cell two or three times while he was writing, for a minute or so—I did not come in after<lb></lb>wards and say, "Well, <hi rend="italic">old chap</hi>, is it done?—"I swear I made no such observation—I went to the cell two or three times, and he said, "I am not ready," and I went away again—I did not ask him two or three</p>

               <p>times, "Have you done; is it ready?"—I did not run to the inspector, and tell him he was going to write a letter—the prisoner said he would pay a man for going—he did not ask me how much it would be—he said, "I suppose half-a-crown will satisfy him?"—I said, "I don't know any<lb></lb>thing about it"—he did not say he supposed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would be enough nor did I say, "No, it must be half-a-crown"—he did not give any money—he said there was some money of his in the station-house, but he would put on the note for his wife to pay the half-crown—I said I would endeavour to send to his wife—I will not be exactly positive whether I said, "Send," or, "Send <hi rend="italic">it</hi>"—I did not hold up the letter as I went out of the cell, and put it under my coat, nor pretend to look round, as if somebody was watching—I swear that—I took the letter to inspector Black—I do not know whether he is here—I gave the prisoner no reason to suppose it would not be delivered—I did not make any remark to him whatever—he was examined before the Magistrate the same morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the clerks of the police-court, Bow-street—I attended the prisoner's examination on this charge, on Saturday, the 14th of June—he was then charged on the evi<lb></lb>dence of Mr. Seymour and Selly with offering this property for sale—he made a statement which I took down—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"I took the silver to this gentleman's shop to sell; he asked me where I lived; I said, John John<lb></lb>son, and a street in Somers-town; being the name and address of the per<lb></lb>son for whom I was selling it. This silver, I must tell your Worship, was, about two years ago, brought by a foreigner who lodged at my house; he said he came from France; the next day he said he must be off for the continent, and this old silver which he left behind I might take care of; he said he should be back in about three months; he has not been back; the gentleman said, when I disposed of it, I was to give the name of John Johnson, of Upper Seymour-street, the number I have forgotten; I live myself at No. 6, Gillingham-street, Vauxhall; the silver was all broken up when it was left with me."</p>

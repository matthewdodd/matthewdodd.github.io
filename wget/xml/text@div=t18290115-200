            . On Wednesday evening, the 17th of December, this coat hung on the parlour door, between the parlour and shop - the shop was shut up about four o'clock; I had been into the yard, and as I came back, the prisoner stood in the shop, offering frying-pans for sale; I declined buying them; he sidled out of the shop - I missed the coat, looked round the door - post, and saw him on the pavement with it; I pulled part of it from him - he tustled with me for it; I called Stop thief ! my boy came out - a person came, and pushed him into the shop, he was secured - it was my husband's coat; he said he had done nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was the door shut? A.It was on a spring-lock; he must have pushed with violence to get in; I did not tell the Magistrate it was ajar: I saw the coat on you before you left the shop - it is a tailor's shop; I deal in brokering myself; he said, "Lord have mercy on me; what could I have done? and Oh, dear, what could the matter be? and "Oh, dear, don't hurt me;" I do not think he said he did it through distress - he talked foolish.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Clements: about seven o'clock, mistress was gone out into the yard; the prisoner came in to sell some frying-pans; one door was fastened up entirely, but the other door he had to push very hard to get open - he had three large frying-pans, and placed them all round the door for mistress to look at; I said I did not think they would suit her, but he could stop a few minutes to see - I was at work with my back to him, and did not see him take the coat; when he was gone, I heard her say, "Where is the coat?" she went out, and called Stop thief! I went out, and found the coat under his arm - he kept hold of it, and was shoved into the shop.</p>

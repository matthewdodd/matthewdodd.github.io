On the 9th of November, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in Guildhall-yard; it being Lord Mayor's day a great many persons were assembled, but the crowd was not very great where I was standing - I had been into Aldermanbury, and am positive my handkerchief was safe in <placeName id="t18301209-55-crimeloc321">Guildhall-yard</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090035"></xptr>you to Guildhall? A. I had been to Aldermanbury on business; I heard a great noise in King-street, and went to see what it was - there was a considerable crowd in Guildhall-yard, but not where I stood; there was no other person about him at the time - there was nobody behind me but him; my turning round did not cause the handkerchief to go from me, for I turned in a contrary direction, which would have loosened it instead of tightening it - there were perhaps a thousand persons about Guildhall-yard, but none of them are here; the Magistrate said it was not necessary.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor swears false, for I did not take it out of his pocket - I picked it up from the ground, held it up, and asked who it belonged to; the prosecutor caught hold of me, and said it was his, and took it from me a good while before he took me into the office.</p>
               <p>MR. PAINE. I did not hear him ask to whom it belonged - he could not have done so without my hearing it; nor was there time for him to do so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How happened it that nobody went into the office who saw the transaction? A. A great many went in, who offered to give evidence, but the Magistrate said it was not necessary - two boys were in the yard who appeared to be the prisoner's companions.</p>

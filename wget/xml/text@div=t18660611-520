                  </hi>. I live at 2, Love-court, Ratcliffe-highway—on Saturday night, 4th June, I was in my house waiting up for my son—I fell asleep beside the fire-place—I awoke at 3 o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner looking at me where I laid—I got frightened, and screamed for police, and asked who he was—he never answered me, but flew out of the door—I ran after him, and halloed out "Police"—the front door was shut when I went to sleep, but not bolted, and the inside door was latched—I did not miss anything at that time—I acquainted a policeman of it, and on my return, I picked up my husband's trousers and coat—I shortly afterwards went out again, and two policemen came down with the prisoner in custody—the policeman asked me, "Would I know the man"—I said, "Yes, that was he," and I looked again at him, and saw my husband's comforter round his neck, and my daughter said, "Mother, he has got my father's coat on him," and he had—I identified it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. On Saturday night, I came ashore from my ship to buy some little articles to take aboard; I bought them and put them in my coat pocket; I got intoxicated, and lay in some court drunk till early in the morning, and when I woke, I found my coat and articles gone; I went into the first house that was open; I did not know where I was. My ship is in Shad well-basin now, and the officers could give me a character; I was never in London before; I did not know where I was.</p>

The prisoner was not drunk when I took him—he had the appearance as if he had been drinking—he could walk, and he knew what he was about perfectly well—he did not run at all—I have not found out whether he had just left his ship—he gave me no address—he said his ship lay in Shadwell-basin.</p>

I think my husband's coat had been placed on a box by the side of the bed—the bed was in the room I was sitting in, on the first floor—the trousers and comforter were on the bed-rail—the out-side door was closed, and the inside door was latched—there was no open door for anybody to come in at, not without lifting the latch—that could be done from the outside.

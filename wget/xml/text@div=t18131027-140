            . I am land steward and bailiff of the duke of Northumberland. I reside in his premises. On the 30th of September, we had been drawing the ponds in the Commons. We collected the fish to put in the yard of the dwelling-house; they were stolen on the 8th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity do you suppose there were of fish there - A. Of tench, ninety brace had been put in just at the time of the robbery; carp, exactly thirty brace were put in. On the 8th of October, in the morning, I came down the yard between the hours of six and seven; I came down the yard and gave the men orders. I perceived a net had been drawn, I then immediately called the keeper, and traced where the net had gone, by the droppings of the mud, as it was carried along to the Back-lane to a gate; there I saw they had throwed the net down and taken the fish out. I saw where the net had been throwed down, and the fish taken out in the night; the dew being so strong upon the grass, I followed the track across the lawn into the meadow, to a river at the old bridge that leads down to the Thames; it is part of the Old Brent; there I could see very plain a boat had been, and left its mark. I could also see tracks of men's feet where they put the net in, it being heavy; there were not less than three or four tracks across the meadow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drag the pond afterwards - A. I did. I am perfectly aware that they had dragged the pond. I traced the tracks to the old bridge, and then to ascertain the loss I directed our boats to be got, and a net to drag the pond of carp. I should think about thirty brace were gone, and perhaps sixty brace of tench gone; the carp were large, and the tench small.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner fishing at the old bridge before - A. I had; he is a fisherman. In the duke's pond no person has a right to fish there. The duke gives nobody leave to fish there.</p>

            . I am a fish salesman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270072"></xptr>at Billingsgate. On Saturday, the 9th of October, the prisoner came to me at Billingsgate; he offered me a lot of tench and carp, which he said, lay alive in his boat off Billingsgate. I bought seventy-five pounds weight of tench, at eight-pence a pound; they were very small. There were near one hundred brace, and a lot of carp. I gave him eighteen shillings for the lot. I saw a small pike, and two or three roaches, and some perches. I asked him how he came by these fish; he said, he had been employed to drag Lord Essex's pond, at Watford, and that the steward, or bailiff, had sold him this lot. He then brought the tench home in a basket, and had them weighed. He gave me his direction, Hermitage Bagley, at Teddington, Middlesex; he called himself a fisherman. I asked him if he was one of the Bagley's family, who lived at Stranham-green: he told me he was, but he lived at Teddington. I am sure he is the man that I had the fish of.</p>

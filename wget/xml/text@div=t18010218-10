               <p>Q.Upon the 9th of February, was the prisoner at work in the top warehouse? - A. Yes, he was; he had been employed about a year and a half; I saw the prisoner, about a quarter past one o'clock, turn down one of the alloys, and take the lid off one of the tea-chests, and put his hand into it, and take tea out, and put it into something, and then put it into his breeches; I then went to Pepperal, the commodore, whom the prisoner worked under, and gave him information of what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had told Mr. Pepperal, did you go back? - A. I went back, and pointed the prisoner out to him, after shewing him the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. On looking at the chest, did you find any deficiency? - A. I did; I have no more to say; he was taken into custody by Pepperal.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the commodores of the East-India Company's warehouses, in Jewry-street, Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the information given you by Alderson, did you go to the chest of tea? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a deficiency there? - A. Yes; I then went to the prisoner, and told him to get on with his work, and looked to see if his countenance altered; finding it did not, I called him along-side, and told him to come with me; and as we jogged on, I kept my eyes down towards his breeches; when I came to the stair-case, I put my hand to his shoulder, and begged him not to resist, and he begged for mercy; I immediately told him I could shew him none; he then put his hand to his breeches, and pulled out a bag of tea, and said, he was very sorry for what he had done; he said it was the first time, and hoped I would not take him to the accompting-house; I told him I was obliged; I took him down to the accompting-house, and I gave the tea into the charge of Mr. Brookes, the elder; I went to the chest of tea afterwards, and apparently the tea were both alike; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROOKES sworn - I am an assistant elder at the warehouses, in Jewry-street, Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any tea delivered to you by the last witness? - A. Yes, (the tea produced); the next day I went and saw it was the same sort of tea that we have in our warehouses.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the value of the tea? - A.About one shilling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.How many persons do you employ in that warehouse in Jewry-street? - A. I should suppose two or three hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to you? - A. Yes; when I went to Mr. Stockwell with him, he said, going along, he hoped there would be nothing come of this, more than a dismissal from his employ; he said, he could not think what could induce him to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare it with the other tea? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180008"></xptr>A. It is exactly the same sort of tea; it is congou. <rs id="t18010218-10-verdict53" type="verdictDescription">

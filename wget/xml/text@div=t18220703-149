            . On the 28th of May, about seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner pulling this plank through the wicket-gate, out of Robert M'Dowell's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030051"></xptr>yard; another man was helping him. I asked what they were doing - and both ran off; I overtook the prisoner about sixty yards off; he said he knew nothing about it; but as I brought him back, he said he was hired to carry it to Tottenham-court-road, by one Lawrence, who he knew, but had not seen him for nine years before. I am M'Dowell's servant.</p>

               <p>"There it is, take it." I took it up, and saw his countenance change; he said,</p>

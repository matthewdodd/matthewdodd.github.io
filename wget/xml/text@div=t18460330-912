Deacons', by the corner of Cheapside, just turning round by the General Post-office—he was not driving—I followed the van till it stopped in Aldersgate-street—he got out there and delivered a parcel at a house—as soon as he came out I laid hold of him, and said, "Young fellow, do you recollect escaping from me a few weeks ago?" he said, "Yes"—I said, "I shall take you to the station"—he said, "Where?"—I said, "To Moor-lane"—he asked what charge I had against him—I said, "For escaping from me when I had you on suspicion of stealing a parcel which was in your pos<lb></lb>session"—this was on the way to the station—he said, "You are mistaken"—I am convinced I am not mistaken—I can say positively I am not—he is the man I first saw—I found on him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, a pocket-book, and a book of the same appearance as the parcel delivery-book which he showed me before, but I cannot identify it.</p>

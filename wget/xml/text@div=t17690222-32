Last Thursday two women came into my shop between six and seven in the evening, and asked to look at some striped lawn; upon which my servant took some out of the counter. In the mean time I heard something like the breaking of the glass; I turned round and saw the prisoner at the window on the outside. I observed his arm move several times by the light of the lamp, which is exactly over the place. I went out and saw his hand upon the piece of handkerchiefs: he had them better than half way out of the window where he had broke the glass. As soon as he saw me, he let them go, and ran away. I called, Stop thief! He ran opposite Fleet-market, cross the way, and ran up Snow hill. I ran after him, and caught him in Cock-lane. I brought him down Snow-hill. There were four or five people endeavoured to take him from me. I called assistance, and brought him back to my shop.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had not compleated the felony, by getting the piece in his possession.</p>
               <p>He was <rs id="t17690222-32-verdict193" type="verdictDescription">

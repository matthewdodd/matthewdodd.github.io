                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Richard Giraud, solicitor, of 7, Furnival's Inn—I saw we prisoner in December, 1877, at the office—he introduced himself as John Dunn—he came for the purpose of selling some stock to raise 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he came again on 5th December, when he required an advance of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was granted to him—I do not think I was present—he came again on 12th December, and produced a conveyance relating to some property at South Moulton, and executed this memorandum of deposit (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I witnessed his signature to it—I believed then that he was Mr. John Dunn, as he described himself, of South Moulton—I produce a further charge on this property, dated 10th April, 1878, signed "John Dunn"—he paid no interest, and some pro<lb></lb>ceedings were taken against him—I last saw him on 17th April, 1880, when I served him with a writ—I had not seen him between times to my knowledge—he told me his name was John Dunn Gordon, and that he took that name through his mother—I communicated with Messrs. Rickards.</p>

On 26th August last I went with Detective Haydon to a mews in Stanstead Road, Forest Hill, and saw the prisoner; I told him I belonged to the Police, and had come to ap<lb></lb>prehend him on a warrant for forging a deed—I read the warrant to him—he said, "This is my old uncle's doings"—I said it was a person named Dunn who applied for the warrant—he said, "Yes, that is my uncle; I can explain everything; he gave me the deeds on my marriage settle<lb></lb>ment"—I said, "It is not 'deeds,' it is a deed that you forged and obtained 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon at Furnival's Inn"—he said he did sign a deed in the name of either James Dunn or John Dunn, as he thought he had a right to do, as his mother's maiden name Was Dunn—he said he wanted the money—I told him he would have to go to London—I asked him what he meant by the "deeds," and he said the deeds that he had at home—I asked him where they were, and he said, Captain Harding, his father-in-law and one of his trustees, had some, and his solicitors down in Devonshire had the others—he asked me to allow him to go round to his house and wash himself—we went round and I saw his mother-in-law, Mrs. Harding—she was in the passage when I went in first—afterwards his wife came in—the prisoner cleaned himself—I told him I should have to take all his papers, and ht said, "The other deeds are upstairs," and Mrs. Harding went upstairs and brought them down and gave them to him—I took them from him at the station—these are all the papers—he also gave me this white Chapel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—since this occurred I have been ill from breaking my arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, King's Street, South Moulton, Devonshire—I own some land at Little Deptford in Devonshire—on 20th March 1877 I received the deed relating to that property from my solicitors, Messrs. Rickards—this is it—I put it with other deeds in an old-fashioned trunk and locked it, and put the bunch of keys in an writing-desk, which I always keep looked—I never allowed any one to go near it—at the begin<lb></lb>ning of 1877 the prisoner was staying at my house and I allowed him to stay there a few weeks—he left, I think, is August—my late sister left him an annuity of 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had paid him ever since—about March this year I looked in my box, missed the deeds belonging to the freehold—I never authorised the prison to pass in my name, or to sign any document on my behalf—the signature to this document looks like mine—it is a very good imitation, but I never thought of having it prepared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I bought the property; my aunt left me some, and my ancestors left me some—it was not altogether from the family—I am sorry to say that I am the prisoner's uncle—my sister brought him, up from child, in my father's house: I had nothing to do with him—my</p>

               <p>father died in 1863, when I Wrap master of the house—I kept my sister—I never hated his father—I hated drunkenness—his father was a great drunkard—I may have written to aim, "Old <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> next door said the moon would shine all the year round now; Moon man told him the stars would shine also"—Moon is a tenant of mine—when my sister was ill I did not ask some medicine-man or conjuror to do anything—my sister used to, encourage the prisoner in everything—I never interfered—I may have written to my nephew of his father, "He owes me 19 years' rout at Little Deptford," etc., "I never had a shilling for it to the Year 1846 His wife's funeral he never paid for"—it is true he owed 19 years' rent—I was not angry with the prisoner because I thought he was holding com<lb></lb>munication with hit father—I wrote this letter in September 1877: "I am given to understand that your dear father has visited you. I dare say you are very friendly"—I do not know whether I wrote, "I understand your mother was much blessed with her father-in-law, which must be beautiful and heavenly in the extreme"—his father's solicitor threatened me with a chancery suit—he never accused me of embezzling—he might have said I had embezzledd his deeds—I am not aware that a chancery suit is being commented against me by the prisoner's father—think the prisoner married in August, 1877—I heard he had made a settlement on his wife—I never saw the settlement—I heard he sent it to ay solicitor—my solicitor did not tell me what was in the marriage settlement—I did not know to whom to pay the annuity—he did art tell me that that deed of gift was part of the marriage settlement—I never wrote to him in this letter of October 11th, 1877, the words, "So you can get some cash on my deeds in my name"—it is a very good imitation of my writing, but that line seems to be inserted—the letter is mine—I never thought of such a thing; it is quite monstrous to suppose such a thing—wrote this letter, "My late father gave your mother 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to help buy the Red Lion," etc.—I missed the deeds in 1877—I never gave them to the prisoner to raise money on, and I did not say, "Now, James, whatever you do return those deeds"—Mr. Rickards said they had lost the deeds of the freehold of the house which my lather purchased, but it appeared it was a Mistake—I was examined at the police-court, when the present Mr. Rickard's clerk said that it was not missing—I do not know that the prisoner by his marriage settlement conveyed to his trustees the annuity for the benefit of his wife—I am not aware that Captain Harding has sued me for the annuity—Mr. Rickards paid it—I have nothing to do with it—I was not in arrears—that signature to the deed of gut looks like my writing, but I never prepared such a thing—I remember James Smyth; I think he was clerk to Mr. Chaplin, solicitor, at South Moulton—I do not know whether Smyth is alive—I need to ask my sister what he came to me house about, and she said it was about a patent—he was always taking out patents for inventions—I do not know when I saw him last.</p>

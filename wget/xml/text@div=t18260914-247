            . I live in Bennet-street. The prisoner hired a room in my house on this day, and said her husband was in the Coldstream Guards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He went home with me. I asked what money he had - he said he had but one shilling, and would give me no more till the morning - I went in the morning and got a watchman; but he said he would not take any man in the room; he had no watch that I saw.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. I swear I had a watch, and 4s. in a small leather purse, which was likewise taken - she asked for no money that night, but said, in the morning, she would make all right - I was a little in liquor when I met her.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When did you see your watch last? A. About an hour before - it was then past eleven o'clock - I did not see any other young woman - she took the key inside and locked the door.</p>

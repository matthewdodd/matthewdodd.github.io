                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). In consequence of instructions I received from Mr. Bell, I have been watching his oyster rooms (Pim's) in the Poultry—my attention was particularly called to the premises on the morning of the 15th January—Manning and Buckmaster were in Mr. Bell's employment—I saw Buckmaster come a little after 8 o'clock to the premises, with Pross and Watson, with a barrow—Manning came from the shop, and they commenced unloading the barrow—Buckmaster carried in the first sack of oysters—I saw the barrow unloaded till all but one sack of oysters were gone—I then saw Buckmaster and Manning come from the shop towards the barrow, Buckmaster carrying what appeared to be a bundle of empty sacks in his arms—Manning was close to him, on his left side—the bundle of sacks was placed on the barrow by Buckmaster—Manning took the sack of oysters which had been left on the barrow on his back, and went into the shop with it—an empty barrel and a basket were placed on the barrow afterwards—Buckmaster and Watson went away with the barrow, being followed at some distance by Pross—in Lombard Street Pross joined them, and they went on to Philpot Lane—Watson assisted in pushing the barrow and in coming likewise—half-way down Philpot Lane the barrow was stopped, and Buckmaster and Watson put on the head of Pross a basket containing a sack—Buckmaster and Watson went on with the barrow and I followed Pross—the sack appeared to have something in it, and it was taken from the place where Buckmaster had placed the sacks—I stopped Pross at the top of Talbot Court and told him that I was an officer, and asked him what he had on his head—he said, "Some oysters"—I said, "Where are you going to take them?"—he said, "To a Mr. Hughes, down here by the Monument"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—he said, "Little <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, from Marlow's, gave them to me in Thames Street"—I told him I had reason to believe that the oysters were stolen from Pim's, in the Poultry, and I should have to take him into custody—I then took him, with the sack, to the police-station—the sack was opened, and it was found to contain 260 oysters, which were clean—I went again to the premises in the Poultry and watched.</p>

               <p>Pim's—Mr. Bell is one of the partners—Manning was a porter there, and has been in the employ about six years, and Buckmaster three years, to bring fish from the market with his barrow—Manning's duty was to attend with me at Billingsgate Market in the morning, and buy fish and oysters as re<lb></lb>quired, and it was Buckmaster's duty to convey them to the premises in the. Poultry, and Manning would be there to receive them—when I bought the goods, I used to meet him, and ask him what he had received, and if he had not received the quantity, I used to tell him the quantity he should receive and would tell him if he had received the right quantity—oysters would not be washed until I gave him orders for them to be washed—it was Manning's duty to wash them as they were wanted—the oysters were kept in a cellar by themselves and the fish in another place—Manning has the entire charge of the cellar where the oysters were deposited—he is responsible to me for them, and all oysters whether dirty or washed would be kept in the cellar, except those immediately in use up stairs—on the morning of 15th January he was with me in Billingsgate Market—Buckmaster was also there with his barrow—they were both present when the barrow was loaded—amongst other things, that morning I purchased two sacks of oysters which were put on the barrow with some fish—I left them to take the fish and oysters, and it was Manning's duty to assist in bringing them from the market and then receive them, and the oysters would be deposited in the oyster-cellar, and put under lock and key—the oysters I bought that morning were dirty, as they came from the dredgers—I know nothing of either the prosecutor or Watson—I have seen them about the market, in fact I had employed prosecutor about Christmas-time, when I was pressed, but I did not know his name—as regards Watson, I did not know him—I did not employ him on the morning of the 15th—after I had purchased the first I went to the premises in the Poultry—Manning was then in custody—Buckmaster would have access to the cellar when he was assisting Manning to carry the oysters in—the value of the 260 would be worth a little over 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

We went along, and then Buckmaster gave the sack to Pross. I did not know what he had in it; if I had asked I should have been told to mind my own business.

               <p>Q. Was any other person in the room besides your two selves - A. Yes, another girl went home with me at the time I picked her up. She is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lose your clothes - A. I went to bed first, and she undressed herself and came in too. About a quarter of an hour after she got up, and went down stairs, and returned again in about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other girl leave you when you went to bed - A. She said, she had no bed to sleep in; this girl offered her part of the bed. They had a dispute, and I saw her go out of the room. She had nothing with her. I missed my clothes about six o'clock in the morning. She awoke me between twelve and one, and said my clothes were gone. The door at that time was bolted. I bolted the door after she had gone out of the room and returned. I got out of bed and bolted the door. I was in the dark then.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know then whether your clothes were gone or no - A. No.</p>

            I do not know; very probably it is. Between twelve and one, she said all my clothes were gone. I said, it is all nonsense. I did not believe her. At six o'clock in the morning I found they were all gone. The constable has found my clothes since.</p>

            . I am an headborough. I was sent for to 45, Charles-street. I went up into the two-pair back room. Whitrow charged Nagle with having his clothes. She said she had lost her clothes likewise. I found her clothes in the same house, in Phoebe Jackson's room, and after I had taken Nagle to the watchhouse I returned and found Whitrow's clothes in Jackson's room, under the bed. Before I took Nagle to the watchhouse she was obliged to borrow some things to go the watchhouse.</p>

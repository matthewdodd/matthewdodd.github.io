            ? - A. Yes, I have got the receipt for it, he wrote it in my presence; I paid it in Redcross-street, Cripplegate.</p>
               <p>JOHN DUNKIN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you were a rectifier of spirits in December last? - A. Yes; I live in Redcross-street, Cripplegate; the prisoner was a clerk of mine in December last, that was before I had the misfortune to fail, and Mr. Edwards was a customer of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever account to you for a bank-note of 2 l. received of Mr. Edwards, on the 2d of December? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you your books here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Pray, Sir, how long has he lived in your service? - A. Ever since the year 1799; I found him in the house, and he has been there ever since I came into the business; he has been there twenty or thirty years.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time he was in your service he served you with fidelity? - A. I cannot say I had a good opinion of him long before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to speak from your memory, or from your books, that he never accounted to you for so small a sum as 2 l.? - A. From my memory, and from my books, I am persuaded that if I had received a single 2 l. I should have remembered it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What sum did you receive on the 2d of December last? - A. I do not recollect without I had the books; I have the prisoner's cash-book here, where he ought to enter all the sums he received; there is no entry of it in his cash-book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. In consequence of your having large failings to make up you were more pressing for money, the prisoner was going about in a more than ordinary way? - A. He ought to have kept a regular account, that was nothing to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you your books here besides that of the prisoner's? - A. No, his book was posted by another person; I have my clerk here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that clerk you have here post it? - A. No, he was not there at the time; all the money the prisoner received, if I was not in the way he accounted to another clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that clerk here? - A. I do not know that he is.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you ever received money from the prisoner that he has not put down in his book? - A. Yes, then I entered it in my books; I know I have never received this 2 l.</p>
               <p>Q. When were your affairs deranged? - A. On the 6th of March; I was distressed before, in December last my affairs were deranged.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever account to you for this bank-note? - A. I was not clerk there on the 2d of December last, I was gone six months before that; since I have been in town I have posted the cash-book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There are two defects more; the clerk is not here, nor the books are not here.</p>

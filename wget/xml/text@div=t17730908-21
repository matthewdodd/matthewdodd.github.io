One of the grooms of the king's mews came, and informed me a young man was at the Mews who had offered a pair of silver buckles to him; I went and took the prisoner, and searched him, and found a duplicate in his pocket, which led me to a pawnbroker's in Westminster, where I found a shirt pawned; I asked him whose shirt it was; he said it was his own, and that his sister had made it for him; I asked him where his sister lived; he told me in Archer-street by Great Windmill-street; after I had disposed of him I went to his sister, and asked if she had made that shirt for him; she said no; she said there was something she had she should be glad to be rid of, and produced the knapsack; I took the knapsack and her to Sir

            's; I then said to him how could you tell me the shirt was your's? how came you by this knapsack? he said he took it from a pensioner that was asleep in the field, and said he would take me to the person he had sold the coat and waistcoat to; he told me this voluntarily, and then he told me there was a shirt and the other things in the knapsack, and that they were sold at a house in Thieving-lane; he went with me and shewed me the house; I went to the pawnbroker's for the shirt, and the shirt is here.

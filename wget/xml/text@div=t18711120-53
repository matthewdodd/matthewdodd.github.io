                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 379). On the morning of 2nd October, I was on duty in Chancery Lane, and about 2.45 I heard the breaking of wood at No. 22, Mr. Harris's premises—I obtained the assistance of another constable, and found marks of persons having passed through the area grating—the mortar was scraped off the wall—I aroused the prosecutor, and searched the premises—I found the prisoner Webb in the cellar, under the house, in a closet where there were some coals—the door was closed; it closes outwards—I fetched him out, and said "What are you doing?"—he said "I have gone in there to have a sleep"—I took him to the station, and then returned and found that three doors had been forced open—I found these wax matches where Webb was laid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was a cellar under the basement story—they had actually broken into it—they got in through the area grating—the cellar is not inside the house, but it is under the first floor, just as kitchens are—there was no door between the area and the cellar—there was no way into it without going into the house, and going down stairs—you could not get into the cellar from the outside except by forcing the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Having got through the area grating they could get into a small passage, and there are doors right and left into the cellars—those are the doors that were broken open—Webb was found in one cellar, and Clark in the other.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Webb. Q.</hi> Was not the area broken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there is no window in it—you broke the doors to get into the cellars, and you broke a hole through the floor two feet wide—here are the locks which were broken off the doors—you got through a railing which was open—you got into the passage without breaking anything.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 373). I accompanied Bateman—we got in, not through the area railings, but at the back door of the house, and then down stairs—Symond's Inn is behind the house, and from there we went through a gateway, and through some folding doors, which were open—I searched the lower part of the house, and found Clark concealed on some coals in a cupboard in the coal cellar—we went further, and found Webb concealed under a board in the lumber room—there were no coals there—this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found under a hole 3ft. long and 6 in. wide, which had been made into the room above, and there was another small hole—Webb said he was having a sleep—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am occupier of 22, Chancery Lane, and am a refresh<lb></lb>ment-room keeper—on Sunday morning, 22nd October, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning, I was called, and saw the constable bring up Clark—there was a hole in the floor, which came into my neighbours' shop, Messrs. Everson and Bridger, law stationers—both the cellar doors were locked when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My house is a portion of No. 22, Chancery Lane, and a very extensive cellar, under my shop and under the shop of my tenant,</p>

               <p>Mr. Saunders, a watchmaker, belongs to me—it goes under four shops—the upper portion of the house is chambers, and the lower portion shops, and there is a passage to the water-closet, in which are several small coal cellars for the use of the occupiers of the chambers—my house consists of a shop and a dining-room on the ground floor—I should not have to go out into the open air to go to where Webb was found—the entrance to the house is similar to those in Lincoln's Inn and the Temple.</p>

I examined Mr. Harris's premises on the morning of the 22nd—the back abuts on Symond's Inn, and there is a door, which is shut at night, but is unfastened—at the back of the house was a grating with a hole in it, big enough for a man to go through, and there were marks of persons going through—when you get through you are in an open passage, on the left of which is a door leading into a coal closet—that door had been forced open by this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—I com<lb></lb>pared the marks—you then go on again through the passage, and there is another door, which had also been forced open—it had marks corresponding with the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—that led into the cellar under No. 22—in that cellar there was a hole made in the boards, about 2ft. 6 in. long, into the shop of Mr. Bridger, and the marks corresponded with the <hi rend="italic">jemmy.</hi>

I am a law stationer, in partnership with Mr. Everson—we only occupy the shop—on this Monday morning, about 8.30, I opened the shop and found that an endeavour had been made to break up the floor—there was a breakage in more than one place—they had entered the coal cellar underneath and wrenched the floor up—I left the premises at about 6.30, on Saturday, the floor was then perfectly sound—the shop contained stamps and stationery.</p>

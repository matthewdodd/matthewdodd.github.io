                  </hi>. I am a collector, and live at No. 8, Powell-street West, Goswell-road—I collect money for one house in particular—on Saturday, 13th Jan., I had been out collecting, and in the evening I was in the Green Gate public house, at the corner of Bath-street, City-road—I went with a friend to fetch a gentleman out—I drank some rum and water and some ale—a few minutes before 12 o'clock the landlord called out, "Now, gentlemen, it's time to close, "and two of the persons who were there, Hitchings and Prior, asked me to lend them some money—they both said, "Lend me two or three shillings"; I pulled out some gold and silver loose in my hand—I saw the prisoner, Brown, close by me; he was touching my right arm at the time—T took my money out of my pocket; he was in such a position that he could see the money in my hand—I took out a few shillings and lent it, and put the remainder back in my pocket—after that I had some rum and water—I continued there seven or eight minutes, or ten minutes; I took no account of it—I then left the house in company with a female; in fact, all came out—we went across towards the doctor's, at the other corner—we crossed for the purpose of avoiding the people on the left hand, to go round and come into the City-road—as we crossed, we went through the posts, and there is a piece of vacant ground—I did not see Brown outside amongst the people—in passing through the posts we were pushed against the posts—the people seemed to fall against us; no one did anything to us there—we crossed the road to have some supper—we had no sooner crossed, than they all rushed against us—my friend asked what they wanted, and I wanted to know what they wanted—four or five came and pressed on us, and the prisoner, Brown, struck me on the arm and the eye—I had not struck any of those persons at that time; I did afterwards strike all I could strike—the first blows I had were on the arm and eye—my coat was torn down the pocket; my coat was buttoned over my trowsers pocket—it was a loose coat or cape; any person pulling it would get it open—Brown pulled my coat—I saw Home; he was the man that was fighting anybody; he tried to fight me—I took hold of Brown then; I laid hold of his arm—several persons called "Police!"and some called "Murder!"—the policeman came up while I was holding Brown—</p>

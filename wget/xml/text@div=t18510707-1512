                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Whitton. On 30th June, I came home about half-past 11 o'clock at night, and while I was unlocking my door, Mrs. Jewett, who lives next door to me, was in her house using foul language towards me; she called me a b—, and a rogue—I asked her what she meant, and her husband, the male prisoner, then came out, and struck me across the legs with this well-hook (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was hanging against the house—he struck me as hard as he could, a great many times, holding it in both hands, and he bruised me very much—Mrs. Hunt then came out of her house, which is next door, and struck me about the back and side, and back part of my head with a poker—Jewett then got me down, and sat across me, and beat me in the face with his fists, and Mrs. Jewett hit me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070090"></xptr>
               <p>with the well-hook while I was down—I managed to get up, and was making my way in doors again, and Mr. Jewett cut me across the legs again, and I found some sharp instrument cut into my arm—no one was near enough at that time to have used it but Mrs. Jewett—I could not see any knife—I heard a woman's voice say, "I will cut your b—heart out"—I cannot say whose voice it was—I at last got away, and a policeman came—the cut bled very much—the doctor attended me, and is still doing so—he is not here—the cut is very painful at times, it is 31/4 inches deep, and I can almost lay my finger in it now.</p>

On 30th June, at 12 o'clock at night, I received information, went to Young's house, and found him sitting in a chair, with a large gash in his arm, which was bleeding—it appeared fresh done—I took the prisoners into custody; and in Mrs. Jewett's pocket found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found on the tea—tray at Jewett's house.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statements before the Magistrate were here read</hi>: Mrs. Jewett stated that Young first struck her husband with the well—hook; that he had been drinking at the Lion and Lamb at Hounslow, and that he struck her also with his fist, and used most abusive and indecent language; that she never took her knife out of her pocket, and the cut on his arm must have been done at Hounslow, as he had been fighting there, and was cut about the face when he came to her house. Matthew Jewett stated, his wife came home very late, being detained very late by William Young and two other men following them, and using very abusive language; Young struck his wife; he spoke to him about it, when he struck him with his fist, before he, Jewett, struck him with the well-hook. Mrs. Hunt stated, she never used a poker, and did not strike William Young at all; she came out of her house,</p>

On the evening of 30th June, about 8 o'clock, I saw Young, with a man named Brown, at Mrs. Fielder's beer-shop, Whitton-road, Twickenham—Mrs. Jewett and Hunt were there, and ran into the bar—Young and Brown followed them into the bar directly, and were going to strike Mrs. Jewett, when I shut the bar-door, and fastened it—Mrs. Fielder came in, and wanted the men to go away from the door—they would not go, but called these women all the bad names they could—I took the women into the cellar, and let them out at the back door because I was afraid the men would ill-use them—the men remained half—an—hour, thinking the women were there; they then followed them.</p>

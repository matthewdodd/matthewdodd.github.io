I am not a pig"—the prisoner afterwards gave him a blow in the face, pulled him down by the hair, and gave him a kick, which knocked out two of his teeth—one of them was found, the other was not—Moyadeen picked one up, and showed it to me, and there was plenty of blood—I knew Moyadeen when we started from Bombay—I was acquainted with him—he had all his teeth in his head.</p>

I am a Mussulman"—the chief mate then struck him in the face, laid hold of his hair, pulled him down on the deck, and gave him a kick—there was blood on the deck, and Moyadeen afterwards picked up one of his teeth, and showed it to me—Moyadeen had all his teeth perfect in his head when he left Bombay—when the men were examined in the register office, they were measured and examined—I was present at the time—I took him to the office—he was examined at that office, and all their register tickets were examined—a register ticket is not always given with the Lascar seamen—I did not look into Moyadeen's mouth, but, as far as I believe, his teeth were all right when he left Bombay—if anything happens to any of the men, they come and tell me, and I go and tell the captain.</p>

               <p>in his conduct towards the crew—he was too kind—I did not, during the whole voyage, hear Moyadeen complain of having been ill-treated by Mr. Greer—I heard the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> examined here at the last trial—I did not hear him say a word about his having told the captain that the assault had been committed by Mr. Greer on Moyadeen—the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> never mentioned such a word—we had to tack ship when we got into the Channel—it was about 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, off the coast of Cornwall—on that occa<lb></lb>sion Moyadeen was on the deck, holding one of the ropes—if the rope which he was holding were let go, it would be dangerous to the vessel, and to the other vessels besides—he let go the rope before the order was given, and Mr. Greer rushed forwards and pushed him away, and took hold of the rope—I did not see him strike him—that was off the coast of Cornwall—I never saw Mr. Greer strike Moyadeen, or pull him by the hair.</p>

                  </hi>. I sailed in that vessel. Mr. Greer was very kind and humane—I never saw him guilty of any violence, only once, when one of the men let go the main sheet, and he struck him across the mouth—that was Moyadeen—Mr. Greer struck him across the mouth with the back of his hand, and took the rope which he let go—the result of letting go the rope might have been perilous, we were then amongst other vessels—I never heard from Moyadeen or the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi>, any report or rumour of complaint of violence on the part of Mr. Greer—I saw these men shipped at Bombay—when Moyadeen came on board, I noticed that he had one or more teeth out—he has got a very prominent mouth, and cannot speak without show<lb></lb>ing that—the tacking of the ship was about 5 o'clock in the morning——there was no tacking of the ship before that; we had a fair wind—I did not observe any difference in the appearance of Moyadeen's face during the voyage—Moyadeen can speak English a little—Mr. Greer is not connected with the vessel now.</p>

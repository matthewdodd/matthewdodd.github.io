            . I am a watchman. At eleven o'clock on this night, I was near Saracen's Head, Snowhill, heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw Jordan running from Green Arbour-square - I stopped him - he said, "Let go of my clothes, and take my arm: I will go with you" - a strong party came round and cried out, "Do you want to murder the man?" Jordan then struck me in the eye - I took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>JORDAN's Defence.

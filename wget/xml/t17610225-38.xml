            's regiment of dragoons, called light-horse, the 16th regiment; the prisoner entered into our regiment on the Thursday, and the Sunday following, being the eighth of February instant, he deserted. I came up to town in order to take him, and found my horse at the Windmill in St. John's street. The horse was missing when he was: he acknowledged he took the horse, with intent to make the best of his way, fearing he should be pursued, and that he brought him there in order to send him back again.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176102250060"></xptr>Q. to Watkins. Where did your troop lay when the horse was missing?</p>
               <p>Watkins. At Daventry in Northamptonshire.</p>
               <p>Fosset. The butcher told me the man that belonged to him would come and give me an account what was to be done with him, and I was to give him a quartern of corn, night and morning while he said. The prisoner came, and said he should return him to Daventry. I told him if he would give me orders and money so to do, I would return him for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer to sell the horse?</p>
               <p>Fosset. No, he did not, nor never gave me orders to sell him,</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the horse belonged to the troop there?</p>
               <p>Fosset. No, he did not; then the young man came, and took him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but called four witnesses to his character, who all gave him a good one.</p>

             sworn. - I am warehouse-man to Messrs. Aylwin and Chapman: I received some information from the last witness; I went after the prisoner, and met him between the two warehouses belonging to Mr. Aylwin, with a large stone upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150023"></xptr>his shoulders; I asked him what he had done with the half chest of oil; he said, a man with a white apron on asked him if he was at work at the warehouses, and he said he was; and he told him to carry it to the corner of Billingsgate; he said the person that gave it to him took it from him there, and went into the Gun-tap; I then asked him if he would go and shew me where the half-chest was; he said he did not know, but he believed he could; he went with me to the Gun-tap, and it was there, in the bar; I then asked him to take it back to the warehouse; I said to the person at the bar that it was stolen property, and they made me no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at all? - A. I think I have seen him on the Quays, but he never worked for us in the warehouse; he was employed by the carpenters for the purpose of carrying these stones; he had to pass by the door of the place where the oil was, but he had no business in there; I had seen twenty-five half-chests put in the day before; they were marked with the letter X, the same as an hour-glass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not somebody say to you, when you were taking away the chest from the Gun-tap, what are you going to do with that chest? - A. Yes, but I do not know who it was; there were, I dare say, fifty people in the tap-room; I afterwards went to the Gun-tap again, but there were not above five or six people there, and I could not hear any account of it; I delivered the chest to the constable, and he has had it ever since.</p>

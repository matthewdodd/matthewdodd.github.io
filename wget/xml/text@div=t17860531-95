               <p>Did you make him any promise, that if he would disclose all that he knew, that you would not prosecute him? - I was very loth to do it; I rather apprehended that the promise came in this very place; he sent for Mr. Bill, while the examinations were going on, he came back, and said to my Lord Mayor that he had confessed the whole; I had not said anything; I believe Mr. Cole made him a promise, I apprehend so.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. He never made a full confession, till I and Mr. Metcalf went to the Compter, and told him he should be perfectly secure and safe, if he declared the whole.</p>
               <p>Had he made any confession of having robbed you himself, before he was assured that nothing would happen to him, if he did confess? - I do not believe he had; I believe he did it to save his life; so far from it, there never was a more obstinate man in this world; he never confessed a single thing, till he thought his life was in danger: I found these things at the prisoner's apartments in drawers; in taking our stock over again, we missed a piece out of the box of

               <p>Mr. Shepherd. You do not mean to say that Sinclair and Co. bleaches no other linen but what you deal in? - No, Sir; they bleach a great deal more; by taking of stock over again, I missed a piece of yard-wide linen.</p>

               <p>The prisoner sent for you? - Yes, when he was in the compter, I went in consequence; he was chained to the bed, and he said, he was not guilty; I said, you had better confess, I believe you are guilty; he did not make any confession whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd objected to Rogers being sworn; and the Court observed it would be sheltering a felony to let in a misdemeanor, and that the objection lays in admitting an evidence who is a felon to be an evidence against a misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester replied to the objection, and the court over-ruled the objection, and reserved the question for the opinion of the Judges.</p>

Acton and Ayre; I went there in November last; about five or six days after I had been at my master's house, I was going out with a load and I pitched it in the Horse-shoe passage; the house is kept by Mr. Price; I turned to the tap-room, and the prisoner and the man named Galland were both in the tap-room, and Galland being my countryman, I spoke to him; he was very well dressed; and he asked me if I was gone to live at a draper's, I said, I was; he said, he had lived at a draper's, but had left it a little time ago; he said, his masther had lost some goods, and thought it was him; he said, his master lived in Gracechurch-street; he began saying, if I had a mind, he could put money into my pocket, and something of that sort; and some few words passed; I asked him how, and he said, if I had got a piece of goods, he would give me money for it; I told him I did nothing of that sort, and I did not know how to do such a thing; and I went away with my load; he asked me if I could come that way at night, I told him, I dare not come out at night, but if I came that way with a load, I should call; he said, he would put me in a way to get rid of the things if there was a hundred pounds worth of them any day, he could get the money for them, I told him, I did no such thing; I met Galland often, but this prisoner I had never spoke to, but at the Horse-shoe; I saw the prisoner there every day after, and sometimes most part of the day, he and Galland were mostly together; and the prisoner and others at different times, many times asked what time I opened the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310123"></xptr> warehouse, and that they would be coming that way, and if I would get a piece of goods ready they would call for it, as they went past, and nobody would take notice of it; I told him he must not come then, for our apprentice was always up first, and he staid in the warehouse; he said, then if I would take some goods into the private cellar, the small beer cellar, then I might have a pocket like theirs, either a new coat made, or loose pockets put into that; I believe the prisoner recommended that about the coat, and I was going by that or the next day, and they were there, and Jones the taylor was there; says they, that is the man that will either make you a new coat, or put pockets in that which you have on; the prisoner was there then, he was the first man that spoke about it, and Galland was there, and Jones came and spoke to me, and said, he lived at No. 6, in the court, and he would measure me, and I went, and he measured me, and I had a coat with proper pockets that day or the next; and he asked me whether I would have one pocket for a print, and the other for Irish; and he made that coat, he put in very large pockets; I saw the prisoner and Galland after I had the coat made, and they said, the coat was not right, they would have the pockets altered, but they were not altered; whether Galland was there when he told me to bring some goods I cannot say.</p>
               <p>When did you see this prisoner next? - Galland took me to the prisoner's house on Sunday morning, I believe about a fortnight after I was in place, the prisoner went with us from the Bell, he went up stairs, he did not say much then before Galland; there is a bell, and the prisoner told me to ring the bell, and come up stairs, he said the people below would not take any notice; I only opened the door, I did not stop but a very few minutes; that was the shop I was to leave the goods in if Galland was not in the way; the next day, or within a day or two, I saw the prisoner, and he asked me for piece of Irish; he was most mornings at the Horse-shoe, and I believe a day or two, or three after, he had a piece of Irish of me, I took it from out of a box in the cellar, the furthermost box but two in the lower warehouse; I took it to the prisoner at his own house, I think it was in the passage at his own door; I believe he went out and went down to the Bell, he said, he wanted for his brother-in-law to make shirts, I do not know his brother-in-law's name; he gave me a guinea and a half for it; two or three days after he said, lawns were much better things, they were wrapped in blue papers, they are not so long as Irish quite, if I could bring some of them, he could get more money for them; I had never lived with a draper before, I did not know them; and I believe the next he had, was some printed callico, I think it was a patch for a gown, or some muslins; that is one that I gave him, he said, he could not afford to give above a guinea and an half for the Irish; he said, the highest number was the best; I afterwards took him some muslins, that were ribs, he said, he could afford to give more for them, for his wife could sell them at the other end of the town; that patch was some of it I am sure, and he told me he sold this to Mrs. Holmes, that he never paid me for, but he said, he sold it to her for a guinea, and when she paid him he would give me the money; I did not know the Irish, they always cut the marks out as soon as I came there, they always examined them, and undid them directly.</p>
               <p>Here is a bit of paper that was in your pocket when you was taken? - I remember it, it was my memorandum, an account of some part of what I delivered.</p>

               <p>Mr. Shepherd to Rogers. Where had you lived before you went to Mr. Ayres's? - In Aldersgate-street, at Mess. Dean and Rowlet's, brandy merchants; I was turned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310124"></xptr> away from them for going after another place; I was in custody five days in Tothill-fields, and three or four days in the Poultry compter.</p>
               <p>Who made the first proposal to you to discover? - My master, he sent word by other people, by Mr. Bill, and Mr. Sureton, and Mr. Williams of Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Was any money ever offered to you to make this discovery? - Not as I know of, they said there was a reward, and brought a paper to me; I did not understand I was to have it, or think about it.</p>
               <p>Why did they shew the paper to you? - I do not know, I did not think I should have a reward, I never refused, I said did not know any thing at all about it; I did not make any discovery till after I heard of this reward.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you expect to have a reward if these men are convicted? - I do not expect nothing, only about twenty-two pounds which I worked hard for, to be returned to me; I believe I received seventy-three guineas for the things which I took from my master's; they never promised to return me my money if this man was convicted.</p>

               <p>Court. Recollect that you are open to a prosecution yourself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Have you ever had any conversation with Rogers since he was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he ever say any thing to you about having this money offered to him to make this discovery? - Yes; he said he was offered 100 l. by Mr. Kureton, and his partner; and he said he had received five guineas, but he did not say of whom, and if he did not make the discovery, he should be hanged.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Supposing I have done right in admitting the evidence, you have done right in determining from it; whether I have, or no, will be determined by higher authority; if they are of opinion with me, the prisoner must expect pretty nearly as severe a sentence from the Court as their power will enable them to pass.</p>

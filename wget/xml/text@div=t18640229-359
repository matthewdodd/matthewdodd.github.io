                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Cook, who keeps a cornchandler's shop at Dock Head—on Saturday, 20th February, the prisoner came for half a quartern of flour, which came to threepence—she gave me a six-pence, which I put in a bowl in the till where there was no other money, as we had cleared the till for closing—I gave the prisoner threepence change, and she left—about ten minutes afterwards my husband took out the sixpence, showed it to me, and I found it was bad—I had put no money in the till in the meantime—she was the last customer—on the next Monday she came again for half a pound of oatmeal which came to a penny farthing—she gave me a bad sixpence—I called my husband, and told her in his presence that it was bad, and that she was the same person who gave the one on Saturday night—she said she was very sorry, she did not know it was bad—she knew she was in, and had half a quartern of flour.</p>

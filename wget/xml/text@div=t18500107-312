                  </hi>. I am superintendent of police at St. Katha<lb></lb>rine's Docks. On 29th Dec. I passed the east end of the "C" warehouse—I saw the prisoner standing against the wall near a box, doing something to the front of his dress—he came past me, and I called after him to stop—he did not, and I stopped him, and said, "What have you got here?" pointing to the front of his dress—he said, "O! Mr. Mumford, I was going to put it down these steps"—I found this lead on him—he said he found it in the privy—it is branded—it was entirely concealed by his coat—the Dock Com<lb></lb>pany had such lead on the quay in front of the warehouse, and the brand on it was the same as is on this—I took the prisoner to the principal gate—he had not been at work in the Docks that day; he had no business there.</p>

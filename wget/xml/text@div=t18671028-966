"—the baby is just on eight months old—it was dressed in short clothes—I saw my husband go down stairs—I flew down stairs quickly, and went to my mother-in-law's house—I carried the child all the way in my arms as I have described—the blood dropped on the baby all the way—I was in my mother-in-law's house about twenty minutes before I went to the hospital—I left the hospital three weeks yesterday—I am quite well now, and I hope you will have mercy upon him—this is his knife, sometimes his and sometimes mine—I go out with cats' meat and use it for the purpose of cutting the skewers—my husband had it that night.</p>

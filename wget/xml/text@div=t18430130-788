                  </hi>. I am an accountant, residing in Southampton-row Edgeware-road, Marylebone. The prisoner was one of my clerks for twelve months—it was his duty to collect debts for various persons who employed me-it was his duty to enter what he received in the cash-book when he returned, and to account to me every evening-if he did not come Home that night, then the next morning-I engaged him to collect some money from Mr. Cripps, a staymaker, in Hanway-street—this is the book in which he made his entries—if he received 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 31st of May from Mr. Cripps, he has only accounted to me for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he has not accounted to me for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Cripps on the 6th of June—he has only accounted for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 28th of July, only for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in consequence of something that occurred on the 24th of Dec., I gave the prisoner into custody—I brought the policeman into my office, and said, "I give this man in charge for embez<lb></lb>zlemen"—he said, "Give me a littele time, and I will settle it"—I said, "No, Mr. Pilcher, I have told you of this before; this is the third time, and nobody will employ me if I do not punish you"—he said, "For the sake of my family, will you not arrange it?"—I said, "It does not admit of arrangement; I cannot do it."</p>

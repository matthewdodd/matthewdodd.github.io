            . I am servant to Mrs. Watson; I fastened the parlour window on the 22d of December. I put too the shutter and screwed the sash about dusk, and the window was fast; I saw it a few minutes before I went out of the house; I don't sleep in the house. I came the next morning about half after six, and rung at the door, the window shutters were put too; the bolt was forced off, and the sash broke, and pushed up as high as it would go; the closet door stood a little open. I went about three o'clock the day before to fetch out a bible for my mistress, then the cabinet was safe. There was a bell in the window which was taken away, and laid in the sink; and the glass of the window was broke just at the screw; there were two marks of feet upon the iron rails that are before the window.</p>
               <p>- Dean. I was at Chelsea about half after four, on the 23d of December; I found this cabinet [producing it] in the road, and a pretty many papers lying near it.</p>

            . I am a salesman, and live at the bottom of the Minories. On the 23d of December the two prisoners and Collins came to my shop between ten and eleven o'clock, to buy clothes, my son sold Burn a Bath surtout for half a guinea. I was in the shop at the time; he paid two crown pieces and a six-pence for it, but not a new six-pence. Parker afterwards bought a coat and a waistcoat, for which he paid a guinea in thirty-two new six-pences and a crown piece. Collins did not buy any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. to Collins. Had you any conversation about going out that night?</p>
               <p>Collins. Nothing more than common. I got up again about half after eleven o'clock. Burn and Parker came up to me as I got up; we went to several places about Westminster; then we went to Marybone, and from thence to Chelsea. There I broke open the shutters, and got into a house; it was fastened with a bolt, which was pulled off; afterwards I forced it open with two chissels; the nail was drawn out of the bolt; I broke a pane of glass, and threw a handkerchief over the bell to prevent its ringing, and took it out. Burn was at the corner of the street to watch; Parker was out at the gate three or four times. I drew out a sort of a brass-headed iron that was in the sash, and then threw the sash up. Parker went in, but he ran out again almost as soon as he got in. We took such a little desk as this out of a closet by the window; we had a tinder-box with us; I broke the cabinet open when we got into the lane, and found some crown pieces in it, either eight or nine, and some new shillings and six-pences, I can't tell how many; also a two-guinea piece, a black snuff-box, and a picture inside it like a bracelet; there was a little stone, and a large medal that seemed to be of one of the Popes. We threw the desk in the road, and the papers too. We did not divide the money regularly; I had the crown pieces in my pocket. I lent Parker one crown to buy his cloaths; Burn had two crowns of me before that; Parker had the sixpences and shillings. I put the crowns underneath the seat of the coach as we were drawn down to the Mansion-house. We changed two of the crowns coming down Holborn. I bought this coat just above Mr. Burke's shop, and paid two crowns for it.</p>

               <p>Collins. Yes, and I asked him how he came by it; he said, what was that to me?</p>
               <p>Q. Was the silver you paid away at Mr. Burke's shop part of the money that came out of the house?</p>
               <p>Collins. Yes.</p>

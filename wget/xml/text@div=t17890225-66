               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. What is there remarkable in that nut not being able to come off easily, in the nut of an axle-tree being rusty, where is it different from any other axle-tree that has a nut that is got rusty, and will not come off? - I do not say it is, it might be in another as well as in mine.</p>
               <p>You that use carts, and use iron axle-trees, know it is a very common thing for them to rust on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know it by that at all? - I do not know it particularly.</p>
               <p>Have you any mark at all on that axle-tree, is it not like any other? - Yes, undoubtedly it is.</p>
               <p>You did not make it yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>You bought it, I suppose, second-hand? - I did so.</p>
               <p>Is the person here whom you bought it of? - No.</p>
               <p>Then all that you know is, that you had an axle-tree that was fixed to a wheel? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On which there was nothing particular? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. I think you pointed out a crack in the bed of the axle-tree? - Yes, here it is.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing remarkable in that crack? - The remarkableness is such, that I can swear to it; I will not take upon myself to say, but what another might possibly be made to fit it, but it is almost a miracle:</p>
               <p>Do not the beds of these kind of things frequently crack? - I have never another that is so, nor ever had; I think I could be positive to that to swear to it among a thousand.</p>
               <p>Could the wheel have been got off without the nut being taken off? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt but that is your own axle-tree? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you made any observations on that axle-tree to enable you to swear now that it is yours? - Yes, I have, when I bought it I made that remark of the crack on the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you made that remark of the crack when you bought it, and before it was stolen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you remarked before it was stolen, what you have mentioned respecting the nut? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you tried to get the nut off? - Yes, and could not.</p>
               <p>What, before it was stolen? - Yes, in the day-time on the 23d.</p>
               <p>How long have you had it? - I cannot say positively, I believe about four months.</p>

               <p>Did you go the strait way to your master? - Why, I might have gone a nearer way to be sure; I put it down in the warehouse; when I came to my master's, my master was up; he came backwards, and just saw the axle-tree, and said he would have nothing at all to do with it, and he ordered it off his premises, and was rather angry with me fetching it; I do not know whether it was Mr. Fleming, or my master, or both, I cannot say, ordered me to take the axle-tree on the ruins, I cannot recollect by which it was; I put it upon the ruins.</p>
               <p>What became of the tire? - I do not know, I went to work; I did not put the tire on the ruins, but only the axle-tree.</p>
               <p>Should you know the axle-tree? - I cannot swear to it; I did not observe any particular mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What ruins are these? - The back part of St. Ann's-street.</p>
               <p>Jury. What was your reason for carrying that large weight a further way about than you might have done? - By the order of Mr. Fleming, to go up New Pye-street.</p>
               <p>Was that more out of the way of any body's observation than any other road? - Not a great deal.</p>
               <p>Is it more concealed or private than the other? - It is rather more out of the way than if I had gone along the street.</p>

               <p>Are you enabled to say, that that is the axle-tree you saw dug up there? - Yes, that I can safely say upon oath that is the same, it was under a bit of bank that had been dug under Davis's yard; this

               <p>I am a dustman; I found this axle-tree just going through St. Ann's Lane; this end was buried down quite, and at that end there was no screw nor box on; I found it the back of St. Ann's Lane, in a bit of a drench, at the back of Divine's wall, it was buried over with dirt, and a bit of dung at the lower end; this is the same axle-tree. I carried it over to Mr. Skirton, I can tell by the chalk; I have no doubt but it is the same axle-tree.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. So, you found this axle-tree hid in the dirt? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, on the Saturday morning I attended on Mrs. Skirton about this axle-tree; I went into their yard, and she with me; I saw a part of the yard where the wall had been fresh grazed like, and I looked over the wall, and I saw apparently the impression of a wheel on the other side, upon the premises adjoining to Mr. Fleming; I went into those premises after that, and I saw two impressions, similar to that in Mr. Fleming's yard, in two places; one impression was on a large piece of tin, apparently the handle of a large sausepan, which was jobbed into the ground, like as if it had been done by going over the wall, the other impression was on the ground; I apprehended the prisoners, and I took Fleming to the magistrate, there he made a confession, which I have in my pocket; I saw it signed.</p>
               <p>Court. That will not do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Will you describe the impression on this piece of tin? - I cannot say what it was drove it into the earth, I say apparently.</p>
               <p>Some harder substance falling upon it, drove it into the earth? - Yes, I do not pretend to say what it was.</p>

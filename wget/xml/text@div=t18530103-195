                  </hi>. I am a porter, at the Sussex Hotel, Bouverie-street. On 1st Jan., about 10 minutes to 1 o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner in Farringdon-street, and saw him put his hand into the prosecutrix's pocket; who was standing with some other women, about eighteen, I suppose—after the prisoner put his hand in her pocket, I saw him put something into his own pocket, but I cannot tell what it was—when he had got about two yards off, I spoke to the prosecutrix—I have sees the prisoner before a great many times, about Farringdon-street—I went after him, but did not catch him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Skinner's-place, Bishopsgate-street—on February 23d, about twenty minutes past 12, I was returning home—I had had a little drink, but was quite sober—I was turning the key at my own door, when three men came round me, one took my watch from my waistcoat pocket—I turned round instantly, caught hold of the man's wrist, and turned him round—the prisoner immediately struck me a violent blow on the nose—this is the mark, it cut it terribly—I fell—as soon as I fell I jumped up again and followed the prisoner, and a third man who ran into Bishopsgate-street with the prisoner—when I got up the prisoner was in Skinner-street, about twenty yards from my door—I called out "Police" three times—a policeman came into Bishopsgate-street—the prisoner was then crossing in a diagonal direction towards London-bridge—I told the policeman to stop him—he did so—I have not the least doubt about the prisoner—I never lost sight of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long was the occurrence described taking place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Scarcely three minutes, or not so much—my back was turned to them, when they came to me—the first thing that called my attention was the hand upon my watch—I cannot swear to the man who seized the watch, or to the third man who ran away in the same direction as the prisoner—this one I swear to because I followed him—be struck me with some instrument—I don't know what, not his fist alone—I was knocked down—the blow was a very severe one—I was not stunned, nor confused, but after I had given him in charge, I felt myself getting weaker from the loss of blood—I am quite positive it was the prisoner who struck me—there was light from a public-house opposite, which was shut, but there was no space between the top of the shutter and the top of the sash, through which the light came and enabled me to see—it was twenty yards from the place where I fell to where the prisoner was when I got up—he had not got out of Skinner-street—the other men were running together, but they parted—I heard the evidence of the constable at the police-court—I am quite sure I am not mistaking the prisoner for either of the two men—I had been drinking a little, but not much—I had been that night to 219, Bethnal<lb></lb>green-road, to give in my accounts—I often have to stop there till 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning—I was not coming straight from there—I had been to the Cambridge Music-hall—I never lost sight of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-Policeman</hi>, 70). I heard the prosecutor call out "Police!"—I was passing Union-street and ran towards where I heard the sound—I saw the prosecutor coming out of Skinner-street—he pointed to the prisoner as the man who had assaulted him, and attempted to steal his watch—the prisoner was walking up Bishopsgate-street, from the direction of Shoreditch—Skinner-street is on the left-hand side as you go from London-bridge; the City of London Theatre side—the prisoner was on the opposite side—I stopped him—when the prosecutor came up, he said the prisoner had, with two others, attempted to steal his watch in Skinner-street, while entering his door—he also charged him with an assault</p>

               <p>—I asked him if he was sure the prosecutor was the man—he said he was—the prosecutor had been drinking, but he knew what he was about—his nose was laid completely open—the prisoner gave me an address, 23, East-street, Mile-end New-town, but there is no such street there—he then said it was near the Jews' Burial Ground—I went there—there is an Eastman-street, but not an East-street</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business with my two brothers, as brass-founders and engineers, in Jewin-crescent. The prisoner has been in our employ some years as junior clerk in the counting-house—he was in the habit of keeping No. 1 Ledger, in which Mr. Buswell's account is entered—it was his duty to receive money, and to hand it over to me or the cashier—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the ledger</hi>)—on 16th May 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was owing from Mr. Buswell—if he paid cash, the discount would reduce it to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if a Post-office order was sent up, and received by the prisoner, it would be his duty to hand it over to me or the cashier, and make an entry of it in this book—there is no such entry—this letter is the prisoner's writing, and also the writing on the Post-office order—"Received the above, John Warner and Sons"—that is the name by which the firm has gone for some years—it is not "<hi rend="italic">for</hi> John Warner and Sons"—he never had authority to sign my name, or the name of the firm—we invariably send Post-office orders through our bankers—this order has not got the bankers' receipt—there is no entry in the cash-book of any Post-office order about that date—there is an entry on 15th Aug., "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. cash received of Charles Buswell, of Lutterworth"—by that entry the prisoner charges himself with 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that would import that the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. settled the account, and that it had been handed over to me or the cashier—it is our custom to receive old metal from our customers, and make an allowance for it—here is an entry on the credit side of Mr. Buswell's account, in the prisoner's writing, on 25th March, of 25lbs. of metal, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—if that was properly entered it would be got from the old metal book, and there is no entry there of any metal received from Mr. Buswell—this entry</p>

               <p>of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is in my writing—I got that out of the rough cash-book—the entry there is in Arm field's, the cashier's writing—that 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. makes 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that those two entries appear to balance that item—it is a false entry altogether—my brothers are here.</p>

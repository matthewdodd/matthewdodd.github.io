Something farther, they found the Dyes to make Guinea's, Shillings and Halfpence, in an old Stocking hid under the earth. In the Orchard they found   Instruments to mill the Edges of Milled money, and divers other Dyes. The Evidence further declared, that they were seen to coin several times at Hornsey new milled shillings, and King Charles the First Shillings: That his Wife put the Pieces under the Mill whilst they were coined, and that they had seen him coin several false Guinea's of a course sort of Gold, and that each of those Guinea's was worth 20s. as Guinea's go now. Other Evidence deposed <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16951014003"></xptr>that he did clip several hundred <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> clip it for a Groat in the pound. That his Wife did file it, and   she would allow for 21s. of broad money, 32s. of false. That the Brass costs him  l. and the other instrument for milling the money cost 3l. That he had followed this Trade for several years; and that formerly when he coined money he struck it with a Hammer. The Prisoner said that he did never clip nor coin, and that the Mills and the other Instruments were none of his; but he could not prove it, nor give any good account of his life. He said that his Wife was never any ways concerned, which she declared in the Court. The Jury found him <rs id="t16951014-21-verdict117" type="verdictDescription">

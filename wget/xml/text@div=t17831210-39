               <p>Court. How old are you? - Fifteen</p>
               <p>Was you in the shop when the prisoner came in? - Yes, he came in between seven and eight o'clock, him and another came in to buy some cloth for shirts; they staid about five minutes, they bought nothing: as soon as they were gone out I missed a piece of cotton for a gown, I run after them and caught the prisoner by the coat and tore his coat, and as soon as I tore his coat I saw him let the piece fall from under his coat.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was the man that dropped the piece? - Yes, he was never out of my sight; I picked up the piece of cotton and brought it home; it was the same piece I saw the prisoner drop.</p>

               <p>When I went down in the morning the little girl got out to let me into the kitchen, there is a bolt about the middle of the door, which opens from the stairs into the kitchen, she jumped out of bed and let me in, said I, how could you sleep so long and not open my house before, Lord, madam, says she, Jemima, is not here, says I where can she be, says she I don't know, here is her stays, stockings and shoes; here I thought she must have gone up stairs; says she, lord, ma'am, I never was so frightened in my life; I found the shutters opened, and the sash raised up, so I suspected she was gone, I looked about, and I missed my watch which hung by their bed side, I looked about the kitchen, and missed four gowns, and several other things that lay in a great basket ready for the washing; I went for Mr. Hill, and told him I was robbed, he spoke to the little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100013"></xptr> girl, she said she knew nothing about it, at last she did say, she saw her go out of the window, and saw her pack up the things, and that she was gone down in the country.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>I told her we would not do any thing to her, if she would tell the truth, if I got my things it was all I wished for.</p>
               <p>Have you seen the things found in the indictment?</p>
               <p>- FARREN sworn.</p>
               <p>I went down with Mr. Hill and found the things at the place, and I found the etwee in her pocket, the stays upon her, and other things up stairs in a box.</p>
               <p>(Mrs. Hill is desired to speak to the things in the bundle.)</p>
               <p>This bed gown I know, I had it on the very day before, this bed-gown she had on her is mine, I cut it out, and made myself another gown she said was her's; said she bought two gowns at an auction, she knew they were her's, this old cloak I know to be mine, these shoes too.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill. She acknowledged having taken one watch, that the mother was gone out to sell it; it was a woman's watch, with a shagreen case; no promises were made her to confess; 15 guineas were gone.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hill deposed she could not be certain they took the fifteen guineas, as her keys were left in her drawers; the stays, and all the things together are worth 5 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill. I cannot tell the value of the watch; the watch must be worth a guinea, it had a gold dial plate on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill. Here were three of these rings on, they have taken them off, and put a seal and key on, to make it appear like a man's watch.</p>

               <p>All I have to say is, I did not live there as a servant at first; they keep a house of ill fame, I went in the house and catched the small-pox, and was in the hospital ten weeks, my mistress desired me to go into men's company; I did; I did not receive any wages; I have no witnesses; I have no friends in London.</p>

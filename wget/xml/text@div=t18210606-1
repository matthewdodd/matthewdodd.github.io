The plate was in my custody - I saw it all locked up ten minutes before I went to bed; the articles stated in the indictment were all in one cupboard, except the tea-tongs and caddy-ladle - the soup-ladle was an old fashioned fluted one, and had the crest on it. Next morning I got up about a quarter after seven o'clock, and found the hall door open, and a hole cut in it, large enough for a man to put in his hand and open the door - it was an outer door. I then went to the plate cupboard, found that door forced open, and missed the property stated in the indictment; I have since seen the tea-pot and soup-ladle at Bow-street.

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Merle and Co. refiners, who live in Little Britain. I have bought things of the prisoner at different times. On the 2d of April I bought some table and desert spoons of him - about thirteen spoons altogether; consisting of table, desert, tea, and two salt spoons - they weighed in the whole, seventeen ounces and seven penny weight; they were perfect, and had a crest on them, and the motto,</p>
               <p>"Be True." I think the word true was spelt</p>
               <p>"trew" - he brought them as old silver, and gave no particular account of them. I asked his name - he said Williams. He has occasionally sold me plate before, but he gave me the name at this time. The spoons were put in our common stock, and sold next day to a dealer; I cannot tell who it was now, as we had several who came that day. A table-spoon generally weighs two ounces, a desert-spoon about an ounce, and a tea-spoon, ten or twelve pennyweight. I bought nothing else of him. I saw him again about the latter end of April, he came in the afternoon with some old spoons for sale; we had received information, and he was detained.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have many people come to sell plate - A. Yes; he has sold us plate before. I never doubted his being the man. I paid him 4 l. 3 s. 10 d. for them. I think there were four table and four desert spoons.</p>

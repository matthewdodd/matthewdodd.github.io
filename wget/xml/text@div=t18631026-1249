I am attached to Her Majesty's dockyard—on 2d October, at half-past 6, I was a little way from the Arsenal when the men were coming away—I was standing at the corner of Thomas-street, close to the Fortune of War, in company with another constable, named Randall—I saw the prisoners standing together—Ferguson was rather bulky about his left coat pocket—they both went into the For<lb></lb>tune of War, and we followed them—they were drinking some beer—Fer<lb></lb>guson asked me to take something to drink—I refused, and as he took the pot away he began trembling—he went out of the house towards Wellington-street, and I followed him—I said to him, "What have you got in your coat pocket; you may just as well give it to me?"—he said, "It is a bit of metal," and I took out of his pocket this piece of metal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) weighing 15 lbs. 13 ozs.—he said, "Do forgive me".—I said, "I cannot; I must take you to the station"—I waited there until Randall came with the other prisoner from the public-house—I handed the metal to Randall and said, "I have got this metal, so we must go to the station"—Wilson asked me if it could not be settled—I said, "Certainly not"—Ferguson said, "Look at my family; if you take me to the station I shall be ruined for life"—I took them both to the station—Wilson was searched by Randall, and a consider<lb></lb>able quantity of copper found on him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Dock-policeman</hi>). I went with Crouch to the Fortune of War after the prisoners—I was there when Ferguson went out; Crouch followed him—I remained behind with Wilson—when Crouch was outside the door he called to me and said, "I have got it"—I said to him, "We had better bring the other one?"—and he said, "Yes"—that was said in the presence of the prisoners—I then said to Wilson, "You must go up to the police-station"—he said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "Your mate has got some metal outside; Sergeant Crouch took it from him"—Wilson then came out and said, "Cannot this matter be settled?."—Crouch showed</p>

               <p>me the metal and said, "Here it is"—both prisoners replied, "Will you settle it? If you take us to the station, you will ruin us"—they were both taken to the station, and on the way they several times said, "Settle it, for the sake of my wife and family," and that their length of service would be altogether lost—at the station I asked Wilson whether he had got any metal on him—he said, "No; I have not"—I said, "I shall search you, and see whether you have or not"—I went to unbutton his coat, and he said, "Oh yes; I am the same as the other," and from his left coat pocket I took one bar of copper, and out of the right two others (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and he added, "Oh, I thought if would come to this"—the metal weighs one and a half pounds—the Fortune of War is about 300 yards from the Arsenal gates; three or four minutes' walk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman in the Royal Arsenal, where the prisoners were employed—Ferguson is an assistant foreman, and Wilson also, in my department—they were employed at the Arsenal on 2d October—I saw them in "Dial-square" all day, more or less—they passed out about one minute after 6, and had left work for the day—the prisoners would have access to gun metal and copper of the description produced—the value of this gun metal is about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the copper about 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the whole of it is Government property—the gun metal formed the "dead head" of a model gun; it was cut off as waste, and would go back to the foundry to be cast over again—the copper is employed as vents for old guns—the prisoners had no authority to take the metal away—Ferguson has been employed in the Arsenal upwards of twenty years, and has been four years assistant fore<lb></lb>man—Wilson has been nine years in the Government service, and about the same period as assistant foreman.</p>

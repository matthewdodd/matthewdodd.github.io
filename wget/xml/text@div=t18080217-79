               <p>Q. Did you in the month of February go to Mr. Saunders's house to look after a piece of timber. - A. I found there a piece of timber that I had a perfect knowledge of; I brought it back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. I believe you went before Dr. Perry. - A. Yes. (producing two letters.)</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what then passed. - A. The person that towed the timber in the canal said that Heather told him to come and fetch it from his master's house; then Dr. Perry granted a warrant against Heather.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Heather discharged. - A. The magistrate told him he might go about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask Mr. Bowser to pay the expences of the man, or else he would be prosecuted. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any directions from Mr. Greville not to prosecute this man. - A. No other way than you see in the letters.</p>
               <p>MR. BOWSER. - Mr. Bolland. I believe, sir, you live at Uxbridge. - A. I do, I keep iron mills there; the prisoner has worked for me eight years. His character, from the time of his first employment up to this hour is universally honest; him and his wife has free access to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend Dr. Perry. - A. I did. When the prisoner was taken one of the men came into the accompting house and told me that Heather was taken up. When I went to Dr. Perry the commitment was not signed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he committed. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor institute any other examination about the timber. - A. None whatever while I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170046"></xptr>there; through permission. I was desired to go to Mr. Hilliard to know whether any thing could be done to the prisoner. In consequence of that the prisoner was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body make any application, and by whom was the application made to pay the expences. A. Herbert came to me on Friday before the man was committed on the Monday; Herbert said I want to know who is to pay for the prosecution; I said I always understood the prosecutor paid the expenses; I said let it be taken to Heather or Mr. Saunders; he said if you do not pay it bad will come on it.</p>

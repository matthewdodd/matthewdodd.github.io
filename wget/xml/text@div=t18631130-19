I slept there on the Saturday night, and at Plaistow on the Sunday night. I came up by the Fenchurch-street Railway, and wanting something to eat, I went into the first prosecutor's shop and ordered a chop. I paid with a five-shilling piece; I did not know it was bad; it was part of the change for the sovereign, and I had a half-sovereign and a penny left. I went back to Newmarket and came up again in six weeks, with my brother, who is a jockey. He gave me a half-crown and a sixpence, and said he would send me some postage-stamps. I went into the Ship and gave the half-crown. He bounced it, and I said to myself, "Why, that seems like a bad one." I was utterly innocent that it was bad when I gave it.</p>

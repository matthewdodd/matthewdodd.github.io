               <p>Q. When was this done. - A. This morning about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180028"></xptr> twelve o'clock. I saw our apprentice and the prisoner at the bar having a scuffle at the shop door, the apprentice shewed me a saw that he had taken from him. I immediately took him into the counting-house, I there searched him, I took out of his pocket a parcel of iron pins. He immediately fell down on his knees, and asked for mercy. He pulled out of his pocket five more saws, and placed them on the desk. I sent for an officer.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Knight; the prisoner came into the shop this morning, and asked to see some pins. I shewed him some of several sorts, he said they were all too large. I left the drawer on the counter and went up stairs for more; Mr. Knight was behind the counter, and the shopman. I returned and told him we had no smaller, and took the drawer away. On my return, he was looking at the saws, I observed him look round the shop, and shuffling his hand into his pocket. I observed him do it a second time, I then went to him, and he paid me for one saw; he asked me then to let him see some shears; I went up stairs and shewed him some, they did not suit him. He was going out of the shop, I then stopped him, I told him that he had got some saws that he had not paid for. He took one saw out of his left hand coat pocket. I called Mr. Knight, and he took him to the accounting house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Marines, living at Woolwich. The prisoner I brought as a recruit—the captain asked the prisoner if he knew of the robbery—he said he suspected him, for he did not think that he had so much money at first, and he had changed a sovereign in the ship, and when he got into London he would give him up—the prisoner answered he knew nothing at all of it—I went on deck afterwards to the captain—I spoke to the captain and to the prisoner—I asked him if he had done the <hi rend="italic">likes</hi>—he said nothing—I did not charge him, but told him that he was accused of the theft, and that if he had done so he had better give up the money to me—he gave me a sovereign afterwards—I put it into my pocket—I gave it to Mr. Spence.</p>

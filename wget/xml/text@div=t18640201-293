               <p>ale, and a glass of gin for the waterman outside—the ale came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the gin to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half-crown—I got change from the same shelf, placed the half-crown under the other one, and gave him the change—he went and sat down by the men who he had brought in, and the woman remained sitting by the bar—she said to me, "That is the way he always serves me when he comes out; give me half a quartern of hot gin"—I served her, and she gave me a half-crown, which she took from her muff—I put it on the shelf with the other two, and gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—Miss Hart, another barmaid, came to relieve me at 12 o'clock, and after I had gone away ten minutes she called me into the bar and gave me two bad half-crowns—the prisoners were still there, and I accused them of giving them to me—Eastwood said that he did not give them, and Smith said she had no idea it was bad—I gave those two coins to the prisoner, with the third, which Miss Hart afterwards gave me—I had not served any one after the prisoners gave me the half-crowns.</p>

                  </hi>. My brother keeps this public-house in the Westminster-road—I sometimes serve for him in the bar—on 6th January, I went into the bar between 11 and 12 at night, and a young man, named Wilks, came in for change for a sovereign, which I gave him all in silver—I had some change in a box, but it was not sufficient, and I took one half-crown from the shelf to make it up—there was no other half-crown there, but 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was left—I am in the habit of keeping 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there for change—there were some half-crowns among what I took from the box—I did not give change to anybody else, and a short time afterwards Mr. Wilks brought me a bad half-crown—I knew him well, and let the matter stand over till the morning—a customer afterwards gave me a half sovereign to change—I went to the shelf where the silver was, and found two half-crowns, which the barmaid had changed for small silver, and five shillings in small money—I found that the two half-crowns were bad—I left the potman in the bar, went to Miss Winterson's bed-room and told her—she came down directly and accused the prisoners—Smith said that she was not aware of it—I do not recollect what Eastwood said, I was so confused—I had left 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there in silver that evening, but there were no half-crowns, nor had I placed any on the shelf—Wilks came over with the half-crown next morning—I gave it to the barmaid, and she gave it to the constable—I do not think the woman knew that the money was bad.</p>

On Sunday morning, 24th April, I saw the prisoner in the Hemmingford-road, at the corner of Thornhill-square, in the parish of St. Mary, Islington, about a quarter before 4 o'clock in the morning—I went up to him, and asked him where he had come from—he said, "From Barnet"—I asked him whose coat and hat he bad got—he said, his own—I took his hat off, and found in It this tablecloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him a silver snuffbox, four silver spoons, and this hat and coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—t then went to Mr. Silliphank's, No. l, Thornhill-square, and found this counterpane (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) Wrapped up in this handkerchief, in the garden; I took them to the station, and the prisoner said it was his handkerchief, and he meant to go back for the bundle, as he might as well have the lot while he was about it.</p>

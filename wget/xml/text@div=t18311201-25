            . I am an inspector of the Police. I was formerly in the service of the prosecutor - I was well acquainted with his plate; the initials on it are D. M. - I received some communication from the prosecutor, and went to his chambers, in the Albany. on the 29th of October: the prisoner was there, in his service - I wished her to produce the key of the plate-chest; she said it was all right, but refused to show it to me - I threatened that I would search, and take her into custody; after some persuasion she produced the key, and showed me the chest; there was some plate in it - some of the articles were plated, but I did not discover that at that time; I do not know whether the plated articles were the prosecutor's; I asked if she had any duplicates, and she said she had not - in my judgment some of the plate was then missing; I asked where the remainder was - she said that was all that Mr. Macdonald had - I then commenced searching, and found thirty-eight duplicates; about half of them were in the top drawer of a chest in her sitting-room, and the remainder on a shelf in her bed-room - among others was one for this fish-slice, which I marked; I gave her in charge - she afterwards said she pawned the articles, intending to get them out again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. When was this mark made on this duplicate? A.In St. James' station-house, in my presence, by Clements - there was a person named Shingler there; I do not know whether he had lived in the prosecutor's service - I told the prisoner it would be better for her to confess, as I only wished to obtain the articles, and then she made the confession I have stated.</p>

            . I am in the service of Ann Rochford, a pawnbroker, in Jermyn-street. I have a silver fishslice, pawned by the prisoner, on the 3rd of September, in the name of Mary Murchall; I gave this duplicate for it on that day, but whether I took it in of the prisoner on that day I cannot say; I had taken it of her more than once, and it had been redeemed - here is a table-spoon, pawned on the 1st of September, by the prisoner, to the best of my knowledge; here are some other articles, but I did not take them in.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA FREDERICK CLEMENTS. I was at St. James' watch-house on the 29th of October, and received the prisoner in custody; I found some of these duplicates; the articles are here - here are five table-spoons, two sauce-ladles, and a fork.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find the whole of these duplicates? A. I had them from a servant of the prosecutor's, who is not here; the prisoner stated they were in a particular place; but the other servant had found them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

             ERSKINE MACDONALD. This fish-slice is mine - I never authorized the prisoner to pawn it; I had not given it to her, or sold it - she was merely my servant, and, in consequence of some suspicion, I gave directions to Smith.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you brother to Lord Macdonald? A. Yes - he is an Irish Peer; I am his younger brother.</p>

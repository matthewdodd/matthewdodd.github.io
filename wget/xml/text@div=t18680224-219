                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, of 44, Greek Street, Soho—on Sunday morning, 7th of February, about half-past twelve, I was passing from King Street into Queen Street, and the gentleman who knocked me down struck me a violent blow across the nose, which I feel the effects of up to this moment—I believe that to be the gentleman (Hunt)—when I fell, Whelan was meddling with my waistcoat pocket and rifling my pockets—he had his hands in all of them—I had a snuff-box in one pocket and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in another, and my pocket-book and a pair of spectacles—they tore my pocket from my coat in taking the things from me—I had had a glass of gin or two with a few friends, but I knew perfectly well what I was about,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186802240008"></xptr>
               <p>and, moreover, I took to the road that no one should interfere with me, and that I should not interfere with anybody—Whelan was taken when he came round to Bow Street to see how his friend got on—I knew him again—when I was knocked down the prisoner helped me up, and said, "Poor old man, what a shame to knock him about."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman F</hi> 169). On Sunday morning, the 7th of February, about twenty minutes to one, I was on duty in Queen Street, Seven Dials, in plain clothes—I saw the prisoners there with several others standing on the kerb on the left-hand side of the street—I saw Davis walking down the middle of the street—Hunt left the pavement, walked into the middle of the street, and took a deliberate aim at him and struck him a violent blow on the nose—he staggered some six or seven yards back, then he over-recovered himself and fell on to his hands—Hunt walked back on to the pavement—while he was on the ground, Whelan walked off the pavement, took hold of his left arm, and said, "What a d—shame to use an old man like that"—as there was a large mob of thieves there I did not interfere, but I watched them—they took him in the direction of King Street, Long Acre—I crossed and got in front of them—at that moment Hunt came up and took hold of the prosecutor's right arm—Whelan was leading him along—they commenced shouting "Police" then—as they were leading him along, I saw Whelan's hand in the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket—some woman called out, "<hi rend="italic">Mark the copper</hi>," which means that a policeman is coming—Whelan then ran away—I was about to pursue him, and a woman ran right in front of me and prevented me—seeing that he could run too fast, I stopped—a mob immediately gathered round, and Hunt was about shifting out of the crowd when 171 F came up and took him into custody—I afterwards went to the station and found Whelan in custody, and they were both charged—Davis had been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what he was about—he was sensible—I know the prisoners, and know them to be companions.</p>

I was on duty in King Street, Long Acre, on this morning—I heard shouts of "Police," and saw the pro<lb></lb>secutor there and Hunt with him—Whelan was about forty yards off, in the crowd—the prosecutor gave Hunt into custody for assaulting him and assisting to rob him—I took him to the station—Whelan afterwards came to the station to inquire about him, and he was taken—I found on Hunt 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a knife—nothing was found on Whelan.</p>

            . I keep the White Bear public-house in Field-lane. On the 9th of July, bewtween five and six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, and another man, came to my house-the other man called me out of the tap-room, and asked me to buy a set of harness. I asked him where it was? he took me in to the prisoner, who shewed it to me. I asked the prisoner what he wanted for it? he said, 20s. I asked him if it was his own? he said he made it himself, and lived in Dean-street, Holborn. I questioned him further about it; he then said he lived in Wellington-place, Drury-lane; he appeared in a hurry to get rid of it. Suspecting him, I sent for Barnley; when he came he said he lived some where else. He said it was his own, and distress was the cause of his selling it at that price - He agreed to sell it to Barnley for 15s.</p>

I was sent for, and asked the prisoner if he wanted to sell the harness? - he asked 1l. for it, I offered him 15s. for it, and asked him if it was his own? he said, Yes, and he had two or three more sets at home; he said I should have it for 15s., and one shilling's-worth of rum and water. I told him, if he would tell me how he got it I would pay him for it. He said he lived in Dean-street - I took him into custody. When he got to the office, he said he did not live there. As he went to Bridewell, he said he lived in Wellington-place, Drury-lane, and desired me to let his wife know. I could not find any more there.</p>

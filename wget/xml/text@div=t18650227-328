I am the wife of James Wragg, of 7, Essex-street, Bethnal-green-road—about the beginning of September last, the prisoner came to me—he said he was a ship's carpenter, and that he had come from Australia from my son—n-law's, and he wanted lodgings—he said he had valuable things aboard: monkeys, parrots, crape shawls, and other valuables, and he wished to place them under my care, as my son—n-law said they would be safe—he asked me to recommend him a carman; I did so, a man who used to bring my son—n-law's things home, and he said, "I can<lb></lb>not fetch them, but I will recommend him to another carman, as my horse is ill, 'and he did so—just before he went away the prisoner said, "Oh! by the bye, can't you give me some money to clear the ship?'—I said, "I have only 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that is my rent-money"—I gave him that—he said, "Can't you get some more?'—I said, "I will try"—he said, "I will be back in one hour, and give you double, when I am paid at 3 o'clock"—I went to a neighbour, and got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and lent him that—I let him have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—I lent him the money from what he told me—I should not have lent him it if he had not told me what he did—I believed he was a ship's carpenter—he saw a model of a ship in the house, and told me John had not made it cleverly.</p>

            . I am the father of Mrs Cohen, I came past my son's house that same evening, the house was quite secure then; the prisoner was standing at the door pretending to make water; I asked him if he wanted any body that way; he mentioned something about a crimp living in that house, I told him no. I did not like the man's looks at all; this was about seven o'clock, it was quite dark; then I went home, my son and daughter were at my house; I told them to go home. About two or three months afterwards, the woman that the prisoner lived with laid an information against him. He came past were I lived I secured him; this waistcoat was upon him.</p>

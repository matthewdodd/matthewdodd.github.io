               <p>I am a watchman, I was coming from the watch-house in Moorfields, on the 16th, on Wednesday, and coming by this old house there is a hole in the corner of the wall, there is a gutter that hung over the edge; on looking at the two pair of stairs I saw somebody on the roof of the house, through the cieling; I called out loud, and they both came running down stairs, and came out of this hole in the wall: we asked them what they had been about, and they rubbed their eyes, and said they had been belated, and had been there for sleep; we put them in the watch-house, and in about two minutes I went up stairs, and Mr. Messer followed me; I went and got through the hole of the ceiling, and I saw the lead cut, it was fresh cut, and looks so now, one part of it is gone, it was cut almost off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you find another man in the house? - Yes, he was a poor fellow that only laid down to sleep; the prisoners said he did not belong to them; he was in the corner next the chimney.</p>

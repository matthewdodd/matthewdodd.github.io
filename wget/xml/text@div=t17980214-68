               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. That poor fellow is one of the Tower-Hamlets Militia? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q.One man came into your shop under pretence of buying? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, that he only came in under pretence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner till you caught hold of him by the collar, with the umbrella in his hand? - A. Yes, I saw him come up to the door with the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you ever see them speak one to the other? - A. I cannot swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by swearing that they came together then, if you did not see them speak to each other? - A. They came together.</p>
               <p>Q. There is generally a croud about that time on a Saturday evening? - A. Yes, no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q.What you came back with the prisoner, was the other man in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you thought them both connected, why did not you take them both into custody? - A. I did, and he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been unlucky enough, the day after this offence was committed, to say a great number of other umbrellas were stolen from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you unfortunately, the next day, an execution in your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's mother? - A. I have seen her.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not ask her to give you a guinea, and if she gave you a guinea, you would not appear before the Magistrate? - A. I will not answer that question.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are bound to answer that question, did you or not? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with her? - A. Yes, a few words.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not tell her, that if she gave you a guinea, you would not appear against him? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>You will swear that? - A.Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not accuse some other person, the next day, of stealing umbrellas? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many? - A. A dozen or fourteen; but it was not the next day, it was on Monday night, when the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the night before the execution? - A. Yes; there was a distress made, and my property was taken away out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go out of the way yourself the next day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not represent to the prisoner's mother, that you were in great distress, and if she would give you a guinea, you would make it up? - A. I told the prisoner's mother so the same night that he was committed; a man who was at the Public-office, in Marlborough-street, begged me to go and see him, and I would not; a day or two after, the mother came to me to beg mercy, I told her it was out of my power; what I said, was the consequence of your son's taking my property, it has brought down the devil's luck with it, for I am in trouble, and have lost all my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, that if she would give you a guinea, you would not appear against him? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say, when you took hold of him at your shop door, I was going to ask the price of it, and was only looking at it? - A. He said nothing, but trembled.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you, he only took it down to look at, to see if it was such an one as he wanted? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not going towards your shop door? - A. No, the contrary way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not searched, and a twenty-shilling note, and several shillings found upon him? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the search was made? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p> - KELLY sworn. I am a watchman: I was upon duty that night; I heard a noise, and hurried myself to the noise as fast as I could; I got to the door, and got charge of this man; I took him to the watch-house; he was just by the threshold of the door, there was another man in the shop, I did not see any umbrella on the man, I believe they had taken it from him; another man took the other man.</p>
               <p>VALENTINE ROMLEY sworn. - I am a watch-house keeper: I searched the prisoner, and the umbrella came into my hands to take care of,(produces it); he had not money about him, to the best of my knowledge; I received the umbrella from the prosecutor himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the other man any money? - A. I think not, but I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley Q.How did you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140089"></xptr>serch the prisoner? - A. I searched him thoroughly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search his fob? - A. I do know that I did, I dare say that I did, but I cannot swear it. (The umbrella was deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my witnesses.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TOWNSEND sworn. - I belong to the Tower-Hamlets Militia: the prisoner had enlisted on the Thursday before, and received his bounty-money, which is five pounds; I have known him twelve years, he is a very honest man.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH CRESE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am the mother of the prisoner: I went to the prosecutor's house on the Tuesday evening after my son was taken up; he seemed quite severe upon it, and made a great many protestations, that he had been robbed the over-night of eleven umbrellas, and the man he had got, he would make answer for the whole; I begged him to be merciful, he said nobody had been to defend him, if he got a guinea, and was paid for his trouble, he would not appear against him; I said, if that had been all, I would have been glad to have given two, not to have brought him into this trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath you have taken, the prosecutor made use of the expressions you have now stated? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Donahoo.) You have heard what this woman has sworn, is it true or false? - A. It is quite false.</p>

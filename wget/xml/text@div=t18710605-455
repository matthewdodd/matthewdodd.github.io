At 4 o'clock in the morning of Sunday, 12th March last, I was on duty in Tower Street, Lambeth—the prisoner came up to me, and wanted to know if he could go into the station—I asked him for what purpose—he said he was tired of his life, and tired of walking about; he also said that he wanted to give himself up for a murder he had committed in Brompton, in August last, at some gardens called Gledhow Gardens—he said he had murdered a potman, Samuel Lee—I asked him why he had done it—he said "I owed him some money; he demanded more than I owed him, and we quarrelled; I went behind him, and took up a hammer, and struck him on the back of the head; with that, he fell; I struck him several times afterwards, and then left him for dead"—I took him to Tower Street Station, where he made a statement to the Inspector on duty—it was 4.15 when I got to the station with him—he was perfectly sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Chief Inspector of the Detective Police—on the 19th or 20th August last, I saw the prisoner at a workshop on the estate in Bolton Gardens—it was on the Thursday or Friday after the body was found; that would be on the 19th or 20th—the murder was on Saturday, the 13th, and the body was found on Tuesday, the 16th—I asked the prisoner where he received his wages on the Saturday previous—he said "At No. 15, Bolton Gardens"—I said "What time did you arrive home?"—he said "About 2.10"—I asked him at what time he received his wages that day—he said "About 1 o'clock"—there were about ninety men that I had to see, who were at work on the estate—I was investigating the murder at that time—I knew where he lived; it was, I should think, about twenty-five minutes' or half-an-hour's walk, from 3, Gledhow Gardens—that was all that passed between us on that occasion—I was present at the inquest; it was held on the 18th, either Wednesday or Thursday—I think there was an adjournment—I was present on both occasions—the prisoner was not there on either occasion—I next saw him, to speak to him, about 11 o'clock on Sunday, 12th March last—he was, at that time, in custody—I had received a telegram, which caused me to go to the police-station at Kensington—he was in a cell there—I said to him "Do you know me?"—he said "Yes, you are Mr. Palmer"—I said "Have you been drinking?"—he said "No"—I said "Have you any pains in your head?"—he said "No"—I said "Are you aware of what you have been saying, and the serious consequences that may occur?"—he said "Yes"—I said "But no hammer was found"—he said "I left it there"—I said "Do you mean to say that it is true, what you have been stating?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I will fetch your father," which I did, and his father and brother had an interview with him—before that, I said to him, "What makes you make this serious accusation against yourself?"—he said "I could not stand it any longer; poor old Jack used to stand by the side of my bed at night, staring at me with those big eyes of his"—the interview with his father and brother took place in my presence—he adhered to the same statement—his elder brother spoke to him; his father was too much affected—I did not hear everything that passed between them, but I heard him make the remark that he could not help it, he had done it—I was present on another occasion when his father was with him, at the Hammersmith Police Court—I think that was at the second exam<lb></lb>ination; the 28th March—his father had an interview with him, and he then said that he could not help it, that he had done it—his father said "I cannot believe it"—on 4th April, at the last examination, I asked him if he was hungry—he said "Yes"—he had had nothing since 8 o'clock—I sent him in some food, which he thanked me for, and as I was leaving the cell, he said "Mr. Palmer, have you found the hammer?"—I said "No"—he</p>

               <p>said "Well, I can't account for it; I always thought I left it in the room"—I may add that, on the day the body was found, Tuesday, the 16th, I searched the room, and was not able to find any hammer—I was not the first person there; it was some hours after the body was found; but I searched the house fully, and also the day following, but I found no hammer, or any instrument that would be likely to inflict the wounds—several persons had been there before me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Some of the adjoining houses were searched, and the neighbourhood, and I was never able to find anything of the kind—the con<lb></lb>versation I have spoken of I now depose to in the witness-box, for the first time—I did not say a word about it at the Police Court—I did not take it down in writing—I gave evidence at the Police Court as to going to the prisoner, and looking at the house—when I saw him and questioned him on the Thursday or Friday after the body was found, he appeared cool and collected—I bad not the slightest reason, from his answers or his appearance, to suspect him—he answered every question I put to him, and answered it truthfully, as I found out, about the payment of the wages, and so on—I ascertained that he did get home about 2.30, because I made enquiries about every workman—he did not say that after he received his wages, and before he went home, he dined in Sloane Square—he did not say where he had his dinner—I have never heard him say anything about that—I examined and questioned not only him, but about ninety workmen, and followed up any clues—I ascertained what men had been discharged, and made every neces<lb></lb>sary enquiry—I found that two men had been discharged just previous to the murder, sixty or seventy at various times, but two shortly before—I endeavoured to follow up those clues, and I cleared up as to where they were on the day in question; there were other clues that I endeavoured to work out; there was one which I followed up for some time, and I found that he could not have committed the murder, he was too drunk to walk; that was not my only reason for foregoing my suspicion—the suspicion was, because he had called on the widow of the deceased a day or two after—I cleared that up, to my own satisfaction—there were other clues which I was following oat at the time, without any success—the doctor was examined at the inquest—the nature of the wounds was spoken of—I heard it suggested, by the doctor, that it must have been done with a hammer, such as a lather's or plasterer's hammer—the prisoner is a painter by trade—his father is a person of very great respectability; he is a sort of sub-contractor, he does the whole of the painting for Messrs. Spicer, on that estate, and was employ<lb></lb>ing his son under him—in the course of this inquiry I have had every reason to rely upon what the father has stated to me—I said to the prisoner, at Kensington, "Are these the clothes you had on in August last, the day of the murder?"—he said "No, you will find my clothes under my bed," describ<lb></lb>ing the coat and trowsers—I ultimately got a coat and trowsers from the house; they have been submitted to medical inspection, to the doctor who examined the deceased, for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was anything upon them—I did not get his boots.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not know the prisoner at all, until I made these en<lb></lb>quiries in August—I have no means of knowing what clothes he actually wore on that Saturday; some clothes were given up to me—I did not mention the conversation when I was at the Police Court; no professional person was employed in the case there; I had to conduct the case myself—before I used it in evidence I took the opinion of the Soli<lb></lb>citor</p>

I am landlord of the Drayton Tavern, Thistle Grove, Brompton—the deceased man, Samuel Lee, was a potman in my service—I was in the habit of supplying the workmen engaged on the estate, in which Gledhow Gardens is situate, with beer, during the week, and it was their practice to pay when they got their wages, on Satur<lb></lb>day—Lee had been in my service about three years—he kept a book—the last time I saw him alive was about 12.30 on Saturday morning, 13th August; he was then in front of the bar—I had just given him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver for change; it was mixed silver, half crowns and shillings; that was to enable him to give change to the workmen when he received his money to settle the weekly accounts for beer—I did not see his book—he went out with that money—he would have to receive, on my account, I daresay, about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the workmen, on that Saturday—he did not collect money for anyone else, but he himself used to supply dinners to the men, which he used to give credit for, so that he had debts due to himself to collect, as well as mine—after he went out, on that day, I did not see him again alive—his ordinary time for returning would be about 1.30—information was given to the police that had not returned—on the following Tuesday, the 16th, in consequence of what I heard, I went to No. 3, Gledhow Gardens; a man named White fetched me there—No. 3 is very nearly opposite my house—I went up stairs to the ground floor, and there saw the body of Lee—he was lying on his back, in the dining-room, the back room, and this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was by the side of him, close against his hand—I went round the other side of the room, and it appeared to me that there had been two parties standing opposite each other, by the mantelpiece—there were two footprints, and there was another footprint and a half, just the ball of the foot, without a heel, but there had been a good many cats running about the floor, so that they had disturbed them a good deal—the room was all covered with dust—a constable was sent for, and he examined them.</p>

               <p>when I got into the house I perceived a remarkably disagreeable smell—I went into the back room ground floor, and there found the dead body of Samuel Lee, known to me as "Potman Jack"—we did not know his proper name on the premises—the door of the room was partially closed—it stood about a foot open—before I went into the room I saw the hair of a man's head, as I supposed, through the partially open door—I opened the door, went in, and found the body—upon this I went back to No. 6, and fetched Benham, a fellow workman, and told him what I had found, and I then sent for Mr. Adkins, the landlord, and he brought the policeman Large with him, and another constable—we went into the room, and they examined the body—I have known the prisoner about four year—I had seen him for some length of time—he was working at No. 6—I saw him the week before, and the week before that—I am not positive whether he was working at No. 6 on that Saturday, but I saw him several days during that fortnight, working on the estate—he has been working on the estate all the four or five years I have known him—the out-door workmen were supplied with beer by Lee—I have known Lee lend money to several workmen—Saturday was his usual pay day.</p>

On Tuesday, 16th August, from what I heard I went to No. 3, Gledhow Gardens—and on the ground floor there, saw the deceased lying on his back and this book lying on the floor, open, leaf downwards—I got my knife and got it up from the floor—I saw there were several wounds about the man's head and face, and his clothes were all smothered in blood—he was lying in a large pool of blood—I searched his pockets and found a sovereign in his right hand trowsers pocket, and a shilling in his waistcoat, through a hole in the lining of the pocket—Mr. Godrich, a surgeon, was sent for, and he examined the body in my presence—I had not turned the body over before he came—I searched minutely every place I could think of, to find what the wounds had been inflicted with; up the chimney and every place that could be thought of, but could not find any instrument—there are entries in this book of the name of "Woolley"—in four places, I think—there are no initials against the name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should think the deceased man's weight would be nearly nine stone, or from that to ten stone—that, would be about his weight, I should think—I weigh twelve stone—he was short and stout, but not over and above stout—I lifted him, not by myself, with assistance—dead people always appear more heavy than living ones—I noticed dust down the front of his clothes, and on the front of his trowsers, as if he had first fallen on his face; that was the appearance—I could not tell from the appearance of the floor whether there had been a struggle, because where he was, it was all blood—there was a great deal of blood where the head and shoulders lay, in fact the blood had run nearly four feet from where the body was—there were a few <hi rend="italic">spatters</hi> of blood on the wall, as though it had spattered in three different places, on both sides and behind—his clothes were covered with blood all the way to the waist, all smothered in blood—there are five or six stone steps to go up from the road to the front door—is that distance elevated above the road—the back room looks out into a large garden at the back of all the houses, a large square—there is no road out there—I should think where the body lay would be 40ft. from the road, including the path—I looked in other places as well as in the house for the hammer—I made a minute search all about the place and in the gardens, every place we could think of at that time, and times after—I went in at the door just behind the landlord—two persons had been up to the fire-place; you could see the footmarks in the dust—one of those two appeared to have been the deceased, there is no doubt about that—there were the footmarks of two persons in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Fulham Road, West Brompton—on Tuesday, 16th August, I saw the body of the deceased, at No. 3, Gled<lb></lb>how Gardens, and on the 17th I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—perhaps I had better read the notes that were taken down at the time the <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> occurred—the original notes are partly in my handwriting, and partly in my son's—I saw the body on the 16th August—I was fetched by a police<lb></lb>man—on the 17th I received an order from the Coroner, to make a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I found that the deceased was about 5ft. 3 in. high, he was well nourished, and apparently healthy; he was lying in a dried pool of blood, apparently dead three or four days; the right arm was slightly abduced from the body, the left arm close to it, both arms ex<lb></lb>tended;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187106050037"></xptr>
               <p>the eyes were widely open, the right pupil somewhat dilated; the face, head, and arms, more or less covered with blood; also the back of the clothes; no blood on the clothes in front; there are several spots of blood on the wall, about four feet from the body; the black trowsers are covered with dust similar to that on the floor; the shirt is rolled up above the elbows"—I mean that his arms were bare up to the elbows—"He was a stout, healthy-looking man. In the front of the head there was a large, round, depressed wound, as though made by some blunt instrument, in the median line of the head; that had impli<lb></lb>cated some of the bones of the nose; it was knocked in upon the brain; it was about one inch, or three-quarters, beaten in upon the brain; it mea<lb></lb>sured about one inch and three-quarters one way, and one inch and a quarter the other. Just above this fracture there was another on the frontal bone, running into the first, apparently made by a more cutting instrument, the bones being out through, rather than depressed; the length of this wound is five-eighths of an inch; still more to the right, near the coronal suture, is another fracture of the same character as the last, running into it; by these fractures a large portion of the frontal bone is detached from the rest of the skull. Over the left eye there is a triangular wound, exposing the periosteum, that is, the lining of the bone, but not implicating the bones. Immediately below the right eye is a large contused wound, not exposing any bone, but beneath it the mala, the cheek bone, and the jaw-bone, are fractured in several directions, and depressed into the antrum, that is beneath the nose, knocked in upon the brain. On the left side of the face, although there is no evidence of a blow, the nasal processes, that is, the nose, and the superior maxillary bone, are detached; that blow, I think, must have been given after the cessation of the circulation, there was no appearance of braise in it. On the right parietal region the perios<lb></lb>teum was denuded by an irregular wound, the bone was uninjured, that was, in popular language, on the right side of the head. On the back of the head, on the left side, is a large comminuted fracture, that is, the bones are all broken up into pieces beneath the skin, on the left side, behind, through which lacerated brain substance is protruding; that implicated the occi<lb></lb>pital bone, and the left parietal bone of that side; by this fracture a train<lb></lb>gular portion of bone on each side, about an inch and a half, is detached, and hangs by the scalp. In addition to this, a number of smaller portions are detached—that injury has apparently been inflicted by two blows, one of a rounded form, the other in front, of a cutting character. Immediately behind the right ear is an incised wound, 21/4 inches long, by which a flap of the scalp is removed from the temporal and occipital bones, and the periosteum exposed; this had apparently been inflicted from behind, as the flap was adherent to the front only; behind, on the occipital region, on the right side, there was a smaller contused scalp wound; there were no other apparent injuries")—When I first saw the body, he was lying on the back—on the front of his trowsers was the debris of mortar and stuff in the room; it was very thick; they were black trowsers—there was no blood on his clothes in front lower than about here (the chest); but he was lying on his back, in a pool of blood—he must have fallen on his face, otherwise he would have been turned over twice—I know what a plasterer's hammer is—I gave it as my opinion then that it was done by a plasterer's hammer, or something of that character; that is my present opinion—that has a blunt hammer on one side, and a cutting chisel on the other—I saw nothing of any hammer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can come to no other conclusion than that the large wound behind was the first that he received—I should think there were five wounds that would have caused instant death, and that one particu<lb></lb>larly—I think that must have been the first and mortal wound, from the state of his clothes—that wound was caused by two blows, one by a round substance, and one of a cutting character—that must have been a very heavy blow, indeed, given with immense violence, and must have been done with a heavy hammer—the skull is particularly thick there—that wound must have caused instant death—the man must have fallen forward, on his face; his clothes, and the whole of his black trowsers, being covered with dust in front—he could not have moved himself after that, he must have been turned over by some other force, and the other blows must have been inflicted afterwards, otherwise he must have been turned over twice; he was, I should say, rather a stout, powerful man, a broad man, about 5ft. 3 in. in heighth; I should say his weight was ten or eleven stone, or more than that—I am ten, and I should think he was two stone heavier than I am—he was a stout, fat, well-built man—if he was dead when he fell, it would take more power to turn him over than it would if he had been alive—we had a difficulty in moving him up to be examined—I gave evi<lb></lb>dence before the Coroner, and described the wounds—I read from this paper—the eyes were wide open, widely extended; he looked as though he were looking at you with his eyes very wide open—I have used the word <hi rend="italic">staring;</hi> we call it staring when the eyes are so very wide open—I used that ex<lb></lb>pression before—I also stated my impression that it must have been done with a hammer of the kind mentioned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant foreman, at Messrs. Spicer's works—I was employed on the estate at which Gledhow Gardens is situate—I know No. 6; there was a plasterer's hammer lying in the fire-place, at No. 6, some time previous to the murder; it was an old hammer, that belonged to no one particularly; it was lying in the fire-place, among some rubbish; it was claimed by no one particularly, and I gave it out of my office to one of the labourers to clean some bricks with; that was some months pre<lb></lb>vious,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187106050039"></xptr>
               <p>but it had been lying in that house for some considerable time—I last saw it lying in the fire-place, at No. 6—I expect that was about two months previous to the murder—it was an old plasterer's hammer, the cutting part was very much worn away, but the bottom part was only a little chipped; it was a hexagon-shaped hammer—it has been searched for—I followed the constable, and searched for it immediately the body was found—I was not able to find it, or trace it in any way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave it out to somebody to chip away the cement work, and to clean bricks—I don't recollect who that was—it is two years ago when it was first given out—I saw it after that, some months after<lb></lb>wards; I saw it continually—I last saw it lying in the fire-place—the work<lb></lb>men were finishing that house, No. 6, at the time of the murder—I was there during the last two months before the murder; I did not notice it then, I did not see it at all—the reason I noticed it two months previous was because I saw a man using it—I was in that house, three or four times a day between that two months and the time of the murder, and in that room in which I had seen the hammer—this matter has been a good deal discussed amongst the workmen, as to its being done with a hammer—it was my impression, when I saw the shape of the wound, that it was done with a plasterer's hammer—I believe it was frequently discussed amongst the men—I have not seen any of them imitate the way in which they thought it was done—I have heard them suggesting the way in which it was done—I have very little association with the men, beyond the work, and I do not hear what their discussions are.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There sare five Woolleys working on the estate, my elder brother, two sons, and a nephew—the prisoner went away from home about 9.30 on the Friday morning before he gave himself up, so his mother tells me; I was not at home at the time—he did not come home after that Friday—where he slept that night I have no knowledge, or on the Saturday—he was not angry with me before he went away, that I know of—I saw very little of him the last four weeks he was at home—I suppose he would be annoyed at my having discharged him—I knew of the body being found on the same evening; my son told me of it—he said something like this, "O father, they have found the body of poor old Jack in No. 3," but the exact words I could not tell you positively—I did not see any appear<lb></lb>ance of confusion about him at any time; nothing but what you would think natural—I was there when the Inspector came to see him—he appeared quite cool and collected, a great deal cooler than me—when he spoke about the body being found, he spoke in a feeling manner; he seemed to be quite feeling about it—I saw him about 2.10 on the Saturday—he had his tea with me between 6 and 7 o'clock, when I came home from the Abbey—I did not notice his clothes particularly—there was nothing upon his clothes to attract my attention; no blood, or dirt, or anything of that kind—there was nothing at all amiss with him that day, that I know of—the clothes that were afterwards given up to the Inspector were the clothes that he was wearing on that day—when I came back on the Saturday afternoon, I found him working in the garden—he worked there the whole afternoon, without coat or waistcoat on—he kept on the same trowsers—a person, named Jackson, was working there with him—besides the wages that I gave him, he was receiving money about that time from the Savings' Bank—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think it was, that very week that he went to the Crystal Palace; that was besides his wages—I paid him the day's wages for his holiday, and we were making overtime that week—as contractor, I had to overlook the house, No. 3, as well as the other houses—there had not been any work done in it for some months before the murder—I had not been in the house for some months—we left it under second colour, and I went over it to see that it was done all through—no tools were left lying about the house at that time, that I know of—this matter was a good deal discussed amongst the men; it was the common talk all day along—I have heard it discussed when my son has been present; I have discussed it with him myself—I have seen some of the men, when they have been discussing it in his presence, suggest the way in which it was done; some said it was done one way, and some another, imitating the way in which it was done; moat probably I have done so myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have got his Savings Bankbook(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., left now—he had none there in August; he took the last out the last week in July—I have no doubt about the clothes that the police took away—the coat was one of my own, a brown-coloured sort of coat; I think the trowsers were a sort of grey, rather lighter than those I have on—those were the very clothes he was at work in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Mr. Reynolds's, Sun-square, Bishops-gate, and rent the back-parlour. On the morning of the 13th of October I locked the door and went out, and took the key with me—on return<lb></lb>ing, I found the things in confusion, my door broken open, and the window also—I missed a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of trowsers, which hung on a nail when I went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, William Reynolds, in Sun<lb></lb>square, Bishopsgate, Mr. Crohnheim occupies the back part of the house. On the 13th of November I came home, about a quarter past four o'clock—I heard a noise in the back-parlour—I looked through the key-hole, and then went into the yard—I found the window open, and saw the prisoner coming from the bed with some clothes in her hand, to the window—she said, "Where is Tom?"—I said, "You wretch, you are a. thief"—she said, "Mercy, mercy, I will give you any thing to let me go"—I shut the window down—she broke the glass, put her hand through, tore my bonnet, and scratched my face—when she found she could not get the window open, she broke the panel of the door, and put her head and shoulders through—we had a great struggle in the passage—I hallooed out for assistance, and the neighbours came and detained her—she said she would leave her shawl if I would let her go—when I first saw her she dropped some things by the window—I found all the things strewed about—the coat, waistcoat, and trowsers were on the floor by the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was sent for to the house—I found the prisoner in the passage struggling with the witness—she said, "If you will let me go I will pay the damage done"—the back-parlour window was broken from within, as the glass laid in the yard—the pri<lb></lb>soner's hand was bleeding very much—the room door appeared to be broken from within—these clothes were on the floor, and the room in confusion—the water-closet is quite distinct from the room.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant C</hi> 9.) I was sent for by Measrs. Rushworth and Jarvis, on the 22nd of July, to Saville-row, for the purpose of taking the prisoner's fellow-servant into custody—I went back after<lb></lb>wards, and searched the top room of the house; the room used for the servants to sleep in—the first day I searched for money, and found a sovereign—I went afterwards, and found this hair-chain, in a small red box that was locked—the prisoner gave me the key of it on the Monday I saw it, but did not remove it—on the Wednesday I went again—it was locked—I sent for a man to open it—I found the muslin in a box that was locked—a man broke it open—Mrs. Squibb was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am widow of the late Francis Squibb—the prisoner resided with me for five or six years—I missed a piece of India muslin, dur<lb></lb>ing the life of my husband—I made search for it throught the house—it was about the beginning of the year 1833—I was assisted by the prisoner—I could not find it—this is the piece that was searched for.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you obtain this piece of muslin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was in a chest that was sold by my husband, belonging to Lady Jones—my husband died in December, 1833—there was not a great deal of this kind of muslin—it was divided between three Ladies—none of it had been sold by Mr. Squibb in the sale-room; this had never been in the sale-room—I have frequently made the prisoner presents—my husband did not make her presents, to my knowledge—he left her 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a brooch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now do you see this other piece of muslin made into a collar (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>ducing it</hi>); compare it with the other; is it of the same quality? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but one has been washed, and the other has not—I never saw the prisoner wearing this openly about the house—I might have seen it—I do not notice servants' dresses—I have no recollection of this collar being found in the box with the muslin—in 1834 I went to Ireland, and left her in care of the house; so that she had two years to dispose of the muslin—I did not leave her money to pay bills—I left her a sovereign, to pay contin<lb></lb>gent expences—I never authorised her to receive money from tenants—I may have told her if any weekly tenants called, to take the rent.</p>

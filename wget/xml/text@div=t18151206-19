             then came before me, and said, don't go yet, let us have some more drink. I said I should not stop, for I should be locked out. Before I could well give them that answer, the other three were round me; Barry put his hand into my pocket, where there were two old silk handkerchiefs; I found another hand in my breeches pocket, and on looking round, it was George Green, who is not in custody; I laid hold of Green's hand; he kept lungeing me with his shoulder, and said, "I had better take it quietly, for I must be served." The prisoner Cooper, had his arms round me, and kept my arms down. Finding I was overpowered, I would not resist any more. They took from me seventeen shillings and sixpence or eighteen shillings, two silk handkerchiefs, and my tellescope, which I use in my employ. They had not gone far before they fell quarrelling about dividing the money. I did not like to go to the watchman who were near me, for fear they should come back to me again and illuse me. The two watchman went up to them, hearing them quarrelling, and then they dispersed. I followed them into Whitecross street, and then I saw

I told him what I had lost, and he said, he would go and try to get it back from them. They then went along talking and swearing, and I followed them through Finsbury square; then

             came and asked me what I had lost? I told him, and he said it was a great shame, for that George Green had sold him, he only got two or three shillings from me. He told me I had better be quiet until the morning, for he did not suppose they would give me my property back that night. I then went home to my own lodgings. On the Friday evening following, we found Barry sitting in the Sun Dial in Goswell street, and apprehended him, and the officers searched him; they look two silk handkerchiefs from him; they asked me if they were mine? before I could well answer them, Barry said, they were not mine; for mine were two old ones, and one of these was almost new; they were neither of them mine. Cooper was found in Giltspur street Compter, upon another charge.</p>

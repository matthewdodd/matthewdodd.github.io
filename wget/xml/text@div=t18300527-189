On the 10th of April I was introduced to the prisoner in Blackfriars-road, between seven and eight o'clock - we walked down Holland-street, into Green-walk; the person who introduced me said, "This is the man;" he said, "Very well" - he gave me a parcel containing some base half-crowns; on the 19th of April I met Goff and Myers, by appointment, at the Plough in Carey-street, between four and five o'clock -Goff searched me in the presence of Myers; I had nothing; Goff gave me sixteen good shillings - I went into Carey-street, saw the prisoner, and went with him into <placeName id="t18300527-189-crimeloc1013">Grange-court</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who has accommodated you with those gentlemanly habiliments to come here? A. My own labour; I did not appear against Bishop - I was never convicted in my life; I have a brother - he does not go by the name of Bradbury of Pope; I never went by the name of Howard or Dunn - I have known Mr. Powell five or six years; I was employed in one case before, four or five years ago - I get nothing except my expences; I appeared against a person of the name of Phillips and another; I never was abroad - I do not know that I ever was at the Coach and Horses, Mutton-hill; I never had a case against me - Goff asked me to detect a man in selling bad coin; a man named Bill introduced me to the prisoner - I never saw Bill till the 8th of April; the officer brought him to me at the Angel - I do not know that his name is Brathwaite; I was never at the Mint with him - I do not know that I have a relation who has been transported: Goff was by when I bought the parcel of the prisoner - I suppose I was searched to see if I had any money; I have heard the word tush before - I heard Bill use it - I never used it; I have seen bad money in Whitechapel, and other places - I never was a smasher; I have in my hand a little book, in which I sometimes write - here is the prisoner's name, but nothing else respecting this; I would rather you did not look at it- Goff has known me ten or eleven years; he first knew me by taking a person for robbing my house - Bill was there when I bought the money, and when the prisoner was taken up; he then ran away.</p>

            . I am an officer, and live in Union-street, Lambeth. I have known the witness several years; as far as I know he is a respectable man - I employed him to assist me in taking the prisoner; I contrived to have him introduced to him by a person named Bill - I went with Myers to the Plough, on the 19th of April; I saw Rose there, and gave him sixteen good shillings, after I had searched him to see that he had no other money; he left me - I went into Carey-street and watched him; the prisoner joined him - they went into Grange-court; I saw them in the court - the prisoner came out, and went towards Chancery-lane; Rose came to me - we went to the Plough, and he gave me this paper, which I have in my hand, with twenty-four bad half-crowns in it - he said there were twenty-six; I gave them to him to mark, and have had them ever since - a man named Simmonds was at the Plough on the 12th of May, when the prisoner was taken; I had given Simmonds 8s., to buy twelve half-crowns of the prisoner, but he was intercepted - when the prisoner was taken, a pocket-book, a knife, and some good money were found on him; I received from Lee at that time, four crowns and four half-crowns, which are counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What Police do you belong to? A. I am a constable of Lambeth; a young man informed me that he knew a gang of coiners - he is a person in a respectable situation; I do not know that ever he was transported - he introduced Bill to me; I never gave them any thing; I will swear I do not know of their having any thing but the purchase money - I do not know that Bill has been in the Mint - Bill was present on the 19th of April, and on 12th of May; he is not here - I do not know where he lives; he did live near John-o'-Groats house, in the neighbourhood of Blackfriars-road - I have been there several times; I was there three weeks back -I did not take him before a Magistrate; I trusted to the witness - I sent for the witness because I knew him, and knew he was trustworthy; it is common to search persons, and I did not like to omit it - I went to the Mint, and saw Mr. Powell, about the 4th or 5th of April, a day or two after I received the information; I had seen Rose once before in the case of Lipman and Phillips, in 1825 - I do not recollect being present at the trial of a man of the name of Bishop, when a man of the name of Rose was a witness - I do not know a person named Bradbury; I know Pope - he was the man that robbed Rose, and he was tried and transported for seven years; that was the first I knew of Rose; he did not go by the name of Rose that I know of, nor Howard - Pope and Rose are not the same: Pope was a young fellow. I employed Rose because I knew he was offered a bribe and would not take it; I did not see the prisoner give Rose any thing - I passed the end of the court; Bill went into that court with the other two - I depended on Rose to give me what he received.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. Where was Pope convicted? A. At the Newington Session; Rose and his wife prosecuted- I believe Pope was a lodger of theirs: I found some of articles.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you sent Rose up Grange-court did you keep your eyes upon them? A. I passed the end of the court so as to see they were together - when they parted Bill went away, and Rose came to me.</p>

            . I am a tobacconist. On the 19th of April I went with Goff to the Plough, in Carey-street -Lee went with us, and Simmonds, and a person named Kemble; Goff directed me to go to the bottom of Grange-court - I saw Rose searched by Goff; he had nothing -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270087"></xptr>sixteen good shillings were given to him; Rose went out. and shortly after we saw the prisoner go up to him at the corner of Grange-court; they went up the court, and soon after Rose came to us, and brought a parcel of money - I saw him part with the prisoner, and he came directly to us- when Rose came he produced twenty-four half-crowns, wrapped up in paper. On the 12th of May I took the prisoner with twenty-four bad half-crowns in his hand; he was dealing with Simmonds, and I ran up and seized him, while he was counting twenty-four half-crowns -Kemble was with me: I took the prisoner to the public-house, marked the half-crowns, and gave them to Goff; as we were going along the prisoner dropped a parcell at my feet, from which I had seen him take the twenty-four - a woman picked it up, and gave it to Lee; she said the man in the white jacket dropped it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been at this kind of work? A. Ten years; I have been parish constable and my time is up; Goff came and informed me of this - I went with him; I was not employed by any body - I went with Goff to the Mint, to tell them we had the bad money; we did not get any thing from the Mint, nor any where else; Bill was no acquaintance of mine - I have seen him since this was in hand; I did not know him before - Rose is a respectable man; I have known him a great many years - Bill was with Rose on the 19th of April, when he went to the prisoner; we did leave Bill and Rose together - they were gone about three minutes to buy the money; I do not know whether there was time for Bill to have given Rose this money - I was not present when they turned up the court.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and did work at a stone pottery. I was with Goff and Myers nt the Plough on the 12th of May; I was employed to deal with the prisoner for bad coin - I was searched, and received 8s. - I went into Carey-street, and saw the prisoner; we went into Grange-court, and he asked what I wanted - I said a dozen; he said, "What, a dozen tush?" I said Yes; he put his hand into his pocket, and counted them out - Myers came round the corner, and said, "Halloo! what have you got here? you are a wholesale dealer;" he took him while he was counting the half-crowns into his right hand - Myers took them; I do not know how many he had counted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you labour last? A. For Dalton and Watts, at Lambeth; they are potters - I swear I worked for them about a month ago; I am not acquainted with Rose or Bill - I knew Mr. Goff twelve years; I never did a job of this sort for him before - I did not know Bill but by name; Goff introduced me to him to make a purchase of the prisoner - Mr. Goff came to my house that morning, at No. 2, Sander's-street, Lambeth-walk - I do not know where Bill lodged; I met Myers, Rose Lee, and Bill at the public-house - when I went in we had something to drink: we drank there for about five minutes' Myers paid for it - I think Bill and Goff had some - Bill and I then went out, and went with the prisoner down Grange-court; Myers was at the top of the court - I should think he could see; the counterfeit coin came from the prisoner's pocket: as I hope to be saved, and upon the oath I have taken, it did not come from Bill's - I have not seen Bill since.</p>

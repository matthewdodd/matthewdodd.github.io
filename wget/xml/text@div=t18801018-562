I lived at 5, Vale Street, Stepney, when the prisoner was remanded—I had been in his service two years in Devonshire—I was married to him in August, 1876, at St. George's, Bloomsbury—I lived with him at Peckham, Hoxton, and Broadwell as his wife—I heard he had a wife two years ago—I was living with him then—I told him I had heard he had a wife—he said he did not think he had done wrong in marrying me, in the sight of God, he might have in the sight of man—before I was married to him I had been living with him as his wife at 129, Stamford Street—I had then no knowledge of his wife—that was in 1875.</p>

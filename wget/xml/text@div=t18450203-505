                  </hi>. I am a coach-maker; my premises are at Mount Pleasant, St. Andrew's, Holborn, the prisoner was in my employ as a wheelwright. I missed a pair of new hind cabriolet wheels—they had the first coat of priming, before they were tired, and the stock-hoops had no priming—I saw them safe on Monday night, and the tires were put on them and stopped—the prisoner worked there till one o'clock on the Wednesday—I missed the wheels after he was gone—he did not return till the Saturday morning—I then asked where the wheels were that had been tired—he said he thought they were on the other side of the planks—I told him to go there and see—he went, and said, "I can't see them; I don't know anything about them"—I then asked what new pair of wheels he was seen with last Wed<lb></lb>nesday morning about half-past eight o'clock—he said a pair he had made overtime, and he bought the timber over Blackfriars-bridgi—I said, "Who tired the wheels for you?"—he said, "I can't think of the name now; I have got his card at home; he lives the first turning to the left down Drory-lane, Holborn"—I said, "You know where to go to the place?"—he said, "Oh, yes"—I sent the officer with him, to see if be could find tae place, they came back, and could not find it—the prisoner had come to work at my place on the Wednesday morning at seven o'clock, and it was lot his business to leave the place—he said he had sold the wheels bekmgfog to himself, on the Wednesday, to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man on the rank in Gray's Inn-lane; he did not know his name, but they put the wheels on a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and drove off—he must have taken them from me on the Tuesday night—we frond these panels at the room where he lived—they are mine, and ought to have been on my premises.</p>

I went with the prisoner to Drury-lane, for him to show me the man that tired the wheels for him—he said he did not know his name, but he lived down the first turniag—we walked up and down, and the prisoner said he did not know where he lived—I said, "Perhaps it is the second turning"—we went there—he then spoke very saucy, and said, "I don't know the name at all; the man fetched the wheels from my house, and brought them back when tried"—he said he met a man in Gray's Inn-lane, and sold the wheels to</p>

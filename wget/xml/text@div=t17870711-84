               <p>Do you remember on the 8th of June, laying by your mistress's black silk gown and petticoat? - I folded them up, and laid them on a trunk in the bed-chamber near the window; I left the shoes upon the same window; there was a pair of black sattin shoes, a pair of Spanish leather shoes, and three pair of stuff shoes, and a black silk gown and coat; they were in the room when I left the room.</p>

               <p>What day was it? - On Friday, the 8th of June.</p>
               <p>What room? - The back room, one pair of stairs; there is a door from the back room into the drawing room; a little before eleven I went up stairs, and upon opening the door I saw the sash up, and something like the flap of a man's coat go out of the window; I was in the room about four o'clock and saw the things, and again about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was the window of the room shut at that time? - Yes, all the three windows were shut down.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Upon seeing the flap of the man's coat what did you do? - I went immediately to the bed room, and saw the bed clothes tossed up into a heap on the middle of the bed.</p>
               <p>Did you miss any thing then? - No, I ran to the window, and called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Were there any alterations in the door of the bed-chamber that goes to the staircase? - No, only it was bolted on the inside; I left it unbolted when I went out; I missed these five pair of shoes, and the gown and coat; the shoes I missed first; my mistress was not at home from four o'clock, nor had not been at home when I went up.</p>
               <p>Had any body else been into the rooms after that? - No, I dare say not.</p>
               <p>You did not lock the chamber door? - No, we went out about six o'clock, and then the windows were pulled down; I came home about half past ten o'clock; I went off the pavement, and looked up to see whether my mistress was returned, and the windows were down.</p>
               <p>After ten? - Yes, I am sure of it; the shutters were not too, but the windows were down.</p>
               <p>Was the day light gone when you came? - Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>The person that came out of the window was the same that the watchman made his catch at? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right, the person was not out of your sight before the watchman catched at him? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you say that the prisoner at the bar is the man? - I cannot, but I am certain that the person who came out of the window was the same that the watchman catched at.</p>
               <p>You did not see him stopped? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you know the watchman that stood at the top of the street? - No, but I afterwards enquired for him at the watch-house, upon which, Waters told me he was the man; I desired that he might not go to the watch-house, nor see the prisoner till next day, and he was put among a number of persons at Justice Hyde's, and Waters picked him out.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman at the corner of Craven-street: on the 8th of June last, I heard the noise of glass breaking; I was then in the centre of the street, at the narrow end, I saw the prisoner at the bar running up the street, on the same side of the street as the house was.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner? - Yes, my Lord, I am sure of it; I made a catch at him, and missed him, and he got past; he turned the corner towards Charing-cross; I swung my rattle, and cried stop thief, and followed him; and near the end of St. Martin's-lane, I met him between the patrol and a watchman secured, and I said that is the youth.</p>
               <p>What was the name of the man in whose custody you saw him? - William Pennington.</p>
               <p>Was it the same man? - Yes, I am certain of it; he was not dressed as he is now, but I am certain that the man I saw between the patrol and watchman, is the same that I catched at, in Craven-street; he had on then a long light coloured coat, and striped waistcoat and trowsers, but I could not observe much of his face.</p>
               <p>Was he ever out of sight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long? - Not above three minutes at farthest.</p>

               <p>Where did you see him again after that? - At the office next day.</p>
               <p>Did you know him then? - Yes, I picked him out from others.</p>
               <p>Your knowledge of him was his dress, and his hair? - Yes, I observed the dress and figure of the man, he was shorter than I.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol at Charing-cross; on the 8th of June last, about ten minutes past eleven, near Craven-street, I heard the cry of stop thief; I went as quick as I could, and saw the prisoner cross from Craven-street, and cross the Strand; I then followed him, but could not get quick enough because a coach was going past; I lost sight of him for half a minute; I made a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110114"></xptr>at him with my staff; I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Did you see him taken? - No, but I helped the watchman who did take him to carry him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>You made a blow at him, and missed him? - Yes, there was a crowd gathered, and I pursued him, still crying stop thief; it is only one hundred and seventy paces from the place where I struck him, and the place where he was taken; I took the trouble to measure it; I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Prime, of Forty-hill, Eofield, a boot, and shoemaker. About three or four o'clock, on the 22nd of March, the prisoner, whom I had not seen before, came and asked if Dr. Thomas lived there—I said he did not—he had a basket, and went away towards Enfield town—I did not see him again till the middle of the day on Monday, the 24th, when he came up to the shop, but did not come in—he had an empty basket—I went up stairs, and saw him going from the shop with something bulky in the basket in the direction of Carter-hatch-lane—I</p>

               <p>came down to the shop, and missed a pair of shoes which had hung on a nail outside the window, when I went up stairs—I went after him—I saw Wright and spoke to him—I returned, and the policeman brought the prisoner and shoes to our house—these are them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at Enfield. About twelve o'clock, on the 24th of March, I saw the prisoner with a basket which had nothing in it—Mrs. Prime afterwards spoke to me, and I went after the prisoner—I spoke to a policeman, and he secured him—I had seen him going down the lane running fast—I did not see anybody else go down the lane for an hour or so before.</p>

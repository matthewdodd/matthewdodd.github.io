            . I am a baker. The back door of Mr. East's is right opposite of my house, about fifteen feet distance. About a quarter after two I was in my bakehouse alone, I heard a foot coming over the passage, which is boarded over, and then I heard a good deal of whispering, I heard one man say to the other, is there a light, which caused me to be curious to see what was going forward; I could not see well out of my own bakehouse, I had occasion to go up into my flour loft, on purpose to shoot down a sack of flour; I heard a crashing and wrenching, like a bursting something open, I looked through the hole of the door, there I perceived the prisoner at the bar and another man with him, with something of an instrument, forcing the outer door open; presently the outer door opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this door open while you were looking through the hole. - A. Yes, I never took my eyes off; the inner door has a leaden casement on the top; I saw the prisoner's hands go through to the inside when that door opened; I then returned, as the wind was blowing from the hole at the door, to cough; I had a very bad cold, and with that they all run off.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it. - A. The moon shone very bright.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the face of the other man. - A. No, the other man stood in the shade, out of the light of the moon, his hat was over his face; the prisoner stood in the light of the moon, halfway, I could see all his head, shoulder, and back; his face was sideways to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively swear that the prisoner is the man. - A. Yes, I have seen him before, he frequented this public house. I came down and called the watchman, he and I called Mr. East up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe the prisoner to East or the watchman. - A. I did, the next day, as well as my knowledge would let me. I knew the prisoner by sight, I never knew his name.</p>

            . Q. You are a watchman. - A. Yes. I was coming down Holywell lane upon the 23d of January, crying the hour of two o'clock; when I got within a few yards of the passage, Mr. Forbes called out Watch; I went up the passage, he told me Mr. East's house had been broken open. I found the outside and the inner door open.</p>

Forbes and the publican attended, Forbes identified the prisoner at the bar to be one of them, he said he could not be positive to Nowland, he believed him to be the man; the prisoner and Nowland were locked up in different lock up rooms.

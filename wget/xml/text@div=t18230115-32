I lost a sovereign, two half crowns, and a few shillings - I had spent 2 s. I charged her with robbing me, she denied it, and said I had given it to her. which I had not. I gave her in charge. The watchman found a sovereign and 2 s. on her. I went to the pay-table at eight o'clock.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I took her in charge; Wilson was holding her hand, she was struggling with him. He accused her of robbing him of a sovereign, two half-crowns, and a shilling or two. He was neither drunk or sober. She said she had only 2 s. from him. I found the sovereign and shillings in her mouth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me two pieces of coin, which I thought were shillings; he afterwards said, if I did not return it, he would give me in charge. I refused; he dragged me down the court, and called the watchman. I put it in my mouth, to prevent his getting it away.</p>

            . On the 3d of December, a witness in court saw the Prisoner go out of my house with a bundle, and she told me of it, and I pursued him, and took upon him one camblet coat, a cloth coat, a linen apron, and one linen shift: All these things were taken from my kitchin; and I took them upon the Prisoner, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, about an hundred yards from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the worth of these things?</p>
               <p>Mc Culla. I valued them at 4 s. and 6 d. when I took the goods from him, he joined both his hands to a stick, which I will show, and it had a tuck in it; I did not give him an opportunity to draw it, for we laid hold of his arms.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether I made any Resistance.</p>
               <p>Court. He swears, that you put your hand to the stick, in order to draw it.</p>

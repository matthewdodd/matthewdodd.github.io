                  </hi>. I live at Stratford. On 21st Oct., I had two pigs in my possession—they were my brother's—on that morning, I let the pigs out of the sty about half past 6 o'clock, into the yard—at a quarter to 7, I missed one of them—I went in search of it, but could not find it—I got some information from a neighbour—on the Friday morning following, I went towards Stratford—I saw the prisoner about 100 yards from where I live, driving the pig—there were two or three men with him—I said, "Who owns this pig?"—the prisoner said, "I do"—I asked where he got it from; he said he bought it—I asked who he bought it of; he said, of a man down Stratford—I asked if he knew him; he said he did not—I said, "You will have to find him, for that pig belongs to my brother"—I said I would fetch him, and shut the prisoner and the pig in the Church school room yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Lee, who lives at Stratford. On Wednesday, 21st Oct., a pig came into my house—I was lighting my fire, and I heard a noise in the front room; I turned round, and saw two pigs there—I drove them out; I had lighted my fire when one came in again, and I drove it out into the back yard—I let it remain until my hus<lb></lb>band caine home—it broke a glass lamp, standing on the table, and a case of stuffed birds—I was trying to drive it out with a broom, when my husband came home I told him a stray pig had come in; he asked me what mischief it had done—I told him; he said, "Let it remain," and he would send to the police station, and give information about it—it was there from the Wednesday until the Friday—on that day the prisoner came for the pig—my husband was not at home, and I gave him the pig to keep until the owner was found; that was the agreement between my husband and him.</p>

I have been there ever since I was nine yean of age—when I came home on the day in question, I asked who broke the case of birds; my wife said a pig came in the place and ran underneath the table, and upset the case—I was very angry, and said I would keep the pig until I found the owner, and would make him pay for it—I asked my lodger to write a letter for me to take to the station house, on the Thursday; he said he would take it; he delayed it—I asked him for it on Friday; he gave it to me, and I took it to the station as soon as I had done work, about 9 o'clock—I went to where my brother-in-law works, and asked him if he would take the pig until I could find an owner, as I had got no place to keep it—he did so—when I went to the station they said they knew nothing about any pig.</p>

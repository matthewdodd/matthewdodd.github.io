             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an engraver, Little Newport-street: The prisoner came to me on the 3d of January, he pulled out his pocket-book, and from it took a letter, purporting to be an order to change their bankers; he gave me an order in writing, (producing it;) he put that into my hand, and said, they were going to change their bankers.</p>
               <p>Q.Who? - A.Messrs. Crowe and Company, of the Suffolk and Essex Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say he was? - A. I cannot recollect what he said; in the course of conversation, he said, his brother was exceeding fond of prints, I suppose he meant Mr. Brown; I shewed him a work I was about to publish, Views of Paris.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more? - A.This little order I could not make out, this is the order he produced to me.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you that paper? - A. Yes, and told me to make an engraving from it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many impressions did he order? - A. I did not print it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many plates? - A. One plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the plate to correspond with that paper?- A. Yes; there was a little part of the ornament I could not make out, he said, he would furnish me with one of the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you to get the plate ready by? - A. In a few days.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you perform the order by getting the plate ready? - A. I said, I could do it in the course of a week; I got it ready in a week; he came in three or four days after, and said, they should not change their banker, and therefore I was to fill it up as the note was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any more conversation then? - A. No; the prisoner went away, he gave me the note the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came the second time, did he give any direction about filling up the note? - A. Yes, as the old note, Barclay, Triton and Company; in about three days he called again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you compleated the plate then? - A. No; he called again in an hour, and it was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the plate performed according to the order he had given you? - A. Yes, in every respect; I made him out a bill of parcels for the plate, in the name of Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the plate? - A. He took it away with him; he gave me, I think, 2l. 5s. for it.</p>
               <p>Q.Should you know the plate again? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all that passed? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a printer in St. Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in January; on Monday, the 10th of January, he came into my shop, he appeared as if he had just come from the country, he had a couple of sporting dogs with him; he produced the plate, and told me, he wanted one hundred impressions taken from it as quick as possible; he told me, he must have them early the next morning, to take some of them to the Stamp-office, to get them stamped; he said, he wanted to send some of them out of town the next<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160043"></xptr>day; he delivered the plate to me, to have the order executed.</p>
               <p>Q.In consequence of this order, what did you do? - A. I cut the paper, and sent the paper and the plate to a man of the name of Prosser, that does piece work for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the order executed by Prosser according to your direction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you next see the prisoner? - A. The next morning, about eleven o'clock; he came into my shop, he looked at the notes, they were all spread upon my counters to dry, he found fault with them, and said, the paper was too thick.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the same plate back from Prosser?- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner see it? - A. Yes; he complained the paper was too thick; he said, they were not worth a d - n, it had not the appearance of Bank-paper, that the people in the country would not look at it; he then told me I must print him another hundred from the same plate, and gave me directions where to go and buy proper sort of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy the paper according to his direction? - A. Yes, and sent them to Prosser to print, as I had done the former hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that order executed by Prosser? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - A.The same afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the second impression and the plate then? - A. Yes, they were spread out on the counter; he said, they would do very well; I made a parcel of them together with the plate, and gave them to him; he put them into his pocket, and paid me for them.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of the first hundred? - A. He put them in his pocket when he ordered the second hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the engraved plate you received from him, was the same you delivered back? - A. It is impossible for me to swear it, it had every appearance of being the same, it was out of my house in the hands of Prosser.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know the prisoner before?- A. I never saw him in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you confident he is the person? - A. I am confident of it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Bow-street officer; I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday afternoon, the 19th of January, at No. 26, in Mercer's-street, Long-acre; he was at home at dinner; Mr. Brown, the prosecutor, accompanied me to the lodgings; Mr. Brown opened the door, and looked in, and said, there he is; I went into the room, and told him he was my prisoner; he then got up, and I began to search him, and in one of his waistcoat pockets I found a key that belonged to a black leather portmanteau trunk; when I opened it, I found these notes and this plate; I brought the trunk and the prisoner to the Office, and opened the trunk at the Office.</p>

               <p>Q. With the key you took from the prisoner? - A. Yes, in the presence of the Magistrate; I went back, and brought away all his property; I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing the prisoner said at any time that you recollect? - A. No, that I remember, he said nothing to me. - (The plate and notes produced.) - These seven are stamped and filled up, with the dates and the name; these are not; one parcel of them is thick, and the other thin paper; there are one hundred and fifty in the whole, including the seven.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it a fact that some of them are thicker paper than the others? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. You took him away the first time you went? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you were first there you searched his pocket, and found a key; did you see the trunk then? - A.There was a great deal of rubbish; I did not observe the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you go after he was at the Officer? - A. In about half an hour; there was a woman in the room; I believe he cohabited with her; she pointed out all the articles to me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Girton.) Look at the plate, is that the plate you furnished the prisoner with? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite certain of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the note? - A. This is an impression made from that plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that plate made according to the direction in the order - do the plate and directions correspond? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hammond.) Look at that plate? - A. I believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any direction for any thing to be struck off from that plate? - A. Yes two separate hundreds.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other plate from the Suffolk bank from which you had any orders to strike off any impressions? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosser.) Look at the plate, is that the plate you received from Hammond to strike off any impressions? - A. I believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those seven notes, do they appear to be struck off from that? - A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them - one of the parcels? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160045"></xptr>These appear to be the impressions first taken; they are the thick.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the other parcel? - A. I believe these were struck off that plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill, the bill in question? - A. I don't perceive any difference.</p>
               <p>Q.Does that appear to be taken off the same plate? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you strike off any notes for that bank before? - A.Never; I have for other banks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Can you take upon you to swear that was taken from that plate? - A. I cannot take upon me to swear it was; it has every appearance of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the difference between that and the others? - A. I cannot perceive any difference, only the impression is rather fainter; those done on a thicker paper appear stronger.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an able-bodied seaman—on 9th February, I came into port in the Packwan, and went to lodge at the prisoner's boarding-house, near the West India Docks—on 13th February, the prisoner took me in his cart with my shipmates to the Mercantile Marine Office, to be paid off—18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>?. was due to me, and I received a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three sovereigns, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw Ashton paid at the same time—I got into the cart and went back to the boarding-house before dinner—a tailor named Much was there to whom I owed some money, and I paid him with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—there was no interchange of notes between me and my shipmates—I owed the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him the same 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which I had received at the office, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of that was for a pair of shoes—Ashton, Walker, and O'Neal were present, and I saw Walker give the prisoner a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—this was just before dinner—the prisoner did not give me the change, and as we went down to dinner I said "Don't forget the change of that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note Mr. Robinson"—he made no answer—I asked him several times after dinner, and he said "No my boy, you are mistaken, you never gave me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at all"—I said "Yes, I did," but he denied it altogether—my shipmates told me to turn out my pockets to show him that I had not got the note—I told the prisoner that if he looked over his money he would find that he had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. too much—he said "No, I shan't take the trouble, for you did not give me any"—I went out with Ashton, and in the evening I borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—from the prisoner—he said "Don't forget to pay me that 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back"—I</p>

               <p>said "You pay me my 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I did not sleep there that night, but I went there in the morning and asked the prisoner again for the note—he said that I did not give it to him, and he gave me a piece of paper with two numbers of notes, and said "Those are the two notes I have got, go to the shipping office and see if they are yours"—I have not got the paper, I showed it at the shipping office and received information of the number of my note, and as the prisoner had said that I might have given my 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to Much, I called on Much and showed him the paper—I then went with policeman 16 <hi rend="italic">HR</hi> to the prisoner's house, but he was not in, Ashton was with me all the time—I afterwards saw the prisoner again, and he said that I had not given it to him—I said "Well, I shall have to go home," that was to Hull—he said that I owed him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and refused to let me have my bag of clothes unless I paid it—I said "Let me have my bag, and I won't say anything about it"—he said "If you don't be off and say no more about that note I will give you in charge for defamation of character"—I went to Hull and met Davis and came back to London with him and attended before a Magistrate, and claimed my bag, and the prisoner was ordered into custody on a charge of stealing the note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to him, owing him some money, and asked for my bag of clothes, and I said that I would not say anything about the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, <hi rend="italic">but</hi> when he said he would not let me have them till I paid him, I threatened him about the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I had no money when I was dis<lb></lb>charged—when I got to Hull I went to the Institution there, and made a complaint to Mr. Davis that the prisoner had stopped my bag of clothes, and asked him to write for them—I also mentioned the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note on the first day that I saw Mr. Davis—Mr. Davis afterwards told me that he had telegraphed to the prisoner and had written, but he did not tell me what he had written—I do not remember his saying that he had communicated with the prisoner, who refused to give my clothes up till I sent the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Hull—it was not after that that I mentioned about the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—Mr. Davis said that he wrote about that too—he is here—Ashton and I had one glass of drink when we came out of the shipping office—Walker and I were never together—I may have had a glass on the Sunday, but I was not drinking a good deal, nor on the Monday—I was not the worse for drink—it was about 1.30 when I gave the prisoner this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash—that is the fact—I did not pay him more than that—I did not pay him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or anybody <hi rend="italic">else</hi>—I paid Much 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some odd pence—I had borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the prisoner, and he said that I owed him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not borrow 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of his wife; not after I <hi rend="italic">squared up</hi>—I paid his wife 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., of course it is down in the book—that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was down in the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it was not my look-out if it was not—I must have paid that 55. to the man—I swear that I did—his wife had never lent me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never received any money from the wife—the account was in a book, not on a piece of paper—I did not see it—I did not borrow 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. twice—I borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s:</hi> twice on the day I landed, and after the closing of the account I borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him—I believe I borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him on Sunday after<lb></lb>noon, the 11th, but I cannot exactly swear it—I afterwards borrowed <hi rend="italic">Is</hi>. of him—I did not borrow three separate 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him on the 11th—I cannot swear that this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the book, it is like it—all I borrowed of him on Sunday was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., not 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not ask him how the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was owing to him when I paid it to him, but it was for what money I borrowed and my board—I paid him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for some boots,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187703050075"></xptr>
               <p>and I never got the change—after dinner on the 13th I told a good many people that I had given the prisoner a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, not that I had lost one—did not say "I have lost a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, have you seen it, Mr. Robinson?" nor "Have you had it?"—he knew that he had it, for I gave it to him—Me did not say that the numbers on the paper he gave me were the notes that Much and Tucker had received, but of those he had—I do not know Tucker, an oilshop keeper—I never thought of giving the piece of paper to the people at the shipping office—I asked for the numbers of the notes I was paid off with—Walker was not with me after the note was lost—he went borne at night—he did not tell me that he had a note from Robinson which he had changed at Much, the tailor's—I told Robinson that if he would let me have my clothes I would not say anything about the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, because I had no money or friends in London—I did not tell him I had been to the shipping office and to the police—he never mentioned the a, he only mentioned the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I borrowed of him, and I said "You know I cannot pay you that, you have not given me the change out of my note"—I told you before that he said that I owed him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said "I will not let you have the clothes till you have paid the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you borrowed of me paid the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you borrowed of the mistress"—I told the Magistrate that I paid the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that is right, I have made a mistake to-day—I paid nobody in the house but Robinson and the tailor—I made a present of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a person out of the house, and I gave the girl Lizzie 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for some coffee—I gave her 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which I borrowed of the prisoner after I gave him the note, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I borrowed of my mate—when I borrowed the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him he said "Mind you pay me back"—I said "Yes, when you pay me my 9J. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I shall be able to"—that was not the same night, but the night after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>.

I am a seaman—I—was paid off on 13th February, and went to the prisoner's boarding-house—I received two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, but did not take the numbers—various payments were made to the prisoner and Much—I saw Barry pay a note to the prisoner, but whether it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note I cannot say—I had heard him say that he had to pay a bill of 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then gave the prisoner a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and told him it was in payment of my board—he gave me no change at all, because my friend, McNeal, said "I will change my note, and that will save you changing yours," and I went downstairs with McNeal and asked the mistress for change, and McNeal paid my score as well as his own—I then received a note back from the prisoner, but I do not know whether it was the same that I had given him—I did not get it immediately I got back, I had to ask him for it again, and he said "I will give it you directly"—I did not go down to dinner, but I received the note back before they went down to dinner—O'Neal was with me all the time—I heard Barry ask for his change in the room, and the prisoner said "I will give it to you by-and-bye"—while they were at dinner I went to Much's and bought a canvas bag, and gave Much the 10. note which the prisoner had given me, for which Much gave me two fives—I have got the number of the 10. note; I put it on the hack of my discharge before dinner—this is it, No. 94368 is the one I retained, and No. 94353 is the one I paid to Much—I thought it was very strange that the prisoner did not return the change, and thought it was better for me to take the numbers of my notes, and O'Neal took the numbers of his at the same time—none of us changed notes between ourselves.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ten years old, and live with Richard Quested, my father. On the 18th of Jan. I was returning home from getting some cat's meat—I touched a little boy on the shoulder who had been calling me names, and told him not to do it again, and a man, who was with the pri<lb></lb>soner, said, "What did you do that for? I will blindfold you for that"—the prisoner then unhooked my cloak—I called out, and the prisoner ran away with it—the other man put his hands over my eyes—I am sure they were both together—the prisoner was about a yard from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I heard a cry from the little boy, "He has got my cloak!" on the evening of the 18th of Jan.—I ran to the spot, and saw the prisoner running away, followed by the prosecutor—I followed—I looked, and said, "He has not got it"—the boy said, "No, the other man, on the other side, has got it now"—I left the prisoner, and pursued the other—I came up with him and he had not got it—the prisoner was then running down Montague-street—I pursued him—he ran against an apple-stall, and I collared him, and said he should come to the station—he said, "I have not got the cloak"—he made a desperate attack on me, and kicked me—I gave him to a policeman.</p>

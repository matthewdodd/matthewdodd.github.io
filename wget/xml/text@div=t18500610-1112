On Monday night, 3rd June, I was at Hampton Court—I do not remember the time—I had been drinking—I was too late for any conveyance and walked towards Twickenham, as I thought, but I was never there before—I have no doubt I met some persons between Hampton Court and Twickenham—I did not drink anything on my way that I know of—I had some gold and silver loose in my pocket—I do not know how much—I know I had more than one sovereign and some silver—I do not remember whether I had any half-sovereign, or what silver it was I had—I cannot tell where I went to—I became unconscious—the next place I remember myself at was at a house, at a place which I was told was Tedding<lb></lb>ton—I do not know what time that was, the sun was up—I remember having money with me in that house—I do not know when I left it—the next thing I remember, was a person scuffling or wrestling with me—I do not know where that was—I do not recollect whether I had my money about me at that time—I got up, and ran after the person—I gave the prisoner in charge—I cannot swear that he was the man that was scuffling with me—I do not remember his face—it was about three o'clock in the afternoon that I gave him in charge at Teddington, as I was told.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Teddington. On Tuesday, 4th June, about twenty minutes to one o'clock in the day, I was at the Royal Oak tea-gardens, at Teddington, and saw the prisoner and Wilson come into the gardens arm-in-arm—the prisoner asked Wilson what he would have to drink—he said, "Anything you like"—the prisoner said, "Will you pay for it?"—Wilson put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out some gold and silver—there were two or three sovereigns, and shillings, and sixpences—I did not see any half-sovereigns—the prisoner told me to fetch a pint of ale and a bottle of ginger-beer in it—I did so, and Wilson gave me a shilling to pay for it; the prisoner told him to do so—I am not a servant at the place, but was only standing there—I brought back sixpence change, and gave it to the prisoner, as Wilson was asleep when I came back—the prisoner then asked me to go and look after a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I was gone about ten minutes, when I saw the prisoner come out of the gardens with Wilson on his arm—I asked the prisoner if he would want a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he said no, the gentleman was going to walk to Richmond—they went on towards Twickenham, that leads towards Teddington Church, and Mr. Strahan's premises—Wilson was very tipsy; he was not able to walk without the prisoner's assistance—the prisoner was tipsy, but was not so bad as the other.</p>

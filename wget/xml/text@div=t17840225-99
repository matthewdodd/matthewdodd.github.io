               <p>Court. Was it dark at seven? - Quite dark; when we came down stairs, seeing the sash up, we went up again, and called out from the one pair of stairs for assistance, and one

               <p>Court. What are you? - I am a taylor, I live in Addle-street, and have lived there years, I am a house keeper; on Tuesday night last, the 24th of February I went to my door, which is directly opposite this court; opposite my door I found three men, I watched about five minutes, there was a lamp directly over the court, at the entrance.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the prisoners, can you tell by that lamp light that the prisoners were the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You speak to them all three? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Be very sure, it is a matter that affects their lives. - Yes, I am very sure, I suppose I saw them half an hour in the court; they were walking backwards and forwards, and I saw Wheeler John cross the way, from the other two, and go into a green shop, he crossed again and came past me, and went round the corner into Wood-street, and he came back to the other two, who stood at the bottom of the court, and then he and Robins went up the court; Goodall waited at the bottom, and presently the other two came running down the court and joined him; and they all went to Addle-street together.</p>
               <p>Is this court a confined court, or is it open at both ends? - It is a confined court; as soon as they got out of sight, I heard the cry of murder, and thieves! I went up the court, and saw the woman out of the window, who begged me to get in, for there were thieves in the house, I saw the windows were o pen, and the window sashes thrown back, the bolts wrenched off, only hung by a nail that one might turn it round with one's finger; the woman came down and let me in, I searched the house, and below there stood the china, and tea pot, and some things ready in the window, they stood one in the other.</p>
               <p>Jury. What distance might you be when you was making these observations? - I do not know, two coaches can hardly pass the street one by the other; I went out afterwards, and at the bottom of Bartholomew Lane, the corner of Whalebone Court I saw the same three men again; there is a great light there, I heard no conversation, I watched them till a coach turned up the lane, then I lost sight of them, I then went up Throgmorton-street, and found them at the bottom of another court, I passed them, and had them apprehended, I heard them say nothing at any time; in the court where Goodall was taken, we found an iron crow, about two or three yards from him, I did not see it found; the first that was taken was Robins, he had a scuffle with the man that took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Goodall. The crow was brought in a quarter of an hour after I was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Baltic-street, Old-street, St. Luke's—I get my living by going out charing. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening, the 1st of July, I went into Lascelles-court, St. Giles's—I saw the prisoner standing at the door of No. 7—I was taken unwell, and wished her to show me a private place—she took me to a room on the first floor, and furnished me with a convenience—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said I had got more money about me, and instantly knocked me down, and said she would have all that I had or my life—she struck me violently in my body and my eyes, and tore my bonnet—the crape of it was terribly torn—she threw me down, put her hand into my pocket, and took out 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she then left the room—I was quite stunned with the fall, and when I came down stairs she pushed me again, and tried to get my pattens from me—I saw King, the constable, and told him what had happened—I was quite sober, but very much agitated—I hardly knew how to get home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was at the top of the court when she came up, she had another female with her—she asked me to accommodate her—I took her into my room—she stopped about half-an-hour talking about her husband, saying she had been drinking all day, and was truly unhappy, and should I like something to drink—she gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and came down stairs—I said, "I don't wish to go out"—she laid hold of me, and dragged me by my shawl—another female came up—she gave her 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and dropped a halfpenny on the stones, which the other female picked up—I asked what it was—she said "You may keep it"—she said, "Well, I have lost 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I have been robbed somehow;"—she said to the other, "Take my pattens and pawn them, and we will have something to drink"—she said, "You had better go and pawn them yourself." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is not true—I did not talk with her about my husband, or that I drank because I was out of spirits about it—I did not offer to send for gin—I did not want to pawn my pattens—I did not accuse the other female of robbing me—she did not assault me at all—she came there to see what was the matter.</p>

On the 1st of July, between eight and nine o'clock, the prosecutrix came up to me at the end of Lascelles-court, and gave me information—I took the prisoner into custody in Las<lb></lb>celles-court—the prosecutrix charged her with robbing her, and another woman, as being with her—she did not express any doubt at that time who took her money—she said the two were together—she was sober, and had a great mark on her forehead, which is to be seen now—it appeared done at that instant—she appeared to have been beaten.</p>

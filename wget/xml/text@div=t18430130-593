                  </hi>. I am a schoolmaster, and live in Newcastle-street, Strand. On the morning of the 5th of Jan. I placed a bag, containing 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, in a drawer in my escrutoire, which was not locked—at twelve o'clock in the day I found 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. gone—the bag was in the same place—it was all done up in 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. parcels, in half-crowns and shillings—I had suspicion, and re<lb></lb>quested my wife to search the prisoner, who was our servant—she refused to be searched—I sent for a policeman, and saw him take a purse of money from her, which she said was sent to her by her husband—she was taken to the sta<lb></lb>tion, and these twelve half-crowns and thirteen shillings, some wine, a pair of stockings, and pocket-handkerchief, were produced—I know the stockings and handkerchief to belong to my wife—they have her mark on them—I cannot swear to the wine—she had been about three weeks in my service.</p>

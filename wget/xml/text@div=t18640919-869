                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—about half-past 10, on the evening of 25th August, I was walking in Leicester-square—a gentleman was with me—the prisoner came up to me—I told him to go away, I did not want him—he said I was his wife, and where I was he had got the right to be—we had a few words together, and he cut me in the neck with a knife that he uses in his business as a saddler—I got it in my hand, and broke it in two, and threw it on the ground—I ran into the Sabloniere Hotel, and was there attended by a surgeon, and afterwards by a gentleman who was supposed to be my father.</p>

Q.</hi> Who is that gentleman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Cutliffe—he is a surgeon—he has known me from a child—he brought me into the world—he attended my mother at my birth—I have been married to the prisoner fourteen years—we were married at Barnstaple—we lived there comfort and happiness for several years—he then came to London, and followed his business as a saddler here—I was living comfortably with him here—about four months ago we lived in Nutford-place—while residing there I was seized with illness—Mr. Cutliffe was brought to attend me—he visited me two or three times—I don't think he came above twice while we were there, because I went into Whitechurch, in Shropshire—I lost sight of him for some time, until about a year or eighteen months ago, and then became re-acquainted with him—he took the Old Cock public-house in</p>

               <p>the Haymarket—I was then lodging in Brewer-street, Pimlico; a private lodging-house—Mr. Cutliffe was very badly off while we were there, and my husband received him into the house, and gave him his meals from day to day, in consequence of his impoverished state; that was both in Brewer-street and in Princes-street, Pimlico—Mr. Cutliffe afterwards came into some property, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he took the Cock public-house, and put my husband and me into it, and he also lived there—the result of it was that he and I turned my husband out of doors, and I have been cohabiting with him up to the time this happened—it was not Mr. Cutliffe that I was walking with—although cohabiting with Mr. Cutliffe, I was walking the streets in the neighbourhood of Leicester-square, with any man I could meet—two or three nights before this occurrence, my husband entreated me to return with him to his home, and abandon my course of life—on this night when I was walking with a strange man in Leicester-square, he came up to me, and entreated me to come back and be a wife to him, and he would forgive all—I told him to go about his business; I would walk with whom I liked—this knife was given to him by Mr. Cutliffe—it is a doctor's knife, and the prisoner used it in paring his leather—it is a straight knife, and will not shut—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On the night of 25th August, about half-past 10, I was on duty in Leicester-square, and saw the prisoner and prosecutrix near the Alhambra—when I arrived within about a dozen yards off them, I saw the prisoner raise his hand, and seize her by the throat, as if shaking her—before I got to them, she extricated herself from the prisoner's grasp, and ran into the Sabloniere Hotel—the prisoner followed her, and caught her by the shawl in the door-way—I then went up to the prisoner, and took hold of him—as I did so, a waiter came out of the hotel and asked me to go in, which I did, with the prisoner—I saw the prosecutrix there, and saw that she was stabbed in the left side of the neck—I then took the prisoner into custody—as we were going to the station, he said he was glad he had done it, and he should now die happy—he was sober—I got part of this knife from Sergeant Lee; the other part I saw picked up by a young man near the door.</p>

I am a surgeon, 2, St. Martin's-place—on 25th August, between 10 and 11 in the evening, I was sent for to the Sabloniere Hotel, and there saw the prosecutrix—I examined her neck—I found an incised wound on the left side, about half an inch in length—it was not of a dangerous character—it might have been caused by a knife of this description—I did not probe it—it was not deep.</p>

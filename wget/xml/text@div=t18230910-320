            . I live in George-yard, Whitechapel. On the 25th of June, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and asked me to walk with her; we went to a wine vaults, and had a quartern of rum - she wanted me to buy the duplicate of a blanket, but I refused - she said, if she had 1 s. 6 d. she would take it out of pawn. I went home for my money, and put a pound in my bosom, which I had to go to market with. It was two crowns, a half-crown, and silver. I lent her 18 d. and then called for another quartern of rum; I found my head heavy, and fell asleep. A young man awoke me, I found my money was gone; I caught her over the way at another wine vaults, and said,</p>
               <p>"Where is my money, that you took out of my bosom;" she said, if I would go to her sister, she would make it all right. I caught hold of her hand, and a half-crown and 1 s. 6 d. fell from it on the ground.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not tried here - A. Never; I was at Hick's-hall for an assault.</p>

            . I went into the wine vaults to get some beer, the prosecutrix was asleep. I saw the prisoner with her arm round the prosecutrix's neck, and her hand at her bosom; she pushed the corner of her handkerchief out; I suspected she was robbing her; she untied the corner of the handkerchief. I told the landlady of it, and she awoke the prosecutrix. The prisoner was crossing the road at the time the prosecutor went after her - I did not say anything to her. I am a horse dealer, and live in George-yard, Whitechapel.</p>

               <p>"If you will go to my sister's, I will make it all right with you;" they went out together. She has put money in my care before.</p>

I received 30 s. on the 24th, I was coming home, and met the prosecutrix, and went to drink with her; she asked me to lend her some money, as she had lost a good deal by mackarel. I said, I had none to lend her - we drank two or three hours. I went to leave my money with this young man; she came over and said, I had robbed her, and took 2 s. 6 d. out of my hand.</p>

On the 31st of August, my husband and I went to bed together at eleven o'clock—the kitchen door was fastened with a latch—I saw it fast—we had a copper in the house, but it was not set—the policeman alarmed us about two o'clock in the morning—I came down stairs—I did not see the prisoner—he</p>

I was awoke about two o'clock by a loud knock<lb></lb>ing at the door, and begged of my wife to call the lodger, to see if her son was at the door, he being in the habit of coming in rather late some<lb></lb>times—she called the lodger, and soon after the lodger came down, and said there was a man in the house—I had been brought home the preceding night with a sprained foot, and could not get out of bed myself—I know that the copper stood in the corner by a pile of bricks, and I could not observe any difference in it in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty at Deptford on the night of the 31st of August, and about two o'clock in the morning, as I walked up my beat, I heard a noise proceeding from the kitchen, like something falling down—I turned my lantern to the kitchen door, and found it a little open—I gave an alarm to my brother officer—I went in and found the prisoner lying down on his face—he pretended to be asleep, but when I awoke him he did not appear to have been asleep—I turned him over—we asked him what brought him there—he said that was a query to him—we alarmed the inhabitants, and a lodger came down—the cupboards were all open, and the copper standing nearly in the middle of the kitchen—I moved the copper into the corner—I did not perceive any of the cupboard doors broken—I had passed by that kitchen door about a quarter of an hour before—I am sure it was shut at twelve o'clock—I took the prisoner into custody—he resisted as much as he could—he kicked and knocked down one of my brother officers—he struck me—I took him to the station-house, and told him I took him for breaking into the house—he appeared sober—I cannot say whether he had been drinking.</p>

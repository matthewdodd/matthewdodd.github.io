                  </hi>. I am a coffee sampler at the C warehouse, third floor, St. Katherine Docks—on 22nd July, about 11.30 a.m., I was in my office and saw the three prisoners walking about on the third floor—I knew they had no business there, and followed them up one staircase and down another to the first floor, when they went into a warehouse where coffee is stored, and closed the door after them—I pushed the door aside and watched them—Collins was at one end of a cask of coffee, which was on the floor, and Fitzgerald at the other, holding a bag—Boucher was at the bung-hole, tilting the cask, and the coffee was coming out into the bag—I went and gave information to my foreman on the third floor, who lowered me down by the lift on to the quay—I spoke to Sergeant Robinson, went to the warehouse with him, and when the prisoners caught sight of us Collins and Fitzgerald jumped out at the loophole on to the quay and Boucher hid himself behind the cask—they left this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under the mouth of the cask—it had about 80lbs. of coffee in it, worth about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had never seen them before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the foremen of the C ware-house—the prisoners have nothing to do with the docks, and no one has a right to be there unless employed on the establishment—on 20th July Burden spoke to me, and I lowered him down by the lift to the third floor—I afterwards went with him and the police sergeant, to a door which was a little ajar, and saw Collins and Fitzgerald in the act of taking coffee from a cask—one bag had been filled, and Boucher was tying it up—these are the two bags—we weighed them, and there was 70lbs. of coffee in them—I said "What are you doing here?" and Collins and Fitzgerald jumped from the loophole, 12 or 13 feet, on to the quay, and Collins hurt his foot—I found Boucher behind a cask, and gave him to the sergeant.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110081"></xptr>Q. Had you ever lost sight of him? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose? - A. Two half-crowns and two shillings; when he was taken into custody, he said he had no more than one shilling, and upon searching his pocket we found two shillings and three halfpence, but the money I had lost was not found upon him; and if it had I could not have sworn to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I caution you first, that that young man has as good a character as you can have. - You saw that lad in the entrance to the Play-house; was that the first time that you saw him? - A. No; I saw him in Fleet-street, a little above Shoe-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you force yourself, and endeavour to obtrude yourself, into his company? - A. I did not; in crossing Fleet-street, one of them came up, and said, where are you going; I said, what is it to you.</p>
               <p>Q. There are two other persons here, who were present? - A. I know there are, I have seen them; and I can swear to one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober enough to observe all that passed? - A. I had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not very drunk? - A. I don't know the meaning of the word very drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That you will swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you will swear it twenty times? - A. Yes; because when a person understands what he is about, he cannot be very drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you were very drunk? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not so drunk as to insult many people in the course of your going along? - A. I was not.</p>

               <p>Q. I will give you one instance of it; did not you run away with several play-bills from the poor women, throwing up a halfpenny, and then getting hold of the bill, and running away without paying them? - A. No; one girl, against Fetter-lane, came up to me, and I gave her a halfpenny; and another, and I gave her a halfpenny; and another play bill was offered me and I gave nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not do that in more instances than one? - A. No; it was through Temple-bar that the last bill was offered.</p>
               <p>Q. Near the Theatre, did not you? - A. No; the girl said, a bill of the play; and I took hold of it, and I walked away. - But if I did, that is no reason that I should be robbed and ill-treated afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that this matter happened? - A. In the passage leading to the Theatre.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it when you had got considerably forward in the passage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not, at that time, a very great, and a very close crowd? - A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not such a crowd, that several people were forced to hold up their hats, and could not get down their hands, on account of the pressure of the crowd? - A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a word at Bow-street about your being hustled? - A. I did mention the person's hand being in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You tell us now, that going into the Playhouse you were hustled by about four or five people; I ask you whether, in your examination at Bow-street, you said a word about being hustled? - A. I think I did; I ought to have done it whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went immediately before the Magistrates at Bow-street, did you say a word about being hustled? - A. I believe I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. They committed him then, not for a highway robbery, as you have charged it, but merely for stealing from you so much money? - A. I have not charged it as a highway robbery, but the clerk of the indictments.</p>
               <p>Q. What difference does that make, do you know; I have heard of such a thing as a reward of forty pounds? - A. I have not the least doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Q. And had not you, upon your oath, heard of a reward? - A. I have heard of such a reward, but not so perfectly as to think of getting it.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost two half-crowns and two shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all the money you set out with in the morning? - A. No; I let out with three halfcrowns, and three shillings, in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you set out in the morning? - A. I set out, at first, at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been skaiting? - A. No, I had not, although I had the skaits in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. I will put you in mind of a remark some persons made as you were going in: do you recollect that your skaits in your pocket incommoded some people, and they complained of it? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they ask you what had you to do with skaits, you are not steady enough to skait? - A. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody told you you had no business with skaits, you were too drunk to skait? - A. I heard no such thing; people there might hear more than I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the people there tell you you were too drunk to have any thing to do with skaits? - A. I will be upon my oath that I did not hear any such thing; there was a person there said my skaits hurt them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not any body tell you you were too drunk to skait? - A. I can swear that I did not; hear any such thing, I might be listening to other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you another thing; upon your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110082"></xptr>oath, don't you know that boy was so incommoded by the crowd as to be obliged to hold up his hat above the crowd, and was unable to put down his hands? - A. Not to my knowledge; I know that his hands were not so pressed but that, at the time they were down, they slipped into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When this young man was searched, what was found upon him? - A. There was one shilling he pulled out, that he said his master gave him to go to the play; but upon searching him, they found two shillings and sixpence upon him besides, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no half-crown at all found upon him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not half so stout as you? - A. No; but there were four or five in company.</p>
               <p>Q. You had hold of his wrist? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you really were not at all drunk at that time? - A. I had been drinking; but I cannot answer that question unless you will be so good as explain the word.</p>
               <p>Q. How many public-houses had you been in? - A. Only one.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been there? - A. Four hours.</p>
               <p>Q. In company? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of your companions there? - A. No companions, but using the house; the landlord, in the morning, asked me to partake of some beef, which is customary the day after Christmas-day; after that was done, they said we must have some drink.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might that be? - A. Between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Till what time? - A. Till about twenty minutes past four.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say you had been drinking till twenty minutes past four? - A. I cannot say so much; I know what I paid; I gave the landlord half-a-crown, and he took for four pints of beer, and two three pences, towards the liquor that had been drank; then I paid him, after that, I think it was nine-pence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink as your own share? - A. I drank in my turn, I cannot say how much.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there? - Q. Different people came in at different times, that used the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You sat it the whole time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And were your sober? - A. Yes; I was so sober as to know what I was about; and I went along without molesting any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Which play house was it? - A. Covent-Garden, against the passage from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Under cover, was not it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that this lad's hand was actually in your pocket? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sober enough to know that? - A. Yes, I was, perfectly.</p>

               <p>Q. He said so at the time, did he? - A. Yes; he said he was very much ill-used by the prisoner and his acquaintance; he said they had beat him about very much; upon that I went up, and took his part, and took him to Bow-street, and he was searched at Bow-street; he said, at first, he had no more than a shilling about him, and there were two shillings and sixpence more found upon him, and some halfpence.</p>

I went up to him, and saw him lay hold of the prisoner's collar, and Williams was along with me, and Williams took his part; I saw the prisoner push him about, but I did not see any thing more, because I was not near enough.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know of his going to the play this evening? - A. Yes; I gave him leave, his brother was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Drake? - A. Yes, an apprentice to Mr. Simpson, in Gravel-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you furnished him with any money? - A. Yes; I gave him 3s. and a sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he went towards the play? - A. I gave him leave to go to the play, and my wife and I went with them part of the way, they set off first, we overtook them before we got to Blackfriars.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing more of them after that? - A. Yes; I saw them together when we got over the bridge, and then we left them behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have the least distrust in employing him again if he is acquitted? - A. Not the least.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he sober, or drunk? - A. He seemed to be in liquor, and rolled about, and affronted several people going along.</p>

             acted before, and was telling the rest about it, and he over-heard us, and then he joined us.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you did not begin the conversation with him? - A. No; there were four of us in company, so that we did not want comapny.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, as you were going to the play-house, any thing about play-hills? - A. Yes; he pulled a halfpenny out of his right-hand pocket, and held it up in his hand, and asked for a play-bill, and then snatched it from the girl and ran away, he served five or six others the same; the last one that he served so was a little girl, and she ran after him and caught him, and he shuffled away from her again.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the play-house was this? - A. Close to the play-house, going into Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was beyond Temple-bar? - A. Yes; then we went in at the play-house door, out of Bow-street, and there was a terrible crowd, and he took hold of my hand, and said, let us keep all together, for I love good company as I love my life; I had a bottle of ale in my pocket, and Richard Thompson's boy had another, and I told him, he should be welcome to have a part of that; we were going into the one shilling gallery, and just as the door was opening, Palmer said, his pocket was picked of half a-crown; a gentleman asked, who was it, and he said, it was that young man, the prisoner, and he said, he could swear to the money; a gentleman that was standing by, said, young fellow, it is a hard thing to swear to money, you might swear to the person that has robbed you, and then he said, he lost half-a crown and 2s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at all, at that time, pretend that he had caught that young lad's hand in his pocket? - A. No, he did not; he took hold of him, and collared him, and told him he should go along with him; he did not lay a word about his having his hand in his pocket; the prisoner said, as you have deprived me of my night's giverssion, I will go along with you, and see myself righted, and then they took hold of one another's collars; then Palmer ooted the prisoner, but he would not loose Palmer, me would go with him to see himself righted; then the mob shoved us I on further, till we had go to a place on the right-hand side, where the soldiers.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110084"></xptr>were, and then they got hold of one another's collars again, and Palmer made his complaint to the serjeant, and the prisoner made his complaint; the serjeant said he would have nothing at all to do with it, says he, go and sight it out, and lick him well, if he has charged you falsely; then his brother said, as he is so obstinate, let us go up, or else we shall not get a seat, and we left them to go and sight it out by themselves, we had no idea that any thing more would come of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your master here? - A. No; he would have been here, but he is a constable, and is obliged to attend the sessions at Horsemonger-lane, in the Borough; when we were in the crowd, Palmer had a pair of skaits in his pocket, and the people cried out that they hurt them, and stuck into their sides.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any particular expression made use of by any of the mob, about his skaits? - A. Yes; they d-n him, and swore about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing further about it? - A. Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner, as you were going in, was before, or behind, or at the side of you? - A. He was behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all turn round to see what situation he was in? - A. Yes; he was holding his hat up, and I did the same, because they should not be squeezed or rumpled.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you were at the play-house, and the prisoner was charged with robbing this young man, did he strike him? - A. No; but Palmer struck the prisoner's brother, and made his nose bleed; every body then spoke on the prisoner's side, and not a soul spoke for this young fellow.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Palmer.) Q. Do you know the young man? - A. I can hardly say; he seems differently dressed now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in High-street, Poplar. Easton was my journeyman for nine or ten months—he had 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week, with board and lodging—I occasionally employed Court, and gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-day. On the 14th of March, about half-past five, I went to market, and left Easton at home—I had heard something a fortnight before, and desired Mr. Cook, my neighbour, to watch—I returned about eight o'clock, and went to my slaughter-house—I have some fat-sacks—I examined them, and found the fat in them waa eight or ten stone deficient—in consequence of information, I got an officer and went to Court's lodging in Cotton-street, Poplar—I found him just going in at his door—the officer told him that Mr. Palmer charged him with taking something from a sack out of his shop—Court said he had not been near the shop—I gave him into custody—I have seen the fat since—there was about 561lbs. of it—I believe it belonged to me—it was the same sort as I had seen in'my sacks the night before—there were two pieces that I could distinguish—they were taken from the heart, and I had skewered them round—they were there the night before.</p>

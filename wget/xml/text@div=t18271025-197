            . I am an officer. I found the prisoner at a house in Backchurch-lane, which I was searching for stolen property; he came in - I asked him about these boots; he said they were made for his sister; we have not found them - I was told the prosecutor had taken 10s. 6d. not to prosecute.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRIGHTWELL re-examined. I took the case before the Magistrate. I saw the prisoner take the shoes, as I returned from the public-house; he passed me on the stairs with them - I heard them rattle in his hand, and asked where he was going; he went out, and I followed, but a person stopped me from pursuing - I gave information - I caught a glimpse of them in his hand - his friends came to my mother's house, after the first examination, and gave 10s. 6d. - I wished to make it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My sister was measured for these boots; they were to be done on Saturday night - I went and asked if they were done; they said Yes; I said,"Give them to me, and meet me at Coats', in Whitechapel;" but he did not - I went to him; he was gone to bed, but got up, and we went and had some drink; he then let me have them; here his receipt for the 10s. 6d.; he told me not to let his father know, as he had made them unknown to him.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRIGHTWELL. This receipt is my writing - I wished to make it up, but the Magistrate would persevere;</p>

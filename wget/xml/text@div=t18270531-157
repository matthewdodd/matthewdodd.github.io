            . I keep a pawnbroker's shop in lissongrove. I have known Susannah Sibley about four months; she came and bought an iron on the 11th of May, and told me she knew a respectable person who had a steamer to sell for 10s. if I would buy it - she brought it on the 12th; I said I could only give 5s. for it, as it did not suit me - she took the 5s. On the Tuesday following she left word that she wanted to speak to me; she came again to my house, and told me to hide it till after Monday for God's sake, for she believed it was stolen; I said, "I cannot think of that; where was it stolen from?" she said from Wilson-street, Portland-town - an officer's wife came up, and told me what to do.</p>

            . I went with Joseph Sibley to a street near St. John's-wood chapel - we went down a road; he got over a wall, and said there was some copper pipe to the house - he began to pull it down; I helped him; he put it into the coal-hole; I went with him to No. 4, Lissongrove, and then he got over a wall of another house, opened the gate, and shewed me a steam-boiler; he took it to pieces, and put it into the corner of a room; he said he should take it some night. I do not know whose house it was.</p>
               <p>JOHN SIBLEY'S Defence. He took the pipe himself, and sold it for 8d.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH SIBLEY'S Defence. On Saturday morning my son brought the boiler to me; he said a person wanted to sell it, and would give him 1s. I went and sold it to this woman.</p>

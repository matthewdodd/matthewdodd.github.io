               <p>I am a clothes-man. On this day fortnight I went to Hedge-lane with my clothes-bag over my shoulder about one or two o'clock; I went to a publick-house, and called for a pint of beer; the prisoner asked me if I would buy any glasses, for he had some that belonged to a carriage; I thought he was making game of me; I said I would buy them. I told him where I lived, and he came in the evening at nine o'cl ock with the carriage and the lady in it; I bought two hind glasses, and two fore glasses of him; he said the lady had made him a present of them, and the carriage too; I knew by his speech they were stolen.</p>
               <p>Did he offer to sell you the carriage too? - No.</p>
               <p>(The glasses were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I keep the Red Lion at Lambeth-marsh. Mr. Vincent's carriage used to stand at my house. The prisoner drove it. On the 5th of this month the prisoner came, and said Mr. Vincent wanted the chaise to go to Hammersmith; he took the chaise out in the afternoon; about nine or ten o'clock in the evening, he sent it back again, by a man who cries clothes; the blinds were up, I did not see whether the glasses were in it or not, it was locked up, and the door was never opened afterwards, till I broke it open.</p>
               <p>Were the glasses in when the carriage went away; - Yes; for they were all washed, and the carriage was cleaned the morning before.</p>

Betwixt the eighth and ninth of July my kitchen forewindow was broke open; the spring to the key was broke off before, so that by turning the bolt round, the key would fall out; which was the case here. All was fast over night, when I went to bed, which was betwixt nine and ten, but when I got up, which was about a quarter after four the next morning, (having heard a noise about three quarters of an hour before) I found the kitchen window open, as also the door; there was likewise a pane of glass broke before, through which hole it was easy to pass a hand to open the casement. We then missed the goods mentioned, and the linen taken from below. There was a door broke to get up stairs in the garret, which is my work-shop, from whence I missed the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110032"></xptr> tools mentioned, and the silver boxes to watches. I had been at work over night, between eight and nine o'clock, with the vices, and saw the boxes lie before me.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I was out this night, and came home about half an hour after ten, and went up to bed. I lay in the work shop, but heard nothing, till next morning Mr. Abraham came to me, and told me all was open below, and the things gone. About a week after the prisoner and the evidence were taken. The evidence told me the tools were at the pawnbroker's on Snow-hill. I went there, and they brought me a hand vice, a pin vice, and dividers down. I went back to Baily in Bridewell, he said they were all there; then I went to New Prison, and the prisoner said, I do assure you the tools are all there. I went to the pawnbroker again, then he brought me another hand vice, and a pair of old nippers. Produced in Court, and deposed to by Mr. Abraham and this evidence.</p>

            . About ten weeks ago, about half an hour after twelve at night, the prisoner and I went to Mr. Abraham's house in Lamb's Court, where we turned the pin of the window, and the key dropped out. I opened the shutter, then put my head throught the hole where a pane was out, opened the casement, and took down a pair of white curtains from that window, and handed out some knives and forks. We both got into the house, where we took a shift, two caps, two aprons, and a table cloth. Then we went up into a garret, which was a work-shop; there we took four silver watch boxes, two pair of hand vices, a pair of nippers, and a pair of dividers. We sold the four watch boxes to one Scampey, a Jew, for five shillings, and the prisoner pawned the tools at three different times upon Snow-hill, at the Three Balls, and I stood at the door each time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he did not meet me near the Fleet-market, and say, As you are cleaner than I, do you go and pawn them for me.</p>
               <p>Baily to the Q. Yes, I did. We had got no money, and I said you may as well get some money on them, for you are cleanest.</p>

I went out about nine at night, on the eleventh of July, and fastened the door and windows; I returned about twelve, and found it broke. I was then a single man. Two of the window-shutters were open at the ground window, and one of the hinges was wrenched; the sash slides sideways, but I am not sure whether that was put too before I went out. I missed the goods mentioned in the indictment, and advertised them. Shortly after I was sent for to Justice Chamberlain's, for Baily's brother-in-law came and told me, he thought he could help me to my things. I went with him to Islington, to the Duke of Cumberland's Head, there Baily owned the thing very freely, and I found some of the goods; the others were brought to me by the prisoner's own brother. I asked Baily how he came to serve me so, because I knew him when he was a boy. He said he was sorry for it, and hung down his head. The prisoner directed me to Mrs. Wood's, at the corner of St. Ann's Lane, where I found some of the things. The goods produced in Court, and deposed to.</p>

            . I was the constable. I was before Justice Chamberlain about other business, and Baily was there. The Justice bid me take charge of him, and go with him by his directions for some tea-kettles, which I found.</p>

            . I do not know the time, but it was the Thursday after the other robbery. About half an hour after nine, between Codpiss-row and London Spaw, in the new road, where the prosecutor's house is, the prisoner and I found the shutters all fast, so that we could not get in; at last I stood upon the prisoner's shoulders, and put my hand through the window shutters, pulled back the bolt, and got the shutter open. There were a great many things lay in the window. We both went into the house, took the things mentioned, and hid them in a ditch in a field amongst some nettles. Some odd things we sold. My own brother took us in Fleet-street.</p>

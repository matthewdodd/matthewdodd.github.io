                  </hi>. I lodge in Queen-street, Edgeware-road St. Marylebone, in the house of Robert Unwin—the prisoner came to lodge in the same room with me on the 3rd of January—we were to sleep in the same bed. On Saturday, the 11th of January, I left the room at half-past seven o'clock, leaving the prisoner in bed—I returned about half-past six or seven o'clock in the evening, found my cupboard-door broken open, and my clothes and articles taken—I had left it locked—the bolt of the lock was forced back—the value of my clothes was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—both the coats were quite new, and I value them at what they cost, but the other articles I value as they were—the prisoner did not return to his lodging—I saw him again on Tuesday evening, the 14th of January, and gave him in charge—I said I believed he had robbed me—he said it was no such thing, and said he did not know me—I went to the station-house with him, and when he was searched, I saw he had my waistcoat on, and my scissors were found in his pocket.</p>

            . On the 25th of January, coming up Cheapside, at Mr. Smith's print shop, I saw the prisoner make several attempts, but he did nothing; he went into St. Paul's Church Yard; Mr. Brooks was looking at some pictures; the prisoner went up and took the handkerchief out of his pocket; I saw him stoop and put it into his breeches; I asked Mr. Brooks if he had lost his handkerchief; he first said no, then he felt and said yes. I examined the flap of the prisoner's breeches, and there I found it; when we came before my Lord Mayor I found three more on him.</p>

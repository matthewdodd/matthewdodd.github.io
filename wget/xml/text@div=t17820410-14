               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>There was very little doubt they had been at work, their hands were very black, there is a great deal of grease employed in the work.</p>
               <p>From Morris. He tells you there were two candlesticks standing by the large press? - There were two candles burning, I did not say candlesticks.</p>
               <p>Were my hands black and greasy as if I had been at work? - They were.</p>
               <p>From Norton. Whether I had my coat on?</p>
               <p>Court. He has sworn you had it on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carpmeal deposed he went to the house, and found the door and opened it, and saw the same persons, in the same situation as the former witness described, and added, (the press was produced in court) their hands were dirty, there were two presses, a large cutting out press, a die fixed, and a halfpenny between the dies, there was a bushel of halfpence and a bushel of blanks, here is the halfpenny I took from between the dies, two gentlemen marked it.</p>

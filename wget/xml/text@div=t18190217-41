On the 12th of February, about half-past six o'clock at night, I was in the shop - it was quite dark - the lamps had been lit above an hour. Thompson came in, and said he had got two boys for breaking our window, and had taken them to the watch-house - we knew nothing of it ourselves. I had seen the window in the morning, one pane was cracked quite across, from side to side, but the glass was quite fast, and not at all likely to come out - the crack had been there for near a month. When Thompson came in I went out, and found the pane broke and cracked all over - one piece was out; I had not been in the shop ten minutes before Thompson came in - I did not hear it break - it might have been broken before I went in. I observed the handkerchief hanging about half a yard out of the window - one part inside and the other out; they were full a yard from the window when I saw them before. There was a piece of cloth behind the glass, which prevented them from coming quite out; there was a quantity of glass in the window, when we cleared the things away.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Sepulchre's. On the 12th of February, between six and seven o'clock at night - it was quite dark, I was informed there were some suspicious persons in St. John-street, I went there with Morgan, the patrol. I saw the two prisoners there in company with another, (who had an umbrella,) against the prosecutor's shop - I was in a house on the opposite side of the street. I saw them all three go up close to the window - they appeared to be covering each other, so that nobody should notice them - the middle man appeared to be doing something to the glass; I do not know whether it was the other man or the prisoner Williams; they all immediately left the window, and crossed over to my side of the way - nobody had given any alarm. They joined, went back to the window again, and still appeared to be employed as before; somebody came by, who appeared to look at them; they all left the window again, and crossed over to my side. They repeated it three or four times. At last I saw Jones go up to the window by himself; I saw him put his left hand into the window,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170027"></xptr>and pull something - he remained there about a minute; they crossed over the way, and saw me knocking at a shop-door; Jones looked at me, and crossed over immediately, as I suspected, to give the others a signal that I was watching. I followed, got on the opposite side, and collared both, as they appeared to be making off; Williams made a desperate resistance, and got from me. I called for assistance, and the patrol stopped him in the middle of the road, before he got out of my sight; I put them in the watch-house, which is about 150 yards off, and returned directly to Mr. Hawkins - I could not have been gone above two or three minutes. When I came back I observed the glass had been broken - the putty appeared to have been cut with a small knife; there was a piece of glass quite out, and taken away; a small piece of glass was left sticking to the putty. Drakefield said two handkerchiefs had been taken out - I did not see them.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was coming down St. John-street, about half-past five o'clock, and saw the prisoners looking in at several shop-windows; I watched them. At last they went up to the prosecutor's window. I gave Thompson information, and we both went to the shop - it was then about a quarter before six o'clock - you could not distinguish a man's features by the natural light - the lamps were lit in the street and shops. I saw the prisoner, Jones, with two others go up to Hawkins's shop; I then saw the man with the umbrella push the corner pane of glass with his hand; then all three went from the window up the street. I went and called Thompson to my assistance - we went and found them at the window, Jones was in the middle pushing the glass with his hand. Two persons went into the shop; the three prisoners immediately crossed over the way; Jones came and stood before me, looking me full in the face, the other two stopped. Directly Jones saw me, he went and spoke to them, and they all went away together. They came down St. John-street again, went to the window, and I saw Williams pulling at something. I went down the street, and stood at the end of Swan-alley, and saw all three at the window. Jones walked away, and crossed to where Thompson was hiding himself - a waggon came by, and I saw no more until Thompson called out, tyo, which is my watch-ward; I crossed over, and saw Thompson had hold of the two prisoners; Williams struck him and got away, another patrol came by, and struck him with a stick; I seized him, and immediately took him to the watch-house. I went to the window, and saw two handkerchiefs hanging out of the broken place - it was near seven o'clock when we took them.</p>

            . On Friday, the 12th of February, at full half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was coming out of Swan-alley into St. John-street; Thomson stood at the end of the passage; he pointed three men out to me at Hawkins's shop - they were the prisoners, and another who had an umbrella over his shoulder; he desired me to go beyond them, and assist in securing them if they went from the shop. I went directly opposite to them, about 15 yards off on the other side - all three stood abreast the window, the middle one seemed to put his hand to the window - at that time a person hastily passed by, he has hastily took his hand from the window, and rose it to his face. I distinctly saw a piece of glass in his hand, about as big as my four fingers. All three instantly walked from the window up the street, crossed over, and came close by me. I heard the alarm, and afterwards saw them at the watch-house. Williams had an apron on when he came to the watch-house, he doubled it round him; and I think the man who rose the glass to his head had an apron on.</p>

            . I am the watch-house keeper. The prisoners were brought to me - I think Williams had no apron on, Jones had one. I found a comb on Jones. Before Williams was searched he sat down on a form; soon after, I took a candle, and under the form I found a knife, exactly under where he sat. I went next day to look at the window; it appeared as if a knife had been run down between the frame and the glass - nobody had been in the watch-house before this. I cannot say the knife was not there before.</p>

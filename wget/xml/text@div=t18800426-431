                  </hi>. On 1st April I was acting as polling-clerk at the National School, Hercules Buildings, Lambeth—the prisoner came in about 5.55, and walked up to the booth—I said, "What is your name?"—he said, "William Martin"—I said, "Where do you live?"—he said, "27"—I said, "27 where?"—he said, "Down here, Hercules Buildings"—on looking at the list I found I had already ticked off William Martin as having voted—I have not got the list—I drew the presiding officer's attention to the fact of William Martin having already voted—the prisoner could hear what I said—Mr. Giles put the oath to him, but he would not take it—he said, "If you don't want to take the vote I don't want to give it," and turned round to leave the polling-booth—somebody touched him on the shoulder, and said, "I think you had better get out of it, and had better get away"—he said that his name was Fudge—I do not recollect what address he gave—he was given in custody.</p>

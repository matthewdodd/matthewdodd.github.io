The night this gentleman was robbed, I had been at Carey-street; I was informed there, that a robbery had been committed that evening in the King's road; I went and searched some suspected houses; I could not make any discovery upon the search, but going accidentally up West-street, near the Seven Dials, I saw the two prisoners on the other side of the way; I did not know them, but seeing them stand in the street, looking at something they had in their hands, I went up to them, put my hand round them, and said, how do you do my lads? I saw this watch in Kennedy's hand ( producing it;) I took it from him; I asked him how he came by it; he said Divett found it; I took them into custody. As we were going along I asked Divett how he came by it; he said Kennedy found it. I searched them, but I did not find any arms upon them: I found three cartridges of gunpowder upon Kennedy. The next day one Wadley, an accomplice, came to Sir

            . The two prisoners and I met together, at the White Horse, the corner of St. Ann's-lane, Westminster, and then we came to a further determination to go a robbing; we staid in the house about an hour, and then went out; I and Kennedy had each a pistol, and Devett had a cutlass: the pistols were Kennedy's, the cutlass was mine: I bought it before of a man the corner of Fleet prison. When we got out of the house, we went first into the fields; there we loaded the pistols, staid in the fields till dark, and from thence went into the King's road, towards Bloody-bridge; we got clear of the houses: we heard somebody cough in the road before us, therefore Kennedy and I ran forwards as fast as we could; Divett followed us at a little distance; when we came up, it was Mr. Morse, and he had a lady with him: I presented a pistol to him, and stopt him; he pulled out his watch directly: Kennedy presented a pistol to the lady; she said she had but sixpence; he said he would not take that, and we made off immediately a-cross the field; Divett came up before we had done; he drew his cutlass and put it between the man and woman; we went first towards Hammersmith; then we came through Kensington to Westminster; Kennedy took the cutlass and pistols and carried them to his lodgings; then Kennedy and I agreed to go together directly to sell the watch; I had the watch in my pocket all this time; Kennedy said at the top of West-street, that he had no seal to his watch, and he wished to have the seal from the gentleman's watch; I took out the watch and delivered it into his hand: immediately as he got the watch, he and Divett crossed the street; I remained on the side I was on, and I saw a man come up and take Kennedy and Divett, upon which I made off directly. Our intention was to have sold the watch in Monmouth-street; we were in our way there when they were taken up. I was informed by my brother, that Kennedy had told my name, and where I lived; therefore I thought it would be the safest way to surrender myself; accordingly I went next day to Sir

I am a turnkey at Tothil-fields Bridewell; the two prisoners were brought to our prison; I lay in the next room to the prisoners; after they were gone to bed, I heard Divett say to the people in the room (for I knew his voice) that it was very lucky for him that he had just delivered the watch to Kennedy. The next day one of the prisoners in that room came and told me, that the arms were locked up in Kennedy's house, and he informed me where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177210210034"></xptr> Kennedy lodged; before I went to search for these arms, a man came to the prisoner, who said he was Kennedy's father; I told him what had happened, and that I had an intention to search the box; (Kennedy had given me a key, which he said was the key of his box;) I went home with the father; he brought a box which he said was his son's; I opened the box with the key I had of Kennedy, and I found in it these two pistols, the cutlass, some cartridges, and leaden slugs, ( producing them.)

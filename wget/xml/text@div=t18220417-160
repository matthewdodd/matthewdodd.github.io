            . I am a shoemaker, and live at the Duke of Northumberlad, next door to the Worship-street Office. I have been acquainted with the officers for a year. On the 13th of April I met the prisoner by appointment; he was to bring me twenty counterfeit shillings; he came in after me, and said he was sorry to detain me; we left the house, and went up Noble-street, and saw a woman standing there, and just before I got up to her; he said</p>
               <p>"This is my old woman," I said,</p>
               <p>"What is that your wife," he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, she has got the stuff," meaning counterfeit money; he said,</p>
               <p>"You may as well deal with her as me;" I objected to it, and said I would never trust a woman with my business - he asked me to step on a little way, I did so, and on turning round saw the woman give him a parcel; he followed me up the street leading into Gee-street, he there stepped up to me, and shifted the counterfeit money slily into my hand - I gave him 6 s. good money, which we had agreed on before. I could not get him to go the way I wanted; we went up Gee-street, into Compton-street; his woman kept with us all the time, and then we parted, and agreed to meet on the following Monday, at the same place. We all three went into a public-house in Compton-street, and at the door, he said he wished me to meet at this house on Monday - I objected to that; he said he would rather, because it was out of his parish, and the officers would not expect to see him there. I said it was taking me so much out of my way. We then agreed to meet at the White Lion, public-house, on Monday, and I ordered another score; I was afraid he was aware of what I was after, and I took a circuitous round to Worship-street - I found the officers were not there; and I gave the counterfeit money to Mance. On Monday I went to the White Lion, and was there about a quarter of an hour; he came in and said</p>
               <p>"Have you seen my wife;" I said No; he said</p>
               <p>"She is looking after you, you may as well walk with me" - I went out with him, and let him lead me where he pleased - he took me to the City-road. He was apprehended at six o'clock in the evening; he told me he had had so much call for them during the holidays, that he had made himself bankrupt, for he had sold all out, and in order to keep his customers together, he was obliged to buy of other people. I saw his wife standing under the workhouse wall, City-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do you get your living by shoe-making - A. No. I go on messages for the officers. I have only dealt with one man besides the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer. I have heard Edwards's statement. He delivered me twenty counterfeit shilling on Saturday the 13th, which I produce. I had frequent communications with him. I saw him, and the prisoner in company together in Leonard-street, and took them both; he acted under our direction. I searched him before he went to buy the money, and saw six good shillings delivered to him.</p>

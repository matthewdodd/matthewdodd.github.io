                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Lemon, a joiner; we did live at 10, Albert Road, Kilburn—the prisoner and his family came to lodge in that house about three months before he "was taken into custody—about a week after they had been in the house the eldest daughter brought the deceased child down, for me to look at, and I afterwards spoke to the prisoner about it—about a fortnight before Whitsuntide I said I did not think the girls were capable of taking care of the child, they were in and out and racing about so much—he made use of very bad language, to me, and said what was he to do, he was out at work all day, and they must do the best they could, and he went out and came home drunk—when I saw the child in the girl's arms it looked very whining—I did not see it undressed—I only saw it's face then—it's flesh hung very loose—it was not the face of an ordi<lb></lb>nary child, it appeared as if it wanted nourishment—I did not speak to the prisoner again about it after he was so abusive—he mostly came home about 6 o'clock in the evening—I don't think he ever came in without he was intoxi<lb></lb>cated, he was in and out of the public house all the evening, except in Whitsun week, and then he was at home all the week, and never went out—I believe that was the week he was out of work, and that week he was sober—the child seemed to be getting smaller every time I saw it—I think I saw it about once a fortnight, for after I spoke to the prisoner I was out at work—I never saw him leave any money or provisions—I saw some Sisters of Mercy once at the house after the child was christened—I can't tell the date—I believe it was before Whitsuntide—on one occasion, about a week before he was taken, I heard him make use of bad' language, and tell the girls to give him the brandy, for he wanted it as much as the child did—on two occa<lb></lb>sions</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187408170040"></xptr>
               <p>I provided the child with some milk and sugar—the last time was about a fortnight before it's death—I told the prisoner when I spoke to him about the child that I considered it was grossly neglected, and I did not consider it had proper nourishment—he made use of bad language, and said he could not help it, he left what he could—I saw the child twice with it's bottle about three weeks before it's death—it took it as if it had a sore throat—it did not draw from the bottle as it ought—it was corn flour, I believe—it seemed as if it could not get it fast enough, it was ravenous; but it could not swallow it sufficiently, it was too weak, as if it had not strength to draw it—on the Friday week before it died, the 26th of June, I went to Mr. Judd, the relieving officer—at that time the prisoner did not come home till past 9 o'clock, and sometimes 12 o'clock, and then he was so drunk he could not open the street door, and the daughter had to do it for him—on the Friday before the child died on the Sunday, I told him that the child was starved—he made use of very bad language, and said I was a liar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't think I stated that before the magistrate—my first complaint was that the girls were so giddy they did not take proper care of the child—that was a fact—they were in the habit of locking it up in the room, and leaving it alone—the last time they left it was about three hours—they did that about three times—I spoke to them about it—the prisoner told me that the child was not neglected, and was not starved, he left what he could—the girls told me that it had Swiss milk, corn flour, and barley milk—I say that the family was left destitute by the father—I can't answer for the elder children, the child was, by what the girls said—I don't know of my own knowledge how much nourishment was provided for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I told the girl that the child looked to mo as if it did not have enough nourishment, and I asked what she gave it—she said she gave it what she could get, that she had some from the Sisters of Merey, but before that the father had not given her sufficient for the child—I asked if she had taken it to the doctor's—she said "No, she gave it a little castor oil when it wanted it, but the father would not allow her to take it to the doctor's"—when I was out at work I asked her to do me a little bit of cleaning—she said she should be very glad, as they had had nothing to eat,—that the father only gave her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at a time to procure things—I gave them a few halfpence for doing that on a Saturday—at one time they left the child four hours, and during that time the prisoner came home, and the child was screaming "dreadfully—he went upstairs and came down again, and said "I can't do anything, the girls are gone away, and the child is locked in"—that was about a month before it died—there were five children altogether when they came, but one went away—one was three years old.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am a registered medical practitioner—on an order from Mr. Judd I went to see the child on the 26th June—its state was scarcely describable, it was a perfect skeleton, shrivelled up to almost a mummy, the left eye was thoroughly destroyed and sunk into the head—I examined it all over, it was nothing but skin and bone—it was suffering from starvation, and from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb></lb>tion I should say of long continuance—I mean by starvation not that the food did not nourish it, but from want of food—I saw the prisoner nest morning, between 11 and 12 o'clock, in his own room—I told him I thought the child was sadly neglected and he ought to have had a wet nurse to it—he made no remark—upon, application the child would have been taken into the workhouse or provided with a wet nurse—if I had seen it at an earlier stage I should have prescribed for it—I did prescribe a little brandy and milk, but only as a sort of <hi rend="italic">placibo</hi>, it was too late to be of any use, the child was dying—I weighed it with its clothes on after death, and it weighed 4 lbs. 6 oz.—the average weight of a healthy child at birth is from 3 to 4 lbs. Up to 16 lbs.—I have repeatedly had 16 lb. children—the average weight at five months would be from 18 to 20 lbs.—when I opened the abdomen there was not a particle of food in the stomach or any fatal matter in the bowels, and not a particle of adipose tissue between the skin and bones—the organs were perfectly healthy—I did not examine the brain, it was too decomposed—the loss of the eye might be from carelessness or neglect, or it might have been injured—the penis was diseased, that indicated neglect, want of washing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. To the best of my belief, on 26th June, nothing could have saved the child—I did not notice that the place was very poverty stricken, I don't remember saying so before the magistrate, or that the child might have refused its food, and so sunk—when I saw it had not the power to suck, it was too weak—I said before the magistrate that if it got all the nourishment mentioned in the depositions it would not have died of starva<lb></lb>tion, to the best of my belief—in ray judgment it did die of starvation.</p>

I told them to come to me because I knew that the father was short of work, only a little hay-making that he could get occasionally that was the last month or six weeks of the child's life—I did not know that it was dying of starvation between 26th June and 6th. July—the last time I saw the prisoner was about three weeks before the child's death—he came to my house one evening—I don't know how much a day he was paid for hay-making—I think the last day's work he did was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I don't know that he was not sober except for one week during the last five months—he did not appear tipsy when he came to me—he did not suffer from <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> before he became a teetotaller—he had a sunstroke about twelve years ago—he was a teetotaller for a great number of years—since the death of his wife he has drunk very hard.</p>

I am the prisoner's daughter, and am 15 years of age—I and my sister were left to take care of the baby—my sister attended to it, I used to feed it sometimes—I noticed, it getting ill—my sister told father it was very ill—she did not say what was the matter with it, some brandy was sent for the baby by the Sisters of Mercy, the baby always had it—father had about half a wine glass of it twice, that was about three weeks before the baby died.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. We used to lock the child in the room for an hour and a half at a time alone with the bottle in' a little cot—it did not get hurt in the eye that I know of, it was bad ever since it was born, it could never see out of it—on Easter Monday my sister went out and left me in charge of the child till 11 o'clock at night—father did not know that—I did not leave the child part of that time, I had it to take care of; it was left alone for about an hour and half once in each week while we went out to play; we were not away as much as two or three hours, I am sure of that—Mrs. Lemon complained of our leaving it for two or three hours at a time, that was true—my sister and I were left in charge of our brother Henry, we let him run about the streets, and he had to be locked up in a reformatory.</p>

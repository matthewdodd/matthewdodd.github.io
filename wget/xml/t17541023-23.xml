               <p>Robert Harris. I am part owner of the vessel called, the Princess of Wales, and belong to the corn trade. Thomas Lake, the master of her, came to me on the 4th of Oct. and told me he had lost the fore-sail, the flying gibb, and a piece of hercer; containing about 15 or 20 fathom, and that on board the next vessel to me, which was a Holland's trader, there was a man who saw the 2 prisoners cut them away. We got a warrant from justice Rickards, and took them up, and charged them with it before the justice, and they both denied it. I advertised the things, and on the 8th day the carpenter of the Dawkins, captain Beladine, came to me and told me he had seen on board their vessel cordage and such sails, and that one

After that the carpenter of the Dawkins told us the things were on board their vessel; then we got a warrant and went on board, and found them there. Then we took

Then Dudley went back and got in their ship's boat, I heard him rattle the oars of the boat; after Malone had cut the sail away, he let it fall into the boat, which was then underneath; they then rowed away.</p>

I keep a slop-shop, and sell watches and other things; I heard a noise, and came into the shop; when I came into the shop, I found the string upon which the watches hung either cut or broke; I went behind the counter, and found three watches and a great many chains, that I had hung upon this string, upon the ground; I missed one silver capped watch and a silver chain, this chain was lying at the door; they all hung in a row, and the chain hung by the side of the watch; the watch had a black string and a silver key to it; I picked up the chain, and have had it ever since; I ran into the street, but saw no person near; I sent to Lambeth-street, and the officers came to our house; I have never seen any thing of the watch since; when I went to the door, a boy of about fourteen years of age was at the door that saw it, but he was by some means put out of the way; I have taken all manner of pains, but I have not been able to find him; my own child is here, and she says it was the prisoner, she knows him very well; he was taken up on the first of this month.</p>

             sworn. - I am twelve years of age, I am daughter of Mrs. Williams, by a former husband: On Saturday, the 14th of January, about a quarter past eight in the evening, I saw the prisoner come into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him perfectly well? - A. Not perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. I have no doubt but he is the man; he had on a blue coat and a blue apron; I saw him come into the shop, I was in the back kitchen; I thought it was a customer, and I went into the shop, and saw this man standing at the counter, with his arm reaching towards the watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had seen you? - A. I do not know; he ran away, then I went to the door, and a boy was at the door of the name of Freestone; he works in the Tower; he was at the door when the prisoner ran out, I saw him by the lights; it was not any thing that the boy said to me that made me know it was the prisoner, I am sure it was him; I saw him at the Magistrate's again, the first of this month, the day he was taken.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were there many people in the room when you saw him at the Magistrate's? - A. Me, and my mother, and the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he irons on at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from the irons that you suspected he was the man that was charged, or had you a recollection of his person? - A. I had a recollection of his person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise while he was in the shop? - A. Yes, like the falling of the watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the falling of the watches made you go into the shop? - A. No, I heard the falling of the watches as I was proceeding towards the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went into the shop, did you know how the watches and the other things were? - A. About three quarters of a yard from the window, upon a line, I picked up some of the things from the ground myself, some lockets and a card of gold rings; I saw my mother pick up a silver watch-chain at the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Could this chain have fallen there from the cutting of the string, or must it have been removed first, and dropped afterwards? - A. They could not have fell so near the door, unless they had been carried there; I had seen the things in the window about five minutes before this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How old are you? - A. Twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you heard a noise in the shop, you were in the back kitchen? - A. No, I was coming towards the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said you were in the back kitchen when you heard the things fall? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The first notice you had of any body being in the shop was in consequence of hearing the things fall? - A. No, I perceived this man come into the shop, that I thought was a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. And after that you heard them fall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any room between the back kitchen and the shop? - A. No, there is a long passage.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were in the passage at the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the door were these things hanging? - A. Not above three quarters of a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. And the things, when you found them, had fallen just underneath the place where they had been hanging? - A. Yes, behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the door leading to the passage opposite the shop door? - A. It is immediately opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that passage? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. As long as this table? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150056"></xptr>Q. Saturday night is generally a busy night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is a tolerable public neighbourhood? - A. It is a public neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. And a great many persons were therefore at that time going backwards and forwards? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. His side was towards you, and he was reaching over? - A. Yes, and I saw his face when he came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he have been in the shop? - A. About a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you not cry out? - A. Yes, to my mother; she was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn back and go to your mother? - A. No, I kept on into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole time that he was in the shop could not have been more than a minute? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And during one part of that minute you could only have had a momentary glance? - A. I took particular notice of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have seen him before, but you are not certain? - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. But you told my Lord you had not seen him so as to recollect him again? - A. I said I had seen him once before.</p>
               <p>Q. But you went on and said, but I did not know him? - A. No, I did not know him perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then though you did not know the man you in the back passage, and his back towards you the greatest part of the time, you take upon you to swear that he is the man? - A. Yes; I am very sure that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it you went into the kitchen for? - A. For the snuffers.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the candles were dim? - A. They wanted snuffing.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding this circumstance, that there was so little light in the shop at that time, and you at such a distance from the man, you undertake now to swear that the prisoner is the man? - A. There were five candles in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. And it is a tolerable large shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been as positive to the man as you are now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the runners who the man was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that this man has lived in your neighbourhood ever since? - A. I do not know; I have heard several times since that he has been past our house upon the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. This offence happened on the 14th of January? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was never taken up till February? - A. The first of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore near three weeks had elapsed before he was taken up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And on the 7th of February he was examined at Shadwell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was a month from the time that the offence was committed, till you saw this man again; and notwithstanding the little opportunity you had of observing him, you undertake to say the prisoner was the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said you did not know who the, man was that committed the robbery, except that he was a pock-marked man? - A. I said, the man that came into the shop was pitted with the smallpox.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not assign as a reason why you could know that the man now at the bar was the man that robbed the shop, that he was so much pitted with the small-pox? - A. I particularly recollect the features of his face, I kept my eyes upon him all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, that the reason why you knew the prisoner when you saw him at the Office, was, because the man that robbed the shop was so much marked with the small-pox, that you observed him, and assigned that reason? - A. I particularly remarked the features of his face; he was pitted with the small-pox.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had known this man before, what reason had you to assign this particular account of the features of his face, as the reason why you should know him? - A. I am sure this is the man that robbed my mother; I know him by the features of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is only from these particular observations that you recollect it was the man you had seen before? - A. I am sure he is the man; when he was coming in, I said to my mother that is the man that robbed the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What hat had he on? - A. A round hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a handkerchief about his neck? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Over his chin? - A. No, round his neck.</p>
               <p>Q. And you still persevere in swearing that that is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - On a Saturday night, it might be six weeks ago, I was going for a little money that was owing me, and going along I saw a mob standing at this gentlewoman's door; I went across the lane to see what was the matter, and I heard the people say that Mrs. Williams was robbed; Mrs. Williams was standing in the shop, very much sturried, and a little girl behind the counter; a gentlewoman asked her if she had been robbed, and she said, yes; she asked her if she knew who had robbed her, and she said she did not know who it was, she wished she did, she would make them suffer for it; I was at the shop door and heard them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the little girl say any thing at the time? - A. No; there was a tape went across the window that was broke down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she so close to her mother at the time, that she must have heard the observation? - A. Yes, she must; she was behind the counter, and the mother on this side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make any reply? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person there besides yourself? - A. A great many more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they strangers to you? - A. Yes; there was another gentlewoman asked her if she should know the watch again; I do not know whether it was one or two; and she asked her if they were marked, and she said they were marked; a woman standing there said, I saw the man go out, it was very much like a carpenter that was at work in your back shop; it was a woman that seemed to be an acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the little girl say any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not say she knew the man? - A. No; I went to the Office; she said, she had lost four pounds worth; they would not hear me speak before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. No further than by sight: his mother keeps a chandler's shop and coal-shed.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you? - A. I go out in the streets with fish.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known this lad? - A. I have known him from a child by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you here to-day? - A. I was speaking about it, and his mother desired me to come and say what I knew; I heard that the lad was taken up upon suspicion of it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Williams. I have not had a carpenter in my house these twenty-one months, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see this young woman there, the last witness? - A. To the best of my knowledge I never saw her; I was not capable, the night I lost my watch, to say a single word; I was so frightened, I thought I should have died.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you had any conversation at all with any body? - A. I do not remember, except that I spoke to a chair-woman who was just going away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that the watches were marked, do you recollect? - A. Indeed I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you had any conversation at all with any of the people who came about you? - A. Not any, to my knowledge; this was not a watch for sale, it was a watch which was sent in for a job to be repaired; it stopped about every two hours, and I paid the owner for it this very week.</p>
               <p>Q. You are answerable for it? - A. I am, and have paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. That chain does not belong to the watch? - A. That was one that was exposed for sale in the window.</p>

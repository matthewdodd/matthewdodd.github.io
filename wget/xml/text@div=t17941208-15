               <p>Q. Did you, in November last, lose any quantity of linen rags? - Yes, on the 19th of last month.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it you lost? - Forty pounds weight of rags.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the bar before? - I have seen him previous to the time; there is a public house opposite my warehouse; I saw him carry a bag out, and knowing him not employed in my warehouse, I suspected that he might have taken them; I have not indicted him on that fact, that led me only to the suspicion. The warehouses that I occupy, you will understand, are two ground floors; my porter was concerned with this man, but the constable let my porter escape. My porter came in the morning and opened the warehouses; during the time he was there the prisoner came and looked in the passage for the porter, and not finding him there, he went in the public house to wait for him. My porter came out of the privy, and went into the public house to him; they both came to the warehouse together, and the porter came out to the door, and looked to see if the way was clear, and the prisoner came out with the linen rags, and I followed him, and took him in Philip-lane, and brought him back, and gave charge of him and the porter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you buy rags of those that collect them? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you or your porter had bought rags of this man before? - I do not know; he could not on that morning; but it is not impossible but he might.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prisoner when he first came? - I see him when he first came to the door, and I never quitted my station till I sent my man to the counting house.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you not any transactions with him before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You know him you say? - Yes, I had seen him come backwards and forwards to the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he at any time, offered you any rags? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner at the bar? - No, I did not apprehend him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a bag of rags in his possession at any time? - The rags were in the scale in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Who produces them in the court? - I produce them in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you receive them? - These rags were carried to the Mansion House, and there a seal was put on the bag; from thence they were carried and left at Mr. Ford's house; they were brought from the prosecutor's house yesterday to the sessions house here, and then they were delivered to me, and have been in my custody from that time till now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they are the bag of rags for which the prisoner is indicted for stealing? - Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can tell you why I put them in the scale, I thought it was proper to know what weight they were, and give the constable an account.</p>
               <p>Q. On the point of identifying them, it is impossible, otherwise than the man went in with an empty bag. Had you the possession of such a bag of rags the preceding night? - They were in a loose package; these had been packed by my porter and the present prisoner. The prisoner told me I could not identify<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080063"></xptr>rags; that was his presumption on this business.</p>

               <p>Q. You live in the neighbourhood of Mr. Ford, the prosecutor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar; did you ever see him before? - Yes, a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information to Mr. Ford of seeing that man come out with any property from his warehouse? What did you see? - The first time I saw it was on Monday morning, I got up between seven and eight o'clock, and saw this man and Mr. Ford's porter together, and I saw him afterwards, when I went out for some butter, I met this man with some rags on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing on the day he was taken up with the rags? - Yes, I saw him come out of Mr. Ford's house, and saw Mr. Ford's porter follow him and bring them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Ford's suspicion arose from an information that you gave him the day before that? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have taken a bit of a house over the water, and I used to buy rags at one place or another, if I could get a shilling in buying any rags, and I brought these rags the afternoon before, and asked two guineas for them, and Mr. Ford's man would not give me but forty shillings for them, and so I took them away again.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

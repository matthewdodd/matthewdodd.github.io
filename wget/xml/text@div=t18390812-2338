                  </hi>. I am a Dane. I left the American ship <hi rend="italic">Roden,</hi> and met the prisoner in the street on the 13th of August—I went home and slept with her—I met her again the next night, and we agreed to sleep that night together—we went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock—I had six sovereigns, which I put into my watch pocket, and put my trowsers on a chair by the bed-side—I went to sleep, and awoke about two o'clock—I then missed three sovereigns—I said to the prisoner, "You have been at my pocket, and taken out three sovereigns"—she said, "I have got no money, not a farthing"—she had been down stairs while I was there—she said she was going into the yard, but was about an hour before she came up again—I went down and told Mrs. Freeman when I missed my money—I had three or four shillings in my waistcoat pocket—I gave the pri<lb></lb>soner 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the first night, and was to give her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the second—I said I would pay her in the morning.</p>

               <p>came—in the course of the night the prisoner came out of the bed-room about a quarter past twelve o'clock, and asked if I would fetch her some supper—she gave me a sovereign to change, and told me a gentle<lb></lb>man of the name of Fred gave it her, who belonged to the army, that she bad been kept by him, and she could always have a sovereign of him—she said the prosecutor had given her nothing, and she did not want him to know that she had this money—I said she had better give me the money—she took a piece of paper out, and gave it me with two sovereigns in it, and the change of the other sovereign, which was 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she told me not to tell the prosecutor—I went to bed, and was awoke by the pro<lb></lb>secutor calling out—he said he had lost some money—I said to the prisoner, "Young woman, if the money you have given me, and the money for the supper, is his, why don't you give it him?"—she kept making motions to me not to say any thing—at last my husband said I had better call a policeman, which I did.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a baker's shop in King-street, Bethnal-green—on Friday, 18th March, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for two half-quarten brick-loaves, which came to 5 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a five shilling-piece—I put it in my pocket where there was no other, and gave her a half-crown, a florin, and a halfpenny—she came back in a quarter of an hour, and said that I had given her a bad half-crown, which she showed me—I took it back, and gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put the half-crown in the same pocket with the crown—in about a quarter of an hour I tried it, and it tasted gritty—I gave them both to the constable, Benson, who was with me in the shop, he looked at the half-crown in the prisoner's presence, and gave it me back—on the Monday afterwards I pointed the prisoner out, and gave her in custody.</p>

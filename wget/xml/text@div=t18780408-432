                  </hi>. I am a carman, of Portobello Road, Notting Hill—on 18th February the prisoner came and represented himself as the son of Mr. Davis, who owed me over 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that Mr. Davis was very sorry he could not settle my account, as they had not received their remittances for the goods I had forwarded into the country, and were rather short of money, and would I advance him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the men's wages, and he would give me a bill for the whole amount, 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked me if I would have it payable at the London and North-Western Bank or at my house—I said at the bank, as it would be easier to collect—I gave him the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he wrote this promissory note in my presence: "February 15th, 1878.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I said "Are you Mr. Davis's son?" and you said "Yes"—I knew you to be his managing man—I have taken orders of you—I cannot tell you whether written orders have been "For J. H. Davis, per C. Fox"—I remember receiving a letter last Christmas and sending it to you, but I did not know you were Fox.</p>

                  </hi>. On 20th March I had a warrant for the prisoner and saw him in High Street, Notting Hill—I said "Fox, you had better step across the road, Mr. Davis wishes to speak to you; I hold a warrant for your apprehension, you will have to go with me to Hammersmith"—I put him into a cab with the prosecutor—he said on the road "Oh father, I hope you will not do this, it is only 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I should not have done it if I had not been drunk."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I did not say "If you tell me all about it I will make it all right with Mr. Davis, it is only a family affair"—I did not say that it was only a matter of form, a family matter, and Mr. Davis would not do anything if I told him all about it.</p>

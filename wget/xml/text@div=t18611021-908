                  </hi>. I am a builder, of Rose Villas. Montpelier-road, Peckham—I built some houses in Albert-road, Peckham—in July I had some semi<lb></lb>detached houses, called Lansdowne-villas, two of which were, unoccupied—the adjoining house to the one in question was occupied by a family named Collis—I call them three-storied houses—the entrance to the house was at the side in the Albert-road; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) is a model of it—there was a stable at the side, which had been built by my previous tenant, who kept a pony and cart—there was no communication between the stable and the house when the house was let in July; you had to go round the back way—there was an entrance here for the carriage, but no communication from the middle—when you entered the house from the street you came along a passage—there were two solid brick walls; one fourteen inches thick, and the other nine inches—the wall at the back of the stable was nine inches thick, and there was another at right angles to it—one wall was against the other—they were each nine inches thick—here is the wall of the stable, and this is the wall of the house, which was fourteen inches thick—when you enter the passage to go to the house, you have not to go into a door; it is an arch—there is a half-briek wall opposite the door that separates the pantry or store closet from the entrance hall—when you go through that archway you come into the lobby where the staircase is—there were two parlours with folding doors—there was a closet under the staircase with a door and boarded floor—there were certain rooms above, and a kitchen built out behind, with a sloping roof—there was an entrance here into the</p>

               <p>kitchen—the only way into it was from the kitchen, but I call it a store closet—the only entrance to that store closet in July was from the kitchen—a garden ran round the premises, and between Nunhead-lane and the passage was a piece of vacant ground belonging to me—about 13th or 14th July, Frederick Clift called upon me—he said he came about the house at Nunhead-lane, and wanted to take it for the accommodation of the stable; that he was living at 2, Harwich-cottages, Commercial-road, which I know very well, as I happened to build it; that he had no stable there, which was inconvenient, and he had to put his horse up at his brother's—we agreed on the rent, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—my wife was present—he signed the agreement on the Monday, and paid half a quarter's rent in advance—on 16th George Clift called on me for the key by himself—my wife was present—I handed the key to my wife, and she gave it to him—no opening had been made at that time from the stable into the house—nothing was said by them about any intention to make an opening, or I should not have allowed it—I did not see the house again till alter the fire on 3d August—I did not then see that any opening had been made—having been at the fire, I went to George Clift's house, in Hardres-road, also called Lansdowne-villas—it is about a quarter of a mile from Frederick Clift's—it is a straight road, only you turn to the right a little—I was asked into the parlour, and saw both the prisoners—I said to Frederick, "There is my house burnt down; how did it happen?"—he said that he did not know; that they had gone to Waltham, and were not at home till half-past 11 that night—I said, "Where were your servants?" and he said, "They were dismissed the week before, and my wife was washing in the kitchen; my child had tumbled into a pan or tub of water, and had not been well since, and she had taken it to Doctor Dennis, in Southampton-street"—I said, "She might have found plenty of doctors it Peckham, without going to Southampton-street that time of night"—Southampton-street is about two miles from there—they said that they should have great losses, and Government particularly, because they could not get their contracts out—I said, "The Government always allow for accidents"—on 13th August, ten days afterwards, I went again to the house—I had been to it and examined it in the mean time, and had seen that a doorway had been made from the pantry to the stable—I saw both the prisoners at George Clift's house on 13th—I asked Frederick when he cut that doorway—he said that he cut it two or three days after he went into the house—I asked him why he cut it—he said that George told him he had done wrong by cutting it, as he ought to have asked my leave—I said that if he had I should not have allowed it to be done, as it affected my insurance—he gave as a reason for doing it that he was afraid of thieves—I said, "I never heard any of my tenants complain of thieves"—he said that he took a gun out one night after them—I said that it made it more easy for thieves to get in, if they had taken a tile off the stable—I asked him the name of the person who had cut the doorway—he said that he would not tell till he was forced to tell, on account of what Collis had said—I said to Frederick, "I let you that stable for your pony, chaise and trap, not for a warehouse"—George said that the stable was not high enough for the shafts of the chaise—he did not then tell me where he had kept the chaise since Frederick had taken the house—the wall had not been cut through by a tradesman, nor was the way which it was made good—it was merely a rough hole in the wall, and a bit of board round it; it was not done cleverly—Frederick said that he had lost sixty sovereigns, I believe it was, which he had to meet a bill—I said. "It is very strange; the firemen</p>

I am a clerk in the Globe Insurance Company-at the time this matter happened I resided at No. 1, Lansdowne-villas, next door to the house that was burnt—I was instructed on Monday, 22d July, to call at No. 2, Frederick Clift's house, to look over it—I went on the Monday evening, and saw Frederick Clift there—after some conversation with him about the quills, he took me into the stable; he took me through the back parlour and kitchen, round the back of the house, through the back entrance to the stable—we went out from the back kitchen through the passage out<lb></lb>side the house—he said, "I am very sorry there is no other way; I must take you through the back of the house "—there were two entrances to the stable, one at the front and one at the back—I might have gone round by the front of the house, and gone in the same way—he said there was no way through the house, he was obliged to go out of the house—I was directed to ascertain whether there was any communication between the house and the stable—I asked him whether there was any communication—while I was in the stable I said, "There is nothing in that wall; are you sure the wall is perfect?"—he said it was—that was one of the principal things that I was directed to ascertain; whether it was a brick wall—I found that there wert quills in the bags which were there—the stable was full of them, within a short distance from the roof, and a narrow passage through, from the front to the back—the bales were packed against the house side, dote to the wall, a narrow passage being on the other side—I have not the slightest know<lb></lb>ledge of the value of such goods; my object was to see that they were really there—after Frederick Clift had been at the house some little time, I knew him and Mrs. Clift by sight—on 2d August, the day of the tire, I saw Mrs. Clift, the wife of Frederick, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I crossed the road to come to my own house, and saw her with the child in a perambulator, standing in the path in front of the house—I think she was coming from the house; she appeared to be standing still—she told me her child had been taken ill, and she was going to take it to a doctor—I cannot say whether she went in the direction of George Clift's house after I left her—I do not recollect whether she moved—I did not see her go away with the child—I went out some little time after that, and afterwards heard of the fire.</p>

               <p>of similar construction: the outer wall against which the stable has been built being a thick wall—the bales and packages were placed against the wall nearest the house, not the outer stable wall—the feathers were piled to t certain extent against the wall; but I think if the door had been there. I must have seen it, above the feathers—the wall on the outer side was away from the house; it is a lean-to stable—I could have walked upright if I hid walked close against that wall—the height of the stable, is on one side, I think, about six feet, and on the other side, it is about two feet higher there is not a passage with feathers stacked on either side of it, only on one side—I know the position of the door that has been cut—if that door bad existed with the bales packed as they were, I think I must have seen the top of it—I did not measure within what distance of the roof the bales went; the door might have been there and escaped my observation, but I do not think it is likely—I swear that I asked him if the wall was perfect; it was one of my first questions when I reached the stable, if I recollect right; it in usual question to ask—of course I have spoken before about having asked him if the wall was perfect—I made a report in which I said that I was told it was perfect—I recollect my previous examination before the Magistrate—I understood it to be a perfect party wall, and that there was no communication; he did not use the word perfect, but he said there was no break in the wall, and that constitutes a perfect wall—I was told by Frederick Clift that there was no communication—I do not suppose I was on the premises more than a quarter of an hour altogether—I looked at several bales, and they appeared to be full of quills because the ends were protruding from the bales—they were not covered.</p>

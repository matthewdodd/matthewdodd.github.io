                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Brierley-place, Wands<lb></lb>worth, in the parish of Lambeth, and keep the house. On the 10th of Jan. I fastened up my house at night—I went into my back garden, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and saw the cellar flap was removed from its ori<lb></lb>ginal situation—I had heard a rumbling noise in the night, which awoke me—I rose in my bed and listened—my wife thought it was the children—I laid down, and heard a second noise—I went down stairs—all was quiet—I went up again, but on seeing the cellar flap I thought I had been robbed—the flap had been nailed down, and had a window inside it—that was raised, and taken away, the whole flap and frame together—they drew the ends of it out of the wall by prizing it, I imagine—I missed two dead fowls, some mutton chops, some pork, a ham, and part of a plum-pudding—the fowls were kept in the house, under the cellar stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of my cousin, William Thomas Fairy, of the Ram Inn, Smithfield—he is also a batcher by trade—the prisoner was in his employment. On 22nd Sept., I received directions from Mr. Fairy to go with the prisoner to deliver the fat—he was to deliver it at Mr. Snowden's, in Elm-street, Gray's Inn-lane, and Mr. Knight's, in Old Gravel-lane, Wappiug—we had five sacks of fat to deliver—we delivered one at Mr. Snowden's, and four at Mr. Knight's—there was then one piece more, not a full sack, only a piece of a sack—I cannot say how that came into the cart—I did not see it when we started, not till the other sacks were removed—it was underneath the others—I could see the other five sacks—I did not always go with the prisoner—after we had delivered all the fat except the piece and one other, we drove to I rongate-wharf—a boy named John Fairhead was with us—I and the boy left the cart, and went into the wharf, leaving the prisoner behind—we had then delivered all the fat except one sack and the part of a sack—the full sack ought to have been delivered at Mr. Snowden's—I had not been in the wharf two minutes when the boy came running in after me—in consequence of what he said I went out, and found the cart was gone—I ran after it, and stopped it in Whitechapel—I got into it, and asked the prisoner to go back—lie said he would not—I asked what he drove away for—he said, what was that to do with me—I eventually took charge of the horse and cart, and went home with him—I then got out of the cart, and he wanted to throw the part of the sack out of the cart—I told him I would not let him, I would put it into the office till Mr. Fairy came—the prisoner said I wanted it myself—I locked it in the office, and when Mr. Fairy returned I communicated it to him, and gave him the key of the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer. On 22nd Feb., I was at the corner of Ludgate Street, about twenty minutes past 5 o'clock, and saw the prisoners—Williams put her left hand into the pocket of a lady, while Coch<lb></lb>rane engaged the lady in conversation—Williams withdrew her hand, and walked quietly away, followed by Cochrane—I spoke to the lady, and went after the prisoners; they walked away together down Ludgate Street—I laid hold of Williams, told her I was an officer, that she had stolen a lady's purse, and she must come back with me to the shop where the lady was waiting—I took from her hand this purse, open (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she said, "You have made a great mistake; you are mistaken altogether—I addressed them both, but Cochrane made no reply—I took them back, showed the lady the purse, and she said that it was her's, in their presence—the charge was booked at the station, in their presence; they made no reply.</p>

I was in Ludgate Street, the day before yesterday, and saw Cochrane at my right elbow; she asked me if I could direct her to London Bridge, or which omnibus would take her there—the other woman disappeared, after asking me two or three questions—a police<lb></lb>man came up and spoke to me, and I felt in my pocket; another policeman beckoned me into a stationer's shop, and I found I had lost my purse—it was afterwards shown to me; I had seen it safe a very short time before.</p>

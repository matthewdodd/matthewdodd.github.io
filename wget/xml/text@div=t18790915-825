                  </hi>. I am a tea and coffee dealer, at 13, John Street—I have known Hall 23 years—on 29th July I left in my office on the second floor, at 5.40, about 12 bags of coffee—some weighed over 1 cwt, some were small bags—at 9 o'clock next morning I missed two bags of coffee, one about 60 lb. and the other about 3/4 cwt—my premises had not been broken open—the prisoner deals in coffee—I called at his premises at 9.30 and 10 o'clock that morning, and he was not in—I went again at 10,30, and he had not come—I saw two bags of coffee, and I looked into a bag of P. berries round coffee and thought it was mine; it was the sort I had missed—the bags were standing in his office opposite the door—I opened them and looked in—he then came in, and said "There's some fine coffee there; do you think you can sell it for me?"—I said "I don't know"—he said he wanted 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound for it—the value is about 120<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per hundredweight—I took a sample—he told me the weight, 61 lb. the bag of P. berries—the other was a flat coffee—I did not recognise the sacks—I went to the police-office and returned with Detective Lawley, but he said he could not go in till I told him the coffee, was there, and I went in first and asked Hall if ha had some other coffee besides the P. berry—I pointed the bags out to Lawley, and said "I believe these coffees are my coffees"—Hall said "They are not your coffees, they have been in my place a week"—I said "They could not be, for they were in my place last evening"—the officer said "How do you account for these bags?—he said "Oh, I can soon account for them; I have an invoice in my pocket that I can show you that I bought them,"</p>

               <p>mentioning a firm in Crutched Friars—he produced an invoice, and I said "There is no such coffee as that hero"—Lawley said "We shall soon come at this; I will go to Macgregor's and see"—he said "You have no occasion to do that; two men brought them in last night at 8 o'clock and shot them out of the bags into these bags, and they are coming for their money at 2 o'clock; they took the bags away"—I waited till 3 o'clock to see the men, but they did not come, and I gave him in custody—the value of the coffee is 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is not an unusual coffee, but a very fine coffee that I and my son had picked out of other coffees from time to time.</p>

There is plenty of it in the market, but we picked this and we can tell it by the weight—on the way to the station he said "I have known you many years; you are very hard with me; if I had known it was your coffee I would not have bought it"—at the station he said "Two men brought the coffee in at 6 o'clock, and if I had known it was your coffee I would not have bought it"—he said he was to pay 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound for it—the value is over 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the one and about 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known him about 23 years—I went to his place to ask for some money for some goods we had bought together and which he had sold—there were other sacks—there is only the one room—he gave me a sample and told me the weight—it was over an hour after when I returned with Lawley—the coffee was still there, and I pointed the bags out to him—he knew Lawley, and handed the coffee to him—it is not usual to have coffee left without the bags, but it is done—I do not have my bags back, and do not charge for them—I am in partnership as Churchill, Potter, and Co.—Mr. Churchill has gone to America—I said at the police-court "I parted with Mr. Churchill; he has no residence in London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Churchill has gone abroad</hi>; I do not correspond with him"—Churchill has been away some time, and was not at my place the day before this—I have not bought any coffee lately—I may have said at the police-court "I have no invoice for this coffee; I bought the coffee from different persons; I cannot say where I got this P. berry from; I do not wish to give the names of my principals"—these coffees are the result of siftings—I recog<lb></lb>nised the coffee by the weight and appearance—I knew Mr. Murcot Roy-ne tried to defraud me out of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he was my landlord—I was not at Whitechapel County Court in connection with a cheque for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was sued at Clerkenwell County Court for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a cheque for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. alleged to have been given to me in mistake for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and judgment was given for the plaintiff—that judgment has never been satisfied.</p>

I went with Mr. Potter on 3rd July, about 1 o'clock, to the prisoner's shop, 17, King Street, Tower Hill—he went in first and afterwards pointed to two bags and said, "Those are the two bags of coffee that were stolen from my office last night"—Hall said, "Oh; if they are yours you had better take them away"—Mr. Porter said, "Cannot you give me any account?"—he said, "I have had them in my place for a week"—I then said to him, knowing him well, "Cannot you give me any account how you became possessed of these?"—he said, "No, I cannot"—he produced this invoice and said, "Yes, I can account for them"—I saw that it related to four other bags of coffee which were standing in the front of the shop and I said, "We can very soon clear this up by going</p>

               <p>to Macgregor's"—he said, "It is no use you going there, Lawley, I will tell you the truth. Last night about 8 o'clock two men came into my shop with the coffee and asked me to buy it for 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound; they have left it here. They were here this morning, and are coming again at two for the money"—I said, "Are those the bags they brought it in?"—he said, "No, they emptied it out of the bags and took the bags away"—I said, "Do you know these men?"—he said, "One man's name is Rawlinson, the other I only know by sight"—I said, "Can you tell me where to find Rawlinson?"—he said, "No, I do not know now. He used to live down Cable Street"—we waited there from 1 till 3—I then said to Mr. Porter, "What shall you do?" and he gave Hall in custody—on the way to the station he said to Mr. Porter, "You have known me many years. These are rather harsh proceedings you are taking against me; had I known the coffee was yours, I would not have bought it"—I have searched for Rawlinson and find that he has been away 3 years from the address mentioned.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I bought them yesterday"—he said, "I only know the other man by sight, but he has been in my shop before"—a man named Hurrell was in and out during the con<lb></lb>versation—Hurrell's name was over the door—I do not know Churchill Ann Watson. Mr. Porter is my tenant—on Tuesday evening, 29th July, I saw two men leave the premises each carrying a large bag, the same shape and size as those produced—I cannot tell if they are the same bags—I did not see Mr. Porter go out.</p>

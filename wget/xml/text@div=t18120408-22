On Saturday April the 4th, I mentioned my suspicion to the partners, I had an opportunity on Saturday night of detecting the prisoner. Before I went into the cellar the prisoner was in the cellar, I called the prisoner up, and sent him with a bag which was standing about the cellar into another part of the warehouse, with a view of going down into the cellar myself. I went into the cellar and concealed myself behind a cask, and presently the prisoner came into the cellar and took two or three bottles off a shelf in the cellar, I supposed them to be castor oil, it was from a place where there ought to be nothing but castor oil. When he had taken them from a shelf he wrapped them up in paper and then put them into his breeches, he left a lamp standing upon a cask, and came up stairs in the dark, and I remained on the premises until eight o'clock. When the prisoner had gone about twenty yards from the door an officer secured him, which we had procured for the purpose, he was taken to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. No. I did not. I observed that he walked very wide and stradling; I walked close behind him for about ten yards further, then I laid hold of him and asked him what he had got about him, he said nothing, what did I want with him; I told him I was an officer, and insisted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080019"></xptr> upon searching him; I put my hand between his legs, then he began to make some resistance; I told him I would knock him down if he took any thing out of his pocket; he was putting his hand into his breeches; I then took from his breeches three bottles, I asked him what it was; he said, oil; I asked him if he was not a porter in some house; he said, no, he was a jobbing porter in the street. I secured him and took him into the watchhouse; I further searched him, and only found his wages which he had received. I took him to the Compter, I there asked him where he lived, he said in Old-street-road; I then went to his lodgings in Draper's-buildings, No. 21, Old-street-road; I there saw his wife, I asked her leave to search the place; I found this quantity of soap of different descriptions, and a piece of rhubarb, and this roll of oil-skin. These are the three bottles that I took from his person, I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. What soap is it - A. Castile soap.</p>

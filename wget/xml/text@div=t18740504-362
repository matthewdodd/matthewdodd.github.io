                  </hi>. I am a labourer and live at 64, High Street, Woolwich—on Tuesday, 21st August, about 12.20, I was walking in High Street, Woolwhich—I had left off work about 8 o'clock—I met with a sol<lb></lb>dier I knew, and went into the Roebuck and had half a pint of beer with him—I had had a pot or two, but I was as sober as I am now—as I was passing by a place called Meeting House Lane in the High Street, the prisoner Clark cams out from a corner, seized me by the throat and said</p>

               <p>"You b----old <hi rend="italic">sod</hi>, have you <hi rend="italic">got</hi> any money?" and down I went on my back, he still holding on by my throat—whilst he was doing that Jordan came and kicked me on my side, put his knee on the top of me and took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a little bag out of my pocket—I had 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my trowsers pocket and he said "Turn the b----old <hi rend="italic">sod</hi> over, he has got something in his trousers pocket"—at that time footsteps were heard, and they ran away down Meeting House Lane—I gave information at the station, and on the Saturday I went there and saw the prisoners placed with other men and I picked them out—I am certain they are the men, I could swear to them if they had been with all Woolwich.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jordan.</hi> Is it likely I should rob a man that lives next door to me?

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 238). I was with Inspector Phillips and apprehended Clark on the morning of the 21st April—he was in com<lb></lb>pany with Jordan—I took him to the station—he was put with other men, and the prosecutor identified him—the prosecutor was taken into the inspector's room, all the blinds were drawn down, and four men were taken in who very nearly matched with the prisoners, and the prisoners were allowed to select their own position, and the prosecutor came and pointed them both out.</p>

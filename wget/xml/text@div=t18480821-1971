                  </hi>. I am in the service of a lady who lives in Eaton-street, in the dwelling-house of Mr. Hutt, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. On 14th Aug., between two and three o'clock, I went out, leaving the street-door shut—I came back, and found it about a quarter of a yard open—I put my hand against it—it was pushed against me—I pushed again—it was opened, and I saw the prisoners on the mat in the passage—I had never seen them before—Leach said, "It is all right, you may come in"—I asked what he meant, and what business he had there—I took hold of them both, and called out, "Thieves!" and for Mr. Hutt—they tried to get away, and pulled me into the street—Graham struck me a severe blow, and they got away, and went towards Hyde-park-corner—they parted at the top of the street—I followed Graham—a gentleman took him—I gave him in charge—I never lost sight of him—I went back to the house—the door opens with a latch-key—I missed all the plate from the table, which was laid ready for dinner—I had left six people in the house—they were all there when I came back—there was no one in the parlour when I left.</p>

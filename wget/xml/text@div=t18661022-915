Mr. Neal said, "Yes, they are quite ready"—the prisoner spoke to the other man in a foreign language—Mr. Neal passed round the counter, and got this press and die and counterpart as it now appears—it is an octagonal die—the prisoner and Claramont examined it, and the</p>

               <p>prisoner said that it would do very well—Mr. Neal said to the prisoner, "Here is your screwdriver, for which I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and gave it him—Mr. Neal did the press up with the die, and Claramont took possession of it, and took some money from his pocket, which he laid on the counter, and the prisoner shoved it up to Mr. Neal, who took it—they then turned round to leave and bade Mr. Neal good afternoon—the prisoner said that he should call again on Monday or Tuesday, and give further orders—I was all this time in the back parlour—I could not hear every<lb></lb>thing that passed—I left the shop two minutes after them, and found the prisoner, the two officers, and Claramont outside—I followed them to Tysoe Street, Wilmington Square, Clerkenwell, where they both went into Mr. Manuel's, a brassfounder—they were in there a minute and a half or two minutes—I was going in and met them coming out—I walked in front of them to Farringdon Road, and the two officers were behind them—the prisoner and Claramont walked arm in arm—on arriving at the corner of Calthorpe Terrace, Farringdon Road, finding they were close to me, I turned round and said, "I am a police inspector, and those are two police officers," pointing to the officers behind them—the prisoner said, "Oh! my God, it is a bad job"—I told them I should charge them with being concerned with a man in custody in committing frauds on the Spanish government—the other two officers took the prisoners, and I took this press (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from under Claramont's arm—he re<lb></lb>sisted, I called the assistance of some gentlemen passing, and then ordered the constables to search the prisoner—I searched Claramont, and found in his coat pocket this round die and the counterpart, one on steel and the other on copper, this pocket-book, containing a large portion of a genuine Spanish note with the signature torn off, this envelope, on which are the impressions of the two dies, the round die and the octagonal one, a number of letters, some Bank of England notes, and some gold, which has been given up to him—I afterwards went to 91, Guildford Street, Russell Square—I had previously seen the prisoner and Claramont go in and out there—the landlady showed me a bedroom there, in which I found a portmanteau containing this type case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found some brass figures which fit into the type case, and will make figures similar to these large figures on the genuine note—I have tried them—I also found in a book in his box this piece of paper, with some figures impressed upon it in dirty blue ink.</p>

I gave Mr. Neal instructions in September, and with another constable watched his shop, 19, Perceval Street—on 24th September I went into the shop—Knowles remained out-side—I went into the back parlour, and while I was there the prisoner came in with Claramont—it was then a few minutes past three—I heard what passed—the prisoner said to Mr. Neal, "Good afternoon"—they went into the shop, and said, "Is the die as nigh like the note?"—Mr. Neal said that he believed it was—the prisoner then asked Mr. Neal the price of a press—I could not catch the price—he then asked the scale of it—Mr. Neal said, "15lbs." (the scale is the pressure)—the prisoner asked if that would be sufficient pressure—Mr. Neal said that he believed that it would—the prisoner said, "I suppose this one will be more money?"—Mr. Neal said, "Yes; 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more"—when they left I followed them into Guildford Street, where they joined a man not in custody, and when close to the doorstep of No. 91 I saw the prisoner put what I believe to be a die into the other man's hand—it was not wrapped up—the other man looked at it, and the prisoner said, "It is done very nicely"—they all went into No. 91, and remained there some time—the prisoner and the third man then came out, and went to No. 3, Guildford Place, where I left them—on Saturday, 29th September, Knowles and I were standing outside Neal's shop, when Potter went in—I saw the prisoner and Claramont go in about three o'clock, and saw them come out—Potter came out after them—I followed them to Mr. Manuel's, in Tysoe Street—they came out again, and went to Farringdon Road, where I took the prisoner—he said, "My God, it is a bad job, I am only an interpreter"—I searched him at the station, and found a complete note for 200 <hi rend="italic">reals</hi>—this wood engraving, with the name of Manuel Losada, was in his waistcoat pocket, and two pieces of a note, the filagree outside part—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the third piece, containing the name of Manuel Losada—those three pieces were all in the prisoner's pocket-book—I also found a bill, "Received 22nd September, 1866, of Mr. A.

                  </hi>. I am a die-sinker, of No. 19, Perceval Street, Clerken<lb></lb>well—on 17th September the prisoner came there—I asked him into the counting-house—he produced something like a note, and asked me if I could engrave a die or stamp the same that was on the note—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said that I could, but complained of its being rather an imperfect impression—he said, "If you hold it to the window and look on the other side you will see better." (That was looking at the reverse side). "If you use a strong glass you will be able to see"—he then asked the price, and I think I told him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said it was rather dear, and I agreed to do it for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he wanted it in two or three days—I said I could not do it in the time, and promised to get it done on the Monday following—he said he could not wait so long, and I agreed to get it done by Friday, by four o'clock—he then left—I saw two stamps on the note, and asked him if he required the second—he said, no, they would only require the one—it was plural, either "We" or "They"—I asked him if he required a press—he said, "No"—I put myself into communication with the police, and what I did afterwards I did under their directions—the prisoner came again on the Friday, and asked me if the stamp was done—I said, "No"—he brought out another note, and told me he wanted the round stamp engraved—he gave me a small piece of paper of the size of the round stamp, and the letters round it—that was for the size—I suppose he thought the impression imperfect, but he did not say so—this lettering was round it when he gave it to me: "Eliz. II. Dei Grat. Hispan. Regina"—the second note was produced, and he asked me which note I should require—I went to the light to look, and said I thought I had better have the two, the impression of one being perfect on one side, and the other on the other side—he asked the price of several presses, and picked up a very small one, and asked if I thought that would do—I told him the power was not sufficient, and showed him a large fly press, but he said that was too much, and took too much room, as he wanted it to put it in a box to send it abroad—I ultimately sold him the press at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with the die and counterpart all complete—he brought out a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and said he would pay me first—I gave him the change—he asked me if I could do wood engraving—I said no; but I had a brother-in-law in that line, and I gave him the addresses of several parties—I agreed to get the first stamping press ready by Monday, the octagonal one—he paid me for the press and die, but did not take them away—Ranger came to my place, by arrangement, on 24th September—the things were to be ready between three and four o'clock that day—I put him into a back parlour, and the prisoner and Claramont came about four o'clock—that was the first time I had seen Claramont—the prisoner asked me if the die was done, but previously to that he had given me his address as B. Claramont, Guildford Place, Russell Square—I do not know the number—he gave me that address in writing—I gave him a pen and ink, and he wrote it down—I do not know where it is—they had to wait ten minutes, as the press was not quite finished—I then took an impression of the die by the press which had been purchased, and showed it to them—I then gave him the notes to</p>

I live at 63, Newman Street, Oxford Street, and am in partnership with Mr. Deane—on 12th September Claramont came, Rodriguez spoke to me, handed me a note, and asked me if I could engrave the whole of it—I said, "No, not the whole of it; you will have to go to a diesinker and a seal cutter to get the dies engraved for the stamps and impressions; I can engrave the note, but not the dies on it," and that I would let him know about it in a day or two—they both left, and a day or two afterwards the prisoner came by himself—he said that there were some numbers on the note, and he wanted to get them done to stamp them on—I said that he must have a tracing—he asked me to give him a tracing, which I did, and he said that it would do—he asked me the price—I told him I could not let him know then, but I would to-morrow or the day after—I ultimately decided on having nothing to do with it—I did not see the prisoner again—he did not come to learn my determination—he had left his address, 3, Guildford Place, with me, and I sent the note back there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wood engraver, of 42, Acton Street, Gray's Inn Road—on 25th September the prisoner called on me, and pro<lb></lb>duced this piece of paper with a signature on it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he asked me if I could engrave it by foreign post-time next day—I said that I could—he left it with me—he did not come next night, but the next morning—I had got this block ready (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he asked me how much it would be—I said, "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he paid for it and left—I gave him an India proof, which he took away—he came to me the same afternoon and brought the block and the proof, which was pencilled in three places—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that he should require it to be done again with the pencil alterations, because he wanted it exactly like the original—I said that I would do it—it was to be ready by post-time the following day—he left the proof and block with me, and next day I made this fresh engraving on another block—he called about seven o'clock—I showed him a proof, he examined it very minutely with the original, and said he thought there were two letters which wanted the least shaving taken off—I looked at them, I had not noticed the deviation before—I took a shaving off in his presence, and then gave him the new engraving and kept the old one and the pencil proof—I did not charge anything for the second block, as the first was not so correct as it ought to have been.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Manual, a type-founder, of 19, Tysoe Street, Clerkenwell—on 15th September the prisoner called there and showed me two pieces of tracing paper with figures drawn on them—he asked me if I could cut some figures exactly the same—I said yes, we had some already in stock in cast brass—he said that he was afraid they would not do, as he wanted them executed like the pattern—I showed them to him—he placed them together and said that there was not the same distance between the figures as there was in the pattern—I told him I would cut him some—he told me to cut five of each, and the figures 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 0—I asked him if I should cut the 4, 6, and 7—he said no, he would bring me the pattern for those—he mentioned a type case, but did not give me the order then—the order was to be executed on the next Wednesday—he called on Wednesday or Thursday, and I said that they were not ready, but I would do them next week—he called on the following Monday, they were not done, and he asked when he should have them for certain—I said on Friday—he said that they were for a shipping order, or were going abroad—he then showed me two pieces of tracing paper, with the letters B and J J on one, and Y and V on the other, and asked me to cut them exactly the same as the pattern, but on longer brass than ordinary, as he wanted them to place in a handle—he also ordered a type case to hold six of the figures—I pro<lb></lb>mised him that they should all be ready for certain on Friday night—he called on Friday about half-past seven, and asked me if they were done—I said that they were—the shop was shut, and he came through the side door—I gave them to him, and asked him what name I should make the invoice out in—he said "Claramont"—I did so, and he gave me the money—he then noticed that the V on one of the little letters was a little shorter than the other—I looked at it and saw that it was so—I told him I would alter it for him the following day at five o'clock—he then left—I have got some of the letters I made in accordance with the tracing—the type figures I made would make similar figures to these on the note—this letter B corresponds with the B on the torn note.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 91, Guildford Street, which is a private hotel for Spaniards—on 8th September Claramont came to live there—he had a bedroom there, and used the common room for his meals—that bed-room was the one the police searched—while he was there I saw the prisoner nearly every day; he always saw Claramont—Claramont does not speak English, and the prisoner very little.</p>

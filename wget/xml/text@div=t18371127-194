                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Lay ton, in Essex. I had a large quantity of hay in my rick-yard—from information I received I was induced to suppose some was removed—I accompanied an officer and ano<lb></lb>ther person to the prisoner's premises—we went across some fields and saw hay scattered, and footmarks were traced to the prisoner's, where this hay was—I went to the owner, John Clare—he came and opened the shed, and let us go in—there are samples of the hay here—I can identify one, it is thatched with rye straw, and the bottom was bean straw, and it is mixed—there is not another farmer in Essex that has the two mixed to<lb></lb>gether—the prisoners live together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse-patrol. I accompanied the prosecutor to the prisoners' premises—I observed hay scattered in different directions to that in which we went in the field—there is a foot-path from the pri<lb></lb>soners' house to the barn—the hay was scattered in a direction from the barn towards Mr. Tyler's farm—I found three bundles of hay on Clare's premises, which weighed about 133lbs.—the shed appeared to have been done up in the usual way—it was not locked when I got there—there was a padlock on the door.</p>

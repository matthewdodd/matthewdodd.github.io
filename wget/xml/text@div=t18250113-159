On the 10th of January, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, Connor and Smith came into our shop - Maloney was standing outside the window - Connor asked to see some seals; I showed her five - Smith was by her side, and said they were too dear; they were about 18 s. or a guinea each - Connor then asked me to let her go backwards; she went into the back parlour - I went with her, and left Smith in the shop; my mother was standing by the parlour-door - I asked her to look to the shop, when I going into the parlour - Maloney came into the shop, and said to Smith and Connor,</p>
               <p>"What a time you are, are you not coming?" Connor staid backward, about three minutes - they then said the seals were too dear, and they would go outside and point to some which might suit them - Maloney pointed to a seal in the window; they then went to the further end of the window, and then ran away - I am quite certain they ran off, they did not walk - I had some rings in a glass case on the counter, five minutes before; as soon as the prisoners ran away, my mother came into the shop, and said</p>
               <p>"I think those girls are thieves" - I then saw the door of the glass-case open - I had not opened it, while they were there, and no person could have opened it, but the prisoners - I missed a case from it, containing twelve rings, which cost my father upwards of 20 l. - I ran round the corner, and saw the girls all running together - I ran after them; a gentleman was passing, whom I requested to assist me; we went into Warwick-street, and they were walking very slowly - I said,</p>
               <p>"If we walk slowly, we shall take them" - we came up to them, and I said</p>
               <p>"You have stolen a case of rings" - Connor said</p>
               <p>"I have not" - I saw her endeavouring to secrete something under her stocking; she had seven rings in her hand - they had thrown the case into the road, at the corner of Warwick-street - when I got home, we found two rings in the shop, which were dropped - Connor was searched at Bow-street, and one was found down her clothes; two of them are entirely lost - I am sure the ten which are found, were taken from the glass case - Maloney escaped, but she was taken the next day - I am sure she was one of the three - I described her to five or six officers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor at Rotherham—I have a partner, and we were solicitors for Mr. Brecknell in the suit of Davies <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Brecknell—I attended the trial in March, 1872—the defendant appeared as a witness on his own behalf—the oath was administered to him in the ordinary way—he was asked whether in the month of October 1869, he had ever been to the office of Mr. Coward with Mrs. Bailey—he said "I never went with her"—Mrs. Bailey was the lady who made the will—he said he never went at any time—he was asked whether he had been to Mr. Coward's office or not and he said he had not been there—Mr. Coward is a well-known attorney at Rotherham; he has been in practice I should think thirty-five years—he also denied that he gave any instructions about the will to Mr. Coward—the verdict was for the then plaintiff, the present defendant—after the case for the defendant was closed, a witness was called in reply, and there was no opportunity of answering that witness—Mr. Coward and his two clerks gave evidence at the trial in March, 1872—an application was made for a new trial and refused—the property was small, and that was the reason the application was refused—there was a caveat entered after the refusal; it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230009"></xptr>
               <p>was discharged—we entered the caveat, although the verdict was for the present defendant—the costs were refused.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My partner and I have been concerned in this matter from the very first, instructed by Mr. Brecknell, against whom the verdict passed—he is now prosecuting this case—at the first trial Mr. Coward did not arrive in time to be examined—the Jury were discharged without a verdict—the matter was re-tried in March, 1872—and then Mr. Coward was there and was examined, and also his two clerks—the Jury found a verdict upholding the will, but to the surprise of every one in Court—the caveat which was entered by me subsequently was discharged by Lord Penzance—I was not there on that occasion, but I was surprised at that—no other caveat was entered after that—I was not in Court when the motion for a new trial was refused—no doubt that refusal surprised me as much as the verdict of the Jury—I felt some disappointment, as most solicitors would do—Mr. Redhead was acting on behalf of a son of Mr. Brecknell—I believe Mr. Bedhead entered a caveat—he is an occasional agent of mine—I pre<lb></lb>ferred a charge against the defendant of perjury before Mr. Arnold at the Westminster Police Court—that was in July—I obtained a summons from Mr. Arnold against Davis for perjury—previous to that two attempts had been made to obtain summonses from the justices in Yorkshire—we applied for summonses before the Magistrates at Rotherham—they refused because they thought they had no right to interfere—that was for perjury—the case was inquired into before Mr. Arnold, and Mr. Arnold refused to commit him, and then under the Vexatious Indictment Act, we preferred this in<lb></lb>dictment; that followed as a sequence—since Mr. Arnold refused to commit the prosecutor has executed a bill of sale—I object to say whether I have received any money from Mr. Brecknell—he is my client—he is here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Rotherham—I am clerk to Mr. Coward, solicitor, of that place—the defendant called at our office in October, 1869, and I have seen him several times since—when he called in October, Mrs. Bailey was with him—Mr. Hoyland, an articled clerk, was also present—Mr. Coward was up stairs in his own room—it would be about the middle of October—Mr. Coward was engaged with a gentleman, and the defendant and Miss. Bailey remained in the office for about twenty minutes or half-an-hour before I went up to Mr. Coward—I had a good opportunity of seeing them during that time—the other clerk was there part of the time—after the gentleman had gone I fetched Mr. Coward down as the old lady was not able to walk up stairs; she was very feeble—Mr. Coward came down and asked their business—Davis said "She has come to make her will; she is to leave all her property to me, and I am to take care of her as long as she lives"—Mr. Coward then asked her whether she had any relations—she made no reply—Davis said she had some relations, but they lived some distance away—Mr. Coward said she was in such an imbecile state that he should decline to make her will; they then left the office—the old lady did not speak at all; she was asked questions, but she appeared to be in a</p>

               <p>perfectly helpless, imbecile state, quite unconscious of anything—it was between 1 and 2 o'clock in the day when they came—the whole con<lb></lb>versation took place in my presence—Hoyland heard part, but he went away to his dinner before they left—I have no doubt that the prisoner is the man that came—I never saw either of them before—I saw Davis again at the first trial in Westminster Hall, in February, 1871—when he was at the office he said "I live at Masboro'"—I was present at the trial, but I did not hear him examined—I was not in Court—I have not heard where he lives—he gave his address as Masboro'—he did not say where the old lady lived—I have no interest in this matter—I was merely subpoenaed to prove these facts as the attorney's clerk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined at the trial—I was never asked the question with reference to the defendant having said that he resided at Masboro'—I was examined at the Police Court before Mr. Arnold, but the question was not put to me there—this is the first time I have stated it—I never saw Mr. Davis till I saw him at the office in October, 1869, and I did not see him again till 1871, at Westminster—he described where the property was—it was about the middle of October when they came, it would be before the 21st—I have not heard that Mr. Coward fixed the date as a particular day when one of his articled clerks went to Leeds for the purpose of having his preliminary examination—I came up to London on both trials—I did not hear a person named Salmon examined on the second trial—I saw him there—I know to whom you refer—he was a client of Mr. Coward's—he had been to Mr. Coward's on one or two occasions—I was asked whether he had ever been to Mr. Coward's office, and I said he had been on other business—I was not asked whether I had made a mistake, and that the person who brought the old lady was Salmon, and not the defendant—Salmon was brought into Court, and I was asked whether I had seen him before, and I said yes, that I knew him well—Davis was not asked to stand up—I was asked whether I had seen Davis, and I said "Yes," but he was not put up in the Court before me—Mr. Coward came down to the office to see the prisoner and the old lady—Hoyland was there when Mr. Coward came down—the old lady seemed unable to speak, and to all appearance unconscious—she did not reply to any questions.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The clerk would have made an entry if any business had been transacted—I believe the man said his name was Davis—I heard no other name; except that the name of Davis was made use of, my mind is a blank—I asked the parties who they were, the man answered "Her name is Mrs. Bailey, and my name is Davis"—Williams, Mr. Hoyland, and I another think clerk were there—Mr. Hoyland is here—the other clerk is not, that I know of—this matter was not called to my attention in any shape or form for eighteen months afterwards—I did not say that it occurred on a day when my clerk went to Leeds to pass his examination—I did not get to the Court in time at the first trial—I arrived just as Lord Penzance had commenced summing-up—the Jury retired to deliberate, and during that time I was in conversation with some of the counsel, and Dr. Tristram asked me if I thought I could fix the date, and I said it was some time about when Mr. Hoyland was going up for his examination—I have not since found out that that was on 28th October—I have not investigated the case at all—I was in time for the second trial, and I was also before the Magistrate.</p>

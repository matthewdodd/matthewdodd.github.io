                  </hi> I am delivery foreman at the wool warehouse in the London Dock. On the 26th Feb., forty-two bales of wool were to be delivered to Kenworthy's wagon—the prisoner was labourer there, and it was his duty to pass the wool out of that warehouse to Leonard, who loaded the wagon—the prisoner was in the werehouse—it was his duty to hand it out of the loop-hole, and Leonard's duty to receive it, and place it in the wagon—I received information that the delivery was complete, just before twelve o'clock, and gave the ordinary note to Leonard to go to another party, from whom he would get the necessary pass, to pass out of the Docks—I saw Joiner with another wagon of Kenworthy's, drive up to the wagon which was being loaded.</p>

                  </hi> I am an extra labourer in the London Docks. On 26th Feb. I was employed in the spice warehouse, which is directly opposite the wool warehouse—about twelve o'clock I saw one of Kenworthy's wagons under the loop-hole of the wool warehouse—I believed the top table were level with the loop-hole—I saw a man with the wagon, I did not know his name—I saw Pottle step from the loop-hole to the wagon—he took off a woollen cover cloth, and took it on to the floor of the warehouse—the man who was standing on the bales looked round, two or three times, to the gate where the constables stand, and then he beckoned to Pottle—Pottle stood about half a minute, and he went behind the loop-hole, took out a bag, and gave it to the man on the wagon—the bag was a kind of corn sack, and after the sack was put on the wagon, the woolen covering was thrown on the sack by Pottle—I</p>

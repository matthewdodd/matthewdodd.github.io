                  </hi>. I am inspector in the Lord Chamberlain's department, at the palaces—Earl Delawarr is the Lord Chamberlain—I have known the female prisoners for fourteen or fifteen years, in Her Majesty's establishment—Elizabeth was a servant in the linen department, and Ellen was a house<lb></lb>maid in the palace all that time—Elizabeth had charge of the linen in the Lord Chamberlain's department, to send it to the wash, and deliver it out to the parties requiring it in the establishment—Ellen had to do the housemaid's duties, but resided in the same apartment as her sister—I saw the articles stated in the indictment at the house of Mr. M'Nair, in Eaton-place.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 25, Upper Eaton-street, and am a servant out of employ. The male prisoner Dr. Lindsay lodged at my house upwards of five months—I have seen both the females visiting him there at times; not all the time he was there, but between two and three months—Ellen visited him more frequently than Elizabeth—they usually came in the evening, except on Sundays; they sometimes then came to tea with their brother—I never observed them bring anything—I have been in James Lind<lb></lb>say's room when he was away—when he first came he had a very small quan<lb></lb>tity of linen, no more than a gentleman would usually have—after he had been there some time I observed a great change; he had new linen, such as sheeting, towelling, and things of that description—I had observed nothing but gentlemen's linen previously—the only thing I particularly noticed was</p>

               <p>a counterpane marked "V. R., 1840"—I saw a corded box brought by a carrier—I saw the counterpane marked "V. R." after that box was brought—an intimation was given that Dr. Lindsay was about to leave, about three weeks previous to his leaving, but no regular notice; it was that he would leave at the latter end of May, or beginning of June—on the 21st of May I saw a cart stop at my house, and two large boxes were taken away-Dr. Lindsay was present when they were put in—I was coming down stairs, and he was on the stairs seeing the boxes put into the cart—he said he was taking the boxes away out of our way—the cart went to Mr. M'Nair's, No. 9, Bel<lb></lb>grave-street South—it stopped previously at No. 17, Lower Eaton-street, and left two smaller boxes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they locked or unlocked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unlocked when I saw them—I opened the drawers, as I had suspicion things were being carried into the house clandestinely—the drawers were the only place the linen was in—I first looked into his drawers about two months back, or between two and three months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the A division of police. I am generally on duty at Buckingham palace—I had orders to go to Brimfield's house, and went on the 11th of May—Mr. Lindsay was out at the time—I went into his bed-room with Brimfield and saw a quantity of linen, counterpanes, and towels, which I afterwards saw at Mr. M'Nair's—I did not observe a mark on either of the counterpanes that day—the articles were in a chest of drawers—on the 22nd of May I went to Mr. M'Nair's, in Belgrave-street, with a search warrant, and found two large boxes there which I opened—they contained a variety of articles, linen, counterpanes, and blankets—I conveyed them to the Lord Chamberlain's office, Buckingham palace—they are here now—there was a counterpane marked "V. R." and a crown, a blanket with "W. R." and a crown, and a linen duster marked "V. R., 1839"—it appeared to have been marked with blue thread and picked out—the stain only is left—after con<lb></lb>veying the boxes to Mr. Saunders' I apprehended James Lindsay—he was about to say something—I cautioned him, and told him the charge—and he said he must communicate with his sisters—he said there Iras no pro<lb></lb>perty there belonging to the Queen—I told him there was a blanket, marked "W. R." and a crown—he then said he had charge of them for his sisters, whose perquisites they were, that he had nothing more to do with them—I searched his lodgings, and found a common plate, which I brought away—the words "Buckingham palace" are on it—I took him to the station-house, and had the plate with me—as I was conveying him there, he laid it was a paltry thing, could not I hide it—I afterwards apprehended the female prisoners—Elizabeth said, "What shall I do, can you give me any advice?"—which I declined—that is all she said—I produce the boxes—the counterpane appears new—the blanket has "W. R." and a crown on it—here is the duster, which has had "W. R." on it, but picked out—the blanket is an old one—here are other dusters and sheeting—there are eight blankets, five quilts, seven dozen and eight towels, four dozen and a half duster, and forty-two yards of sheeting—that is all that was in the boxes—the sheeting and dusters appear to be new, and some of the towels—on the 11th of May, when I went to Lindsay's lodgings, I saw articles of this description in the drawers—these appear to be the same—there were no fossils or books in the boxes at Mr. M'Nair's.</p>

I had occasion to resort to that linen from time to time to use when pressed for linen for the household; with respect to the four blankets now produced, they were given to me by the late Sir Thomas Marsh during the time of his late Majesty, they had been condemned as unfit for use; I told Sir Thomas Marsh they were little fit for use, that they might be used for ironing blankets, and he told me I might do with them what I pleased; with respect to the new linen produced, I took that to re-place the linen belonging to my sister which I had used at the palace. The counterpane marked "V. R." I know nothing of, I suppose my sister does; I was not aware that the duster which has been produced was among the linen. My mother died about fourteen years ago. When I speak of the need of linen, I mean that observa<lb></lb>tion to apply to Buckingham palace as well as St. James's palace, until the present time—I never mentioned to Mr. Saunders about using my own linen at any time.—The prisoner Ellen Lindsay says, 'I confirm what my sister has Said; the counterpane marked "V. R." I must have taken by mistake for my own counterpane. I know nothing about the duster. The plate I took to my brother's with a piece of pudding, and he has asked me once or twice to take it back, and I have neglected it.'—The prisoner James Lindsay says,' I always considered that the property which they brought to me was theirs; they told me so, and I took charge of it for a time for them.

                  </hi>. I am a housemaid at the palace. I do not know how many housemaids there are—it is our duty to receive the bed and other linen from Miss Lindsay—I have been employed there six years, and received linen from her during all that time, according as we want it—it depends on the number of visitors—I receive towels, dusters, sheets, and pillow-cases every day, and if company come we have more—I very frequently had dusters de<lb></lb>livered out without a mark—I cannot say about towels—I did not notice them—I frequently had dusters without a mark, sometimes one, two, or three out of a dozen, which we have at a time—they have not always been of the same kind—I have not had eight or ten in a week without a mark—they were returned to Miss Lindsay with the others—I receive about three dozen dusters in a week—it is according to the work—I may change eight one day, and six another—we take back the dirty, and get clean ones—there may be twenty housemaids—they all apply to Miss Lindsay for linen—she directs the change of linen—nobody but the housemaids and charwomen apply to her—all the housemaids draw chamber-towels—I may have had unmarked towels, and not noticed them, or sheets—I had an un<lb></lb>marked duster among a dozen, the week before last—I have noticed two, three, and four in a week—I have not applied for linen and not obtained it—I never wanted much.</p>

I drew towels and dusters from Miss Lindsay sometimes three dozen in a day—we have them every day—I have had both towels and dusters without marks—I had a towel about ten days ago—it has not occurred very often—I have sometimes had two or three out of three dozen—it often occurred during the three years, but I did not take particular notice till the last twelve months—I have had good ones unmarked—before that I have had old ones without marks repeatedly—I had one pillow-case unmarked—I have had sheets, but none unmarked, that I observed—I have</p>

During that time I have received linen from Miss Lindsay, and have noticed sheets, pillow-cases, towels, and dusters without the Queen's mark—it frequently happened at the latter part of the time—I may have had a dozen towels and dusters unmarked at a time, some pillow-cases and sheets—they have come every time linen came, which is every day.</p>

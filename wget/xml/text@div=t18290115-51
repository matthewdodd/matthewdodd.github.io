            . I am a surgeon's instrument maker. I was in Smithfield, heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw a man running out of the pens, and a mob pursuing him at a considerable distance, I suppose twenty yards - he gained ground considerably; I ran after him, and told him let him run as fast as he would, I would have him; and I caught him just beyond Hosier-lane; he had not got the coat then - he was the only person pursued; nobody was running before him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had he any coat when you saw him? A. No; Horton came up at the time I stopped him, and said, "That is the man who took my coat:" the prisoner said he was running after the thief.</p>

            . I am a drover. On Sunday night, the 21st of December, I heard the cry of Stop thief! in Smithfield; I was at work in the pens among the sheep, close by where the guard, and the man he was following, ran - he was pursuing only one man; I had seen nobody running before - I saw him following a man in a smock-frock; he came down close by the side of the gas-light, and jumped over the pales - no one was following the guard; the man got some distance before the guard got over the pales - it was a very moon-light night; I looked forward, and the man was gone - the guard must have lost sight of him; the prisoner is not that man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How far was the guard from the man in the smock-frock? A. The length of two pens; I am sure there was but one man, and he had a dirty smock-frock on - my attention was drawn by the man in the smock-frock calling Stop thief! and jumping over the pens; I never saw him before - I did not go after him nor try to take him; I was busy among the sheep, and could not get out of them - the man had got nothing; I did not point him out - I did not see him afterwards; the guard was as close to him as I was, and could see him - there was no other person running than the one in a smock-frock, who the guard was pursuing; I will swear that (not that I saw) I saw no other; and swear he was following no other; the prisoner was stopped nearly a quarter of a mile off; I was close against Cloth-fair, and he was stopped by Mr. Blacket's - I was two or three hundred yards from the Fortune of War public-house - I did not see the prisoner after he was stopped; I never saw him till to-night.</p>
               <p>Q.How then did you know he was the man they took? A. I heard Gardner, the officer, say they had stopped a man for stealing a coat off a coach - I did not go to see the prisoner, but I can swear he is not the man the guard was following; the man went through the bullock-pens, then through the sheep-pens again - the guard passed me; I did not speak to him - the man must have lain down in the pens while the guard passed, for I did not see him till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell the guard that was the man? A. The guard was a long way off - when he jumped over the pens he had gone by.</p>
               <p>Q. Who found you out to tell this story? A. Mr. Gardner was talking about having a man; I said, "If you have a man of that description, it is the wrong man, for he had a smock-frock on;" Gardner applied to me to come here -I have known him some time; he is an officer in the market- I never saw the transaction till the guard followed the man down the pens; I never saw the prisoner till to-night, and have no interest in this affair - I am in the service of Mr. Coleman, a drover; Gardner subpoenaed me to come here on Monday last.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH COLEMAN. I am a Smithfield drover - Painter has been in my brother's employ about twelve months; I was with him in the pens about half-past nine o'clock on this night, but not quite close to him (I have been in my brother's service for seventeen years - he lives at Holloway) -I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw two people running; I do not think the prisoner was either of them - I never saw him before to-night, to my knowledge; the person I saw running before the guard, had a smock-frock on - I cannot say whether the prosecutor is the person in pursuit; it was a tallish man - I am certain the man pursued, had a smockfrock on, when I saw him go by the gas-light - he went by where Painter was putting up some sheep; I saw nobody else running, not to know them - I was busy among the sheep, and did not join in the pursuit: I do not believe the prisoner to be the man - I have no interest in saying so.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. You never saw the man before who was running in a smock-frock? A. No, I was not close enough to see his face - I can only tell he is not the man, by his dress, and he appeared a very short man; I heard a cry of Stop thief! but never saw the man after he went round the pens; the guard kept following him, and was closer to him than I was.</p>
               <p>Q.Then he had a better opportunity of seeing whether he had a smock-frock on? A. I am certain he had one on- just as he passed me I heard the cry; I looked round, and saw two persons running, and one had a smock-frock on - I did not point him out; the guard was only pursuing one man - where he went to I do not know; he ran down the alley, and jumped over the pens at the bottom - the guard might be fifteen or twenty yards from him then, and must have seen him jump over; I did not appear before the Magistrate - I did not know a man was taken till Gardner told me of it a fortnight after: I heard no other cry of Stop thief! and did not hear of a lady having been robbed at the same place that night - Gardner served me with a subpoena to come here.</p>
               <p>- GARDNER. I am a Police officer. I served these witnesses with a subpoena last Monday: I never saw the prisoner in my life till the night he was taken, when I saw him in the watch-house; I had been out that afternoon, and as a party had tried to rob another coach, I went to look for them, and soon after that a lady was robbed - I was rather too late for that; I went into the King's Head public-house, sat down, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went out, and tried to stop the person - a hurdle laid in my way; I stambled over it, and a person took the prisoner before I could get up - I returned to the King's Head, and who should be there but Painter; he said, "Well, have you got the prisoner?" I said Yes - he said, "For stealing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150027"></xptr>the coat?" I said, "I don't know what it is for;" he said,"Well, I believe you have got the wrong person, for I was in the pens, and a person came running by me in a smockfrock, and a person pursuing him;" I then went to the watch-house, and said I believed they had got an innocent man - that I understood what was lost was a drab great coat, with two or three capes, and a certain party hid it in the sheep-pens, and some time after the guard was gone by, one of the party came and took it out of the pens, and ran up Cloth-fair; I stated what I had heard of the coat before I saw the guard, and when I saw him, he described it, and it answered the description - I went in pursuit of the party, who I knew, and one of whom has since been taken for felony, but is not committed - it was for stealing a handkerchief last Friday: I never saw the prisoner till he was in the watch-house - I have heard Painter's and Coleman's evidence; Painter told me the same he has stated here -Buckland, the attorney, applied to me, or I should not have been here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Then you know nothing about the actual fact? A. No; I did not go to the pens to look for the coat, because I was informed the party had taken it away before I heard of it, and I went to a certain house - the man's name was Mike Reid, a very bad character, a cad in Smithfield; I did not look after the coat for I was informed it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q.And you do your duty as an officer, when you are told property is moved, not to go and see if it be so? A. I followed the party who I was told had carried it away; I went to the prosecutor, and asked him to point out the way the thief had run, and he pointed out the same tract as Painter told me he had run; the place it was said to be hid in, was about one hundred yards from the public-house, but I followed the party to a house, and if I had gone to look for the coat I might have got there too late - I found a party at the house, and they were all in a flurry, but they had nothing; I have been an officer twelve months - Mr. Buckland came and asked if I would serve Painter and Coleman with subpoena's; I said I would, as I knew the public-house they frequented - I did not appear before the Magistrate next day; I was busy in the market, and was up till half-past twelve o'clock that night - I knew nothing of the transaction; I am a City officer appointed by the Lord Mayor; the description given to me answers the description of Mike Reid, who I knew before - I was told the party had just gone off with the coat, and went to look for him; Reid has been in custody since, but I did not know it till he was acquitted.</p>
               <p>HENRY HORTON. I did not see Painter or Coleman that night, not to notice them - my object was the prisoner; I followed him till he was taken, and never lost sight of him - I saw nobody dressed in a smock-frock; the man I pursued was not dressed in a smock-frock.</p>

About 5.40, on 19th October, I was in Cheapside—I saw the Great Eastern van standing at Thomas's ware-house—there was a horse and cart behind it—I saw the prisoner at the shafts of the van, held by the boy—the boy called me and said, "This man has been in my van"—the prisoner said, "I got in there to look for a mate of mine, named Joe "—I went behind the van, where the horse and cart was standing, and said, "Who does this belong to?"—the prisoner said, "That is mine; I stopped here to get in this van to look for my mate Joe"—I asked him where he had been, and who is master was—he said he worked for Mr. Pound, packing case maker, in Leadenhall Street, and that he had been to Jewin Street with some of Mr. Pound's goods, and that he was on his way back, down Cheapside, and saw the van standing there, and he get into it to see if Joe was there—he gave the name of John Bryan, 22 1/2, St. Mary Axe—I went there, but could find no such place as 22 1/2—I went to Mr. Pound the same evening—there was nothing but a mattrass in the cart at the time.</p>

I am a carman in the employ of the Great Eastern Railway Company—I loaded the van where the prisoner was caught—among other goods it contained a truss received from Arthur Kay &amp; Co., of Watling Street—it was going to Buckles—I put it into the van myself—I left Lee in charge of the van, in Cheapside, when I went into Messrs Thomas's warehouse—when I came out I found the truss had been shifted—there were a lot of people round—Lee said the prisoner had been on the shafts, and attempted to steal it—the prisoner said he knew Bob the driver—I had seen the prisoner in his cart—he followed us from Sweeting's up to Thomas's—I do not know him—my name is James, not <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>—the weight of the truss was about three-quarters of a hundredweight, and about 3 ft. long.</p>

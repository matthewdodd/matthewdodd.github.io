The prisoner was in my service for about seven weeks; she was going away on the Friday after the day in question - my wife and the other servant missed some articles; I went down stairs one night after the prisoner was gone to bed, and I found 1 lb. of moist sugar, in a napkin, marked D. No. 12; my wife made inquiry of the prisoner on the day following, and the Policeman was sent for in the evening - I went with him to the prisoner's bed-room to have her box searched; she produced the key of it - it was corded as well as locked; she opened it herself, and these two wine-glasses, the pound of sugar, this lace veil, these silk stockings, this towel, and this pinsfore of the children's, was found in it, and some handkerchiefs, and one or two other things of the other servant's, which were given up to her - this soap was also found; we had had 18 lbs. of soap in a day or two before, and it was all gone; I know these two wine-glasses.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I know this veil, stockings, and towel to be mine, and I believe the other articles are - I have missed such things; my stock of glasses is deficient by two - I believe this sugar is mine; we give 3 lbs. every week for the use of the kitchen, and there were only 2 lbs. left - we had a good character with the prisoner.</p>

As to the linen I can't pretend to know any thing of it; but there are three prints that I can be positive to. ( Three prints of the duke of Marlborough's battles produced in court.) These I know are my property.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were these prints found ?</p>
               <p>Dr. Stennett. I am not certain where, they were brought to my house.</p>

             left in trust in your house?</p>
               <p>Dr. Stennett. She was, but there were many goods lock'd up.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stennett. Last year about the 5th or 6th of May, upon the account of the Doctor's health, we went to the Bath, and the prisoner Paul had not been long in my service then; we left her in the house with the whole care of it, and put out the plate and other particular things. We staid longer than we intended, for going to our house in Wales we were detain'd, so that we did not come home till the begining of Oct. When we return'd I found her by herself. I did think of discharging her immediately, by reason of the extravagancy of her bills, but the Dr. desir'd I'd keep her a little longer. I had not been at home long before I missed a little linen, sheets, table cloths, napkins, and the like. I was very solicitous, and inquir'd of my own maid, and sometimes I suspected my own memory, thinking I might have misplaced things, rather than accuse her, for fear she should lose her character; I still missed more and more, for the robbery was not all done while I was out of town, but (as they have confessed) it was committed when we were out on a Sunday. I never knew what was become of the linen till some of it was brought to me, which I knew, because it was mark'd by me; Mr. Morris and Mr. Warburton gave us the first intelligence. I have missed much more, but have mentioned nothing in the indictment but what were brought back (a parcel of linen produced in court.) I am sure these are my property, all mark'd by myself, except one sheet. The first parcel was brought by Miss Overal, the second by Mr. Morris, and the third by Mrs. Tisey; here is in the last an under-petticoat, a breakfast cloth, and two towels; they had overlook'd one of them, and mark'd it for own, but here is my mark, an S upon it, was being in white silk they had not observed.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give Mary an' a good character?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stennett. I thought honest, and I gave her a character that I did not charge her with dishonestly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own she took the things away?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stennett. I heard her own before justice Fielding that the old woman took them out of the house, and she gave them to her.</p>
               <p>Q. In what words did she own first?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stennett. Justice Fielding who took these goods out of Dr. Stennett's house

I have known the prisoner upwards of 5 years, she had nursed my wife in 2 or 3 lyings-in; during which time I thought her honest, and not suspecting the truth of what she had told me, I purchased the linen, which consisted of 2 odd sheets, a night shirt and dresser cloth, for which I gave 16 shillings.</p>

In Nov. following she brought some more linen, which she said came from the same place, consisting of 2 shirts, a damask table cloth, and 3 damask napkins; for this parcel she asked more than my wife was willing to give; she said the price was set upon them by the owner. She carried them away, and in about 2 or 3 days after she brought them again, and said the person was contented to take the price offer'd, which was 22 s. 6 d. so I paid for them, and to my great surprise, about two months ago, the servant maid who liv'd with me at that time, and with whom all the three prisoners were acquainted, came and inform'd me that the linen I had purchased was stolen from out of the house of Dr. Stennett.</p>

I look'd them over, and said I was not a judge of them, but I would send them to a friend that was. I had them 2 or 3 days; she asked me 16 s. for them; my friend valued them at 15 s. After that she sent her daughter Ann, whom I told they were valued at 15 s. She said she dare say the person whose they were would not stand for a shilling.

               <p>MR. CLARKSON conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF RIPON. I am a <rs id="t18330704-94-viclabel474" type="occupation">Privy-Counsellor</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18330704-94-victim927 t18330704-94-viclabel474"></join>. In September 1830 the prisoner came into my service as <rs id="t18330704-94-deflabel475" type="occupation">butler</rs>

               <p>COURT. Q. Am I to understand, that antecedent to the application of Pullen for payment of that bill, that that book was in your Lordship's possession? A. It was not put into my hands by the prisoner, but was found in the butler's pantry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe that book was left behind by the prisoner in your Lordship's house? A. It was - I did not find it, but I understood it was locked up in a cupboard, in which he kept other things belonging to me; I asked him on Monday morning, the 25th of March, for these books, telling him I wished to examine all the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040078"></xptr>bills and accounts, but he did not bring them to me, and, in fact he absented himself from my house from that time, except for one or two very short intervals on that day - on a subsequent occasion, he came to my house for the purpose of making up his accounts, and by mistake he was not permitted to enter - after what took place before the Magistrate in March, those things which were belonging to the prisoner, in my house, were by his own consent sold, and the proceeds were handed to my steward, they produced £61 12s. - my belief of this receipt being in the prisoner's handwriting, is founded on a perfect knowledge of his handwriting, which I have seen for two years and a half, - corroborated by the spelling of this name being similar - when I opened this book and saw this receipt, my expression was, "This receipt is a forgery in his handwriting" - I should have believed it to be his handwriting, if these words which are misspelt, had not come under my notice.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the amount of the prisoner's deficiency, at the time your lordship received the sum you have stated from the sale of his effects? A. I conceive not less than £200.</p>

            . I was in the habit of supplying the family of the Earl of Ripon with fruit and vegetables - I knew the prisoner as steward there - this receipt is not my writing, nor is it my name, it is Pullan not Pullen - these small books are what I used to keep accounts in; in July last, his Lordship was indebted to me £10 18s. 5d. and £19 2s. 10d. for fruit and vegetables - I did not receive that money at all in July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this small book in your handwriting? A. No, my son's; I am but an indifferent scholar - my son gives receipts occasionally for me - he is not here - he never authorises other persons to give receipts for me, and he never gives receipts in my absence.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is this receipt your son's writing? A. No Sir, nor any one belonging to me - I never authorised the prisoner to give receipts in my name - my son would have attended here if he had been desired.(The receipt was here put in and read. See Indictment.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time I was in Lord Goderich's service I was deputed to be house-steward, and was employed to market in the best manner I could - I believe it is customary for noblemen to advance money in such cases, but I never had it; though I believe his Lordship would have given it me - I certainly employed Mr. Pullen as greengrocer, but previous to him I had employed Gosling, a greengrocer in Covent-garden market- he had transactions with me for twelve months, and I paid him up to about nine or ten months of his leaving us- Lady Goderich desired me to call in his account, which I did in a book similar to this one; I believe that book remained in her ladyship's hands for some time before it was settled; and I believe there was a greater account due to Gosling when he was paid; he presented me that account, but whether I presented it to Lady Goderich or not I cannot say, but I paid the amount, and never charged Lord Goderich a shilling for it; but it is in this book - I next paid an account of a greengrocer at Charing-cross, the name I cannot tell, but the amount was 3l. odd shillings; and these circumstances involved me very materially; I should no doubt by means of my friends, have had the power to exonerate myself, but I was not allowed that indulgence - I went to my master's house, but was refused admission, and could not make out my accounts, or I should have endeavoured to have set all right.</p>

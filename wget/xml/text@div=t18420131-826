                  </hi>. About two o'clock on Friday, the 21st of January, I was on duty at Greenwich-hospital, and saw the prisoners in company with another person—there was a crowd as the King of Prussia was coming—I had seen the prisoners and the other before standing by them<lb></lb>selves—I am sure they were acquainted—just as the band was coming out, the whole mob rushed up to the gate—I saw Dixon feeling a gentle<lb></lb>man's pocket—I then directed a policeman to watch them—be went, and in eight or ten minutes they shifted their places, and I saw Norton take this handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket—Dixon and Thompson were then one on each side of him, close to him—he took it out with his left-hand, and had hold of the tail of the coat with his right—I was not able to find out who the person was—policeman No. 190 seized Norton, and Thomp<lb></lb>son got away—I caught him with my right hand with the handkerchief—Norton had handed the handkerchief to him—he held it up, and said, "Who has lost a handkerchief?"</p>

I was on duty, and saw the three prisoners and another in company with them, in front of the College-gates—they were standing by themselves, and several other persons standing in front of them, close to the gate, but I had seen them about an hour previous, and the four were then alone—there was a rush at the gate, and at that moment I suspected the robbery was committed—I collared Norton and Thompson—Thompson gave me the slip, but I secured Norton—Thompson was secured by Lovell, and Dixon by another officer—I saw Norton's hand a minute or two previous, and he had no hand<lb></lb>kerchief in it, but the minute 1 turned him round, he had a handkerchief in his hand, and it was passed over—Thompson took it out of his hand, held it up, and called out, "Who has lost a handkerchief?" and said he had picked one up—the prisoners resisted being taken—Dixon became violent, and threw himself down.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Southend, in the parish of Lewisham. On the evening of 27th July, I had some ducks at my place—at a little after 5 o'clock the next morning, I was called up—I examined my ducks and missed two; they were safe the night before—my son had put them up—I had heard a noise shortly before the policeman called me that morning.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, H</hi> 17). At half past 4 o'clock that morning I was on duty near Bromley Hill; I met the prisoner coming towards London in a direction from Mr. Duncan's, he asked if I had seen a horse straying—he said he had been in the country with goods, and had lost a horse from behind the van—I said I had not, but if he would call at my station I would let him know if I heard of it—I saw the prisoner again about a mile and a half further, carrying two ducks by the legs—I took him to the station—I asked him how he got them—he said he bought them of a man for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., after he saw me—I called Mr. Duncan, and he identified the ducks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe the next morning you found the horse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was found—I said I would take the prisoner to the station, and he went quietly.</p>

            . I keep the Red Lion, public-house, in Drury-lane. In the latter end of October last, about eight o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my house, and called for a glass of gin and water - he asked me if I could give him change for a 1 l. note? I said I believed I could. While I was making the gin and water, he said he would go for a friend of his, and laid the note on the end of the counter, and went out. I took it up in his absence, and put it into my pocket. I am sure it is the same note he paid me. I had two others in my pocket, they were single.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you distinguish one from the other - A. It was the last I put in. He returned in about half an hour, or more, alone. I then took it out of my pocket - I know it was that he gave me, because it was the uppermost.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of its being the same - A. I had not at that time, but I have since doubted it, as I think I might have mixed them. I asked him where his friend Reghan was? as he said he was going to fetch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130030"></xptr>him - he said he was not at home, but he had been looking for him. I told him his grog was cold, and made him another glass - he had 18 d. to pay. I took the note out, and asked him if he lived in Short's-gardens? he said he did. I asked him his name? I understood him to say,</p>

He then said he lodged at Mr. Gillett's, No. 13, Short's-gardens, which is about 20 yards from my house. I then changed it - (looks at one) - this is it.

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I saw the prisoner after he was in custody. He said he got the notes from a man who said he found them in the City; but fearing they might be advertised and stopped, the man did not like to pass them, and he bought four of him at 6 s. each, at two different times, not knowing them to be forged. He knew the man's person but not his name, and he appeared to have about a hundred notes.</p>

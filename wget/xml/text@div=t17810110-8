               <p>Did you lose any money in the month of November last? - I believe it was about that time, about thirty pounds; it was in a box in the room where I sleep, in Mr. Childs' house.</p>
               <p>Was the box locked? - I cannot say; I found it unlocked when I missed my money. I had never found it unlocked before; I used to keep it locked.</p>
               <p>Was it unlocked, or had it been broke open? - Unlocked; my money was gone.</p>
               <p>How long before you missed your money had you seen it? - About four days.</p>
               <p>Did you count your money? - No; it was in a paper; I cannot say how long before I had counted it.</p>
               <p>For days before had you seen the money or only the paper? - The money; I opened the paper. At the time I lost my money the prisoner was flush of money and was changing gold. He was a <rs id="t17810110-8-deflabel41" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

               <p>Was he taken up? - Yes; the serjeant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100010"></xptr> took him up and he was put in the Guard House and kept there for seven or eight days; then he was let out; then he changed more gold and I had him taken up again.</p>
               <p>What did he change then? - About three guineas; I don't know what he changed before; we had him before Justice Hayes, who committed him to prison; I can say nothing more against him.</p>
               <p>Are there any other witnesses? - Only where he changed some money.</p>

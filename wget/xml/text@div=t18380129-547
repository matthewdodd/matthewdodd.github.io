                  </hi>. I am watchman at the Grand Junction Waterworks, at Old Brentford. I know the prisoner—on the 6th of Janu<lb></lb>ary, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I heard him call to a watchman who was on board a barge on the other side of the river—I hew his voice, and called to him, "Is that Joe?"—he came down to me, and said, "Yes, is that you?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I sup<lb></lb>pose Bob (meaning the watchman) is asleep; what o'clock is it?"—I said "Half-past five"—he said, "I thought it. was half-past six"—I said to him in joke, "Go and have half a pint of beer, and spend the time"—he said, "No, I will go and <hi rend="italic">turn in</hi> again." and He left me—I walked away in the same direction-as I stood on the platform I thought I heard a noise in the yard of the next quay—I stopped some time, and then heard the prisoner jump with some boards from the top of the wall—I ran towards him, and he ran towards the rivet with the planks—he put the planks as far into the river as he could, and sent them adrift—I called out to the other watchman in the barge, and called to the police—the watchman came out in a boat—the prisoner made every exertion to get away—he was in the water, and I was on the bank—I called for the police, and the watchman to come from the other side, and he came across in a boat—the prisoner got into the boat, and the watchman secured him—the planks belong to Mr. Hugh M'Intosh.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say any thing to him about a boat-hook? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When he called <hi rend="italic">Bob,</hi> the watchman, he asked me if the boat-hook was in the boat, and I said no, it was in the yard—he did not go into the yard to fetch it—he left me, intending to go home—I do not know whether he has a punt—there is a punt there of Mr. M'Intosh's—he threw the planks down in the direction of the water-part of them remained on the land—I had counted the planks in Mr. M'Intosh's yard the night before-we com<lb></lb>pared these with others belonging to the prosecutor, and they correspond<lb></lb>ed exactly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Old Brentford, about a quarter to six o'clock in the morning, and took the prisoner into custody, over the other side of the water—I charged him with the offence—he said he took one of the planks to push his punt off with, but he did not take two—I went into a boat to recover the planks, and found them in the possession of two fishermen—his own father had picked one up, and the other was in another boat—the prosecutor claimed them, and they con<lb></lb>responded exactly with the rest.</p>

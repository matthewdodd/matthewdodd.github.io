                  </hi> On Sunday, the 25th of July, the prisoner came to be, and asked me to go and see his wife as soon as I could make it convenient, for she was supposed to be in labour—I said I would, and asked him whether it was the same woman that had come to me a few days pre<lb></lb>viously and complained of his ill-using her—he said it was—I went to the house, and found his wife completely insensible—she was lobouring under symptoms of concussion of the brain—there was a mark across the nose, and, on examination, I discovered a fracture of one of the bones nose—there was a contused wound about the head, and several contusions about the body—there were also symptoms of premature labour—I bled her twice—she continued insensible for the whole of that day, and for two subsequent days, and at intervals she was delirious—she was removed to the workhouse on the Wednesday—she rallied, and on the 9th of Aug. was delivered of a male child of between seven and eight months—the contusion on the head appeared to have been produced by some hard substance—the skin was broken—I have seen a hammer which I think might inflict it—she had a lot of hair on at the time, that would in some measure deaden the blow, or it would have been more severe.</p>

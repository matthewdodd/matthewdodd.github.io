             sworn. - On the 28th of April in the evening, it might be eleven or twelve o'clock; I was very much in liquor; I met the prisoner in <placeName id="t17980523-3-crimeloc13">Bunhill row</placeName>

               <p>Q. In rum or brandy, or what? - A. It might be both, I cannot say; I pulled out a guinea, and a half guinea, and four shillings, and the mistress of the house saw that I was in liquor, and said to the prisoner, patrol, you had better take care of him; and I fell asleep, I believe; at last the nightmen and the patrol together waked me; I did not miss any thing till the lady of the house told me I was robbed, and then I missed my guinea; she told the prisoner, he was a very bad man, for that he had robbed that poor man (pointing to me), and should be brought to justice for it; he denied it, and said, that he had but three or four pennyworth of halfpence in his pocket; then the night-men collared him, and wrung the guinea out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do not you remember giving me your money in Bunhill-row, amounting to a guinea, and a half-guinea, to take care of? - A. I cannot remember a word of it; I do not think I should to a strange man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. The property was delivered into my hand, a guinea and a half, and four shillings; and going to this house, the Jack of Newbury, the prosecutor desired his money again, and I gave it him; and when he paid for his liquor, he put it all upon the bar, before the landlady.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t17980523-3-verdict14" type="verdictDescription">

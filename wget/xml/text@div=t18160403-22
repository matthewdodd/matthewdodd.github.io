In November, I directed Trudgett to send a bay horse, which he had let to a gentleman, who broke his knees, and another horse that was down to Thorn's at Ealing; he said he knew a better place; he said it was the Duke of Clarence's Farm, a better place to be turned out at. Dear was not present; that was in the counting-house; then the horses were taken away, and booked out to straw yard. Trudgett brought in his account to me, and I copied that account into my book. In the month of February. I discharged Deare; and on the 2nd of March, I wrote upon a peice of paper, Trudgett, let me know where those two horses are; I want them up from straw yard, and he wrote under it, sir, at Bushey, just other side Teddington. One of these horses is a brown horse and was spavined; the other is a bay horse, that was broken kneed; on the same 2nd of March, when I wanted them up, he wrote let them stop a little longer, for they are doing very well, and I said; be it so. I had occasion to reprimand him two or three weeks before the 2nd of March, about his staying out late, he said he had been to look at the horses, and they were doing very well, and they were up to their collars in straw. In the afternoon of the 2nd of March, I was passing along Piccadilly, and at the end of Bond-street. I saw the bay horse which I called Butcher, because I had bought him of a butcher, in a hackney chariot; I took particular notice of him, and knew him to be my horse, the way he cocked his ear; the man was driving off, and I took the number of the coach, and found that it belonged to a Mr.

            , in Borough-mews; the number was 910. I went there and found the chariot at the public-house-door; I then knew that horse to be mine; I traced it to Mr. Harris's, stable-keeper, Kennington Cross; he relered me to Garland, and Garland to Bishop, and Bishop to Dixon's repository. Both the horses are here, below, and they are both my property. I traced the brown horse down to Huntingdon, and there I found that it also, had been sold at Dixon's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. These horses were not lumber in my yard; they were unable to work when they were with me; but they are now valuable horses; they were by no means useless, or I would not have turned them out. I had told Trudgett to sell the bay horse for twenty eight guineas, but that was before he was fired; I thought I had one of the greatest treasures in the world, in Trudgett, as a servant.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he not a general authority to sell your horses, when to your advantage - A. I have sent him with horses to Tattersall's to sell; but he never had any authority to sell them of his own accord; I put a price on whatever he was to sell.</p>

               <p>Q.Upon the oath you have taken had he not a general license to sell your horses if for your advantage - A. I don't deal in horses; but when accidents have happened, I have told him if he could sell such and such a horse to advantage, to sell him; but I never told him to sell these horses. He never went out to market to buy my bay or straw; I never yet trusted a man to buy any thing of the kind; I did not allow him to take and receive monies to keep, until I called on him to settle; we settled every Sunday morning. I never gave him credit, except for money I had lent him to get his things out of pawn.</p>

               <p>Q. If Trudgett directed him then, to sell the horses, it would be his business to believe Trudgett, and take them as he directed - A.I should think he would consult me upon it.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Dixon, at the Repository, in Barbican. At the time I was with him, I remember two horses coming from Steel's livery-stables; a hay horse, and a brown horse; they were brought to the Repository for sale, and the clerk not being there, I took the instructions. John Deare brought the two horses; he said he brought them from Mr. Steel's liverystables, by order of Trudgett; one was to be booked in the name of Dean, not Deare, and the other in the name of Clarke; but I am not sure. He wished them to be sold for what they would fetch. At the beginning of the sale, he came back, and told me that they were not to be sold under eighteen guineas the two. I asked him how he laid them about the equal price, and he said that either of them might be sold for nine guineas, but not otherwise, or eighteen guiness the pair; they went to the hammer, and neither of them would fetch nine guineas; in consequence of that, they were sold by private sale, for pounds instead of guineas; one was sold to a Mr. Bishop for nine pounds. On the Saturday Deare asked me when pay day was, and I told him on Monday.</p>

One of the horses was sold to Mr. Bishop, the bay horse, I think, and the other to a man of the name of Searborough. Deare gave me an order from Trudgett for the payment of the money they had produced.</p>

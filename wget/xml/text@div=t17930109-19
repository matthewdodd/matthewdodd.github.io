               <p>I am a patrole belonging to the parish of St. Giles's; the 31st of December about half past nine I and my partner were coming up Great Russel-street, we were met by a gentleman who informed us that No. 19, had been robbed of some wet linen, we went in pursuit of the linen, we went into a house in New-street, a private house, I found the prisoners and the linen in the rooms, it might then want a quarter to ten, Tobin sat on the bed side close by the fire, the other sat at another seat facing the fire, when I opened the door Tobin threw himself flat on the bed; I told my partner to stand at the door, I had a great suspicion that the things were in that room; I went into the room, and Stanson he had two handkerchiefs and a pair of pockets in his hand, and he immediately attempted to put them under the fire place; I went to him and clapped my hand on his shoulder and stopped him before he got them under the place; I saw no more of Tobin than throwing himself on the bed, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090030"></xptr>the rest of the property lay under the bed on the floor that he lay upon; I brought away all I could find at the time; I produce all I brought away; I have put nothing with them.</p>

After I had got the money at the Bank of England I met my brother at Moorgate Street Station, and between Moorgate Street and Gower Street I gave him five 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and, I think, 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money. We then went to Euston Square; my brother changed one of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes at a public-house at a corner, and bought a hat and umbrella. He then saw me off to Liverpool by the 2.45 p.m. train; my brother and the woman he was living with afterwards came down to Liverpool, and I had to keep them there; the clergyman's signature to the order was written by the woman; her name is Tracey"—I then took him to the police-station.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a general dealer, at 5, Henry-street, Grays-inn Road. On Wednesday, 6th Feb., the prisoner came to the shop, about five o'clock in the evening, for a pennyworth of onions—she laid down a half-crown—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I laid down separately, and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I said, "There is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; please to look at it"—she said, "I know good money"—she took up the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and put it, as I supposed, in her</p>

            , go to Mr. Fenn's window and take up the tea caddy, and look at it, it stood at the window, the prosecutor is a broker and undertaker; he put it down again and walked about three paces from it, as though he was dealing for it, and then he returns again, takes up the caddy and put it under his coat, under his arm; I hallooed out to Mr. Fenn, but there was nobody came; I put on my coat and ran after him; I overtook Mr. Elliot in Peter-street, and I asked him if he saw such a man? and I overtook him just by the Bluecoat school, and I and Elliot apprehended him; he had the caddy on him; the caddy is here, Mr. Elliot has it.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went from the shop did he run or walk away? - He walked away.</p>

               <p>I met the prisoner in Great Peter-street, walking fast with the tea chest under his arm, about a hundred and fifty yards from Mr. Fenn's house; and then Frazier came up, and we pursued him, and apprehended him, and we have got the caddy that we got from him; the man was very much in liquor. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. Did either of you know this man before?</p>
               <p>Elliot. I never see him to the bed of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Frazier. I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Fenn I understand is a broker, I went to ask whether he was at home at the time.</p>
               <p>Fenn. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave any person in his house to sell goods in his absence? - Yes, but nobody was in the shop, the person was down in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was near his shop, nor did I know where his shop was, I presume it might be handed off, but by another person; at the time he saw me take this tea chest no man called out, nor did Frazier come up, it was that man, the constable, came up. At the same time I had bought this tea caddy, and paid three shillings and six-pence for it, I met a man and he said he was going abroad on that very day following, and I knew there were some people going abroad the next day; and when the black came before the justice, he said it was a man in a green coat.</p>
               <p>Court to Frazier. Did you say before the justice that it was a man in a green coat? - I said it was a man in a green coat, and he had on a green coat, he has not got on the coat that he had on when I attacked him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That black has forsworn against me, ask him if he is a christian.</p>
               <p>Frazier. I was born in a christian country, and I believe was made one, as my friends told me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Does he know the 8th commandment.</p>

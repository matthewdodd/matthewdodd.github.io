I am the wife of Thomas Hearne, who keeps a beer-shop, in Uxbridge—I saw Pike at my house—he had two shirts with him; he laid them down—he afterwards made a complaint to me about them—I went into my private house, where the prisoner slept, and found her—I asked her if she had got two shirts—she said she had not—I said I would see whether she had or not, and I observed the two shirts under her gown—Pike was not par-ticularly in liquor—he had been drinking at my house—they had five pints and a half of beer—there were four in the party—I cannot say whether the shirts were new—I do not know whether they wanted mending.</p>

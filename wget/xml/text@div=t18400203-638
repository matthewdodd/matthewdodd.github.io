                  </hi>. I am carman to Messrs. Copeland and Garratt. On the 10th of January, about four o'clock, I was in Fleet-street with their cart—my coat was in the cart, which had been stopped several times, as the street was very crowded—I was walking by the side of the horses' heads, and saw my coat safe in front of the cart—I did not see who took it, but just as I got below the Bolt-in-Tun public-house I looked round, and it was gone—I do not think it could have dropped off, as it was over a little basket of glass—the prisoner was brought back with it—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is mine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No</hi>, 100.) About four o'clock that day I was going down Fleet-street—I cast my eye on the opposite side, and noticed the prisoner run from behind the cart in a confused state, with the coat half wrapped up—he ran almost into my arms—he turned down Water-lane—I ran after him—he made a stop at the end of Water-lane, and looked to see what way he should turn—he then turned to the Temple, and held the coat up at the gate, then he went into the Temple, and appeared to hesitate what way to turn—I ran up to him, and said, "Is this yours?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I think not, give it to me"—he said, "I will not," and resisted very much—I was taking him to the station-house, and met the prosecutor, who owned the coat.</p>

On 9th Nov., about 7 o'clock, the prisoner Reer came to my husband's shop, and asked for an ounce of salts, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he threw a sixpence on the counter, which I took up and found was bad—I said, "You see what this is"—he said, "What is it?"—I said, "A bad one; you know that"—while I was speaking to him Harris came in, and asked whether Adams, a bricklayer, lived down that turning—I did not answer him immediately, and he asked me the same question several times—I told Reer if there was a policeman I would give him in charge, and they both went out at the same time—I followed them round the corner repealing the same remark, and Reer went to the right and Harris to the left—the sixpence remained on the counter, and in a few minutes Noakes, a policeman, came, and I gave it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of No. 25, Mint-street On Wednes<lb></lb>day night, 19th Dec., I went to bed—in the middle of the night I awoke, and found my room full of smoke—before I could come down I saw fire coming up the back stairs from the kitchen—there has been no fire in the kitchen since I have been in the house—the kitchen is level with the one next door—I am satisfied from examination that the fire broke out in the kitchen—the flue of the copper of the next house came to the cupboard of my house—the brick <hi rend="italic">noggin</hi> was in it; that is a wooden frame which is built up first, and bricks are put in afterwards—it was also boarded on my side in the cupboard, and that formed the wooden wall of the cupboard—on the No. 24 side it was all brick <hi rend="italic">noggin</hi>—the next door is an eating house, and it opened on the same night as the fire—the fire broke out at my cup<lb></lb>board—I saw the fire in the kitchen, out of the back window—I am a smith and gas fitter, I know nothing about setting coppers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the Fire Brigade. After put<lb></lb>ting out this fire, I made an examination in the kitchen of No. 24, and found a copper built against the plaster of the brick <hi rend="italic">noggin</hi>—I believe it was a stone floor—there was a common fireplace under the copper, above one foot and a half deep—the wall was composed of brick and timber—there was a hole at the end of the flue, about a foot from the ground, caused by the wood work breaking away—by the flue I do not mean the chimney—the flue runs right round—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a piece of the wood work of the <hi rend="italic">noggin</hi>—I have no doubt that the fire commenced at that part of the wood work, by it's catching fire by the flue—I have seen many coppers set, but they always cut the wood work out first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer and builder, and have been so forty-three years next June. I examined this kitchen—the front of the flue was covered with flat plain tiles to form the front of the chimney, the chimney having been cut out to form the flue at the side of the copper—in taking these tiles down, I found that the inside of the chimney had been cut out, and I found one of the quarters of the partition between Nos. 24 and 25—it probably had been an old kitchen, and had been filled in with brick work to keep the cold out—by the partition, I mean the brick <hi rend="italic">noggin</hi>, and it was par<lb></lb>tially burnt away in the upright flue, leading into the kitchen chimney—there was a fireplace under the copper—it was about two feet nine inches from the door to the back, and from the front of the copper to the brick <hi rend="italic">noggin</hi> was three feet—the depth of the fireplace was about two feet—the copper was set on the floor—where the flame caught the back part of the flue there was another quarter which had only plaster to cover it, and the flame beat against it; it was where the fire went into the furnace—the fireplace is what I call the furnace; furnace is the proper name for it—the mouth of the furnace is eight or nine inches square—if a person was putting up that copper, it would be his duty to see what he was putting it up against; he ought to have ascertained that by taking off the plaster—merely tapping it would not be sufficient to ascertain whether it was brick <hi rend="italic">noggin</hi> or not—it would be enough to tell him whether it was wood or bricks, but not enough to enable him to tell what description of wall it was—the whole of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185601070116"></xptr>
               <p>plaster ought to have been cut away to ascertain—it is not uncommon for walls to be composed of brick <hi rend="italic">noggin</hi>, especially old houses, but it is very dangerous—a person who has had experience in setting coppers would know that fact.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That mode of building is prohibited now by the Metropolitan Buildings Act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has been for some time—if there had been brick, and there had been no wood work, it would not have occurred—six inches square had been cut out of the chimney breast to form the flue—I cannot say whether the person who set this copper had cut that out, or whether there had been another copper set there before—a piece had been taken out, which has been burnt.</p>

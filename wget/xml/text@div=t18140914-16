               <p>EDWARD CRAMP. I am a dealer in cattle. On the morning of the 22nd of July, I was in Smithfield market; I observed there five bullocks, and while I was handling them the prisoner asked me if I would buy them; I said yes, if he and I agreed about the price; he asked me, twelve pound a piece for them, and agreed to sell them for eleven. They were small Scotch cattle. I marked them at the tail, and after I had marked them I went round the market. The prisoner came to me for the money; I asked him what his name was; he said,

            ; he came from Hadlow, in Kent; he said his father kept a farm there; they were his father's property; his father kept Bone farur, at Hadlow. I enquired of three salesmen if they knew such a person. I returned to the prisoner; I told him it was not customary without he knew any body in London, and giving reference, to pay money to a stranger. He said he did not know any body in town. He then said if I did not pay him for the beasts he would put them to somebody else to sell, which he did to Mr. Biggs. I then, went to Mr. Biggs, and told him not to sell them, as I had bought them. The prisoner said he would drive the beasts away. He was in the act of doing it; I called an officer, and told him to detain the beasts until he could prove he came honestly by them. The beasts were detained, and taken to the Fox and Knot yard, the regular lock-up yard I then went to the prisoner, and told him he and I would have no more words about it; if he could prove he came honestly by them I would go with him to Hadlow, and pay the coach hire, and I would pay him at his fathers. A drover informed me that Mr. Adair's bailiff was at the Fox and Knot yard. I went to Fox and Knot yard, and saw Mr. Pick; he claimed the five bullocks as Mr. Adair's property.</p>

               <p>JAMES PICK. I am bailiff to Alexander Adair, esq. On the morning of the 22nd of July, I was informed of the loss of these five bullocks; I took my horse, and came to Smithfield. I found the bullocks in Fox and Knot yard; Cramp and I looked at them together. These five bullocks that Cramp and I saw together, were Mr. Adair's property. We sent them back to Mr. Adair.</p>

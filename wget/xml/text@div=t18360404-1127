               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had he been in your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twenty months—he came to me at my solicitation—here is a petty cash-book which he kept, containing an account of money he expended—he was in the habit of receiving of me, in the early part of the week, a sum of money, out of which he used to make petty disbursements—I make up my book on Saturday, and then in the early part of the week I generally made him some advance—about Wednesday, he generally used to ask me to let him have a few shillings—it was never inquired whether he wanted it for disbursements or for wages.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it happen, that in the week beginning on the 20th of February, you did not make him any advance till the Friday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot charge my memory, but I think I did—it being the transaction of a week, it was left as a mere meter matter of memory—I will not say I did—on the Saturday before the 20th of February, I think there was about 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., due to him—he was in the habit of receiving weekly rents for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever told him that, when there was any thing coming to him on the Saturday, he might pay himself out of the rentes received in the following week? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That he occurred several times—at the time he was taken on this charge, I did not asked him whether he had received these sums.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.He was apprehended on another charge? A. Yes, and in consequence of that, I had indirectly a communication with him on his general conduct, and I agreed that if he furnished me with an account of all he had embezzled, I would forgive him; he was apprehended for embezzling 4l. in November, and between that and the time of his furnishing me with the account, I received information of this 5l. 18s.; he had no means of knowing that - when he furnished his account this sum of 5l. 18s. was included in it; the first charge went off for want of evidence - my partner was aware of what I had said to the prisoner, and concurred in it; his account arrived on the 16th, and I said to my partner,"If the 5l. 18s. is in this account, it is within our agreement; we are not to prosecute unless we find others," to which my partner agreed - I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010040"></xptr>concurred in any proceedings against the prisoner; he had been with us eight years and seven months - his character stood unimpeached; I do not know who is the prosecutor, if Avis is not.</p>

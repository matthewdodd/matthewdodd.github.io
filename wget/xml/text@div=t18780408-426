                  </hi>. The defendant is my son—I am well acquainted with the character of his writing—I examined these letters on Saturday, to the best of my belief they are not his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have only spoken to Miss Elmer since my son has been in custody—I think I attended the police-court on the first occasion—on the second occasion he was represented by a solicitor, and I sat at the table and saw the writing—I rather think Mr. Hall was sitting at the back—Mr. Isherwood was also there, and I took Mr. Williams, a writing master, there to examine the writing—he professes to be an expert in writing—I did not hear a request by Mr. Williams and Mr. Isherwood that I should examine the letters in Court—Mr. Williams did not report to me that the writing was the same as the writing produced from the Alexandra Palace—he did not report that it was the same writing as the receipt, he seemed to think there was a degree of similarity—Mr. Williams is not interested in my son, he came for the purpose of giving his opinion; he was a stranger to all the parties—he, in my presence, examined some portion of the anonymous letters with the receipt—I do not recollect his saying that the similarity was so great that he could not give evidence for me—I did not decline to go into the witness box—I have no recollection of saying "You must not call me"—Mr. Williams and Hall and I were there looking at the letters, and none of us were called.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner and have received several letters from him—I saw these nine letters on Saturday; to the best of my belief they are not his writing—I know nothing about this letter.(<hi rend="italic">The one received after the prisoner's committal for trial</hi>.) I did not write it—I heard that libels had been written to Mr. Proctor and my half-sister, but I do not know who the writer is.</p>

               <p>go to the police-court to be a witness in the prisoner's favour—I cannot recollect whether I was in Packington Street on Tuesday evening, January 1, 1878, with the prisoner—he did not show me an anonymous letter—I have been told from time to time of my half-sister receiving these letters—I did not decline to give any opinion about them, I was never asked—the only one I saw was one which my mother received, letter E; that came by post, and I opened it—that was on 22nd October, 1877, and I knew that that was Mrs. Proctor's wedding-day—I don't know whether it came on her wedding-day; it has a post-mark—the writing does not resemble the prisoner's in the least.</p>

Believe me I do not do it to annoy you, but to show up your hus<lb></lb>band, James Proctor. He has been the ruin of me, and I do not see that I should spare him. You had two of your servants leave you in the family way, and if you do not keep a sharp look-out you may have more in the same way. Numbers of nights when your husband has been stopping late, and told you it's been business, he has been with me. He boasts openly that he has had twenty women since he has been married. From what I know of him I should think it quite possible. When he was with me one night he happened to drop three letters; they had your address, a Mrs. Elmer's, and a Mr. Hoppe's. I mean to send them all a letter each, and if I can get hold of any of his relations' addresses I will send them letters also. I do not like to see people imposed upon, so I have gotten my brother to write these letters. Should I hear any more about his goings on with other women I will let you know. From a Friend."<hi rend="italic">Letter B stated</hi>: "Since I wrote last your husband as called on me several times and tried to come to an arrange<lb></lb>ment.

The child I have by him is now four years old, and doing well. If you really want to find him out, just employ a private detective to watch him, &amp;c. James pays regularly towards the support of the child, or you would have had me down before this.

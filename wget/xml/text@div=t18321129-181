On the afternoon of the 9th of November, I discovered a bottle of gin - a bottle three-parts full, and one quite full of wine among the empty bottles; and as the bottle-house was under the direction of the prisoner, suspicion lighted on him - a lad gave me information, and I discovered that the prisoner had delivered a dozen of wine to Mr. Kirby, a surgeon, who produced a bottle of the wine, and came over with me to our house; we opened the bottle, my partner and I tasted it, and my opinion was that it came from No. 2 bin in our middle cellar - it was the oldest wine we had - I could swear to it; the bottle found among the empty bottles was our wine, but of a different sort - I cannot swear to the gin, as many other persons have gin from the same distiller; I was not aware of the loss of this earthen bottle, but it was found at the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Have you no more partners? A, No - Mr. Kirby said that the prisoner brought him the wine to place against an account; the prisoner was not in the habit of having wine of us; he had special permission once to have some; that was some months before.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. When the prosecutor applied to me I gave him a bottle of wine, which was one of a dozen I had had from the prisoner in payment of a debt; I had had some of him some months before, by his master's permission - I think it was two dozen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you live near the prosecutor's? A. Yes, they knew me very well - I have dealt with them.</p>
               <p>MR. BONNY. I never authorized him to take any but once; on that occasion he said he owed Mr.

             a bill, and two dozen of wine would cover it, and we allowed him to take it; when the officer brought the prisoner round to our front door, I said he had been using me exceedingly ill, considering I used him well, and he never wanted any drink himself; he said he could not tell why I treated him so, and said he bought the dozen of wine of Frank Denny, at Thompson and Fearon's, but on producing

             at the office, he said, "That is not the man, it was John somebody that was with Thompson and Fearon, but I do not know where to find him;" on the second examination he said it was our wine, and he was willing to pay for it in any way if we would allow him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he had conducted himself well up to this time? A. Yes, we had him from Thompson and Fearon's, where he had been twelve months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have had the jar upwards of twelve months; Mr. Kirby sent for a dozen of wine, and I took it over - I meant to have entered it, but it slipped my memory.</p>

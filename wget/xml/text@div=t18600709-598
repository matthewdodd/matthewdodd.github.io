I am barmaid at the Crown public-house, Long Acre. which is kept by my father—on the night of 12th June the prisoners came in together at about half-past seven—Jones asked for a pint of porter—I served them—the woman drank half the porter, and the man said he would rather have some gin for it if I would exchange it—I did so—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—they then both left the house—I put the shilling that the man gave me into the till—there was no other there—about ten minutes afterwards the prisoners came again with three other men—Vigo asked for a pot of porter—I served her and she gave me a shilling in pay<lb></lb>ment—I gave her 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and I put that shilling into the till—I had been to the till with some coppers between the time they came in first and when they came in the second time—I had not put any shillings in be<lb></lb>tween the first and second visit—the prisoners and the other men drank the pot of beer, and Vigo said to me, "Fill this pot again"—I did so; Jones then gave me a shilling in payment—I went to the till, still keeping the shilling in my hand; I found I had not got a sixpence—I took from the till a shilling and a florin and gave it to the waiter, Thomas Christmas, to get change; when I gave them to him he said, "This will not do, it is a bad one," he said the shilling was bad—Jones then asked for some gin; he heard what Christmas said—Christmas then went round the bar and said to Jones, "Have you got any more of this sort," and he said, "Oh, yes, plenty"—and took a shilling from his pocket and threw it on the counter—Christ<lb></lb>mas took it up and looked at it, and said it was bad—a policeman was sent</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Jones's Defence.</hi> Is it feasible that I should stand in front of a bar and change two or three shillings, when I had the change of one in my pocket? I changed one shilling in the house, and as to knowing whether it was good or bad I did not. I changed a half-crown in the Hay market and got 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I did not know they were bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Vigo's Defence.</hi> I am an unfortunate girl; four weeks last Wednesday evening I met a man; a stranger to me, he offered to treat me. I went to a public-house in Long Acre with him, and had some porter; I drank part of the beer, the man changed the glass of beer that was left for a glass of gin; we came out of that house, he then said, "Now, will you treat me?—I said I had no money; he said he would give me a shilling and I must treat him out of it. We went back to the same house and met three men; we had one pot of porter, and I paid for it out of the shilling the man gave me. He then called for some more beer and some gin, and left the house; the barmaid had sent for some sixpences, and the waiter stopped us and said the money we had given was bad.</p>

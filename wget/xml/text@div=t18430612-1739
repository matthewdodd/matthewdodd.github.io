                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and keep a shop in High-street, Shadwell—the prisoner was my shopman, and had been so three months. In consequence of suspicions I entertained, I applied to Mr. Young, who marked 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my presence, and gave them to Mrs. Buxton, who lives at his house with her father—I afterwards met Mrs. Buxton coming from my house with some pork—on going home, I searched my till, and found in it one of the marked shillings, and one shilling not marked—the police-sergeant was fetched, the prisoner searched, and two shillings found on him—one of them marked—I had paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Thursday night, and he said those were the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had given him—I had not given him the marked shilling—this was on Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, at Mr. Young's. My father is an invalid under his roof—I saw Young mark two shillings between five and six o'clock in the evening—I took them to Horwell's shop, purchased 2lb. 6oz. of pork of the prisoner, by Young's directions—it came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave the prisoner the two marked shillings, and had 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, which he took from the till—I saw him put the two marked shillings in—I met</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant.</hi>) I went with Mr. Young to Horwell's shop, on Saturday evening, the 13th of May—the prisoner was called into the back parlour by Horwell, who said, "I suspect you have been robbing me"—the prisoner appeared surprised, and asked how—Horwell said, "I suspect you have been taking money from the till"—I asked the prisoner if he had any money about him—he said he had—he put his hand into his pocket, and took out two shillings, one of which Horwell identified as one Young had marked—the prisoner said, "They are the two you gave me the night before last"—I produce the two found in the till.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was a Mr. Shoesmith there at the time you took the money from the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think he was—Dr. Young was there—he examined the money, I am quite sure about that—to the best of my recollection he took it in his hand and looked at it—but I will not swear positively—he was before the Magistrate, but was not examined, and not bound over—I did not see Mr. Young at the till—I was not there when the money was taken out of the till—when it was handed over to me it was in Mr. Young's possession, but Mr. Horwell was present at the time—I asked the prisoner whether he had any objection to let me search him—he said, "Not the least"—I then asked him whether he had any money about him—after he took the two shillings out of his pocket, and after Mr. Horwell identified one as one that Mr. Young had marked, the prisoner said, "They are the two shillings you gave me the night before last"—I saw the prosecutor identify the shilling—that was before Mr. Young had looked at it—I think it was then handed to Mr. Young—it was put on the table, and Mr. Young took it up—I do not recollect the prosecutor saying, "That is the shilling, is it not, Dr. Young?" or anything of the kind—some words might have passed, but I cannot recollect what.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you receive the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which the prisoner produced from his pocket? A. I did, in the first instance—I examined them before any one else looked at them—I noticed a mark on one of them—I can swear that the one Mr. Horwell afterwards spoke to was one I took from the prisoner—it could not have been changed—it was not out of my sight—Dr. Young had it in his hand, but I saw it—the mark I now find on the shilling is the mark that was on the shilling I had from the prisoner—there is one mark on the crown.</p>

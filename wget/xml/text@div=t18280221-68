On Friday, the 11th of January, my wife and I had occasion to go into the Commercial-road. The house only consists of two rooms - we have no servant - I locked the street door myself, between six and seven o'clock and we went out - it was dark then; in about five minutes, when we got to Grove-street, my wife wanted to return for a sixpence, which she had left behind; we returned - I put the key into the door to unlock it, and it was fastened inside - I said there were thieves in the house, and gave an alarm immediately; I held the handle of the door, and the door was pulled inside, to open it - I still held it, and heard persons going up stairs; the window up stairs was thrown open, and out jumped one person - I laid hold of him; that was Nichols; and then the other prisoner dropped down - I laid hold of him - it was the two prisoners; I am quite certain of them - I held them for about a minute, then both broke away from my hold; but I did not loose sight of Nichols - I can safely swear they are both the men who dropped from the window; there were two gas-lights; I could see them plainly, and am certain of them both - I lost sight of Seldon; we went down to the watch-house to give charge of Nichols, and then Seldon was brought in; that was in about ten minutes - I spoke to him with certainly. I went back to my house; found the up-stairs window open, and the table moved into the middle of the room - I did not perceive any thing else - I never saw either of the prisoners before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all day-light gone at the time the matter happened? A. It was between six and seven o'clock - it was very foggy - day-light had gone; it could not be daylight; but I could see them by the gas-light, as clear as I can see your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know it was between six and seven o'clock? A. It was just as the watchman came on - he comes on at six.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the lamps were away, was there not a glimmering of day-light? A. It is a very dark street.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man was in a wide open place, was there not sufficient light to distinguish his face? A. Quite sufficient. I caught hold of both the men; the second jumped out in about a minute after the other, and he got away in about a minute; they were twisting and struggling with me - I was not frightened; for I had been robbed twelve months before, and wanted to know who the thieves were; I am fifty-five years old - it might be nearly a quarter of an hour before Seldon was brought to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you speak of the time you were robbed; or when you went out with your wife? A. When we went out. Nichols struggled and got away, but I never lost sight of him; he was taken in the same street, about one hundred yards off - I pursued him, and a man, who is not here, stopped him; he delivered him to the watchman, who is here; my street is about three hundred yards long - there were a good many people about; it is a populous little street - three or four persons pursued with me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure it was after six o'clock? A. Yes: I went out after six, and returned in five minutes - I did not go into any street or place where there were no lamps lighted.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I left the house with him between six and seven o'clock, leaving every thing safe and fast - the street door was locked; we returned in five or six minutes, and found the door fastened inside - my husband called out, and I saw the two men come from the up-stairs window; the gas-light nearly opposite gave a good light; I could see them perfectly well; the prisoners are the persons; the watchman was on his beat at the time; Seldon got out of my sight, but I ran in the road and kept Nichols in sight till he was stopped. When we were at the watch-house, Seldon was brought in, in five or ten minutes - I could not be certain of him, but my husband swore to him - I saw his face, and was certain they were the two men; I recollected his features, and was certain of him - I found our window wide open, and the table moved into the middle of the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not at first say you could not be certain of them; but your husband swore to them? A. If I did it was a mistake; for I knew them both to be the men; it is not my husband's swearing to them that makes me certain - I could not say so much of one as the other, as he was close by me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you run with your husband? A. I ran by myself - I was about four yards from Nichols - there were people about, but I saw him stopped; there are but two windows to our house; one up-stairs, and one down - there are none behind; there is a back door which I bolted myself before I went out, about five o'clock; there are two back doors, one is up stairs; they were both bolted - the one up stairs had not been unfastened for three or four days - I swear I bolted the one down stairs; there is no other way out behind - my husband shut the shutters - I shut the up stairs window myself; but it was not fastened; it had not been open since the morning; I saw it shut about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before; when I went up to put on my bonnet - I saw the lower window just before I went out, and saw my husband fasten the shutter.</p>

Watch! and Thieves!" a great many people were collected, and Nichols was in hold of somebody - I cannot exactly say who, for there was a great crowd - the prosecutor and his wife were there, and desired me to take him to the watch-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210073"></xptr>house; saying their house had been broken into - they gave him in charge - Seldon was brought in in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes charged with being one of the party who broke into the house - Mrs. Smith was there; I am not certain whether her husband was - Nichols wished very much for his hat; I had taken him without a hat; it was found afterwards; but not in my presence - he wished me very much to let him go, saying that he was a coppersmith and brazier, and out of work - he said nothing to the charge; I did not wait to hear what passed about Seldon - Smith and his wife gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I thought you did not see Mr. Smith at the watch-house? A. Not at first, from the number of people - they both gave charge; I heard Nichols given in charge; but paid no attention to what passed about Seldon - Smith was there to give him in charge; but I did not hear him do it; he was detained at the watch-house on the charge - charge was given; but I paid little attention to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know where Nichols was apprehended? A. It might be sixty or seventy yards from the house - it was in the same street, near a chandler's-shop, nearly opposite the shop; I took him from a person who held him; I do not suppose Smith was a yard from him; Mrs. Smith came to the watch-house five or six minutes before her husband - the watch-house is not a quarter of a mile from the spot; Mr. Smith followed us to the watch-house; I do not know who the man was who stopped Nichols, there was such a crowd; Smith's wife ordered me to take him: whether the man who stopped him followed us to the watch-house, I cannot say.</p>

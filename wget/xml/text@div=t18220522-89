            . I live in Sun-street, Bishopsgate. On Thursday the 23d of May, at half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was passing down <placeName id="t18220522-89-crimeloc477">Kingsland-road</placeName>

I am perfectly sure that the prisoner Neumhier is one of the two, but not the person who snatched the watch. When I was on the ground the man who took my watch let it drop about a yard and a half from me, and I crawled on my hands and knees towards it, but he was too quick for me, and snatched it up and ran away. As I was endeavouring to get up, the two prisoners passed me - I had not seen Crawley in the transaction before; I took particular notice of him - I at first thought he might be only a person who was passing, till I saw him with Neumhier - I noticed his features, and am quite sure he is the one who ran off with Neumhier, I had seen him repeatedly before. I pursued them nearly to the top of the King's-road, crying</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" and never lost sight of them till they turned the corner of Ivy-lane; before that I saw three young men come out of a house called the High House, and join in the pursuit. I came up in less than ten minutes to where they were stopped, and saw them in a public-house where they were conveyed, and am certain of their persons, perfectly so. The watch was shewn to me before I got to the public-house. I felt very sore for two or three days from the blow and bruises occasioned by the fall, and my hands were lacerated with the gravel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. This was only five days ago, and you are quite recovered - A. No; I am not. Two persons rushed against me, a blow immediately followed, and while on the ground the prisoner passed me; the blow and my falling were almost instantanious, I staggered a little, the person who struck the blow and took the watch has escaped. I saw Neumhier rush on me, and then pass me, my attention was more upon him than the one who escaped. I am perfectly certain that the watch was not taken till after the blow was struck, and when I was in the act of falling; I staggered a yard and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. You at first thought the third person was only passing by - A. Yes, till I saw him with Neumhier. I had not called Stop thief when I saw him. His face was quite familiar to me, I did not know his name, they ran about three quarters of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you had such a view of them that if you had met them a month afterwards in the street you should know them - A. I think I should directly; perhaps I might have passed them a month after, and not notice them.</p>

            . I live in King's-road, Hoxton, at the High House, and am a seal skin-dresser. Last Thursday evening I was at home, and heard a noise, I ran to the gate and saw Mr. Bowerbank covered with dust, holding up his stick and saying</p>
               <p>"Stop those rascals, those thieves!" pointing to the prisoners who were about twenty yards before him; I pursued, they turned to the left, and then down Ivy-lane; a man named Rump stopped them, before I lost sight of them; it was the two prisoners. I laid hold of Crawley opposite the Unicorn, public-house, I took him into the house, he scuffled and struck me a blow under the ear, and using a bad word, he said he would serve me out when he got loose again; I let him go, and seized him again immediately, and got him into the public-house, and the other was brought in directly; Bowerbank came in in five minutes, and said he could swear to them both.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say they turned to the left, and then to the right, down Ivy-lane - A. Yes; I did nor loose sight of them, I saw three persons in Ivy-lane; I saw the prisoners when they turned the corner; Crawley did not say that he knew nothing about it, he said he would serve me out; he said at the public-house, that I had nothing to do with it, he had done nothing.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to MR. BOWERBANK. Q. While you were getting up and saw the two persons, was the other man running away - A. He was before; I at first thought Crawley might be a man who might assist me. He made no attempt to stop the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you such a view of Neumhier, that if he had not run away, you would have charged him with it - A. Certainly.</p>

            . I live at Hoxton, and work with Collins at the High House. I heard a hollowing, and ran out and saw Mr. Bowerbank all over dust, holding up his stick and saying,</p>
               <p>"Stop thief," I looked towards Hoxton and saw the two prisoners running about twenty yards off, I pursued and never lost sight of them. I stopped Neumhier; somebody laid hold of him when I came up. Collins took Crawley; a scuffle ensued between Collins and Crawley about which public-house they should go to, whether to the Green Man or the Unicorn; and in the scuffle I saw the watch behind Crawley, I saw it in the act of falling to the ground, it fell at his heels, and I think it must have fallen from him; a sailor picked it up and gave it to me. Bowerbank claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You suppose it fell from him - A. Yes. I do not think it could have fallen from any one else; I saw it fall. Collins had hold of him, and a third man wanted them to go to the Green Man; there was a great mob, but the watch could not have fallen from them, it was too near to him; I saw it in the act of falling; the sailor boy who picked it up is not here; he offered it to me, but I would not take it, and told him to take it to the gentleman.

Sparks had hold of Neumhier and asked me to assist him which I did, and in the middle of the road the prisoners wished to go to the Green Man, and said they would not go to the Unicorn. Crawley scuffled with Collins; Neumhier tried to get to Collins, and I perceived Crawley throw the watch down; I saw it come out of his hands; a sailor picked it up and gave it to me; I gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You will not swear the watch he threw down was the same that the prosecutor claimed - A. Yes.

Sparks came up directly and laid hold of him; I kept hold of him and saw Crawley stopped; they wanted to go to the Green - Man we took them to the Unicorn; there was a scuffle between Crawley and Collins. Bowerbank came into the Unicorn and said they were the men who had robbed him.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Whitehead, of Ball's-pond. I met the prisoner Crawley in the Kingsland-road, between six and seven o'clock, a few yards from the King's-road; two more men stood behind the toll-box. Crawley turned back and went up to them, and before they went up to the gentleman, I heard them say, they would have one before an hour passed over their heads. I did not know what they meant. I saw the prosecutor standing in King's-road; they all three rushed from the box and knocked him down. I saw him fall, and was so frightened I could not call out; I saw one of them snatch the watch from his fob; that was neither of the prisoners; they all three ran up King's-road. I saw the prisoners at Worship-street next day, and was sure of them. I am still in my master's service.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw Crawley before - A. No. I had no conversation with him: when I met him I noticed that he looked very pale. The gentleman did not speak to me, I was about two yards from him, he got up, and hollowed</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" holding his stick up. My master has a situation in the Bank of England.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see what became of the watch - A. The man who knocked the gentleman down, gave it into Crawley's hands, and bid him run, and said, if they came after him they would stop them; they were close to me at the time; I saw that the watch ribbon was dark, and I thought there was a seal to it, but it seems it was only a key.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a labourer at St. Alban's: I was at Elstree the day that Birdseye was killed, I cannot tell what day it was; I saw the prisoner and Birdseye at the Artichoke, just as I left work, I saw them wrestling in the yard; they kicked one another several times, and then East said, I will give out, you are a better man than I am; he said he pinched him so hard he could not bear it; Birdseye said he should not give out; I saw the prisoner come out of the yard towards home, and Birdseye followed him, and then East threw a stone at Birdseye.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing before he threw it? - A. No, I did not hear him say a word; then I heard East say, I will shoot you if you follow me home to my premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Birdseye say any thing to him? - A. He said he would take away the stone from him if he could, that is all I heard; then East went home, and Birdseye followed him, and then East came out to the door with a gun in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Birdseye stand? - A. I cannot say; I did not see him shoot him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a shoemaker, I knew the deceased and the prisoner: On the 11th of July, hearing a noise in the street, I looked out at my own shop-window, about three yards from East's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the Artichoke? - A. I think about a quarter of a mile; I saw East seemingly in a great passion, saying, if he came to his house he would shoot him; I could not tell then who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there besides East and Birdseye? - A. There was Pickett with Birdseye, and one Hamilton, a labourer; East was first by himself, then he came to his own house, and went in at his door; he was gone in the space of half a minute, and then returned to the door with a gun in his hand, declaring that if he came there he would shoot him; upon that, he took the gun and presented it, bearing against his right hip, with one foot on the stone step, and the other in doors; then Birdseye came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120013"></xptr>up, and Pickett and Hamilton stood right in the front of him, in the middle of the highway; and one of them, I cannot say which, said shoot; I rather think it was Birdseye, he said shoot again; and then they repeated a few words of a song:"Shoot at random in a wood,"At some curious lady wheresoe'er she stood." then Hamilton said, go it; and then Birdseye made a rush, seemingly to seize the gun; with that, before he got within half a yard of the muzzle of the gun I heard the report.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the gun go off? - A. I cannot say, I believe he had it against his hip, Birdseye fell; I saw no more then, but came out of door's to go to East's house, Birdseye was then brushing his wound, and looking at it; then he got weak, and slipped down, and called to Cowley, and said, Cowley, give me hold of your hand, for I am a dead man; then there was a cry where East was, they said he was gone out backwards through his garden, and into Mr. Berry's field; I immediately went after him, in pursuit, to take him, and when I got into Mr. Berry's field, about half way up it, I saw William East in an alley between a gentleman's pleasure ground and a nursery ground; as soon as he saw me he came towards me, and as soon as I got pretty near him, he said, I hope in the Lord I have not killed him; I immediately said, I fancy you have, or very near; but you must go back again with me, and answer for what you have done; upon which he replied, and said, I do not care where I go, or what you do to me, it was all his own act and deed, for he aggravated me to it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When you first saw the deceased he was in a great rage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Mr. Const, can you carry it any further?</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. A.Certainly not, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Mr. Knapp, you do not mean to say he did not kill the man?</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. A. We mean to shew, by evidence, that the gun went off by accident, occasioned by the man seizing it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. On Wednesday the 11th of July, I was standing at tea, and heard a noise in the street; I looked out, and saw East, the prisoner, go by in a passion; he swore he would be d - d to hell, if he followed him, if he would not shoot him; Birdseye then came up, with two others, and was going to turn into the Plough, but turned back again, and said, he would go and see what he would do; and then East came out with the gun, and said, he would shoot him, and he told him to shoot away; and he said he would be d - d to hell if he would not shoot him if he came near him; then there was some conversation, which I did not hear, I was at forty yards distance; and then somebody said, go it; and then I heard the report; he said to me, God bless you do what you can for me, I am a dead man; I took two small shot out of his side where the wound was; I looked after the man, and he was brought back; I asked him how he could do such a rash action; and he said, we might hang him if we would, for if he was aggravated to it, and if it was to do again he should do the same.</p>
               <p>The Court being of opinion that it was too much to say, upon the evidence, that the gun went off by accident; and also, too much to say, under the circumstances of aggravation, that it was wilful murder; the Jury pronounced a verdict of</p>

                  </hi>. I have been for some years officially connected with the Consulate of the Netherlands in London, and reside in Back Road, St. George's—in consequence of information, on Tuesday evening, 21st May, about eight o'clock, I went to No. 10, Back Church Lane, to a room on the first floor—I found the prisoner there alone—I had no one with me, I left two gentlemen outside, Mr. Kerkhoeven and Mr. De Pries—De Pries is em<lb></lb>ployed by me—when I went in I shook hands with the prisoner, and said, "Well, Mr. Zeigert, how do you do?"—he said he did not know me—I said I was the agent of the Dutch Consul-General, and I gave him my card—I asked him if he knew a man of the name of Meygerink, and a woman of the name of Anna Rihorst—he said yes, he knew them both—I asked if he knew they were both in custody at Amsterdam—he said he had heard something about it, but he did not believe it—I told him that they had told the Magistrate at Amsterdam that he was making false coupons and giving them to them—he said, "They can tell what they like, but I know nothing about it; it is very easy, too, for the people in Amsterdam to say I did it, because they know I am a bad character"—he said that Meygerink knew lie (Zeigert) had been in prison for eight years in Prussia for forgery there—I asked him if he had got any forms that he made coupons on, that he was working in lithography—he paid no, he did it before, but not in London—I said, "There is a gentleman outside; if you will permit it, I will call him"—that was Mr. Kerkhoeven—I said he was the owner of the coupons—he is the gentleman whose name is signed at the foot of the genuine coupons—I did not say anything of that to Zeigert, I only asked him</p>

               <p>if he would permit me to call the gentleman up stairs, and he could talk with him—he said, "Yes, sir, let him come up"—Mr. Kerkhoeven then came up—I said to him, "This is Mr. Zeigert"—I was talking to him in his own language—he is a High Dutchman, but he was talking all the time in Low German, that is very near Dutch—we could understand each other—he is a German—Mr. Kerkhoeven conversed with Zeigert about the coupons—he asked him about small coupons for two guilders ninety-seven cents—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it, but he would give an explanation before he would get the blame by the people—Mr. Kerkhoeven asked him what his business was—he said he was a painter and made sketches—Mr. Kerkhoeven asked if he would show him any of the sketches—he did so—they were landscape sketches—Mr. Kerkhoeven asked if he knew Meygerink—he said he knew them both—Mr. Kerkhoeven then asked if he might look in his box, that was standing under the bed—he told him it would be better for him if he had got anything to do with it, to tell him, and if he had got any forms or stones, or lithographs, to give them to him.

               <p>some black and blue ink—before Mr. Kerkhoeven came I said to the prisoner, "This is very fine work; this is a bank note of the Netherlands"—he said in English, "No, no, not money"—I said, "Yes, it is"—I told Palmer what it was, and Palmer said to me, "Tell him that I charge him with having stones in his possession; there is a proof of a note of the Netherlands, and he is my prisoner from this time, and not to say anything more unless he wants"—he said, "Very well," and at the same time he turned very pale—we asked before that if he was working with these tools—he said he used them for painting—when this piece of black oilcloth was produced, Palmer said, "Look here, here are letters upon this; ask him what that is for"—I asked him, and he said, "This is only what I rub it over with"—there are letters visible here—it is in the same state as it was then—I don't think it has been used since Palmer took it away—here are the same letters on this that are on the stone, "Mint billet," and here is the form of the note, the same that is on the note—when Mr. Kerkhoeven came in all these things were lying on the table—he took the stone in his hand, examined it, and said to me, "Well, this is very luckily found out; a bank note of the Netherlands"—I think he spoke to the prisoner about it, but I do not remember—he was removed in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I have had great experience in handwriting and lithography—I have examined the stones and the coupons—I have not the slightest doubt that the forged coupon has been struck from this stone—all these are tools which would be necessary to execute such work, and the acids and other things would be necessary—I believe the name of Schultz on this coupon and the letter signed "Schultz" are written by the same hand.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi>). This matter was placed in my hands by the Consul-General of the Netherlands—I took the prisoner into custody in Back Church Lane, on Wednesday, 22nd May—I discovered these stones, the inks, and other things, under the circumstances that have been detailed by Mr. Prokop—I have kept them in my possession ever since—there was no ink on the stones at that time; that was put on two days after—I have had this oilcloth in my possession ever since—nothing has been done with that; Mr. Smart examined it—I got this impression from it, but nothing has been put upon it—the roller was very damp when I found it, and the ink came off on your fingers if you touched it—before I took the prisoner into custody there was some conversation between him and Mr. Prokop in a foreign language—he said nothing in English.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have these things been in your own personal possession and care? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The tools were locked up in my own cupboard, the stones and oilcloth were locked up in a store-room attached to the office—they were never out of my possession—what Mr. Smart did was done in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Prokop—in cones<lb></lb>quence of his directions I stayed with the prisoner on the Tuesday night at No. 10, Back Church Lane—about two o'clock in the morning we made some coffee—I asked if he wanted some bread—he said no, he could not eat—he sat for a little while, and then he said, "What a wonder that the man in Amsterdam (meaning Meygerink) did not say that he won these false notes by playing cards! then he need not say that I made them"—he was quiet for a little while, and then I said, "Perhaps the man made them himself"—he pointed to his breast, and said, "No, he cannot do it, lam the lithographer"—then he was quiet for a little while, and then he had a sort of a fit like—he began to tremble all over—I was frightened, and said,</p>

               <p>"What is the matter, Mr. Ziegert"—he said, "Oh! oh! that bad Pru<lb></lb>ssian"—I said again, "What is the matter?"—he said they had made him so unlucky.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you remain with him all night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was left there by Mr. Prokoy—I am not a countryman of the prisoner—I speak half Holland, and he speaks half Dutch, we understand one another. (<hi rend="italic">The letter, being translated, was:</hi>—"In regard to the Meygerink affair, I can only at the most surmise, which I am ready at any time to give.—Schultz.")</p>

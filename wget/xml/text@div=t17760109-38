               <p>I live in the back parlour of Rotheram's house, next room to where he lives; I was at home all the week he was out; on Saturday I cleaned the passage; I did not see the door open or a jar; in the evening I saw the door a jar, I called Mr. Rotheram you may have a light, I received no answer; I went to the public house to enquire for him, when I came back the lodgers were in the room: I go by Rotheram's door frequently in a day, I did not perceive any thing of it being open till six in the evening; then I called the lodgers out.</p>
               <p>ROTHERAM. The box of the lock of the door was forced open, and lay two yards from the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Might it not be pulled to after it was broke open so as to make it shut fast without some force being used again? - It shuts very close, a piece of paper might make it stick.</p>

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> These last two charges of Peters and Boxall were not made by you at the police court were they? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were not; they have been made since—I have Onions's papers in my possession—I have not gone through them for the purpose of ascertaining what further charges could be made against him, nor has any one—Peters disputed the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and has sued me for it—I did not call Onions as a witness—I cannot tell you when I paid Peters, without referring to the account—I believe it was not before I gave Onions into custody, I believe it to be since; it appears that I was put in the Court by Peters on 14th March, and he was given into custody on 8th March—I did not want to charge Peters 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a set off, for Onions's time in going down to Kingston—Peters and I had a running account, I owed Peters 21 at that time—I requested my clerk to ask Peters if he ought not to pay for the man's time—I did not set up that at the County Court, I did not go into court with it—I requested my clerk to pay the money, in consequence of finding I could not make a set off against it; Peters refused to pay it, and there it ended—he said Onions had borrowed no money of him—the only proposition between the prosecutor and myself was that which is contained in this agreements, we did not enter into any other patent, there was no talk of embarking in anything, but what was connected with this business—the rag mill was all connected with the business—the patent is for knives, plates, and bars for a rag mill—there are other things mentioned in the agreement—I never entered into any separate arrangement with Mr. Onions, except what is contained in this agreement—I have assisted him in taking out two patents connected with these mills, which were to supersede the original patent—I do not know anything about these patents—I was not able to work them when Mr. Onions joined me, nor can I now; neither can he—I have never worked them since I gave him into custody; I have only employed three or four labourers on the premises to clear up the place at different times, but not continually—a circular has been printed and circulated, but I am not prepared to say whether it was before or after Mr. Onions was given into custody—it was printed by my direction—I will swear it was not printed after he was given into custody—I refused Mr. Onions entrance to the premises, after I had discharged him; I did not then try to work the patent myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you threaten to sell off the plant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I wrote to him to that effect; but I never received any answer from him, I did from Mr. Bath an attorney—I cannot tell whether it was after that answer, that I gave Mr. Onions into custody—I cannot say whether I gave him into custody on his threatening to enforce the arbitration clause, in consequence of my having threatened to do something which he did not approve of—a copy of my letter is in existence—I really cannot tell you from recollection, whether I gave him into custody after or before that.</p>

               <p>account to Mr. Brownhead, and he wanted to deduct between 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told his clerk that whatever Mr. Onions, claim was I would settle with him; upon which Mr. Brownhead paid my full demand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was it you were under this false charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In October last—Onions came down to give me a character, and he did so—he had known me about three years—there were six or seven other witnesses, I think—I did not pay the expenses of any of the witnesses to my character, as they did not apply for them—Mr. Brownhead owed me money in October—Mr. Onions told me that he had expended, for himself and other witnesses, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not say, "You can make it a set off against Brownhead's account"—I told Onions there was between 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be deducted by Mr. Brownhead, but that I should get my full account, and then settle with him—I did not say that at Kingston; it was in February or March, because the principal part of the work was done after October—he named it to me about January or February, that he thought his expenses down at Kingston were about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that that would satisfy him very well; he did not say that was to be set off against my account with Mr. Brownhead—I have never offered to pay him—he has never applied, and I do not consider it a debt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you consider it a debt when he had paid 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to your witnesses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I considered it was friendship—I told him I would pay him any charge, but he did not make any—I never went into Court to give my evidence—Mr. Brownhead sent his clerk to me, and it was settled that I would not take off the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that money was for Mr. Onions, time for going to Kingston—he one day paid for the refreshments of the witnesses, and he said he had expended 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

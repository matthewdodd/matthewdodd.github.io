                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, C</hi> 9). I took the prisoner—I was in plain clothes—I told her I was a sergeant of police, and was authorized to take her in custody for receiving a draft from India, from some gentleman whose name I did not know, signing Emma Prebble's name on the draft, and obtaining 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the bank—she said, "Yes, I know I have done wrong; but I had been authorized to go to the bank previously to receive money also"—she also told me that she had received money from the bank since—I told her I must search her boxes, and that I required some papers, some letters from India—I saw an envelope in her hand; I took it from her and found by the post-mark upon it, that it came from India—I searched the boxes and found two half-sheets of paper—I told her that was not the whole; that I wanted all—upon that, the man that was in the room living with the prisoner, took from her purse a letter which the prpsecutrix stated was written by the gentleman from India.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you tell her you would take her on a charge of forgery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she did not say "Forgery! then I have done wrong"—she said, "I know I did wrong"—I arrested her at 2, Church-street, Soho—I am confident she did not use the word "then"—it was on a former occasion that she said, "I have done so by her directions"—when I told her that she was charged with forging the name of the prosecutrix on an order on the bank, she said that she had drawn money from the bank on former occasions—she did not say, "I have written her name on other occasions;" or anything like it—to the best of my belief she said she had had money from the bank previously, but whether she mentioned any name I won't be positive—she said that the money she had been authorized to receive from the bank on former occasions, was for the maintenance of the child then in the room—she said she had since received a draft from a gentleman—she did not mention any date—she said, "The last draft that was sent to me was sent in my name, and my name was on the draft"—she did not say "Out of that draft I gave her 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—she said, "What I have done was for the support of the child"—she did not use the word "justice"—she attempted to conceal the letter from India, because she gave the purse to the man as she thought unperceived by me, and he immediately put it in his pocket—she did not tell me where the prosecutrix lived at the time—I am quite confident that she did not tell me that what she did, was by the authority of Mrs. Prebble.</p>

I am married, and live at 3, Melford-place—I know the prosecutrix and the prisoner—I knew them both whilst the prosecutrix was living at the prisoner's house—I was present when a letter arrived containing an order for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mrs. Prebble and the prisoner were present—Mrs. Prebble asked the prisoner to go to the bank to receive the amount of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told her to sign her name and to receive the money.</p>

Prebble—I did not see the ink used at all—the letter was opened and sent to the bank a few minutes after—Mrs. Peck wanted a half<lb></lb>crown to go for the money—Mrs. Prebble had not got it, nor had I—she borrowed the money—I did not hear her borrow it—Mr. Peck first spoke to me about coming here—that was last Sunday morning—I had not, before that, heard of Mrs. Peck being taken into custody—Mr. Peck asked me if I should be able to come down to the court, because Mrs. Peck had been locked up about some money that she had taken from Mrs. Prebble—I said I would come if my husband would give me liberty, because I was just off a sick bed—he said I might as well come if I could—he asked me if I remembered the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. order, and I said yes, very well—that was all he said.</p>

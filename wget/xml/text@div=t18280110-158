            . I am a waiter at the Six Bells public-house, Chelsea. On Christmasday, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in the street, lying on the curb for nearly an hour - I did not know him before; between nine and ten o'clock I saw Smith go up, and take hold of him by the collar; he asked his name; he said it was Davies, but a lad said it was Bull. Smith said,"You must go along with me;" Bull then got up, and went a few yards with him; I saw a scuffle began by Bull, who tried to pull himself away from Smith, who held him by the collar; Smith fell down, in the struggle, on his hands and knees, with great violence. Bull ran away as hard as he could. Anderson ran after him; Smith got up, and went after Anderson; in about half an hour I picked up a large key in the road, and gave it to Smith when he called next morning; Smith was intoxicated, but he was capable of walking - he staggered a little; no blows passed between them, or I must have seen them - I was within a yard of Smith - he had something in his hand, but I could not see what; he did not say "Here is a warrant," nor any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing to shew Bull why he took him? A. No.</p>

            . I was apprentice to Smith. I know Bull by sight. On the morning of Christmas-day master came home, and Williams, the milkman, came in, and said,"Make haste, or Bull will be gone;" master went out to look after him, but he was gone; he came in, and said Williams had given young Bull in charge; I was coming home in the evening, and saw Bull sitting on the curb; I went and told my master, who came with me - he was still sitting there; master asked his name; he said Davies or Rees, I do not know which; I said it was Bull; my master collared him, and asked him to give an account of himself - my master was a parish constable - he had no staff in his hand, nor any warrant; they went on together two or three yards, and Bull struggled to get away; master fell on his hands and knees, and Bull ran away; I followed, calling Stop thief! but soon returned to my master; he went to Dr. Daley's, who said he could not do any thing to him, but said he had better go to the hospital; my master lived about a fortnight after. No blows passed between them - master was a little in liquor.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Chelsea. I saw Smith a little before ten in the evening of Christmas-day; he shewed me his left hand, which was dislocated in the last joint of the thumb, and had a bruise on the back part of it; I succeeded in reducing the dislocation - it was produced by a fall, in my opinion; it went on well for eight days, and that evening unfavourable symptoms came on, and on the afternoon of the 10th he died, from a locked jaw, produced by the bruises on his hand.</p>

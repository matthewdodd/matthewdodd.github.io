                  </hi>. I am a publican, and live at Lisson-grove. I have known the prisoner about a year and a half—he had quitted my service about twelve months before—on the 4th of January, a pair of window-guards were taken off, and laid on the counter—I saw them, and in a short time I missed them, and no one knew any thing of them—the house was closed, and a short time after the policeman knocked, and asked it I had lost any thing—I said, "Yes, the two guards belonging to the doors"—I went to the station-house, and saw them, and the prisoner—I had not seen him at my house that evening.</p>

I had been to Mr. Friend's house to sell something to the bar-man, and meeting some customers, I got drinking pretty freely—the bar-man then refused to serve me any more—this property was throwing about outside, among some girls and young men—at last it came to me, by whom I do not know—I was stopped, and told the truth.</p>
               <p>(John Leader a coach-plater, of No. 5, Mead-row, Lambeth, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

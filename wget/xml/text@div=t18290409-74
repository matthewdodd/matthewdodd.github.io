            . Q. Do you keep a slop-shop? A. A sale-shop - I have seen these things within a year; I have hardly been in the shop a year and a half - none of them were found on the person of Chapman; a duplicate was found on him - he had a pair of trousers and a rap on; I do not claim them as mine, because I am not sure they belong to me; I did ask Chapman about them - I told Mr. Scott that a pair of trousers were found on Chapman: I know he is without father and mother, and has no friends - he was in great distress when I took him; I rather believe the trousers to be mine, but I left him in possession of them, because I am not sure they are mine; I believe a duplicate was found on a person named Casey, who was before the Magistrate, but is now at large.</p>

            , one evening about three months ago - it was since Christmas; there were seven pairs of shoes and a black cloth waistcoat - I cannot say how much I got, I believe it was ten shillings; I gave some of the money to Barr, and kept some myself - I believe I went eight times, once with a waistcoat, sometimes with shoes; the two last times there were two pairs in each parcel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you often go to the shop of Mr. Davis? A. Twice a week sometimes, but not every week - Mr. Davis was sometimes from home; I saw things hanging at the door, clothes and shoes, in the day time - I have passed the shop before I knew the prisoner; I have not known him above three-quarters of a year - I have a pair of trousers belonging to Mr. Davis; I pawned a coat and a pair of trousers at Mr. Wells', at Kensington, and I took a coat and a pair of trousers to another pawnbroker's - Barr gave me the trousers I have on to wear; I went with Casey to Mr. Gould's, the pawnbroker - I told the prosecutor I had a pair of his trousers on; no one was present when the prisoner gave them me to pawn.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say Mr. Davis was there sometimes? A. Yes; and then I did not speak to the prisoner - they asked me my name at the other pawnbroker's, but not at Mr. Gould's, because they knew me; I live with my father and mother.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you tell your father and mother the prisoner gave you these things, before the trousers were found on you? A. No; I only told Casey - I afterwards told Mr. and Mrs. Davis.</p>

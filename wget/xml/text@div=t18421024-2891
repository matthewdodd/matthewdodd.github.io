                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Curtis, of Riding-house-lane, Marylebone. About two o'clock in the afternoon of the 10th of October, I was delivering goods from a van, in St. James's-street—two gentlemen came out of St. James's-street—the tail of my van was down—there was not room for them both to pass—one of them gently passed by, the prisoner followed, and put his hand into the gentleman's right-hand coat pocket, and took out a purse—the gentleman said, "Halloo! halloo!—the prisoner turned, and threw the purse into my van—I took it up, it was a net purse with money in it—I gave it to the gentleman, jumped down, and followed the prisoner—he ran as hard as he could—I took him at the end of St. James's-square—he struggled very much—I said he must come back to the gentleman—in turning out of a court he said, "Don't be hard with me; if you do, you may send me for life"—I brought him back to the van—the gentleman was gone—two gentlemen ou came up, and said, "You must take him to Vine-street," which I did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical student. I was in attend<lb></lb>ance at the London Hospital on the 26th of August, a boy was brought in, I do not know his name—he had two penetrated wounds on the abdo<lb></lb>men—they had been made by some hard substance—they were gun-shot wounds—one of them penetrated into the cavity of the abdomen—he died three days after—I examined the body, and found one wound commencing with the cavity of the abdomen—I cannot say whether the intestines were wounded—I did not take the trouble to examine—it was stated he hid been shot—nobody examined the intestines—the death was caused, un<lb></lb>doubtedly, by the wounds producing inflammation of the intestines—they might have been inflamed without being wounded, being connected with the external wound, it was sure to be the case—the bowels were gene<lb></lb>rally inflamed, which a wound of the abdomen would cause.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 26th of August, abort twenty-five minutes to seven o'clock in the evening, I heard a shot in Went-worth-street—I was told something, and went to the prisoner's father's house—I saw the prisoner there, up stairs, and asked him where the boy was who had shot the other with a pistol—he said it was himself, hut it was not with a pistol, but with a small cannon—I asked him where the cannon was—he said, "I will give it to you"—he came down stairs, went into a room, and brought it out—(<hi rend="italic">producing one between two and three inches long</hi>)—I asked him what it was loaded with—he said with powder and a piece of paper rammed in pretty tight—I went to a doctor's in High-street, Whitechapel, with him, and found the deceased there—he was wounded about the abdomen—his name was William Walker—I do not recolled whether the prisoner spoke to him—I asked Walker if he knew the pri<lb></lb>soner before—he said he did not—the prisoner did not say that was not the boy he had wounded.</p>

                  </hi>. I can on business with several partners under the style of Jackson &amp; Graham as upholsterers, cabinet-makers and general house furnishers—we have two factories, one attached to the ware house in Oxford Street and the other in Ogle Street; they are perfectly dis<lb></lb>tinct—the course of business at the Oxford Street factory has not been altered, we were working piecework by the union book; by the union I do not mean the Cabinet-maker's Alliance; but a West End society; that is a trades union of the workpeople—the union book is a book that was agreed, upon by the masters and men many years ago—that mode of labour has not been changed at all in Oxford Street—at the Ogle Street factory up to 13th November last the men were paid by day work or by the hour; there was no piece work done there—on the 13th November we gave a notice of our intention to change that system to piece work at what is called "lump prices;" that means that the contract with the workman is for the entire finishing of the article, to take a contract to do so much work at a price—in the notice we gave we offered employment to all the workpeople on the new system—we gave the notice on the 13th that the change would take place on Monday, the 16th—I did not know any of the defendants previous. to the 13th, I had only seen Matthews who had once worked in our place; he was not working there at that time—the other defendants had never worked for us—in consequence of a communication from our foreman I con<lb></lb>sented to receive a deputation from the Alliance Cabinet-makers Association and I did so on the 16th about 11 or 12 o'clock—before I was asked to receive the deputation the workshop in Ogle Street had been opened for the men to come to work under the new system; only one man and two boys presented themselves—before that there had been about forty in the cabinet shop—the deputation consisted of Ham, Reed, and a man named Bright; Reed began the conversation and Bright followed—Reed asked me whether I was inclined to alter the terms upon which we were prepared to do business, if I would allow the prices to be determined by a shop committee—I said "No"—there was a long rambling conversation after that which had nothing to do with it in particular—I was asked by Bright whether the idea had entered my head that I should not be able to get workpeople—I said no, it never had, that with good shops and good pay we should always be able to get men—they then retired—I did not in any way entertain their proposals; I told them that we wanted to get the best men in the trade, that they might be able to earn what they were worth—after that, on the 17th, we received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Head</hi>: "Alliance Cabinet-maker's Association, 3, Mitre Square. 17th November, 74.

               <p>country newspapers for workpeople, and on the week following the 16th I think we had one or two applications—about the 24th November I saw Matthews near our factory in Ogle Street with a man named Tommany—I generally went to the factory between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, and left between 10 and 11 o'clock—sometimes I went there two or three times a day—I always went there in the morning—it was between 9 and 11 o'clock in the morning on the 24th that I saw Matthews and the other—they were walking up and down in Ogle Street within about twenty yards of the factory—they did not enter the factory; they were sometimes 60 or 70 yards from it—they passed up and down—they went up to the factory—when I saw them first they were on the other side of the road—there is a chapel opposite the factory—I can't tell how long they remained there—I only saw them when I went in and when I came out-for about five weeks after that I saw Matthews near the factory every morning—different people were with him, sometimes Ham, sometimes Reed, and a man whose name I believe is Cavers—they were walking up and down, and if any one came apparently applying at the factory or coming near the factory they generally crossed over and spoke to them—I saw that done—I have seen them as late as 5 o'clock in the evening and before 9 o'clock in the morning—I have been there: when they were not there, but as a rule they were there—I don't think I ever saw Ham, Reed and Matthews all three together—I have seen Weiler and Hibbert there for about three weeks, the first eleven days in February and the last week in January, up to the time when they were arrested—I generally saw them when I went to the factory between 9 and. 11 o'clock and when I came out, and when I went at other times—they were in company with other men whose names I did not know, walking up and down and. standing just outside the factory—I have also seen them at midday when the men came out to dinner, about 1 o'clock, and also when they came out in the evening after work—I have seen Hibbert and Weiler together constantly, as well as with others—I have seen about nine persons so con-ducting themselves opposite the factory—I ought to qualify that by saying I have seen nine only for a definite period—I have seen more than ten at one time, of' whom Hibbert and Weiler were part—when workpeople approached the door of the factory they spoke to them and talked to them and walked away with them; that has been at the corner of the factory, which is about 20 yards from the door; the door is in a side street called: Ogle Mews—they have been close to the wall of the factory—I have seen as many as nine or ten at 1 o'clock when the men came out to dinner, and at 2 o'clock when they came back—I did not like it—this kind of-conduct ceased to a great extent after this prosecution commenced, but I saw the prisoners about there occasionally—before the prosecution commenced we bad the very greatest difficulty in keeping persons in our service; after the prose<lb></lb>cution was commenced we had not equal difficulty; we had plenty of enquiries.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HOPWOOD</hi>. Ours is a very old firm, and a very extensive one—it might be taken that we discharged the men, we told them that we should not do day work any more—they were told definitely on the Friday that they were discharged on the Saturday unless they chose to take our new terms—the first thing the deputation asked was why the men had been discharged on Saturday—the Oxford Street factory had been working on piece work—that which we proposed at Ogle Street was a different mode to that—the men did not tell me that if we chose to adopt the Oxford Street</p>

               <p>system at Ogle Street they would not offer any opposition—I did not know that that was the case—they did not ask me to work at Ogle Street on the union book—they asked me whether I intended to work by the union; book as used in Oxford Street, and I said I did not—that was a book agreed on in 1811—when they asked me that question I had the very gravest doubt whether they wanted me to work by that, because their society does not work by it, and does not understand it—the defendants work lump work them selves; piece work at lump prices—I merely understood that they wanted to know what I was going to do—the system at Oxford Street was piece work in parts, our proposal was piece work in the lump at a lump price, say a table or desk, for which a working drawing is given—frankly our object in. doing that was not benevolence, it was to prevent ourselves from being robbed; I don't think that is too strong a term—it would not give us the advantage of making a bargain with anybody to do the whole at a less price than somebody else—we had no fixed price, but the same price would always be quoted for the same work again—no man is bound to take a contract—we should be entitled to make a bargain with each individual, what he would do it for—I should think I have seen ten men at a time about six times at least, spreading over three months'—at about 2 o'clock, when the men were returning to their work, a little before 2 o'clock as a rule—there were some men from Messrs. Howard's factory which is about 150 yards off—their dinner hour was the same as ours—none of the men ever spoke to me—I don't know whether or not I saw any of our old hands in the street at any time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CRISP</hi>. We had about forty men employed at Ogle Street in November—Stride was one; Parr was foreman; Woodrow, Jewell, Carr and Russell—Jewell was the only man who remained in the service with the two boys—Carr is foreman of the polishers, and has been there all along; the notice would not apply to him—Woodrow did not remain, he went out on the Saturday or Monday—I don't quite know how Jewell was paid prior to the discharge of the men—afterwards he was paid by piece work I think—I can't say for certain, I mean lump work, I believe he had to make a contract, but I don't know, because some of the men began by working day time again, to finish the work that was in hand—I can't tell 'you whether Jewell was one of these, my foreman will be able to tell you—I believe all the men who entered the service after 24th November adopted the piece work system, the foreman can tell you—I know several:' of them began day work to finish the work in hand, and after that they went on at lump work—when they left nearly every man had one or two pieces of furniture that he was making to finish, and some of that was not finished for five or six months—during that time payment by the hour was not going on, they were working lump work—I think all the finishing was day work, and that has continued up to the present time—their may have; been one man working day work to finish—we manufacture our own cabinet work—during the strike we had to buy a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> things—a great many upholsterers in London do not manufacture, they are supplied by trade working masters—as a rule they are cheap houses and can under sell us, except in machine made furniture—our adopting the lump system would. not be quite the same thing—we should be more able to compete with the cheap houses, it would benefit the men—it would benefit both parties—it was not entirely to compete with the cheap houses; in part it was—I made a note of the time when I saw Reed (<hi rend="italic">referring</hi>), it was the second week in</p>

               <p>December, and the first week in January, and I think on no other occasions—Ogle Street is not above 80 yards long—there is a public-house at the corner of Ogle Street and Foley Street—I don't know the name of it; it is kept by a man named Tennant—Ogle Mews leads out of Ogle Street, it is a <hi rend="italic">culled sac</hi>—the entrance to the factory is in Ogle Mews—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a very good map of the place—the public-house is about 30 yards from the factory—I think it is frequented chiefly by our men—Messrs. Howard's men frequent three other public-houses, they would not come that way.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARRIS</hi>. Matthews came to work for us on 4th Octo<lb></lb>ber, 1872, and remained till March 28th, 1874—I expect I saw him every morning when he was there—I. have no doubt about his being in the street on 24th November, I never had any doubt about it, I believe he was there the whole of the week—I said before the Magistrate "I saw a man whom believe to be the defendant Matthews"—Laws told that his name was Matthews by the men who worked with him and knew him—I did not know his name when he was working with us—I asked the other people who he was, and they said his name was Matthews, that he had spoken to them and they knew him—I have no doubt he is the man—I saw him within 20 yards of the factory walking up and down—I have heard of a system called the "sweating" system; I think I can explain what it means; it is not the lump system; as I understand it is this, when a man takes a contract per lump he is allowed to have his son or a lad as an apprentice to him or to work for him, and he takes all: the money and pays his son what he likes, and he reaps the benefit and not the master—piece work is where a man is for instance paid for parts of a table, such as the claw, the pillar, or the top, and the lump system is a contract system, by which the parts would not be separated as you mean, but they are separated in as much as the machinery does part, but he contracts for the whole-table—it was the lump system that I wanted the men to adopt—I believe that system is not known in the trade as the sweating system; I have explained what I believe to be the sweating system.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in London Street, Fitzroy Square—I am now in the employment of Messrs.

Jackson &amp; Graham, of their intention to alter the mode of payment—on Saturday 14th, a meeting was held on the subject at the King and Queen public-house, at the corner of Foley Street; it was a meeting of the workmen of the firm belonging to the society, Ham was the chairman, Weiler and Reed were present—there was a dis<lb></lb>cussion upon the subject of Messrs. Jackson &amp; Graham's proposed altera<lb></lb>tion, and an arrangement was made that none of us should go in to work at the factory again until it was announced by the executive committee that the shop should be thrown open again, it was closed until then—we were not to commence work again till we had orders from "the executive committee—it was proposed that a deputation should wait on Mr. Graham, to see if he could make arrangements for our coming into work again under the old system—a resolution was passed that we should sign the book each day at the society house, the King and Queen, between 10 and 12 o'clock in the morning and 2 and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> o'clock in the afternoon, to receive strike pay, that was a guinea a week, the regular strike pay—I heard something said by some of the executive, I won't be certain whether it was the" chairman or secretary, about advertising in the. different papers and sending to the different secretaries of the society to block all towns they had corres<lb></lb>pondence with to prevent men from being sent to fill our places—I spoke as to my desire of going back and trying the new system, and I was scarcely allowed a hearing—I said there would be other men to take our places from all parts of the country, only too glad to get in if we came out, and that was the answer I received, that they would advertise-after the deputation had waited upon Mr. Graham, there was another meeting, on the 16th—Mr. Ham took the chair—the matter was discussed by several members, I among the number, and each had a hearing but myself—there was one or two besides that were anxious to go back, but they said' they would abide by the decision of the executive committee, that they should like to go back and try it, but they would not if the executive wished" them not—Reed was present at that meeting, and I am almost certain Weiler was—one of the members; I can't say which, said "Had we not better keep some pickets on the. outside of the factory to watch the premises; I will go as one," and the chairman remarked "Don't be in too great a hurry, that will come on very likely by-and-bye; if you listen to me you will wait till you get orders from us"—the subject of picketing was dis<lb></lb>cussed among them, but nothing further, as I know of, arranged—on the Tuesday, I resigned my membership of the society, and on the Wednesday morning after breakfast I went back to my work in Ogle Street, and except when I have been ill I have been working there ever since—I did not see any picketing the first day—I did some five or six days after, or it may be a day or two more; I first noticed some men walking up and down outside the window close to the head of my bench where I could look out and have a view of them all day long—I don't remember who I first saw—it was in Ogle Street—ray place looks into Ogle Street, facing the church—it was generally after breakfast that I saw them walking up and down—I</p>

               <p>scarcely ever saw them before breakfast that I remember, and it continued up to 7 o'clock in the evening more or less—our breakfast is at 8 o'clock, we have half an hour—to the best of my recollection I have not. seen any<lb></lb>body when I have gone to work in the morning, not to notice them; sometimes it was dark in the morning—this picketing continued as far as I was cognisant of it up to the second Tuesday, in February, which was the Tuesday prior to my going to the Police Court on the Thursday—it was about the same each day during the whole of that time, from morning till evening; if I looked out at many different hours I would see them—I have seen from two to four men engaged in this occupation, sometimes two, some<lb></lb>times three, sometimes four—I have seen all the defendants engaged in it, some more than others, Matthews most—he was there very often, in all weathers—next to Matthews Weiler was most frequently there—I saw Ham one week almost every day, at intervals—being a member of the executive, he was similar to a sergeant walking about to see that, the men were on duty—Hibbert was the last I saw there—I saw him the last morning of any—he was walking up and down in the same way—I-saw Reed at several intervals, but not very frequently, he was doing the same as the others—I might have seen him before, but I was not aware who he was till I asked, and after that I noticed him—he stopped me one morning as I was going back from breakfast—I can scarcely: say which of the defendants I have seen together—I have seen. Reed in conversation with the others that were on picket more than once or twice—I have not seen the whole five together that I am aware of—but I have seen Reed with each of them at different times, walking up and down—have seen several of them together walking up and down, I can. scarcely tell which, because I little thought it would come to this, or I should have taken greater notice—when I have seen them, whether together or not, they have been doing the same thing as the others—I have been spoken to by Matthews, on one occasion—fol<lb></lb>lowed me into. the Wheatsheaf public-house in Upper Marylebone Street, when I was coming from my work going to my dinner he followed me along with some of the new hands till he saw where we went, and then he came in and commenced conversation about the work, and who the men were that were with me—he then asked me if I would have a glass of ale with him—I said I had no objection—after that he stood a glass of wine or gin, and he left me at the counter and turned his conversation to. the new hands—he tried to influence them, I can't say exactly what he said—he persuaded them by all means to come out—as near as I can recollect he said "Don't you think you are acting very foolish to stay in there and work, when if you come out we can get you other shops, as good as that or better"—they said they did not see as they were doing anything detrimental to their cause, they wanted work, they understood that they were giving very good prices 'and they had always been used to. piece work, therefore they should try it for the present—he then asked me if I could not influence them to come out, and why did 1 not come round to the society house with him on the next lodge night and get reinstated to, the society again—I said "<hi rend="italic">I</hi> am very well satisfied where I am, I am very comfortable at present, and until I see things take a change I wish to remain where I am"—I told him that all I wanted was good work and to be well paid for it, which I had got at present—he said he was surprised at me after my being a leading man in the society at Bristol as the secretary for some time, setting such a bad example—he wished me to come out and they would support me, and anything in</p>

               <p>reason that I wanted they would furnish me for coming out, he had got that authority—I still stood to my previous answer—when he was leaving there was another person in the trade with him that I was not acquainted with, and he said "Mind, I hope I shall see you on the next lodge night, I shall be looking out for you, I shall speak to them about you, we want to get you back again as you will be useful to us"—I did not go—I saw Matthews again a few days after—he frequently spoke to me on the subject, he would follow me—we generally went to this public-house, being the nearest I passed coming towards my home—on one occasion he said to me "Of-course you are aware you will be called a black, go where you will, and you will find that you won't be able to get any work in any shop in London or else-where where there is any society of ours held"—on one occasion Reed spoke to me as I was-coming from my breakfast, and just going into the factory, he beckoned me and said "How are you. getting on inside, how is things looking with the new hands" and while we were in the midst of conversation Mr. Rawlins, one of our foremen, came up and I went away into the factory—the picketing went on after these conversations just the same as ever.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">HOPWOOD</hi>. I have been ill for some, little time past—we had-two meetings at the lodge-house, one on. the Saturday and one on the Monday after the" deputation had seen, Mr. Graham—I had not been a member of the society ever since I had been in London, only since. I com<lb></lb>menced working for Jackson and Graham—was secretary to the Cabinet-makers' Society at Bristol; it was a society that was understood to protect the interests of the men-against the employers—it is generally understood that a man is considered a black if he opposes himself to the rest of the society—I-have never treated any so I never had occasion for it—at the meeting on the Saturday I most emphatically opposed coming out from Jackson &amp; Graham's; I say that on my bath—I did not vote either time—there was a division; some went to the right and some to the left—the side I happened to be sitting, at the right, voted for coming out—I sat there, but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> did not vote—I never held up my hands—I did not know they were going to divide—I can't say how many went to, the other side of the room—I can't say that one went—I announced on that occasion that I differed from the rest—I had two or three says, and they put me down on each occasion—I heard more than two say they wished to go back; I heard two I am certain besides myself, but there were more than two—I can't say how many were there; all the men that were at work at Jackson &amp; Graham's—I did not go back to work on lump work; I went on at day work for a month or two, finishing the. work I had left unfinished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Crisp.-When I went back to Jackson &amp; Graham's I found one grown man and two boys I think in the shop where I was working—I can't say what work the man was doing; I did not go to look—I was given to understand that he was working day work as-usual, but I can't say—it must have been at the latter end of January that I began to work lump work—it was at my own suggestion that I commenced it, because I could make more money—it was no use-my suggesting, it before; there were the rules of the shop to abide by—when I commenced lump; work I did not have a boy working under me; I had my son with me; he. is almost big enough to be a man; he is between 16 and 17; he would be called a lad in the warehouse—I can't say whether having a lad working working under you is called the "sweating" system; I should not consider it so myself; I can't answer for my fellow-workmen—I remember when piece</p>

               <p>work at lump prices was commenced at Jackson Graham's—there is a distinction between lump work and piece-work at lump prices; that com-menced as soon as the new hands came on—there was a lot of work to be finished, but the new-hands generally, had new jobs given to them—I can't tell you any one of them; there were, several strangers to me, and they were got out again by the pickets—the: lump work began immediately the fresh men came on—I was at day work finishing my jobs—the men who tried to get me away, did not know what system I was on;-of course they were given to understand that the. lump-system would be the system for the future, and so it will be.</p>

                  </hi>, I became foreman-of the cabinet, shop of; Messrs. Jackson &amp; Graham in Upper ogle Street on 5th August, 1873; that was when I entered the service—I continued to be foreman down to November, 1874; up to that time the men were paid by the hour—it was my place as foreman to see that the work was done—found that it was not done in accordance with my requirement—on 13th November, a notice was given of an alteration in the mode of payment—on the morning of; the 16th, when the new system was to commence, one man came to work, the two boys were in—on the Thursday I think I saw all the old workmen, they came to take their tools away—I don't remember any fresh men pre<lb></lb>senting themselves for employment during that week I think Stride came on the-Wednesday; but I am not positive—he continued to work—was paid by the hour for five or six weeks as he was finishing some work—I first noticed the picketing on the; Monday; 23rd November—I am not quite certain which of the defendants were-picketing that first week—I saw men-walking; up and down from about 8 o'clock in the morning until about 5 o'clock in the evening; there were generally two, sometimes: three—some fresh' men presented themselves in the week commencing the 23rd, I think one man called that week and arranged to come in on the following Monday morning; he did come at 6o'clock and remained till 1o'clock, when he went to dinner he then returned and took away his tools—don't know his-name-at that-'time the picketing <hi rend="italic">had</hi>: commenced—dare. say about half a dozen men came in the week beginning on the 23rd, some of them brought in their tool and some did not coma in at all—don't know the names of those that brought their tools in and took them-out-again, because the names were not taken—saw some of the men that applied for work spoken to by the persons that were picketing outside-about three out of the six brought in their tools and took them way again—don't know that I saw those three spoken to but they told me what had happened the first week after the notice was given scarcely anybody applied for work, and no systematic picketing was resorted to, but the week following it co<lb></lb>mmenced—in the week beginning November 30th some fresh hands came in; I think Peter Galliard was the first that came in, but I am not quite positive which week he commenced—the system of the shop was explained; to; him and he accepted the times, it was piece work at lump prices—he is work<lb></lb>ing there still—I have not seen him spoken to by men outside the next man engaged I think was Tame he is working up to the present time—I am not quite positive whether he came in that week—Duck, H. Brown and Baker, I think, came in that week; they are still in the service on piece</p>

               <p>work, lump prices—I noticed the persons outside during these weeks; they were there all day—I have seen all the defendants there from time to time—this continued down to 11th February, when they were taken into custody—I found a difficulty in getting men to come in—the men were walking up and down in front of the premises—that was all that I per<lb></lb>sonally saw them doing; it continued all day, from about 8 o'clock in the morning till about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, there were generally two, sometimes three—I have seen a greater number than that outside the factory, but I could not say they were picketing; by "picketing" I mean watching the premises with the intention of preventing men coming to seek for work—I saw Matthews for about three weeks or more picketing in com<lb></lb>pany with another person—Ham I saw I think for a week—I am not posi<lb></lb>tive whether Reed was there more than a fortnight, and I am not positive whether the two weeks were consecutive—Weiler I saw about three weeks, some weeks were consecutive, and Hibbert I observed about two weeks at the end of the picketing—I can't positively state the number of men that came for employment from 23rd November to 11th February, but I should imagine about twenty or thirty, who did not come in to work—somewhere between" twenty and thirty did come into work, but some left—I distinctly remember-two leaving that is three altogether I did not know that they were going to leave before they left; they did not finish the work on which they-were engaged-after the defendants were in custody new hands applied for work; we had no difficulty in getting hands after that, after the picketing had ceased, and they continued to work on the contract system, at lump prices—since the picketing ceased I do not remember an instance of a man leaving without finishing his work—whilst the picketing existed one or two men made complaints to me, one in particular, Clark.</p>

I should not get a job and should not stay there the picketing did not prevent my going Out, but I-would not go out on account of it—did not wish to be bothered about it; it made it unpleasant for me to go out, and that was why I kept in.</p>

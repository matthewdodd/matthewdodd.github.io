            . I had the care of the house - it is No. 29, Princes-street, Bank. On Saturday, the 10th of November, I came home about twenty-five minutes before six o'clock, I was induced to go to Messrs. Marsden's office - I found the door shut - I went for the key to unlock it, but I found it was unlocked; I opened it, and went in to see if things were safe - I saw the prisoner in a little private room belonging to Mr. Marsden, standing with his back to the bureau, hiding the part which had been broken; he immediately rushed at me, and knocked the candle out of my hand - he did not succeed in getting by me, for I stopped him in the room, and called out Stop thief! and my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290058"></xptr>wife locked us into the room; he begged and prayed for mercy - he said I was a much older man than himself, and he would give me all the money he had, and for God's sake to let him go; when I found the room door was locked, I loosed him - he said, "O good God!" he ran to the window, and tore the blind up - I ran and seized him, and never let him go; he put his hand into his pocket, and dropped some picklock-keys, which the officer afterwards took up in my presence, and a clasp knife was found, which did not belong there; the drawer of the bureau was open, and a bundle of papers was afterwards brought in.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know how these papers got out? A. No - if the prisoner had taken them out, he might have gone off; I did not try whether any of these keys would open the drawers - I think they are too large; I do not know who opened the drawers or the doors - the bureau had been forced open, and the lock off; the prisoner said before the Lord Mayor, that a person sent him to the place; I do not know whether I frightened him, but I did my best to keep him, and cried out Thieves!</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know that one was the property of Mr. Charles Shaw? A. He is one of the proprietors of Bank stock, and I saw him bring it in - they have not been found.</p>

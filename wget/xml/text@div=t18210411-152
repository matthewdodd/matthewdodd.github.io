Daws brought the pillow, bolster, and stand to my room, a day or two before he was taken; he said they were not his own, that they were purchased for 6 s. Next day, Miller came to my room, I asked her if she sent any thing by Daws, she said she sent a bundle, and said they were her own, and it was all right. I understood from her that she was going to leave her place on Saturday; Daws afterwards took them out of my room; they were found at my mother's - he brought them in a bundle and untied them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twenty-one years old. I was in the service of the Governor and Assistants of the Mines Royal, and was employed on board the <hi rend="italic">Olive Branch</hi> barge, of which the prisoner was captain—it was our duty to take copper from Harefield to London manufactured, and from London to Harefield unmanufactured—we got to Harefield on our last journey on Tuesday morning, the 15th of December, and discharged our cargo of unmanufactured goods—the barges have lockers to them, of which our employers in Harefield have one key, and our employers in London another—on Thursday evening, the 17th of December, about five o'clock, I was in company with the prisoner at the Fly mill—copper is kept there—the prisoner took a cake of copper and put it on board the barge—after that we returned to the Fly mill, and I got a pair of tongs, which were lying on a tub, and tried to raise up a copper bowl which was lying on the ground, close by the Fly mill—it had frozen to the ground—the prisoner was then standing at the mill door, about five yards off—I did not succeed in getting the copper bowl then—there was some one coming with a light, and the prisoner called out to me, "Come here, there is some one coming with a light"—we then went into the Fly mill, and I saw William Else going into the water-closet—I went out of the mill directly he was gone in—that was between five and six o'clock—nobody went into the privy but Else—I returned to the mill-yard again about eleven at night, got the bowl away, and took it on board—I was not aware that I had been watched at six or half-past six—I saw the prisoner again between one and two—he came on board the barge, and told me to go down to the Hammer mills, and fetch up the bars of copper, and he would look out and see if any one was coming—I went to the Hammer mills and brought away five bars of copper, which I placed in the cabin of the barge—the prisoner then went into the cabin with me—I brought them into the barge and gave them to him, and he put them into the cabin—we remained in the barge till the morning—we did not go off that night, because we had no horses to tow us down the canal—about six in the morning, Winter and Croker came on board and remained till half-past seven—we then found the barge was ordered not to leave—the prisoner and I then went to a public-house—we locked up the cabin in which the copper was—we had a key a-piece—the prisoner and I slept in the cabin that evening after we went on board—no one had access to it but us—we returned to the mill from the pub<lb></lb>lic-house, between ten and eleven the same morning, and were then taken into custody—I was taken into the counting-house, and the key of the cabin was taken from me by Atkins, the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the Company's employ at the Copper mills at Harefield. On the evening of the 17th of December, I had occasion, about twenty minutes past five o'clock, to go to the privy, which is between the Fly mill and Evelyn's mill—the privy door was partly open—while I was in the privy I saw Bignall with a pair of tongs getting a copper bowl up from the frozen ground—I saw the prisoner at the time standing five or six yards off, a little distance from the Fly mill—I heard him say to Bignall, "George, here is some one coming with a light," and they both went into the Fly mill—William Else then came up and came to where I was—after he had come into the privy, Bignall went to the bowl again, and the prisoner stood a little where he had stood before—Else said something to me—he spoke loud enough for them to hear, and on his speaking to me the prisoner and Bignall went away towards the barge, which lay near the Hammer mills—I then went to the place where I had seen Bignall, and there found the copper bowl, and the tongs which laid on the tub—the bowl was a little raised up—it had been frosty—I went and told Webb, the shearer, who I work with, of it, and we went to the place where the bowl was—Webb took it up, and took it to Evelyn's mill—I did not see what he did to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were examined before the Magistrate, I be<lb></lb>lieve? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know whether Bignall was present—I never saw him—I was looking at the Magistrate—the prisoner and Bignall were not in the yard when I went to the water-closet—they came in while I was there—Else did not pass by them—they had gone into the Fly mill when Else came in—they could not have seen Else then—they must have heard Else and I talking in the privy—we talked quite loud, so that they could not help hearing it—it was just before Else came in that the prisoner said, "Here is somebody coming"—Else had no light with him—another man had who came up the yard with him—I saw that man from the privy—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to the Company. On Friday morning, the 18th of December, I was requested to watch the <hi rend="italic">Olive Branch</hi> barge—I watched by myself—I did not know that any one was watching at another place—I saw the prisoner and Bignall come out of the barge at very near eight o'clock—the prisoner returned to the barge in two or three minutes, unlocked the cabin, and went in—he came out again, locked the cabin, and went away—I had seen the copper cake now produced, on the Thursday afternoon, lying against the Fly mill door—there is a mark on it by which I know it—it is the property of the Company—I cannot speak about the bars—I was present on the Saturday when the prisoner was taken into the counting-house, and heard Mr. Jacobs say to him, "Captain, this is a bad job," or words to that effect—the prisoner walked towards him, and wished him to make intercession for him, his wife, and family, and he should ever have reason hereafter to pray for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who was present at this conversation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Looseley, Atkins, Mr. Jacobs, and myself—Bignall was not there—I was not examined before the Magistrate—I mentioned this conversation to the solicitor, not to any one else, I believe—I have not talked of it to Loose-ley or Atkins—I do not recollect whether the solicitor asked me if any thing had been said—he might have done so.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received an excellent character.)</p>

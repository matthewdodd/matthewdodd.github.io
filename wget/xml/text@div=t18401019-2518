                  </hi>. I am a glass-coachman. On Saturday night, the 10th of October, a little before twelve o'clock, I was crossing the road from the Alsop Arms public-house, at the corner of Upper Gloucester-street, New-road, near Dorset-square—as I crossed, a bunch of turnips were thrown against me—I did not see who did it—there were three or four men stand<lb></lb>ing together, and it appeared to come from them—I threw it back again, and the prisoner threw it back to me again—I am confident it was the pri<lb></lb>soner—it was a very moonlight night—I knew him before—I was in the act of throwing them again, and he ran in and cut me in the side, and said, "There you b——, take that"—I felt the blood running from my side, and felt what I thought was a blow at first, and put my hand to my side directly I felt the blood running—I did not see any thing in the pri<lb></lb>soner's hand—there was no one but him within two or three yards of me—I ran for assistance, and met Mr. Farrow eight or nine yards from where it happened, and William Neil, a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-driver—I said I was cut in my side, and wished they would take me somewhere where I could have something done to it—they took me to the infirmary—my side was examined there—I found a large cut in my side—I had done nothing to the prisoner before he struck me but throw the turnips at him.</p>

On the night of Sa<lb></lb>turday, the 10th of October, a little before twelve o'clock, I was at the Alsop Arms public-house, New-road, and saw the prisoner close by, in the act of closing a razor, which he had in his hand—I saw something thrown towards the prisoner, and directly after I saw him closing the razor—I did not see him go anywhere after that was thrown at him—I stood at the corner of Alsop Mews—I know Wadey—I cannot say that I saw him there then—I had seen him before—the prisoner appeared to be sober—he said he had bought the razor a few minutes before—I and another man stood at the corner of the mews, and he said, "If any more of your <hi rend="italic">larks,</hi> I will rip your b—guts open."</p>

On Saturday night, the 10th of October, just before twelve o'clock, I was in the Alsop Arms public-house—I have seen the prisoner before, and saw him that night, and also saw Wadey there—I saw some greens thrown from the opposite side—they were not thrown at the prisoner at first—I afterwards saw Wadey throw them at him—he took them up again and threw them at Wadey, who took them up again, and was in the act of throwing them at the prisoner, when the prisoner ran with great violence and struck him a blow—I cannot say whether he had anything in his hand at the time—Wadey came over to me and Neil, and complained</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon of the Western General Dispensary, in the New-road. I remember Wadey being brought there on Saturday, the 10th of October, between twelve and one o'clock—I ex<lb></lb>amined him, and found a wound on his right-side, about an inch below the hip-bone—it was a clear incised wound from two and a half to three inches long, and about two inches deep—my little finger would hardly reach the bottom of it—a razor would have inflicted that wound—I cannot say whe<lb></lb>ther it had reached the bone or not—I attended him afterwards—it was not serious in its nature, only as it approached the important parts—it was near parts where it might have been attended with serious consequences—it was across the leg-bone, evidently proceeding rather upwards towards the ab<lb></lb>domen—I imagine it must have been a clear cut at first, and something turned his arm, so that it went up between the muscles, or it must have reached the hip-bone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman harness-maker, and live in East-street, Manchester-square. On Thursday night, the 27th of July, I was going home with a bundle, and saw some people standing at the corner of York-street, East-street—I knew the prisoner before by sight—he was one of the men—he said nothing to me—Hickey, one of the men (<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 625) who has been convicted, asked me to give him something to drink, then tore my waistcoat pocket off, and took my money from me—as soon as he had done that, the prisoner immediately struck me down with his fist—I called, "Police," and they all few ran down the court—I was called up</p>

               <p>in the course of the night, and saw Hickey in custody—I am certain Bunrns is the man who knocked me down—I did not know his name until, after he was apprehended—he was standing on my left side when he struck me—I am perfectly sure of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the night in question, about half-past twelve o'clock, I saw Hickey run past me from York-court—he was looking backwards—I suspected something was wrong—I went round my beat, and heard the prosecutor had been robbed—about five minutes before the robbery took place, I had seen the prisoner standing with Hickey and two others—I saw him with Hickey afterwards also—I knew him well before—he was with Hickey and the other two, when I apprehended Hickey, but went away—the other two followed us to the station-house—I afterwards took Burns close by Oxford-street, about half an hour after I took Hickey—he was before the Magistrate, but was discharged—I do not know why—they were all four before the Magistrate together—the prosecutor pointed Burns out as the man who had knocked him down, but they said there was not sufficient against him—when the depositions were read over, then was nothing in them about Burns.</p>

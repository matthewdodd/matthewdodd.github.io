I ordered him to take out no ale without orders from the counting-house - he took out what beer he wanted. On the 15th of December we asked what orders there were for ale - he said, "Three casks," and we had an order for four - on the 15th we told him to put the seven casks on; we watched, and saw him put on four - we asked how many he had got - he said, "Three;" we told him to put on the other four, which he did; he then put the table-beer casks all over the ale, and went out; I went, and my clerk counted the ale, in my presence - there were eight casks deficient; we had counted them the night before - there were then thirty-six; one dray had taken out a cask, and there were twenty-seven left - Molero dealt with us for table-ale, but never for this sort; I knew of no ale going to him that day - when the prisoner came home I stood by while the clerk entered his account; I then said,"Have you made out your seven casks of ale all right?" he said, Yes - I said, "How many?" he said, "Seven;" this was on Saturday, and on Monday we found where the ale had been taken to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Is your business pretty extensive? A. Not particularly so; he was nearly three years in my employ; we open the doors about eight o'clock - the prisoner loaded about a quarter-past eight - I was then mounted on the top of the brewery, about forty feet high, and could see all over the yard; the clerk booked the seven casks in his load-book; we took the book out, and compared it with the casks - I have been robbed by two or three men.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could you count eight casks where you were? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Laxton. On the night of the 14th I counted the ale - there were thirty-six nine-gallon casks, and early in the morning I counted the same number - the prisoner said he wanted three casks - we added four more - I watched, with Mr. Laxton, and saw the prisoner put on four casks; I came down, and asked how many he had put on - he said, "Three;" I told him of four more, which he put on - I asked if he had the ale - he said,"Yes, seven casks;" he placed it in the middle of the dray, and then put the table-beer round it; he did not say he was going to take any to Mr. Molero - I afterwards saw a cask of Mr. Laxton's there - we sell them to the trade for 18s. - when he came home he accounted for only seven casks; here is a cask of beer, at 4s. 6d., entered in his book that day, to Mr. Molero.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there not other men who take out beer? A. Another dray went out that day; another man went with the prisoner; all the ale casks were marked.</p>

            . I keep a chandler's-shop, in Lower George-street, Chelsea. I have taken beer of Mr. Laxton for three years and a half - I took ale occasionally, and paid 11s. for it to the prisoner; I ordered a cask of good ale on the 8th, and on the 15th the prisoner brought me a cask of small beer, and one of ale; I paid 12s. for the ale, and 4s. 6d. for the small beer; he gave me this receipt - I had had one cask of ale before, and ordered one of the same quality; I was called on, and Webster took the same cask away, in Bryan's presence, on the following Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not said, at the office, that the cask found at your house was brought by a man named Good? A. No; the prisoner delivered both casks - I did not say I had sold the cask delivered by the prisoner; I said I had made a present of a cask which I had before, similar to this - the Magistrate might say I should have been prosecuted; I was never told that my giving evidence here might save me - I have had beer from a man named Good.</p>

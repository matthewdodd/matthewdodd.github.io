I have known him this five or six months, he was in the habit of visiting our house when we kept a public house, I have bought several things of him. The prisoner called at our house about eleven o'clock in the forenoon. Mr. Woodroffe was arrested for one hundred pounds, and the people were all in confusion, expecting to be seized upon for ground rent. I put my plate in a trunk, and locked it up. Mr. Levi came in, and asked what I was crying for. I told him that my husband was arrested. He asked me whether I had any private property that I wished to take care of. I told him I had none, except a small trunk. He said he would take it with him for me; he said, seal it with a guinea. I wished to seal it with my husband's watch seal; he said, no, seal it with a guinea; I said, I could not seal it with a guinea, I had not got one; he put his hands in his pocket, and pulled out a guinea, and he sealed it with a guinea; that is all I know. When the trunk came home, the seal was not in the same place, and there were sixteen crown pieces taken out of the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what was in the trunk. - A. Eight silver table spoons, and a milk pot, two pair of silver sugar tongs, two pair of salt spoons, a bundle of muslin and lace, six babie's caps, two muslin gowns; and a sarsnett pellise, and some babie's bed gowns, sixteen crowns were in a small white box, four yards of lace, and two yards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210016"></xptr>and a half of muslin, and other things that I do not recollect; the box was brought home by my servant girl, on Monday the 29th, about six o'clock in the evening; when she brought home the box, the seal was broken, and it was not sealed in the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. What was missing from the box when it was brought home. - A. Two yards and a half of muslin, four yards of lace, sixteen crown pieces, two old dollars and about one pound fifteen shillings in other monies; a pair of table spoons were changed, and a child's cap, these things were missing from the box; he desired me to send the servant for the things; I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. With your servant you sent a written order from your husband to give up the box. - A. I did; this is the written order, when the servant went for the box, she told Mr. Levi, that the seal was not in the same place; she saw it sealed.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mrs. Woodroffe, where was the seal placed - A. On one of the corners, I cannot say which, and when it was brought back, it was sealed almost in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of all the things in the trunk. - A, About forty or fifty pounds.</p>

            . - Q. You are servant to Mr. Woodroffe, are you. - A. Yes; I have lived with him three months.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 25th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning Mr. Levi came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your master. - A. He was in trouble; he was arrested on that day. On that day Mr. Levi came to our house, and seeing my mistress in trouble, she gave him this box; I saw what was put in, it was corded, and sealed at the left hand of the lock with a guinea. I fetched the box on the 29th of January from his house, his wife delivered it to me; she said, you see it is corded and sealed; I said, yes, but not where it was when it went from our house; she made me no answer. I took the box and came away.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from the prisoner's house. - A. We live in Old Ford, and he lives in Ebenezer-square, by Houndsditch. I came home with the box in the Bow stage, and when I brought it home my mistress opened the box perceiving the seal being moved.</p>
               <p>Q. Who spoke first of the seal being moved. - A. That I cannot say, she opened it herself, and found several things missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was it you went from Levi's house. - A. I suppose about four o'clock; I came home by the five o'clock stage, I stopped at the biscuit shop till the stage came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the biscuit shop. - A. Adjoining the Black Boy and Camel in Leadenhall-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had to wait pretty near an hour, had you. A. I did; Sir, I stopped in the biscuit shop near an hour, I had a shillings worth of biscuit, and waited till the stage came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the box before it was delivered to you - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take the box away in that state. A. It was sealed, I supposed that the seal might have given way in carrying it, and he had sealed it afresh, and that the cord had slipped; I had no other idea.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew this place in Leadenhall-street was no great distance from Levi's house. - A. No; the box was heavy, I could not carry it without resting. I was to go by the four o'clock stage, and when I came there it was gone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What time did you leave Old Ford. - A. It might be a few minutes before two, or a few minutes after. I walked to town from Old Ford, it could not be above half past three when I came to Mr. Levi's; it was only half past four when I got to Leadenhall-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not you have walked from Levi's house to Leadenhall-street in five minutes. - A. No; the box was heavy, I was obliged to stop at every door; I dare say it took me half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went home with the box, your master and mistress said, the seal was not in the right place. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So then you must understand, that if that took place, and any thing was taken out, it must be either Levi or you. - A. I had no keys with me; I did not think any thing about it till it was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when it was opened, and the things were missing, did not you think that one of you should be laid in fault for it. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. When the trunk was delivered to you, did you say one single word about the seal being in the wrong place. - A. I did, and that I stand to, were I going out of the world now.</p>
               <p>Court. Does Levi live at the end of Houndsditch. - A. No; you go up Gravel-lane to his house, and the Black Boy and Camel; is by the India-house.</p>
               <p>Q. The stage must have passed the end of Houndsditch if you came away from Levi's house at half past three, the stage must have passed you. - A. You cannot get a place first always, without you take it first.</p>

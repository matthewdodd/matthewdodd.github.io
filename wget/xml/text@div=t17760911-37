               <p>I saw a boy take a linen gown from Mr. Hayward's and give it to the prisoner; I was in my father's house which is opposite; I ran down stairs and informed Mr. Hayward of it immediately; the gown has never been found: I had seen them several times before, but did not know their names; the boy got in at the window which was open; it was about five o'clock in the evening; I was in the two pair of stairs room; they were in the court half an hour before they took the gown; I was looking out at the window and saw the prisoner attempt to get in at the window, but he could not reach the gown.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A jeweller: I thought they were not at any thing good, and therefore I looked at them; this was on the Monday, on the Thursday following I was going through Smithfield and saw the prisoner, and had him secured.</p>

               <p>On Monday or Tuesday I went out to take a walk, I heard a cry of Where is he, where is he? I followed them, and at last the boy said it was me, and had me stopped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior assistant in the solicitor's office to the Treasury Department—on 26th February this year the legal business of the Admiralty department of the Government was transferred to the Trea<lb></lb>sury Solicitor's department, and two clerks, who had formerly been employed in the Admiralty Solicitor's office, Mr. Swainson and Mr. Lindsay, were transferred to the Treasury Solicitor's department, where they continued to attend to the Admiralty business—on 9th March I remember Mr. Lindsay bringing me this letter, dated the 8th, which purported to come from Mr. Reeve, of Lowestoft, in reference to some surveyor's charges relating to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187706250056"></xptr>
               <p>purchase by the Admiralty of some land near Lowestoft called Maid's Acre; the amount claimed was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in consequence of that I requested Mr. Lind<lb></lb>say to look up the papers, when the conveyance of the property was found to be missing, it was not with the bundle where it should have been—upon that I wrote this letter of 14th March requesting Mr. Reeve to return the conveyance, and on the 16th I received this reply from Mr. Reeve, enclosing the conveyance. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "As requested by your letter of yesterday, and upon the understanding that the costs herein, amounting to 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10rf., are sent me by return of post, I enclose the conveyance duly executed. (Signed) R. H. Reeve.") That 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was composed of 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10cl. legal charges nnd 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the surveyor's charges—upon the receipt of that letter the papers were looked at and Mr. Swainson brought me Mr. Reeve's bill of costs—I am under the impression that he brought it me at an earlier stage of the pro<lb></lb>ceedings, when I received the first letter from Mr. Reeve applying for his costs; I took it only as applying to the surveyor's costs, being aware at that time that his own bill was paid—after receiving the letter of 15th March, enclosing the conveyance, I communicated with Mr. Swainson—I had not seen the cheque before that. (<hi rend="italic">The cheque was uncrossed for</hi> 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">on the London and County Bank, Victoria Street hranch, drawn, by A. Isaac Bristowe, payable to R. H. Reeve, Esq., or order, and endorsed R. H. Reeve"</hi>) I spoke to Mr. Swainson on the subject, and he then produced to me the receipted bill and the cheque; that was on 16th March—the receipted bill of costs would properly be in Mr. Swainson's cus<lb></lb>tody, he being the accountant—all the old papers and books were brought over from the old office at S, Richmond Terrace, to the new office at the Treasury, and the old papers, which were very voluminous, were deposited in certain vaults in the basement, and those relating to current business were at once transferred to the room which was to be occupied by Mr. Swainson and Mr. Lindsay—these particular documents were probably in a safe is that room, where the vouchers were kept, the business not being concluded—Mr. Swainson was the person responsible for their custody; Mr. Lindsay had no particular department, he assisted generally in the work under Mr. Bristowe as a clerk, in conveyancing for the most part—on 16th March I wrote this letter to Mr. Reeve, which Mr. Stephenson signed. (<hi rend="italic">This informed Mr. Reeve that the receipted bill and endorsed cheque were in the possession of the Treasury.</hi>) I then received from Mr. Reeve a request to forward him the receipt and the cheque, which I did on the 19th—on the 20th I received from him a telegram stating that his clerk would come to London, which he did the following morning, bringing back with him the cheque and the bill—I don't know that I informed Mr. Swainson of each step that was taken, hut the letter-book was open to his inspection, and I have no doubt he knew what was going on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In December and January 'last I was in precisely the same position that I now occupy—I had nothing then to do with the Admi<lb></lb>ralty department—the business was not transferred to the Treasury until 26th February—Mr. Alfred Isaac Bristowe was then acting solicitor for the Admiralty department—his father, up to the time of his death, had been solicitor to the Admiralty, and after his death the son was left acting soli<lb></lb>citor, having been in his father's office, and he held that office until February this year, when it was transferred to our department—I think I may say he then retired, his office was abolished; he was not taken over in the same way as Mr. Swainson and Mr. Lindsay—I first heard that anything was wrong on</p>

               <p>16th March—as soon as it was discovered that a forgery had been committed the matter passed out of ray hands, as I do not attend to the criminal busi<lb></lb>ness of the office, into the hands of Mr. Stephenson; he had the entire investigation of this matter from its discovery on 16th March; I had nothing to do beyond answering any question that Mr. Stepenson might put to me—I know nothing beyond what I have stated—I only saw Mr. Fullagur on one occasion, a few days after the work was transferred, when I went to the office at Richmond Terrace to inquire as to certain papers that had not apparently been transferred; I then saw him for a few minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. My principal duty is that of accountant, I have been in the department forty-five years next August—I was acting in that capacity during the year 1876—on 31st March, 1876, I paid by Navy bill the purchase money in respect of the site of this Coastguard station at Lowestoft; from that time until January, this year, I had nothing to do with it—on Saturday, 27th January, the prisoner came to me at Richmond Terrace, he brought Mr. Reeve's bill of costs in his hand, and said that he bad looked through it, I believe, and saw no objection and would I draw a cheque for the amount—in the ordinary course it would be my duty to draw a cheque, and the prisoner's, duty to ask me for it if he attended to the matter, he having previously asked Mr. Bristowe about it—I then took out the cheque-book and filled up the cheque—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—this counterfoil is in my writing: "27, January, 1877, to R. H. Reeve, Esq., Lowestoft, Coastguard"—all the cheque is in my writing except the signa<lb></lb>ture, and the endorsement, I know nothing about the endorsement—Mr. Fullager waited while I wrote out the cheque, and I then handed him the book with the cheque in it to take to Mr. Bristowe to sign—he took it and went into Mr. Bristowe's room, he was gone about ten minutes—he then returned and said that Mr. Bristowe declined to sign it, but that he—would do so on Monday—this was between 1 and 2 o'clock, the office closes rather early on Saturday, I used always to go away at 2 o'clock on Saturday—while Mr. Fullagar was gone I got the cash-book and entered the cheque, thinking it would be signed as a matter of course—this is the entry: "27, January, Mr. R. H. Reeve, Lowestoft, Coastguard, 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—as if it were a cash payment—if that cheque had been brought back to me signed, it would not have been my duty to do anything further with it, Mr. Fullagar would bring it back and write the letter, if I had had to send it, it would have been my duty to cross it; I make it a rule always to cross cheques, either at the time I draw it or before it goes away—Mr. Fallagar brought back the cheque and the book to me on the Saturday, and I locked it up in my drawer till the Monday—on the Monday; he came to me and said "I will take that cheque for Mr. Bristowe's signature"—I handed him the book, he took it in to take to Mr. Bristowe to get it signed—I did not see him do so, he took it away, I saw no more of it that day that I remember—we had separate rooms, Fullagar's room adjoined mine—Mr. Lindsay and I occupied one room, and Peter the messenger had a temporary seat there for a time as we had not any room for him—we had no letter book, a draft is kept of letters sent, which is kept with the other papers—it would have been Fullagar's duty to write that letter—search has been made and no such letter can be found, I was in the habit of entering as cash paid, merely on the signature of a cheque—if I had to send away a cheque it would be the ordinary course to make an entry of it in the day-book, which is a rough book where everything is entered, the whole of the office business; the</p>

               <p>prisoner made entries in it, it was open to all, it was the office book, any person sending such a letter would make the entry, but Mr. Lindsay generally made the entries, although others might do the act, and I did it myself frequently—this entry was made by me: "January 29th, letter to Mr. Reeve with cheque for costs 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a bill of costs"—I made that entry, seeing that there was not one made, and seeing a letter to Mr. Reeve in the letter-box—the letter-box is on the mantelpiece, in which all letters going away are put—I think I saw that in the afternoon, it was a foolscap envelope with an enclosure of course, a thickish envelope, with "On H. M. Service" printed on it, and with the Admiralty solicitor's blue-seal, one of the official envelopes—I saw the direction on it, it would be in Mr. Fullagar's handwriting, he having written the letter—I saw the address as far as I recollect—I am able to say that I did—I could not say positively in whose handwriting it was, but Mr. Fullagar having written the letter, it would be in his—there was nothing at all unusual in my making the entry, although I did not do the business, it was the usual thing, it was a sort of con<lb></lb>fidence in the office, we did not think anything about it, we trusted to each other, it is at page 16—the body of the page is Mr. Lindsay's—I had to draw three other cheques on the Monday; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—I had the duty of sending those away—I have crossed them; that was my practice when sending them away—the first one, as to Blake, would be entered to the day-book, not the others, because they did not relate to any particular business; they would be entered in the cash-book—I believe Mr. Fullagar took them in with the other cheque for Mr. Bristowe's signature—Peter Dameral, the messenger, had to take the letters from the box just before 5 o'clock, and take them to Whitehall to go into the official bag—the three cheques are entered in the cash-book on 29th January, "Messrs. Blake, Cromer, Coastguard, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Messrs. Moulton, law stationers' account, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Mr. Hansard, votes, Session 1877, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—only Messrs. Blake's cheque is entered in the day-book; the latter part of that entry ib my writing, and the former part Mr. Lindsay's—I wrote that letter and enclosed the cheque in an envelope, put it in the rack, and Dameral would take it to the post; that would be the ordinary course—I was examined at Bow Street—do not recollect Mr. Fullagar making up the letter and return, from his room with the envelope and cheque, putting the letter and cheque in the envelope, and leaving it with me to enter; I have endeavoured, as far as I can, to bring my mind back to the transaction—the next I heard of the matter was about a fortnight before we left Richmond Terrace; Mr. Lindsay and I were clearing up the things a bit, and we could not find that Lowestoft conveyance—Mr. Fullagar did not speak to me about it until he he brought me the bill; that was three or four days after—I could not fix the day exactly—he came out of his room and brought me Mr. Reeve's bill of costs, with the receipt to it, and said "Here is Mr. Reeve's bill of costs"—as far as I recollect, he had only the bill of costs in his hand; he cer<lb></lb>tainly did not being a stamped envelope and show it to me and take the bill of costs out of it; he brought it to me open—I took it from him, looked at the receipt, and put it up with the other bundle of vouchers—I don't recollect his saying anything about there being no letter with the bill of oosts—he did not on that occasion say it was great <hi rend="italic">cheek</hi> of the postman to leave it downstairs; I am quite sure of that—he had done so on a previous occasion—I put it among the vouchers and put this docket on it—it was about the middle of February when we could not find the conveyance—I</p>

               <p>asked Mr. Lmasay whether it had been reported, and he said he had not reported it; that means reporting its completion—when completed it would be reported to the Secretary of the Admiralty, or according to his directions, to whoever it came from—I went into Mr. Fullagar's room and asked him if he knew anything of the conveyance; he said he did not—I then spoke to Mr. Lindsay, and it was arranged that a letter should be sent to Mr. Reeve for the conveyance—I afterwards handed the cheque and the bill of coats to Mr. Chabot—the paid cheques are returned by the bankers every month or so in the banker's book, and they are generally tied up in a bundle and marked as paid cheques—I keep the vouchers until Mr. Bristowe's quarterly account is Bent in to the Accountant-General of the Navy—I remember the prisoner being discharged before Mr. Flowers on Saturday, 31st March—some days afterwards he came into my room at the Treasury and said "My object in calling on you is to personally apologise to you, Mr. Swainson, for the observations of Mr. Straight, and to assure you that they were not made through any directions from me, but you must consider them as only apply<lb></lb>ing to the handwriting and not to anything else, as I am quite sure you had nothing to do with it"—Mr. Straight had said at Bow Street that the handwriting on the cheque was as much like mine as Fullager's—he was re<lb></lb>presented by Counsel on the second occasion, not on the first; he conducted his own defence then—I have not seen him since that occasion—after his discharge I was, in common with other persons in the office, examined by Mr. Stephenson—the prisoner has borrowed trifling sums from me on several occasions; I think the last occasion was about a fortnight before we left Eichmond Terrace; he had a sovereign of me—these cheques are on the Westminster branch of the London and County Bank—I have to go there from time to time to pay in money—I am pretty well known there; I have been going there nearly two years, off and on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard the Solicitor-General's opening, as to the crime being between me and the prisoner, or perhaps a third person—I never heard that suggested by the prisoner or any of his friends—Mr. Straight's remarks were only as to my handwriting being as much like the cheque as Fullagar's—when Fullagar came to apologise for it, he said it was not in<lb></lb>tended to draw any other inference from it; he was as friendly towards me then as he ever had been—the sovereign he borrowed of me was somewhere about a fortnight before the office was transferred—it was repaid shortly after we went over to the Treasury—he was not the only person that ever had a sovereign of me—I paid the petty expenses of the office; Mr. Bristowe used to give me a cheque for petty cash, which I cashed—I kept the cash in an iron safe to meet any petty payments—I had funds in hand to pay petty cash with—the sums he borrowed occasionally were for private purposes, for his own accommodation, not for petty cash—he did not tell me they were for his own accommodation, but I knew from his manner they were—he never wanted money for office expenses unless he told me what it was for—he would give me a list of his petty expenses at the end of the quarter—he generally waited till the end of the quarter before he got the money for them—they were small sums, principally cab hire—it would be about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter, perhaps, for cab hire—Mr. Alfred Bristowe has occasionally had trifling sums from me for his private requirements, and I: think Mr. Oswald occasionally—Mr. Lindsay has had trifling sums, and I have occasionally lent Peter, the messenger, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a time—it was—common thing in the office, that has been going on for a good time—the</p>

               <p>prisoner repaid me all that he borrowed, sometimes within a week or a month, different times—he brought it me back voluntarily; I never asked him for it—the salaries were paid at the end of each month—there was never any difficulty in getting the salary—Mr. Bristowe paid him his salary—it was 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he was also allowed to practice as a solicitor on his own account—after Mr. Flowers dismissed him I went up to him, shook hands with him, and congratulated him on the result—he was in the passage as I passed—my evidence was given on the Saturday—I think he was appre<lb></lb>hended the night before—the case was adjourned for a week—he was not out on bail—he came up again on Saturday, 31st March—I had known him from the time he entered the office in 1875—he was not in the same office with me all the time, only from December till February, at Richmond Terrace—that was only a temporary arrangement because we had not got room—we had three rooms at the top of the house; the first floor was un<lb></lb>occupied, the ground floor was the office of the Conservator of the Mersey, Admiral Evans, and the Privy Seal Office; the servants were underneath; I don't know who they consisted of, we were there so short a time—there was a housekeeper, a woman—I used to see a youth there occasionally; I don't know what relation he was to the housekeeper—there may have been others those were all I saw—there were attics above our offices, they were empty—the papers in reference to this and other matters were brought from 39, Parliament Street, to Richmond Terrace—we left Parliament Street some<lb></lb>where about 31st December, 1876—the principal part of the work in reference to this matter had been done there—those who came over to Richmond Terrace were Mr. A. I. Bristowe, myself, Mr. Fullagar, Mr. Lindsay, Mr. Alfred Bristowe, Mr. Oswald, and Peter; that was the whole staff—Mr. Lindsay had been unwell, and went away for a holiday in August, then scarlet fever broke out in his family, and he did not come back till January, I think—in consequence of his absence there would be more work for Mr. Fullagar to do—I suppose some of it would occasionally get into arrear—there were several letters from Mr. Reeve during the latter part of last year asking for a settlement—if I was there first I should open the letters—they were placed on Mr. Lindsay's desk by the messenger—they were addressed to the Solicitor or to A. I. Bristowe, Esq., most of them—they would be delivered at the house in the morning—Peter was there earlier than the others, and would attend to the offices—they were not locked up at night, they were left open in charge of the housekeeper, who would light the fires and dust the rooms—anybody who was there with her would have an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of going into all the rooms; they were all open, none of them were locked—I don't know what the housekeeper did with the letters the first thing in the morning, whether she delivered them or whether Peter brought them upstairs—the postman occasionally brought them up—I used to be there from 10.30 to 10.40—in the middle of the day the postman frequently left the letters below, and they were brought up by the first person who came in—persons connected with the office were constantly going in and out, so they would not remain long—anybody might come in that liked, it was a private sort of entrance, up steps; the front door was open, there was an inner swing door—Mr. Fullagar has complained of the postman leaving letters below—I could not say that he made that observation as to this particular letter but I believe not—as far as I recollect he did not say a word about the postman leaving letters below on the Wednesday—my memory docs not enable me to say positively that he did not—am positive that he did not</p>

               <p>open the letters before me—I was positive before the Magistrate; if I said I did not remember, perhaps I got a little confused and did not quite under<lb></lb>stand the point—he came out of his room into my room up to my desk and handed me the bill, and said "Here is Keeve's bill," and I took it and looked at the receipt, and put it with the other vouchers—letters brought in during the day would be taken in to Mr. Bristowe if he was there, if he was not there, perhaps they would be laid upon Mr. Lindsay's desk, or whoever might be there to take charge of them—if Mr. Lindsay was there lie would keep them—he and myself and Mr. Fullagar had the right to open them, and we did open them, if Mr. Bristowe was not there, or if he was there, if they were thought to be public or business letters, we did not take them to Mr. Bristowe first; Mr. Lindsay would open them in the morning and enter them in the day-book before they were taken in to him; if I came in before Mr. Lindsay very likely I should open—them, and if Mr. Lindsay was away I should enter them—if the prisoner came in before Mr. Lindsay he would most likely open them—I can't say for certain what time of the day it was when this bill was given to me; I think it was somewhere about the middle of the day; Mr. Alfred Bristowe was in the office—I was the accountant; I had occasionally to write letters and see to the general business of the office sometimes—I have occasionally written a letter to a solicitor as to some purchase of a coast guard; occasionally, if others were absent I should attend to the conveyancing part; in fact, I used to do generally any class of business in the office; that mostly happened when others were absent; I did part of the office work in addition to the accounts—three cheques were drawn on 29th January, one referring to the Cromer Coastguard; I wrote the letter for that, for Mr. Bristowe's signature—I have occasionally acted for the business of the office generally, while any one else was there—it was not my business especially to attend to the Cromer business—did not write in reference to the Lowestoft business, because 51 r. Fullagar was attending to the Coastguard, and Mr. Lindsay was per<lb></lb>haps busy in other matters—Mr. Fullagar had no particular branch, he was the solicitor in the department; I believe he is a solicitor, admitted many years, he was engaged as a solicitor, qualified to do solicitor's work; I was not a solicitor—I should have written the letter with reference to Lowestoft just the same as I did with regard to Cromer or anything else—I have occasionally attended to other purchases or anything of the sort—I attend to any business in the office occasionally; I had nothing to do with this particular matter of Maid's Acre, except paying in the purchase-money—I made the entry in the journal of both the Cromer and the Lowestoft cases—as a rule I only entered the work that I did myself, but I have occasionally entered for others—this is a journal of all the business of the office done in the course of the day—there is no handwriting of the prisoner's here with reference to the Marsdon case—Mr. Fullagar attended to White and Borritt's business; I know that, because I had the cheques to pay the costs—this book was mostly kept by Mr. Lindsay; Mr. Bristowe always signed the letters if he was there—it would depend upon who attended to the matter—if Mr. Lindsay signed he would sign for the solicitor, and if I wrote the letter I should sign "Swainson for Admiralty solicitor"—Mr. Liud say attended to the principal part of the business relating to the Lowestoft purchase—I think it was in consequence of his absence that Mr. Fullagar had this to do—Mr. Lindsay did the principal work in that class of business, the Coastguard business and the preliminary conveyancing—Mr. Fullagar</p>

               <p>occasionally did so, and I did occasionally—Mr. Bristowe might occasional hand letters to Mr. Lindsay to write—if Mr. Lindsay had the Lowestoft busi<lb></lb>ness. in hand the ordinary course would be for him to carry it out, he would be responsible for it—I think the prisoner attended to part of the Chancery work—the Lowestoft property was a church property, and they had to get the consent of the Court of Chancery, and if I recollect right Mr. Fullagar attended once or twice with Messrs. Gregory's clerk, about the matter at the Chancery office—he had the papers in his room when Mr. Lindsay was absent—I believe Mr. Bristowe handed him the bill of costs to look through—I wrote the letter in reference to the Cromer business, because I had drawn the cheque for the costs; I also drew the cheque for the costs for the Lowestoft business, but I did not attend to that, because Mr. Fullagar had gone through the bill of costs, and was attending to that part of the business—am not aware that he had gone through the Cromer bill of costs—I cannot swear that he had not—I had no power to go through a solicitor's bill of costs and settle it without Mr. Bristowe's authority; I did not get the authority to go through it—I think Mr. Lindsay handed me the Cromer bill of costs to draw the cheque, he having attended to the matter—I wrote the letter because Mr. Lindsay was attending to something else perhaps, at the time—of course I cannot tell whether Mr. Fullagar was not attending to something else, than the Lowestoft business at the time—I did not say I had gone through the Cromer bill of costs and settled it, I cannot dis<lb></lb>tinctly remember—the ordinary course would be for the person who handed me the cheque to write the letter—I have no particular recollection why I wrote that letter—if I sent the cheque away I should enter it here as a matter of course—I believe Mr. Lindsay handed me the bill to draw the cheque—here is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deducted from the bill—I cannot exactly say whether that deduction was made by Mr. Fullagar—it might be; I cannot swear that he did not go through that bill—I fancy Mr. Lindsay gave it me—I think he had returned then; I think he was in the office at the time—I should not like to swear that the prisoner did not hand me the Cromer bill, but I think it was Mr. Lindsay that did it—I am still of that opinion—Mr. Fullagar got three other cheques signed for me—he did not apply to me to fill up the other two—no one did, I did it myself—I drew them of my own accord because it was business I was attending to—on the Monday, either Mr. Lindsay or Mr. Fullagar asked me for the Cromer cheque—I wrote the three cheques at the same time, and Mr. Fullagar would go with the cheques and the book to Mr. Bristowe, and get his signa<lb></lb>ture and then bring them back to me—I remember his bringing the cheque<lb></lb>book back to me and retaining the Lowestoft cheque, Mr. Reeve's cheque—it was out of the book when it was handed to me—he tore it out of the book; I do not recollect whether he did it in my presence, but he had torn it out for the purpose of sending it Mr. Reeve—I cannot tell you why he did not do the same with respect to the Cromer cheque—I believe Mr. Fullagar got Mr. Reeve's bill in his possession; I do not recollect seeing it on the Monday—I believe it was not on the desk—I will swear it was not—I did not say before the Magistrate that the bill was on the table—I have Rome doubts whether it was on my table; I think it was not—I did not write a letter to Mr. Reeve, I am quite sure of that—the prisoner did not in my presence put a letter and the cheque into the envelope and leave it with me to put the bill in, I swear that he did not give it to me—I cannot exactly recollect the hour that Mr. Fullagar brought back</p>

               <p>the cheque to me—I think it—was somewhere about mid-day—the usual hour for leaving is 5 o'clock—sometimes one stops longer than the other—the letters were sent up to Whitehall, just before 5 o'clock—it was Peter's duty to take them from the box, and take them there; I made the entry just before the letters went—who put it into the box originally I do not know—the entry was made in the afternoon; I did it because I did not see it there—occasionally we had a good deal of work to do in the office, and occasionally we were slack—persons came to see me; very <hi rend="italic">few</hi> friends called at the office to see me—one of my nephews came; he was a clerk in the Admiralty—he occasionally looked in, not frequently, not once a day; on an average, not once a fortnight—he might have called once or twice a week, about January, about his private affairs; I do not think oftener, certainly not every day—I think not, as far as I recollect—he was in debt, I must admit—he came to me in reference to his money matters—I had brought him up with my father—I have another nephew who was in the Post-office—the one who was in the Admiralty had been reprimanded, I believe, for irregularity—the nephew in the Post-office had been dismissed; I afterwards tried to get him reinstated, and they refused—in January two Navy bills were stolen from the Accountant-General's Office in New Street; my nephew was in the Accountant-General's Office there—Mr. Bristowe investigated the matter, I had nothing to do with it—it was sent to the solicitor to investigate—I never was in the Accountant-General's Office—my nephew sent some money lenders to the office to arrange with regard to his money transactions on more than one occasion—I had authority from my nephew to receive his pay at the Ac<lb></lb>countant-General's Office—I gave an undertaking to one of the money<lb></lb>lenders to pay a portion of his salary to him—there were only two called—I think I gave a written undertaking to one to pay him so much a month for his bill; the other was only a verbal understanding that if he would keep up his arrangement I would pay him the trifling amount—I have not said that it was my practice not to cross cheques unless I was going to send them off—the Lowestoft cheque was drawn on Saturday afternoon in the presence of Mr. Fullagar; I have given my reasons for not crossing it—I drew the cheque in his presence while he waited for it, and thinking Mr. Bristowe was waiting, I handed it to him, I suppose, without crossing it; that was the only reason—it was a sort of accidental thing—I had charge of that cheque in the book from the Saturday till the Monday—he brought the book to me with the cheque; I put it in the drawer and locked it up—on the Monday I drew three other cheques; he was not waiting for them then—I did not cross the cheque then; I presume I passed it over, thinking it was a cheque that was to stand over and I did not notice it, I mean I did not notice the absence of the crossing—I knew it was the cheque I had drawn on the Saturday, but I did not notice that it was not crossed; it was an oversight—it was about the middle of February that I found out the conveyance was not there—I and Mr. Lindsay found it out—Mr. Lindsay said that he drafted the letter to Mr. Reeve—I did not write; I only suggested to Mr. Lindsay, who had to do with most of the matter, to do so, and he told me a few days afterwards that he had drafted the letter to Mr. Keeve and put it on Mr. Bristowe's table; that was at Richmond Terrace—I did not speak to Mr. Fullagar about it; he seemed to be attending to other matters and was indifferent as to the business then, and Mr. Lindsay had been principally attending to it—I do not think he attended to it after he went away—</p>

               <p>Mr. Fullagar told mo he had not anything to do with it, that he did not know he should attend to it any more; he told me that some time in the course of February, I think, that he should not trouble himself about the business, he should hand it to Mr. Lindsay; I mean the Lowestoft busi<lb></lb>ness—he had the papers in his room; that was in the beginning of February, I think—there was nothing particular for him to do then—he was getting rid of the papers out of his room; I think there was a largish bundle of papers—they were brought out of his room; I do not know by whom—I cannot tell you when—I cannot swear that they had been got out of his room when we found the conveyance was not there—I cannot tell you the reason why I did not speak to the prisoner about it—I did speak to him about it—I went into his room and asked him if he knew anything about the conveyance—when he told me was not going to have anything to do with it, that was about writing the letter—I did not know that he was going to be apprehended on the 23rd March; I had not been consulted as to his being apprehended—I had been asked about the facts by Mr. Hodgson and Mr. Pollard; I did not advise it in any way—this is the Cromer letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this seems to be the original letter.</p>

Fullagar's writing—it was presented to me by the same person that brought me the cheque; it was to accompany the bill of costs and cheque to Mr. Reeve—these other three cheques were signed by me at the same time—in the ordinary course of business a cheque would have a letter ac<lb></lb>companying it, stating "Herewith we send you cheque for so-and-so, good enough to acknowledge it"—it would not be in the ordinary course of business to send an envelope without a letter—I heard nothing more of the matter until the prisoner was given into custody—I went and saw him at the police-station the morning after he had been arrested; that would be Saturday morning, 24th March—I saw him iu the cell—I had received a letter from him the night before, telling me that he had been arrested for stealing a cheque, and asking me to come and see him as early as possible in the morning, and I did so—I paid the prisoner a salary of 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I have made advantes to him on his salary from time to time, at his request, but not recently—the last time was, I should think, sir months before the office was transferred to the Treasury—should certainly think not subsequent to October or November last—I have occasionally lent him money; not recently—I cannot exactly recollect when—I do not think I have done so for six or seven months from the present time—I am aware that my statement has been taken by a short<lb></lb>hand writer—I say again I do not think I have lent Mr. Fullager any money for six or eight months; if I have done so it has only been a sovereign or a couple of sovereigns—I may have done so since that time; it has only been small sums, but I do not recollect that—I would not swear I had not done so—I think last year I lent him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one or two occasions, certainly not more than two; he always paid me back—occasionally I repaid myself from his month's salary, but at times when he asked me to lend it him for a time he paid it me back—it was not a common thing for him to do so, but in the course of our acquaintance he has done so several times—I may have lent him a sovereign last January; I do not recollect doing so—the signature to the receipt of Mr. Reeve's' bill appears to be an imitation of his writing—I have looked at it before—my attention has been invited to it more than once—there is no handwriting that I am acquainted with in the office that resembles it—I have looked at the endorsement on the cheque; I do not recognise any likeness in that—that is also an imitation of Mr. Reeve's handwriting—I think it is a good imitation; it is like his writing—I see some handwriting of Mr. Fullagar's in this book; there is one line and a half at page 3, in his handwriting, it is an entry of the 15th January—then on page 15, the first entry is in his handwriting, the subsequent ones are in Mr. Lindsay's—the entry at page 16, refers to Henwood and Childers; that is in Mr. Lindsay's writing—at page 201, the entries are in Mr. Fullagar's, with the exception of one or two—at page 202, about half of it is in Mr. Fullagar's handwriting, and the other half Mr. Lindsay's; not equally divided, it is mixed—I know nothing about these post-office orders—I did not go and get the money, or write any of these documents.</p>

Reeve, Esq.," in the corner—I know the handwriting of Mr. Fullagar, very well—I have known it for some years; I do not recognise his hand<lb></lb>writing in the two forged documents that have been produced, namely the bill and the cheque—it is very like Mr. Reeve's writing—I say it does not resemble Mr. Fullagar's writing, or the writing of anyone else in the office—that is my opinion—Mr. Fullagar told me in the autumn that he was getting up a Mortgage Reversionary Company—he told me he had incurred expenses in that—I think he repaid me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I lent him last year—the salary is paid monthly—I know that at different times I have both lent him and advanced him small sums—on those occasions he told me that he did not borrow it as a loan, and I advanced so much—if he had wanted any money in January, I should have advanced it him aa I had done before—there had been nothing to prevent his making a friend of me—as far as I know he was not in want of money then; at all events he did not come and ask me for it—I first heard of this loss on the night Mr. Fullagar, was arrested—I went to him next morning in consequence of his letter—his letter was the first intimation I had that the cheque was stolen—I have not got that letter; I did not keep it—t was very short; I could give you the effect of it—from January to March, I was living, as I am now, at Lewisham, coming up to town every day—I was lot at Portsmouth, at any part of that time—I was there sometimes; I was n London, nearly all the time from January to March, except a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> days at frighten, and a few at Tunbridge Wells, but I do not think there wag a</p>

I have not been in the habit of signing uncrossed cheques—my reason for not signing cheques on the Saturday was because they would be lying in the post-office, or wherever they happended to be—it was not on account of the amount—I heard nothing of this matter until Mr. Fullagar was arrested—I do not know it would have been Mr. Swianson's duty specially to report to me that he could not find the conveyance—anybody who knew that the conveyance was lost should have reported it to me; if Mr. Swainson knew it was lost he should have done so.</p>

               <p>with reference to Maid's Acre, at Lowestoft—I remember Mr. Reeve's bill of costs coming—when the negotiations began, Counsel drew the drafts and I instructed Counsel and examined abstracts of title—I prepared the draft, forwarded it to the vendor's solicitor, and received it back approved—on 28th July, 1876, the management of Maid's Acre was concluded so far as Mr. Reeve was concerned, receipt that he had the engrossing of the deed, and we received a letter with his bill of costs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—up to 28th July I was the person attending to the matter with Mr. Bristowe and his father, but I did not pay the money into the bank—the conveyance was sent to him sepa<lb></lb>rately for examination—I opened the letter on the morning of 28th July, which contained the bill of costs; I presume it was dated the 27th—there was a letter with it which I took to Mr. Bristowe, and I assume it is with the papers—Mr. Bristowe directed me to give the bill to Mr. Fullagar to tax, to look through it, and see whether the charges were proper—I took it to Mr. Fullagar on the same day and gave him Mr. Bristowe's message—he said "All right, put it down, I am engaged, I shall want the papers to look through, as I know nothing about it"—I gave him the letter, but not the envelope—I am not a solicitor, nor have I received a legal education—the prisoner, being a solicitor, Mr. Bristowe invariably sent his costs to him to see whether the charges were correct, whoever might attend to the management of the matter—I pat the papers on the floor by the side of his chair and called his attention to them—he said "All right," or "Thank you," or something to that effect—that was all that passed between us at the time—about a fortnight after<lb></lb>wards there was a further entry from me to Fullagar about the bill of costs—he said "I have looked through these costs; I do not see much to object to except full charges for attending the Trustees to sign the agreement, and full charges for the expenses of conveyance"—that was the stationer's fee, which ought to be reduced after the first attendance to execute the deed—the charges were for attending each Trustee, and he thought Mr. Reeve's costs ought to be less—Fullagar had the bill with him—this was in the front' room in Parliament Street, where he sat by himself—I do not remember whether he had the bill in his hand at the time, it is so long ago—on a subsequent occasion he said that the man had been kept so long without his money that he thought he should allow it in full—that was all he could do with the matter—I believe that was about seven weeks before we left Parliament Street—I must alter my answer, I believe it to have been six or seven weeks before January 1st—here is a letter of Mr. Bristowe's dated 20th November, 1876, requesting me to stop away from the office—I had then been away for a month from 20th November to the beginning of January through sickness in my family, and before that for a holiday—refreshing my memory by that, I say that this must have been in September or October—I hope in the course of the day to be able to give you the definite date—I came back on 2nd January, and found that the office had been changed to 8, Richmond Terrace—I had no further conversation with the prisoner about the bill of costs until after he and I had changed rooms, which I think was about the 10th or 12th of January—I, Swainson, and Peter were then in one room, and it used to be Fullagar, Swainson, and Peter, in Parliament Street—in Richmond Terrace Mr. Bristowe was in No. 1, Alfred Bristowe and I in No. 2, and Fullagar, Swainson, and Peter in No. 3—there are steps which go down from the house into Whitehall, and windows looking on to the Duke of Buccleuch's—there are two large windows</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">A sketch was here drawn by the Judge from the Witness' description</hi>)—mr. Bristowe's is the furthest room inside, nearest the House of Commons—that I call No. 1—the largest room was occupied by Swainson, Lindsay, and Peter when I left—the letter-rack was on the mantelshelf in No. 3—when the change was made Fullager went from No. 3 into No. 2—I took his place in No. 3—his papers were originally taken into the large room, and when he left he left a great portion of them behind—I did not see the papers changed—when we changed rooms I bad a conversation with Swain<lb></lb>son, but not in the prisoner's presence—the Maid's Acre papers were also put into the same room, No. 3, and I saw them there until the time I removed them into Mr. Bristowe's room with the draft letter containing the conveyance—I think that was the week before we removed, which would be the 19th or 20th February—before that I had heard from Mr. Swainson that a cheque had been drawn to pay Mr. Reeve's bill of costs—about a week before we removed I looked at the papers in No. 3 room to see whether the deed of conveyance was there—the papers were on the top of a press with a slanting top, without a cover—a great number of papers were kept there, and they were in great confusion, just as they had been brought over—I could not find the conveyance—it certainly ought to have been there—I then spoke to Swainson, and from what he said I drafted a letter to Mr. Reeve about the conveyance, for Mr. Bristowe's approval—I placed that on chair opposite his door for him to look at, but he was not there at the time; I left it there, but have never seen it since—that was on 19th or 20th February—neither the prisoner nor Mr. Bristowe spoke to me on the subject of that letter, but I am not certain whether I spoke to Mr. Bristowe about it—I have a slight recollection of doing so, and of his saying "I am busy and cannot look at it now"—that was not when I took it there, but in all probability it was the same day—after that I bad nothing to do with the matter till after I had got over to the Treasury—the letter was only a rough draft, it was not ready for signature; if approved it was to have been copied, and signed, and sent—I should imagine it would be Peter's duty to copy it—if Mr. Bristowe had altered it it would come back to me, and I should get it copied or give it to Peter to copy—it was on a half sheet of draft paper—I generally open the letters of a morning, such as relate to Admiralty' business; I do not open private letters—if the prisoner or Swain<lb></lb>son were at the office before me they would open them, or probably Mr. Alfred Bristowe if he felt inclined—I was generally there next to Peter—I got there about 10.15 or 10.20—I made the principal entries in this book—I have no memory of anything passing about the bill of costs on 31st January, and there is nothing here to prompt me—it was 26th February when we moved over to the office of the Solicitor to the Treasury at Whitehall—I can now say that that was the date when the papers were removed—I continued to do the Admiralty business there—I remember some enquiry being made in March about the conveyance—I have seen the receipt on the bill of costs and the endorsement on the cheque—I do not know who wrote them, but I did not—I know nothing of the cheque being taken to the bank, or of the receipt of the money; I never had a shilling of it—a few days after I gave evidence at Bow Street, on 24th March, and after the remand on the 31st, the prisoner called at the Treasury and saw me and Mr. Swainson—that was after his dismissal—I think it was about a week afterwards—I heard him apologise for language made use of by his Counsel at Bow Street—I left them together as I wanted to catch my train as it</p>

I have been cashier for ten years—during that time I have got accustomed to see faces—I do not generally look up unless there is anything particular about the cheque, if it is for a large amount or there is anything irregular about it—if a person presented it to me and I saw him a few days afterwards I should recognise that I had seen his face before, but whether in the street or in the bank I should not know—I do not think I should remember him in a month or two afterwards some faces will make a greater impression upon me than others—I do not call Fullagar's an everyday face—his features are well marked and defined, and rather striking than otherwise.</p>

I live at 55, Commercial Road, Pimlico, and am a clerk in: the Temple Bar branch post-office, opposite St. Dunstan's Church—I have: 'the sheets here—we issued these post-office orders on 31st January—I re<lb></lb>ceived the application from some person who came to the office whom I do—not remember—I cannot say whether I saw the person write this, but it is on one of the post-office order forms which hang on a rail, so that persons coming in can tear them off; they then go behind the screen, so that I should not see the person fill it up; when it is filled up it is handed to me—this is a form for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I issued two for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these two orders are for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, numbers 39653 and 39654, dated 30th January; they were filled up by me and addressed to the post-office, Piccadilly Circus, and I gave the orders to the person who gave me this form—I received from him these two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), 05179 and 05180—I entered the num<lb></lb>bers of them and put our office stamp on them—they also have my initials on them, so that I know they are the same—I should think it was about the middle of the day, but have no recollection of the person—my attention was first called to the matter about 22nd March—I do not know whether there was any name and address on the back of the notes when I received them—I might issue them again, but we generally keep notes till the close of the day; they are then sent to the Chief Office with the cash of the day—we advise the Piccadilly office in the ordinary way unless any other office is mentioned—"Piccadilly" on the order means the central office—there is another office in Down Street, Piccadilly.</p>

This word "Piccadilly" is written by the same person who filled up the application—I should say it is not stamped—I know nothing about it—I do not remember whether the person had any conversation with me as to where it was to be payable—I wrote "Circus" because I thought it would serve to trace the notes, knowing I had granted the order on the Circus—all that I know is, that the person asked for the order to be made payable at Piccadilly—I do not know whether he knew there were two offices in Piccadilly; I do not remember telling him—if the notes were not backed I should have requested the person to do so—I am under the impression that this "J. Fuller, 116, Blakfriars Road," was there when I granted the order—I do not know anything about "E. Butler" being struck out, or my saying "This is not your name"—I do not remember whether the notes were torn very much—we send the advices as soon as we get a small batch; we tie them together and send them by post—we send all the advices together from the different orders which we draw—we put them in our letter-box all tied together, country and town—the person at Piccadilly office does not know that an order has been drawn until he gets the advice, which he does two or three hours after we start them off—they go to the chief office and are distributed there addressed to each particular office—the chief office sorts them—I cannot say what time we</p>

I have been a clerk in Mr. Reeve's service for ten years come January—in January last Mr. Reeve had six clerks, including myself one of whom had been with him thirty-five years one five years, one two years, and another three, and one only a few months—they are all still in his service—I remember this business about Maid's Acre—I attended to the conveyance in the preliminary stage under Mr. Reeve—the transfer of the property to the Coastguard was going on for twelve or eighteen months before the actual completion of the purchase—I remember the purchase-money being paid into the Bank of England—Mr. Reeve held the conveyance until it was paid—I made out this bill of costs, and on 27th July sent it up to the Admiralty solicitor, Mr. Bristowe—I heard nothing more of it till March this year—I saw no letters in the office with reference to the recovery of the deed of conveyance—no applica<lb></lb>tion was made about it till March—I do not remember Saturday, the 27th, or Monday, the 29th January—I was attending to business at the end of January at the office, and was not away until Easter-Monday—I remember the application being made by Mr. Reeve in March, and I came up to London at that time the bill of costs and cheque had been sent down—I did not bring them back; another clerk did that—I know the writing of all the clerks doing business with Mr. Reeve—this "Received 30th January, 1877" is not like the writing of any one I know—I do not recognise the</p>

               <p>writing of the endorsement on the cheque—the writing on the application for the post-office order is not that of anyone I know, nor is the endorsement on these two bank-notes—I do not know this writing, "E. Butler," on the notes—there was no answer to the letters of 18th November, 11th December, and 29th December.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The writing is an apparent imitation of Mr. Reeve's signature, but it is not like his usual signature—it is in the same style—if it is an imitation I should think it is not the ordinary writing of the person who made it—we keep a press letter-book which I have here—letters an pressed after they are written—people sometimes acquire the habit of writing similar to one another—I think this must have been written by some person who knows Mr. Reeve's writing.</p>

On Friday afternoon, 23rd March, in consequence of directions I received, I was in Parliament Street; Mr. Lindsay was with me for the purpose of pointing out the prisoner—I said to the prisoner "Are you Mr. Fullagar?"—he said "Yes"—I said that I wished to speak to him—he turned round from Mr. Lindsay and walked down Parliament Street—I told him I was a detective officer, and had been instructed by the Solicitor to the Treasury to take him in custody, and he would be charged with forging a cheque for 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I should have to take him to King Street station, and he would be further charged with forging an endorsement for that amount—he said "Have the Treasury anyone to identify me, and shall I see them? I think they ought to have sent for me before this"—I told him I could not answer the question—he was taken to the station and taken before a Magistrate next day—I found on him some private papers and letters, a small amount of money, amount<lb></lb>ing to a shilling or two. and some keys, one of which was a skeleton, an old key filed; it would open almost any lock in our office in Scotland Yard—I asked him how he accounted for having a key of that description; he said that it was given to him by a gentleman, whose name I forget, some time ago, to open his drawers when he had left his keys behind, or had lost them—after his discharge at the police-court, he called at our office and asked for the things which had been taken from him, and I returned them, including that key.</p>

               <p>the lock of his drawers—I do not think he mentioned his office table-did not take down what the prisoner said, but I think it was "Why ha not the Treasury; said something to me about this before, and who ha they got to identify me with this?"—I said in my cross-examination "I do not remember your saying 'Why do they fix on me?'" and I may has said I was certainly in and out of the Treasury, why did not they speak to me then," or words to that effect.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Red Lion Square, I have for many years made handwriting a study, and have given my attention to dis<lb></lb>puted cases of handwriting—I have had placed in my hands the forged cheque and the forged receipt; I went to the bank and took tracings care<lb></lb>fully of the bank-notes, which tracings have been photographed—the bank-notes themsslvea are now in Court—I have seen numerous specimens of the prisoner's handwriting; I have also looked at the journal of 1876 throughout and certain pages—I have acquainted myself with the general character of the prisoner's handwriting—I am inclined to believe that the bill of costs, X 2 is in Fullagar's handwriting, but the writing being an imitation of another handwriting, I cannot express that opinion with any degree of strength, or rather I should say I cannot express a positive opinion—looking at X 1, I say that is undoubtedly in the same hand writing as the receipt—there is no similarity in X 2 with the prisoner's handwriting—the X 1 is undoubtedly the same handwriting as X 2, but taking X 1 by itself I can express no opinion whatever as to its being in the prisoner's handwriting, because it is a servile copy of another handwriting, I mean an exact copy, and the nearer the representation is to the original the more unlike it will be to the natural hand of the person who is making that representation—I make no distinction between an imitation and a servile imitation, both X 1 and X 2 are servile imitations—I have compared this signature "R. E Reeve" with the genuine signature of Mr. Reeve, and it is what I call a senile imitation, and so is the "K" in the word "received"—X 3 a and X 3 bare undoubtedly in the same handwriting; I cannot say that they are in the same handwriting as X 1 and X 2—to the best of my belief X 3 a and X 3 b are in the prisoner's handwriting, but I do not express an absolute belief—X 4 and X 5 are in the same handwriting, I express an absolute belief as to that—X 6, 7, and 8 are all in the same handwriting as X 3 a and b, and X 4 and 5 without any doubt whatever, and I believe they are all in the prisoner's handwriting—I express the same belief as to X 1 and 2 with the same qualification—in a serious matter like the present, I am very careful in expressing my opinion, taking X 1 by itself I cannot form the slightest opinion as to its being the prisoner's writing, I formed my opinion upon it from documents which I have not now in my possession, but which were put into my hands before the Magistrate. (<hi rend="italic">The witness here and in cross-examination entered in detail into a number of similarities existing in the forged documents to the handwriting of the prisoner, especially in regard to the for nation of certain letters; such as E, d, y, B, R, P, the crossing of the "t" and other peculiarities which taken singly would not amount to much, but taken together led him to the conclusion that the forged documents were in the prisoners writing.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOWEN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">then proposed to ask the witness as to certain dissimt<lb></lb>larities existing between the forged documents and the handwriting of Mr. Swainson and others; to which Mr. Grantluim objected as raising other issues than that which the Jury had to try.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE FIELD</hi>, <hi rend="italic">however, considered the evidence admissible. Mr. Chabot being examined thereon stated that some of the writing shewn to him was unlike, and as to others, similarities existed as would be the case with alt handwritings.</hi>)</p>

I am a solicitor at Lewes, I carry on my father's old business—I am Coroner for the eastern division of the county, and am the prisoner's brother—I believe he has borne a high character, if he had ever wanted money I should have assisted him, he knew that perfectly well, he had only to ask me for it—he was articled to my father and assigned to me at his death—he was admitted in 1867, he spent his last year in London, and has been in London since—he did not take out his certificate for some time after he was admitted, until he went to the Admiralty, where he was allowed to take private practice—I have known his handwriting all his life—I have seen the forged documents and have not a shadow of a doubt that my brother never wrote them, I am sure he did not, I don't believe he could—there is not the slightest resemblance to his handwriting.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Erpingham Rectory, near Norwich, the prisoner is my brother, he has always borne the character of a man of honour, honesty, and respectability—I have looked at the forged documents; they are certainly not written by my brother, or any portion of them—I am sure they are not; I know his writing well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN LORD</hi>. I live in Fulham Road, St. John's Wood, and am manager of the Reversion Mortgage Company, 28, New Broad Street—the prisoner was acting as solicitor to that company—in January, he had done certain work in registering the company, the expenses incident to which amounted to 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the company was registered about November, and that sum was due and owing to him from the company in January; a portion of it was; paid by him on 24th November, 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for the incorporation; the addi<lb></lb>tional expense would only be about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was paid to him in April, doubtless be would have had his money before if he had applied for it; the company would have been ready to pay it within a week, probably, from the time he applied for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is the certificate of the incorporation of the com<lb></lb>pany, dated 24th November, 1876; it is the certificate given under the Companies' Act, when the fee is paid; the 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would be paid within a day or two of that date—Mr. Fullagar registered the company, and drew up the Articles of Association, and he has acted as solicitor for carrying out several loans—this is simply a memorandum of the amount owing to him by the company at the time the allotment was made—the account was made out within a week of the date, 24th April, I can't say whether it was made out on the same day or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There were other charges owing to him besides the official charges for the incorporation, and there is an amount owing to him at the present time for work as solicitor; these were stated to be payments out of pocket, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at least was made in November.</p>

That was paid by a cheque on the Alliance Bank for 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>". in April—he has no shares in the company, and never had, and never applied for any—the company was promoted in November, 1875; he had something to do with promoting it, he paid the expences of the registration 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he found a portion of the capital; the capital of the company was nominally 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in about 300 shares, the real capital was from 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he found at least 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on or about April, 1877—the company did not go to allotment till then; I found the rest of the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; at that time the company consists of about ten or twelve shareholders.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was introduced to me by Mr. Bristowe, a friend of mine, I think four years ago—I think he was then in the Admiralty solicitor's office; I should not like to say for certain—I was under the impression that he was in Mr. Bristowe's employment when he introduced him to me, and he happened to be a member of the Junior Athenaeum Club, which I belonged to—the only business transaction I had with him was about twelve months ago—I have known Mr. Bristowe for some years—before the prisoner went into his office he was in a situation at Austin Friars, with Messrs. Francis and Bosanquet—I corresponded with him on the subject of the mortgage and have the letters here. (<hi rend="italic">Producing them</hi>)—I had other letters which I have destroyed—these are what I speak from in making my companion of handwriting—Mr. Humphreys shewed me a photograph on Friday last, at this Court—I came here on purpose—I compared the forgeries with these letters of Mr. Fullagar—I have seen him many times since his arrest—this document I have produced is a copy of a lease that was given to me by Mr. Fullagar, about twelve months ago—the money was on mortgage—as far as Mr. Fullagar was concerned, the transac<lb></lb>tion was closed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 63, Gracechurch Street, I have acted as agent for Mr. Fullagar's father, and for his son for many years—I was originally articled to Mr. Fullagar, as a solicitor in 1848—the prisoner came to London, at the end of 1865 or 1866, and came into my office for the remainder of his articles—he left sometime in the following year—during the time he was with me he transacted many matters of business for me, and very much to my satisfaction—I had the greatest confidence in him—I was constantly in the habit of seeing him write—I saw all the original forgeries at Bow Street police-court, and have seen photographs of most of the originals since, and in my opinion they are certainly not in his handwriting; I feel quite positive about it—I formed that opinion at Bow Street directly I saw the documents, I have since examined them again with care, and that has fortified my opinion—he always bore the character of an honest honourable and respectable man—I never beard anything against him, I have constantly seen him coming to my house, and also upon matters of business—he went from me to Messrs. Francis and Bosanquet, on my recommendation to Mr. Francis—he was upon sufficiently intimate terms with me, that if he was pressed for money he might have asked me for it, and I should certainly have lent it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Six or seven years ago, I think he did ask me for 5f. for some purpose, which I had back again—I do not recollect anything else—I carry on business in Gracechurch Street, where I have been for twenty-two years; I think Mr. Fullagar left Francis and Bosanquet's, about two</p>

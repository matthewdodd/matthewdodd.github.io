               <p>I live in St. John's-lane, Smithfield; I work for Mr. Wick of Islington, who has undertaken to build the New Compter; on Saturday night, the 18th of August, I had received my money of my master; and about seven or eight o'clock, as I was coming through <placeName id="t17870912-69-crimeloc330">Cloth Fair</placeName>

               <p>Are you sure it was her? - I am sure it was her; I spoke to her and told her to keep away; she turned out my breeches pocket, on the right hand side; as soon as she had turned out my pocket and got the money, she loosed me and ran into the Weaver's Arms just by; I followed her immediately, and never lost sight of her.</p>
               <p>Had she taken any thing? - She had taken six shillings and six pence out of my pocket, and she had got it with her.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that you had six shillings and six-pence in your pockets? - I am perfectly sure of it.</p>
               <p>You followed her into the public-house? - I did, and challenged her with taking my money; I wanted to take her up, and the man that belonged to the house pushed me out as I went to the door; a man came and struck me right on the breast and knocked me over in the street, and I stopped within sight of the door till the watchman came, and I called him and gave him charge of her.</p>

               <p>Was she there still? - Yes, she was there with a man drinking just by her; then she was taken into custody, and she was taken down to the watch-house; the constable never searched her.</p>
               <p>How came that? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did he refuse to search her? - I don't say he refused to search her; then a man passed his word for her appearance, and she was discharged.</p>
               <p>Whose word was taken for her appearance? - The publican's.</p>
               <p>Did she come again on the Monday? - I went on the Monday to the constable's house, and to the Weaver's Arms to enquire for her; I found he was gone to the Excise-Office, and the mistress of the house told me where she lived, and we went to take her in her own room.</p>
               <p>What public-house was this? - The Weaver's Arms in Cloth-fair.</p>
               <p>On the Monday you took her up, and carried her before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And she was fully committed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was quite sober? - Yes; I had drank share of one pot of beer, that is all I had drank that day.</p>
               <p>You lost nothing but the money? - No.</p>

               <p>About ten o'clock, as I was coming my round, I saw this man standing crying at the door, he had got a shovel or a spade in his hand; and he was standing crying at the publick-house door, the Weaver's Arms; he said he had been robbed by some woman, who was gone into the Weaver's Arms; I asked him if he should know the person, he said he should; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120116"></xptr>went into the house with him, and the man of the house said, there was no person there that had robbed him, and desired him to go out; the prisoner at the bar was there, and he said he was sure that was the woman; we came out, and I asked him if he was sure that was the woman when he was in the house; I told him if it was, I would go in and take her out; I did so, and went and took her down to the watch-house, and she was bailed as before related.</p>
               <p>Who was the constable of the night? - One Mr. Vaughan.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - At No. 7, in Cloth-fair.</p>
               <p>He took the publican's word? - Yes.</p>
               <p>For her appearance on Monday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it usual to take bail for capital felonies? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Vaughan here? - No; he was sent for, but he sent word he was too busy to come.</p>
               <p>I don't wonder at his being shy; I believe he has done more than any magistrate can do.</p>

               <p>I am innocent of what is laid to my charge; I was in at the Weaver's Arms, I had been there full an hour, when he came in; he said the landlady was the woman that had robbed him; me rob you! says she; yes, says he; says I, you may as well say that I robbed you, as to say that that woman robbed you; then, says he, it is you, and I will charge the watch with you; with that he charged the watch with me, and I was carried to the watch-house; the man of the house came down and was bail for me; I staid at home till the Monday, then he came for me; then I went to Guildhall, but I never saw the man till he came to say that he was robbed.</p>

               <p>I live in Cloth-fair; I keep the Weaver's Arms; my husband is not here; he is not at home; he had nothing to do in it; he was not within at the time the affair happened, and the man came in, he came in soon after; all I have to say is, this man came in crying, he seemed to be drunk; it was about a quarter after nine, and some people in the tap-room asked him what was the matter; he said his pocket was picked of four shillings; some of the people asked him by whom; I stood up, that is the woman, says he to me; by and bye I got into the bar to serve; so he said no more but walked out; I laughed at him when he said it was me; he saw me going into the bar, and he went out.</p>
               <p>He did not fix on any body else? - Not at that present time.</p>
               <p>Did he say whether he was robbed by one or more? - He mentioned me as the person taking the money.</p>
               <p>He did not mention any more at the time? - No, he went out when he saw me go into the bar, and sat crying.</p>
               <p>What till the watchman came up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might that be? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>What happened after the watchman came up? - He and the watchman came in, and the watchman asked him which was the woman; he looked round, he saw the prisoner and he challenged her, then the watchman took her away.</p>
               <p>Then after he had charged you, and you laughed at his mistake, he went out and sat crying at the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And then came in again with the watchman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the watchman took her to the watch-house? - He did not go out without her, but took her to the watch-house directly.</p>
               <p>Was any body present that is here, when the prosecutor came in and said he was robbed? - Yes, Sir, there is another that was in the woman's company.</p>

               <p>Did he come home before or after they were gone to the watch-house? - I cannot recollect that.</p>
               <p>Do you think he came home after they were gone to the watch-house? - I cannot recollect, whether he come home before she was taken from my house, or whether he followed her.</p>
               <p>That is not the question; we all know he followed to the watch-house: I want to know whether he came home before the prisoner was taken to the watch-house, or whether he came home after? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Did he take any notice of the man standing crying at the door? - No, Sir, I cannot recollect that; I cannot recollect whether he came home while the man was standing crying at the door; I do not know what he might say.</p>

               <p>Why then he did not see her taken up himself then? - No, Sir, I don't think he was within at the time she was taken up; he was not within when the man came in crying.</p>
               <p>Was he within when the woman was up, upon your oath or not; come answer; you have had time enough to consider; why do not you answer? - I think the woman was taken up before he came in.</p>
               <p>And then he went to the watch-house after her? - I do not know what passed at the watch-house; I know the woman by sight; I don't know whether she has any business, or what business; I believe she is single.</p>
               <p>Is she a house-keeper? - She is a room-keeper; a lodger at my house, the next door to the Weaver's Arms, at another house of my husband's.</p>
               <p>Has he many lodgers there? - Yes, he has.</p>

               <p>Do you know whether he did or not? - Yes, I heard him say he did, he went out of my house the same time that she went; when the watchman took her, Brown went with her, they all went out together.</p>
               <p>I mean the watchman, and her and Brown, and the man that was robbed? - Brown went with the watchman and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Then it was not Brown that told your husband that she was taken to the watch-house? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was Brown in the house before the rest came back from the watch-house; or did they come back together? - I cannot tell whether they all come back together, or not.</p>
               <p>Did Brown come back before your husband came back from the watch house? - No, he did not that I know.</p>

               <p>How long was it before any thing happened? - About half past nine, a man came in crying, and he said he had lost 4 s. 3 d. and he first charged the landlady of the house, who was sitting in the tap-room at the Weaver's Arms; he came in by himself, and said he had lost 4 s. 3 d. and that she had robbed him of it, and he would swear it; he said that without any body asking him any questions, I never heard any body asking him any questions about it; and then directly as soon as he came in, he said he had lost 4 s. 3 d. and that the landlady had taken it, he went out crying.</p>
               <p>Did any body tell him he was robbed? - No, I never heard any body tell him he was robbed; there were people in the house told him he had not been robbed by any body there.</p>
               <p>What said the landlord to him for charging his wife with this robbery? - He was was not at home at the time.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true that he asked him what he meant by charging his wife with such a thing? - No; before the landlord came home the girl was charged; he went out crying, and stood crying at the door till the watchman went past ten, he brought him in and he charged this girl.</p>
               <p>Was the landlord come home then? - I do not believe he was.</p>
               <p>What passed when the watchman and he came in? - He directly fixed on this woman, and said she robbed him; the watchman told the man, if he would swear to it he would take charge of her, he said he would; upon that he took charge of her directly.</p>
               <p>What did he do with her afterwards? - He took her to the watch-house in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120119"></xptr>What became of you? - The landlord came and bailed her out, I went with her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The watchman had not been in before, had he? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The landlord came and bailed her out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long after you was at the watch-house? - I believe it might have been for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, that was the first of my seeing the landlord that night.</p>
               <p>What became of her after she was bailed out? - After I came out of the watch-house, I went straight home, I did not stop, I did not go to the Weaver's Arms.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure of that? - I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Quite sure? - Yes, quite sure.</p>
               <p>You did not drink a pint of beer with her after you came from the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carney. Yes, you did, Brown.</p>
               <p>No, I did not go to the Weaver's Arms, but I well remember she treated me with a glass of gin, at a gin-shop in Long-Lane.</p>
               <p>Then she did not go to the Weaver's Arms? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What became of the landlord? - I do not know; he came home I suppose; I did not see the landlord after she came out of the watch-house at all.</p>
               <p>Is Long-lane in the way from the watch-house to Cloth-Fair? - The Weaver's Arms is just joining to Long-lane.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner treated you with a glass of gin in Long-lane, and you left her at that door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you and she any supper before at the Weaver's Arms? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you nothing at all to eat? - No, not there, I had my supper in Long-lane before I met with her.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner when you was there any thing to eat? - Not to my knowledge, I did not see her eat any thing to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You did not see the landlady bring her any thing to eat? - I do not remember that.</p>
               <p>Had you gin or beer at the Weaver's Arms? - Beer, your worship, I had a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Who served you? - A young woman, she might be a servant for what I know, it was a young woman served us.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing more? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Watchman. I think you told me that you know the man that keeps the Weaver's Arms personally? - I do.</p>
               <p>I think you told me that when the prosecutor first took you into the house, the landlord answered you, and said there was no person there that had robbed any body? - I say so now; I am sure it was him; it is true upon my oath; he desired me to go out and this man likewise.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You know the landlord of the house? - Yes; it is the same man that bailed the woman out of the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Was that man in the house when you and the watchman went in the first time? - Yes, he was stripped in his shirt sleeves.</p>
               <p>Is it true that he said what the watchman has said? - Yes, it is true.</p>
               <p>He said there was no person there that had robbed you, and desired you to go out? - That is true.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes, upon my oath it is so.</p>
               <p>Court to Watchman. How long have you known the master of the house? - Ever since he has kept the house, which I believe is six or seven months; I know his person perfectly well; I have no doubt but he is the person that spoke to me; his wife was there at the time, and she said this man challenged her before I came there with being the person that robbed him; that was when her husband was there, and when I first went in; the second time, when I brought him to the door, I said, are you sure that is the person, he said he was sure it was; I said, I will go and fetch her out; the husband was there both times, and followed us to the watch-house; I cannot say that Brown was there.</p>
               <p>(Here the learned Judge summed up the Evidence.)</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120120"></xptr>Jury to Watchman. Pray was the prosecutor any ways in liquor at the time you first met with him? - I do not know whether he might or no; he was crying and seemed very much troubled; I cannot swear he was not in liquor.</p>

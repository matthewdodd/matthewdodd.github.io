            . I am coachman to Mr. Charles Tyrishit Jones. On the 23d of January, at half-past five o'clock in the afternoon; I left the prisoner in the stables, he was helper there - he asked me to lend him some money - I lent him 11 d. being all I had, Master's box coat and four others, were then in the stable, I returned after tea, and met the prisoner; he said he had not got enough money; I told him to go and wait at the public house for me. I went to the public house, and found the other helpers there, but not him. I was ordered to have the carriage ready at half-past seven; and in going to the stable I found the door locked, the key outside, and missed these two coats.</p>

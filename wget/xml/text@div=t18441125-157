                  </hi>. I live in West-street, Stratford. The prisoner is my brother, and he occasionally lived in the same house with me. On Thursday evening, the 21st of Nov., I came home, and went up stairs to put away a little money in a box—I found my box had been broken open, and missed from it three handkerchiefs—I came down, and missed a pair of shoes and another handkerchief—I went to the station, and gave infor<lb></lb>mation, and the prisoner was taken by a policeman—the policeman took a handkerchief from the prisoner at the station, in my presence—it was one of those which I had missed from below stairs—it was a cotton one, and I have the fellow one to it on my neck now—it is my mother's misfortune to be blind, and she is lying on her bed—any one can get into the house without being seen.</p>

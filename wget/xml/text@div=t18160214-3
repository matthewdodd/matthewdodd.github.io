            ; I lodged there in January last; I had lodged there some days, before the 15th of January; I was there on the 15th, and was in bed when this was committed. I went to bed about the hour of ten, or rather before; I slept in the house, up two pair of stairs; my clothes were not in the room in which I slept, they were in a little back room, on a platform; it is a back room which stands by the water side. There is a platform outside the room; my clothes were in that room, in a chest; that chest was not locked, but lashed down with ropes. I had seen that chest during that day after dinner. Sometimes I dine at two. I had not gone to take anything out of the chest, before I went to bed; it was properly secured, as I used to do, before I went to bed. When I was in bed, I was alarmed by the witness

            ; he came to the door and informed me, that my chest was broken open. I got up, and went down stairs; and the first thing that was presented to me, was a pair of blue pantaloons; I do not know who shewed them to me. I afterwards went backwards, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140005"></xptr>found some of my things were in it, and some were lying round it; there were some deficient, but I could not tell how many. I went into the tap-room, and the prisoner was pointed out to me; I had not known him before. He was there sitting in one corner of the tap-room; there were several persons round him. They told me they suspected him to be the man; he heard that; I do not recollect what he said; he said he was innocent; nothing more was said at that time. I thought, that as the necessary was over the river, and as it was then low water, that some of my clothes might be thrown down. When I was in the tap-room, the patroles went into the yard to search it. I examined my chest, and missed a blue jacket, in one pocket of which was a pocket-book, a red morocco one, with four one-pound bank notes in it; and a pair of drawers, two pairs and a half of stockings, which was worth about two shillings; a white flannel shirt, and a silk handkerchief, which was in the other pocket of the jacket. All these were mine.</p>

            , in January last. The last witness lodged there. I knew the prisoner, and had seen him there before. He sat in the tap-room the most part of the day of the 15th; the day on which this happened about the chest. This house of James Smith, is in Lower Shadwell. He had sat in the house most part of the day, untill ten o'clock at night; he went out, and got a little supper, and asked me for a clean plate, and I fetched it him. He asked the landlady for a lodging; he was told he could have no lodging there; then he went out in the back yard, and went past this parlour in which the chest was; I remained in the the tap-room. I soon after went into yard for water to scour the tables; I saw his fingers holding the privy door, and I said, who do these trowsers belong to; I knew his voice, so as to know it was him. I found a pair of trowsers in one privy, and he was in the other. I asked him if they were his; and he said no. I had a candle in my hand, and I took them into the house, and I told the landlady that I had found a pair of trowsers, and she put them into the bar. The prisoner went out of the house, and he came back again for a three-shilling-piece, which he had given in a mistake; he was stopped in the house by the man who had lost the things; I called him out of bed. I saw David Smith's chest then, and the lashing was cut, and the chest was open; I saw his clothes about; several out of the chest on the floor. I know nothing more. The prisoner was taken out of the house by the prosecutor.</p>

            . I lived at Limehouse; I lived at Mr. Pooles, the Ship and Shears, St. Paul's Shadwell, in January last. I know no further than that this prisoner brought a bundle to my master's house and asked him to take care of it; my master told me to take care of it, until the next morning. We took the bundle into the kitchen, and put it on the dresser. The prisoner went away directly. Mr. Poole's house is a very little distance from where the prosecutor lodged. I had seen the prisoner at my master's house before. I did nothing more with the bundle than put it in the kitchen; the kitchen is not an open place, that every body may have access to. I did not stop with the bundle. I fastened the kitchen door when I went to bed. I went into the kitchen at a little after six the next morning; nobody could get into our house, I found the kitchen as it had been, and the bundle on the corner of the dresser where I had left it; it was in the same situatiation, as I had left it. The bundle was tied in a yellow handkerchief; I had not looked inside of it. Somebody came and told us, that the prisoner had been taken for a robbery. I gave the bundle to Mr. Poole, in the evening of the 16th; it stood on the dresser in the kitchen. My house-keeper, my master, and other people, went into that kitchen. I gave it to my master, in the same condition as I believe I received it. The yellow handkerchief was not hemmed. I am quite sure, that the bundle was delivered to me, by the prisoner at the bar.</p>

In consequence of something which was told to me, I went immediately for an officer and he came with me, and my servant, the last witness, brought me the bundle down stairs, which the prisoner had given to her the night previous; it was a bundle tied up in a yellow handkerchief. The officer took it into his charge. The bundle was opened in my presence; I can't say what it contained, but there was a red pocket-book, with some notes in it; that was taken out of one of the pockets of the jacket in the bundle. There were some papers. I don't recollect whether there were three or four one-pound notes in it.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH THOMAS. I live at No. 27, Hart-street, Covent-garden; my son Edward William is seven years old. On Sunday evening, the 23d of September, he was with me; I had to call with some milk in Clement's Inn, which I brought from my master's place, in High-street, Bloomsbury: I gave a quart can to the child to hold - I was absent from him above three minutes; the child had walked from the door about two yards - I saw the prisoner, as I came out take the can from the child's hand, and walk away with it; I ran after him, and asked what he wanted with it; he said he wanted milk for his coffee - he was no customer of mine - there was a pint and a half of milk in it; I laid hold of it, and he would not give it up to me for some time; he said neither the can nor the child belonged to me; he did not run away, but stood there, and two patrols came up; I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Where was this? A. In <placeName id="t18271025-88-crimeloc527">Wild-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields</placeName>

            . I am a patrol. I was coming up Wild-street, and saw several lads, of the prisoner's age, standing at the corner of Steward's-rents - he was about the centre of them - this woman came about six yards from him, and asked me to take him for taking the can from her boy; he said he was not the lad; he went quietly with me - his brothers would have rescued him if they could - they were tumultuous; the can was delivered to me - the prosecutrix recommended him to mercy, and the Magistrate bailed him, and I gave it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The woman left him to come to you? A. She did, for ten or eleven yards; there were several persons round him.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer's labourer, and live in Oxford-street. I was present when this happened; the prisoner's brother asked the child to let him drink; the child looked back, and then ran away; the mother came back to the young man, and asked if he wanted to thieve the can: he laughed at her, and asked if she was drunk - they jaw'd one another; two patrols came up; she went and told them that he took the can from the child; the young man who had asked to drink, walked aside; the prisoner stood with his back to the wall of Steward's-rents, and she gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In whose hands was the can? A. In the mother's; she took it out of the child's hand; it was never in the prisoner's hand; it was never out of the child's hand till she took it out - the two young men had drank a drop; there was no interruption to the patrol taking the prisoner, but I did not follow them - nobody drank out of the can; the young man who asked to drink, did not get any; it was two young men, two brothers; when she saw the child run away, she thought they had taken the can - I told the patrol, that was not the man who asked to drink, and that he had never touched the can - I was working last at Tyburn-gate - I do not know who for - I knew the prisoner, for about a month, by having lodged where he did.</p>
               <p>JOEL SPENCER re-examined. I cannot say whether this witness was among the persons - nobody told me the child had not had the can taken out of his hands, not that I recollect; some person did come up and say that was the wrong man; the person who stands there, and another, who has gone out, were the two who behaved disorderly; they laid hold of me on each side - I said I would knock them down; they then desisted.</p>

            . I went and asked the child for a drink of water, thinking it was water - I did not molest him any further - he went on with the can - I never had my hand on it; the mother came up and said I meant to take the can away; the patrol came up, and she gave charge of my brother - I went and laid hold of the patrol, and said he was innocent - I thought the child was coming from Wild-street pump, with some water - I have seen water carried in such a can; it was never out of the child's hand, till the mother took it; she has sworn falsely - I touched the patrol on the shoulder, and said my brother was innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you, he would knock you down if you interfered? A. He did not tell me exactly; there were a good many round - I touched him on the shoulder - I did not lay hold of him - I sell things about the street now.</p>
               <p>JOEL SPENCER. That is one of the young men whom I threatened to knock down, if he interrupted me; he was pulling me by the collar, and the other patrol, King, who was with me; he said I had got the wrong man.</p>

            . I work at Mr. Jones', a smith, in Well-street - I live in Wild-court, and was in Steward's-rents - the prisoner and his brother were standing together - the child came along with the can in his hand; the prisoner's brother went up, and asked for a drink of water - the child looked back - the mother came up to the brother, and asked what he wanted with the child - he said, "Only a drink of water" - she stood there, calling us thieves and pick-pockets, and asked why we did not take her up for calling us such names - the patrols came by, and she gave charge of the wrong boy, and said he took the can; but he did no such thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Nobody took the can then? A. No - it is all a lie - I had seen a boy fetch water from the pump, in a can like it, but it had no top to it like this - I did not follow the patrol to the watch-house, or say any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was standing in Wild-street; the woman came down with the child, who had the can in his hand; she was intoxicated, and asked if I wanted to take the can; my brother, who stood by, had asked the child for some water, and she gave me in charge - I was let out on bail, and have surrendered.</p>
               <p>JOEL SPENCER. I did not consider her in liquor; she was in a rage.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTRIX. I took the can out of the prisoner's hand; he did not appear as if he wanted to drink; he said he wanted it for his coffee; he held it some time before he would give it me; there were several round him, but I held him by the collar, till I crossed over to the patrol - I let go of him, to go to the patrol.</p>

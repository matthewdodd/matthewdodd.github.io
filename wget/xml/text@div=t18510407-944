                  </hi>. I live with my father, who keeps the Wheat Sheaf beer-shop, at Hammersmith. On Sunday evening, 30th March, about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming from the yard, and go out at the front-door—there is a door in the yard which leads from one yard to ano<lb></lb>ther, and I saw that open—I immediately ran out, and saw a horse-trough moved from its place, and placed against the wall, so that any one could get on the tiles, and my bed-room window was open—I went up to my room, and missed my watch from off the drawers, which I had seen safe there at four—I went out, found the prisoner in a turning close by, brought him back to the front of the bar, and asked what he had got in his pockets; he turned out several things, but nothing of mine—I then went in search of a person who was with him at our house—I was gone about two minutes, and brought him back (he was discharged by the Magistrate)—I kept them there while my father went for a policeman, and during that time they pulled our gas-burner down, and struck me several times; and during the striking I picked up this handkerchief, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which is mine—a constable came and took them into custody; and while I was gone to the station, the watch was found in our passage—I bad passed through there when I went after the second man, and am quite sure it was not there then—next morning I missed a pair of boots which I had left in my room on the Sunday-morning, and found an old pair under my bed, which did not belong to me—I was going to the station, and met the constable half-way, bringing my boots; these are them <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>—a person by walking on the horse-trough, as it was placed, could get on the kitchen, and could then get in at my window—the value of the things I lost is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

On this evening I was at the beer-shop, and saw the prisoner in the pas<lb></lb>sage—I saw him go to the back door and attempt to go out, and Miss George told him he should not—he turned back again, and Mr. George then came back with his companion, and kept them there till the police<lb></lb>man</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Miss George follow the prisoner as far as he went? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he came baek directly—the other man was smaller than the prisoner—I cannot say whether he was younger.</p>

            . On the 19th of March, about five o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop and asked me to shew her some print, I shewed her some, she purchased of me to the amount of three shillings, and paid me for it, and while she was buying them she conveyed this piece of print off the counter under her cloak, she went out of the shop. I and another young man followed her and brought her into the shop, and then about two yards from the shop door, when she was brought into the shop a piece of print fell from under her clothes, I immediately sent for a constable. This is the print I am confident it is my masters property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop to purchase two yards of print, I gave three shillings for it, and when I came out of the shop the gentleman brought me back, there was a great deal of print laying on the counter, another young woman stood there, the gentleman saw the print lay at a young woman's feet, they said I dropped it there.</p>
               <p>Jury. How near was the other young woman to the prisoner. - A. About a yard distance, the prisoner was not close to the counter, but the other young woman was, the prisoner was about two yards in the shop, and the print lay about a yard from the counter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

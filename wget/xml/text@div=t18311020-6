            . I am ostler at the Nag's Head; Whitechapel - Mr. Bassage comes to our house two or three times a week. I remember the prisoner bringing a gelding there; it remained in my possession nearly two hours - the prisoner took it away; Mr. Bassage was not with him then - the prisoner did not ask me for the horse; I did not give it to him - I saw him riding away by the counting-house door, while I was at dinner - I did not see Mr. Bassage there; there are two ostlers to our yard.</p>
               <p>MR. BASSAGE. I gave neither of the ostlers authority to have the horse rode away by any body.</p>

               <p>Q. Was her box locked?</p>
               <p>Farr. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say she came by the things ?</p>
               <p>Farr. She told me the nutmegs ( there were twenty-one large ones) were given her by a person that came from on board a ship, the mace and cloves were with them in a box.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say as to the rest of the things?</p>
               <p>Farr. She could not tell what to say as to the sugar and tea, because I knew them to be mine; I used to breakfast in the compting-house, and after I sent the sugar up I could have none come down again; I put down but two pounds of tea, but there was a great deal more; she said she brought the tea with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own that she had taken any thing from you?</p>
               <p>Farr. No: she said one of my men gave her the sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say any of the things mentioned are your's?</p>
               <p>Farr. I believe them all to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason for so believing?</p>
               <p>Farr. I have sugar of the very same to match that, and am positive it is mine, or at least have all the reason possible to believe it; after she was committed to the Compter, it happened to be mentioned in Newgate-street that I had a servant that had committed a theft, and sent to prison; a man by accident said is it the chamber-maid or the cook; he was told, it was the cook; said he, I am sorry for it, for I have a box of her's in my house in the Old Change; I went there with a constable, and the constable opened the box that the people said was the prisoner's; in that box I found a key that undoes my lock, to a place in my dinning-room, where I lock up my tea and other things, and there I found the tea.</p>

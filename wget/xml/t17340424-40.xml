               <p>Murphey. Yes; we were well acquainted for 2 or 3 Years. I knew him, and he knew me in a very particular manner - He took up a Knife at my Lodgings, and swore he would be my Death, if I would not maintain him - And another time, he cut this Gown a-cross, intending to cut my Flesh. I can't disown but I have been an unfortunate Woman. And when I had got Money to give him, he'd be pleasant enough; but if I had none, then he would call me all the Bitches in Life, and bid me, turn out, and knock down Men in the Streets, and whatever I could get from other Persons, bring to him, and then I should be welcome; for he did not care what he drove me to - But I design to reform before it's long - Here's the Cloak - You may see how he has hammock'd it - I am sure I was forced to pay for it, for I had borrow'd it to disguise my self, for fear he should know me, and do me some Mischief if he met me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. As I was going home I saw these 2 Women, who are both Women of the Town; and this Mrs. Murphey call'd me Thief and Blackguard-Dog, and said if I did not come to see her as I used to do, she would hang me; and now she has taken me at a Non-plush about this Cloak that was cut, because I won't make it good, and because I won't live with her. When I first fell into her Company, she robb'd me of a Moidore that my Wife work'd hard for. But I was drunk, and she put me to Bed in Magpye-Alley, and I did not know where I was when I waked. And so I got out of Bed, and got a Warrant against her - I am a <rs id="t17340424-40-deflabel174" type="occupation">Butcher</rs>

Collins having by this means got sufficiently into the Secret, acquainted the Governour of the Bank with it; whereupon a Warrant was taken out, and the Prisoner's House search'd, where the very Bill in the Indictment and others were found, and also an Account in Writing of several Bills, their Numbers, and Sums receiv'd on them. Another Witness was one Mors, who depos'd, That the Prisoner propos'd to him that he might get 10000 l. if he would be concern'd; and that he did engage in it, saw the Prisoner make the Experiment, and receiv'd Money at the Bank for him, for which he was to have a third part of the Profit. The Prisoner did not deny the Fact; but being allow'd Council, they argu'd, That Mr. Odam was not a Servant qualify'd to make out such Bills, unless authoriz'd by the Corporation-Seal; That writing with Red Ink on the Inside of the Bill, cannot be call'd an Indorsement ; Nor, if that were an Indorsement, can the Fact be call'd rasing or altering. To this the King's Council answer'd, and the Prisoner's reply'd; whereupon the Court were of Opinion, that Mr. Odam is a Servant qualify'd to make out such Bills for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, but the other two Articles are <rs id="t17150602-10-verdict52" type="verdictDescription">

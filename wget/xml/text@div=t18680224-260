                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Clermont, of 11, Silver Street, Wood Street, foreign importer—these shawls (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are his property—on 30th January, I left the warehouse about four o'clock, they were then safe on the counter with about thirty others—other persons were in the warehouse when I left—I saw the shawls at the Police Court next day—they are worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I returned in about an hour—I heard of the loss the moment I returned from Mr. Clermont—there are two numbers on them, one corresponds with the invoice, the other is the manufacturer's number.</p>

On the afternoon of 30th January I was in Gresham Street, with another officer, Whitney—I saw the prisoners come out of Wood Street into Gresham Street together, at about a quarter past five—we watched them, and saw them go into five different warehouses, one in Gresham Street, one in Aldermanbury, two in Wood Street, and one in Silver Street, which is Mr. Clermont's—Lawrie came out first, and walked on to Falcon Street, where Luigi joined him—they went several streets, until they came to King Edward Street, where they went into a public-house for a few minutes, and came out together—we followed them to the foot of Holborn Hill, where I stopped Lawrie—Whitney stopped Luigi—Lawrie was wearing a large cape—I said, "What have you got under your cape?"—he said, "Nothing"—I pulled his cape on one side, and found these two shawls—I said, "How do you account for these?"—he said, "I shall say nothing here, but I will speak to you at the station-house"—I took him to the station—in the presence of the inspector I asked him if the shawls were marked or ticketed—he said, "No, they are not"—I searched him, but found nothing on him.</p>

               <p>Q. You lost your two jackets and two trowsers - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All you know is, you lost them - A. Yes.</p>

About four o'clock I went out to Billingsgate-market. I hawk fish. When I went out the prosecutor's bag was full of clothes, and when I returned I found it three parts empty, to what I saw it in the morning. I went to Mr. Brown, and had the prisoner apprehended. He confessed that he took the things. He was drunk and hungry. He sold them for twenty-six shillings, in the highway; and a pair of trowsers he put on himself, he said, before he went out.</p>

               <p>THOMAS NEW. I am a slop-seller. I bought a pair of trowsers and two jackets of the prisoner. I gave him twenty-six shillings for them.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BROWN. I was in company with Butler in apprehending the prisoner. He confessed that he got into the house, and sold the clothes to a gentleman in the highway; a pair of trowsers and two jackets, to Mr. New, for twenty-six shillings. He said, he put the window back, and got in. I went to the slop-seller. He produced the property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lazarus. How many lodgers have you got in the house - A. I had two, that is all. I was the last person that went out. At this time the key was fixed in the door. He was to get in at the next door, and I got in at the next door. I got over the next yard myself, that day, to go in at the kitchen window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drunk and hungry when I did it.</p>

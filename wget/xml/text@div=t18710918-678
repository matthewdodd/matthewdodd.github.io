                  </hi>. I live at Great Pearl Street, and am a pipe-maker—about 10.30 on the night of Monday, 7th August, I was in Tyson Street, with my wife, who was about two steps behind me—she called out—as soon as I turned round, the prisoner collared me by the collar and forced my head back with his arm—I felt my watch was snatched—I said "He has got my watch"—we had a struggle—he then ran up a court by the side of a beer-shop—I said "I know you"—I knew him by sight before—my watch was worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not seen it since—I went to the station</p>

               <p>the next morning, and gave a description—I could not speak at first, my throat was sore—I saw the prisoner two days afterwards, on the Wednesday night, and I picked him out from four others—I am sure he is the man—my opportunities of observation were good—there was a gas light about two yards off, and my back was towards it, and it was light where he turned round by the beer-shop—I pointed the beer-shop out to the constable—I don't know the name of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I work for Mr. Crop, at Homerton, close by the church—I have about three miles to go—I have worked there nine mouths—I was not coming from work on this occasion—I had come from the Victoria Park—I did not go to work at all that day—my wife had a holiday, and I went along with her—it would take a little more than five minutes to walk from Tyson Street to where I live—we were going towards home from the park—we had been walking about all the evening—I had a glass of ale—I was as sober as I am now—I had seen the prisoner before about the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood of Brick Lane and Church Street, but not that evening, before his arm was round my neck—I was very much frightened—my wife saw him, too.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—I was walking just behind him on this night—I could have touched him—someone touched me behind—I went "Oh!"—my husband turned to see what was the matter—before he could speak someone put their arm up so, and pulled the watch, but not without a struggle—I could not swear to the person because his back was towards me—he was taller than my-husband, and seemed younger—I beard my husband say "He has got it; I know him, I will have him."</p>

On Thursday the 6th of November, about twelve o'clock, the two prisoners at the bar came into my master's shop and asked to look at some printed cottons for gowns; I shewed them several.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both ask? - I cannot positively say that they both asked; they came in together and conversed together; they asked one anothers opinions on the prints, and they fixed on one which we could not agree for the price of. The prisoners at the bar and me. I shewed them several others and they did not like any of these others; and Bailey replied she would give me two shillings a yard for ten yards, while I was cutting it off and folding it up, Vaughan said that they wanted some cloth, but they had not got the money, and they would come in the afternoon; while I was folding it up I perceived that Vaughan had something very large under her gown, which raised my suspicion, and I fixed my eyes very stedfast on her, Bailey stepped in between us and asked what was most proper for a lining, I recommended her a lining, she desired me to cut her off a yard, which altogether came to one guinea. Vaughan turned about and went towards the door, and Bailey was seeking for a guinea, to pay for the gown; Vaughan got to the door before Bailey laid down the guinea, I immediately gave Mrs. Clarke the guinea, and ran down to the door to apprehend Vaughan, I apprehended her at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mrs. Clarke, the wife of Mr. Clarke? - Yes. I said to Mrs. Vaughan, ma'am, I want what you have got, from under your gown; I catched hold of her by the arm, and took up her gown, and found these shawls under it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many are there-Eight; the constable will produce another.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she a cloak on? - I cannot positively say; her gown was lapped over before her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the shawls? - I took them from her, and brought her and them into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they cotton? - Yes. She immediately begged of me to shew her all the mercy I possibly could, and let her go, she would leave the gown that her and her sister bought, or do any thing, if I would let her go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make use of the word her sister? - No, I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state accurately as to the expression? did she say the gown they had bought, or did she say the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080069"></xptr>gown she had bought? - She said the gown we have bought; that is exactly the expression, and she said, I will give you any thing, only let me go.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept those shawls from that time to this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you separated them from the other goods? - Yes; these shawls were my master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know they were on the counter at the time? - They were laying on the counter, and I saw them during the time the prisoners were there, under some prints that I were shewing to them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the other shawl? - I cannot positively say when I see the other shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see that shawl after it was missing? Did you see the constable take it from either of them? - I did not; I saw it first about two hours afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you identify that to be your master's? - I cannot say this is ours, because it hath not our private mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there such a shawl on the counter? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many were missing? - It is impossible out of the quantity of shawls we have, that I cannot tell how many we have got.</p>
               <p>Q. What may the eight be worth? - About thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they cost apiece? - Three shillings and eleven pence apiece.</p>
               <p>Q. They were fit for sale? - Perfectly to.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other customers in the shop? - Several.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of your own people that belonged to the shop were in the shop? - Mrs. Clarke was there; I believe there were about six or seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here either of them? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I know very well you are very correct, and you always give very correct accounts of what passes wherever you go. I take it for granted that you gave the same account to the magistrate as you do now; you omitted no circumstance that is material? - I have told the matter as it passed now.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body confessed that they took it and desired you would forgive them, you would not forget that? - Yes, I might forget that; I never said any thing of the kind to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you was sworn at the magistrate's to tell him the whole truth? - Yes, I was. I did not consider that as material at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to state it now? - I gave it just now as it stands; you desired me to repeat word for word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I ask you what she said about this? - You asked me what expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. You meant to say every thing that was material before the magistrate, and yet you left out this circumstance? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, your master was there, I suppose? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistress was there? - She was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there at that counter? - There might, perhaps, be one or two besides myself.</p>
               <p>Q. As to Mrs. Bailey she said nothing I see, to you; but she bargained for the gown to the amount of a whole guinea, and that she paid for? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether a gown of that price was about as much as you expect a person of her appearance to bargain and pay for? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing in her appearance? - Nothing except her stepping<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080070"></xptr>in between Vaughan and me, to screen Vaughan, as I supposed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do there? - She asked my opinion about a lining.</p>
               <p>Q. Which lining she purchased and paid for? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet when these people are trying for their lives, when she came in and bargained for a thing, and bought it, you say, that you believe she came in to screen Vaughan? - She took it on my recommendation I believe more than any thing else, I recommended a brown holland.</p>
               <p>Q. After she bought that gown did you think a body lining was not a little necessary? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was necessary and she came in and asked for one? - It was not necessary for her to say she had got no money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say that she had got no money? - She coincided with what Vaughan said.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did Bailey ever say that she had got no money? - She did not make use of those expressions.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the contrary did not she produce her money and pay for the gown? - I did not say contrary to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did she not bargain for the gown and pay for it? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that is all that Bailey did? - That is not, when Vaughan said she had got no money, she would come in in the afternoon to buy some, Bailey said, we will.</p>
               <p>Q. When Bailey was apprehended was not she admitted to bail before the magistrate? - She was.</p>
               <p>Q. And she has come here and surrendered to take her trial? - She has.</p>
               <p>Q. Now again, did your master direct this prosecution? - My master has nothing to say in it; he gave me orders to go and proceed as the law directed; I did not understand it, it was totally left to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they now indicted for a capital offence, yes or no? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that the justice did not commit them for a capital offence? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why is it a capital offence now? - Because it is stealing privately above five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you cannot tell whether the justice committed them for privately stealing in a shop? - I do not know that, I am not sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you had not the curiosity to enquire? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that you did not? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not prefer this indictment capitally against the desire of your master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to take down the question, Mr. Short-hand writer? Upon your oath, did your master direct you to prefer this indictment for a capital offence? You have told me yes, you may recall the answer, if you please. - He gave me no directions about it, but as the law directed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say, yes, just before? - I did not understand the question or else I should not have said it; I do not remember the question, you have asked me so many.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that your master directed you to indict capitally? - He did not give me the least directions for it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was just before that you told me that your master directed you to prosecute as the law directed. Perhaps you know what sort of a thing a Tyburn ticket is? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you hope to get a Tyburn ticket by prosecuting capitally? - No, I never wished it, nor never shall.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080071"></xptr>Q. How came you to prefer this indictment for a capital offence? Upon your oath, do not you know that your master wished to the contrary? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Be cautious. Do not you know that your master wished to the contrary? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear most positively? - Yes, I do, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. However, you know that you have indicted for a capital offence. Bailey was in the shop and laid down the guinea when you stopped Vaughan? - She was going towards Vaughan at the door, and I went round, and stopped Vaughan as she was going out at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not repeat this conversation about the gown before the magistrate? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have indicted for stealing nine shawls; upon your oath, did you say a word before the magistrate about the ninth shawl? - The nine shawls was mentioned, but not by me; it was mentioned before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, whether you said any thing about the ninth shawl to the magistrate. Was your examination taken down in writing? - I do not know that it was or was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you sign your examination in writing? - It was a commitment I believe; I signed something, but I declare I do not know what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not you first sworn to what you signed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you sworn to that,(the examination shewn him) and was not it read over to you, and you signed it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing said about the ninth shawl? - The clerk said there was nothing necessary to say about the ninth shawl.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the clerk say so to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was taken down at Bow-street, was not it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the clerk at Bow-street told you so? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that you did not mention any thing about the ninth shawl; how came the clerk to tell you that you should not mention about the ninth shawl? - She said she bought it of a linen draper, and the linen draper was produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, if you never mentioned about the ninth shawl, how came the clerk to tell you that you should not mention about the ninth shawl? - The clerk said that another time would do as well for that, the time of this indictment, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you have not put any thing in about the ninth shawl?(The witness here sainted away.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. On the 6th of November, I was sent for to Mr. Clarke's; I took the two prisoners into custody, and when I got to Bow-street I searched them, I searched Mrs. Bailey first, and she had nothing at all about her, but three or four guineas in her pocket, and a note, a receipt for stock she had bought; then I went to Mrs. Vaughan, and this shawl she pulled it out of her pocket, and was going to wipe her face with it.(Produces a shawl.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did the young man swear to that? - He said he believed it to be his master's property.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is that shawl hemmed? - No; she said she had bought it about three weeks before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This woman Bailey was bailed at the magistrate's? - She was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080072"></xptr>Q. Did you hear Boyd make any objection to a particular part of her examination? - No, I did not hear that, he said he thought that was his master's property, but the magistrate did not let him have it, but he told me to keep it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Boyd. Do you mean to say that the examination was corrected by your desire? - I believe there is no correction in it, I desired it might be looked over, to see if it is right, but the other shawl was not mentioned in it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you signed it in that shape? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is concerned in the business with Mr. Clark? - No person.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with him? - Near nine years.</p>
               <p>Jury. By what mark do you know these shawls? - They are my own making, with S. and l. besides two characters.</p>

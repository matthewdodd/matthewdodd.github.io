I am boatswain on board the Bremen, a German vessel; she was in the Surrey Docks on 6th May—Bernard Rochelle was the mate—Seiger, Ditman, and Renhardt were sea<lb></lb>men on board—I went ashore with the mate and two boys on the evening of May 6th, and we returned to the vessel at 10.30—the dock gate was shut, but the gate-man opened it when we arrived—about five minutes after we got on board the prisoner and the other two seamen came on board—the mate and I had then gone to our berths, but not to bed—I heard a noise in the forecastle, and heard the prisoner say "Let them come, let them come; I am not frightened of them"—I do not know who he alluded to—I left my berth, and went on the poop with the mate—I could not see what took place on the forecastle because it was dark—the men on the fore<lb></lb>castle said that they believed the mate or boatswain had given orders at the gate not to let them in—I heard the prisoner's voice say "Let them come"—the mate then went to the forecastle and asked them to come to the gate. to convince them that he had not said so, but the prisoner said that he would not come out—after three times the mate went into the forecastle and took Seiger by the collar to fetch him out—I stood by the forecastle door; Seiger got loose, and then the mate game out—he went in again, and said "You must come with me to the gate," and when he came out I saw blood on his coat—I took him to my berth; he was bleeding from the neck—I stopped with him till he was dead—I afterwards went into the fore<lb></lb>castle and saw this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the table with blood on it—I do not know whose knife it is.</p>

I was cook on board the Bremen—she arrived on 6th May in the Surrey Commercial Dock from Dantzic—the prisoner was a seaman on board her for two months—I was in my berth, which is in the forecastle door; there was no light there—I was awoke about 10.30 by a noise in the forecastle, and saw Seiger and Ren<lb></lb>hardt standing by the table, about 3 yards from me—I saw the chief mate, Rochelle, come to the forecastle door—he called out to Seiger to come to the police gate with him—Seiger said that he would not come out—the mate came into the forcastle to bring' him out—Seiger had no knife then—the mate got hold of him by the coat to fetch him out, and dragged him as far as the forecastle door, but he got. loose and came back to the table—the mate went on deck, and while he was away Seiger called the mate "the long fellow," and knocked on the table, and said that it was a shame that he had given orders at the gate not to let them in, and to have the gates locked—soon after that I saw a knife in Seiger's hand—I was not in my bunk all this time, I jumped up—the mate came back in about ten minutes, and went to the further corner from the door, where Seiger's berth was, and wanted to fetch him out—they came towards the door, and the mate got hold of him and fell oyer my box as they were struggling—I then pulled Seiger away from the mate as they were wrestling on the floor, the mate underneath, and saw blood on the mate's chest—they afterwards locked Seiger up, and after that I saw this knife in the boot corner with blood on it—the mate lived about ten minutes; he died about 12.45—Seiger was half sober—I don't know how the mate was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A seaman named Macoon was there, but I did not hear him say anything—I saw the knife in Seiger's hand at the time the mate came in the second time—Seiger had not been having his supper just before, he had it at 5 o'clock—that was the knife which he would use to cut bread or anything he ate—Seiger did not wish to come out, and of course when they were pulling each other they resisted—direotly they fell I went between them and separated them—they were not struggling on the ground for any time—when they fell the mate fell underneath—I saw no blow struck.</p>

I was a seaman on board the Bremen—on Sunday night, 7th May, I had been ashore with Seiger and Reinhardt, and when we got to the dock gates the man refused to let us through, and we got over the wall, and Seiger came after us—when we got on board, Seiger and Reinhardt were down in the forecastle and I was on deck—I could not understand the words that Seiger said, but I could hear a noise going on—at that time the mate came from aft and went to the quarter, and afterwards he went to the forecastle—I heard that the mate said that he should come out, and he would go with him to the gate and say that it was an untruth, and the policeman would tell him that it was wrong about his being told to refuse them admission—Seiger said "I will not come out," and the mate went into the forecastle and pulled him out at the forecastle door; when they got to the door Seiger laid underneath and the mate was at the top, bending over him—Seiger then went to his bunk; the mate went on deck for about ten minutes, and when he came back he went to the forecastle and called to him to come out, but he did not, and then he went to the forecastle, and about three or four minutes afterwards he came out bleeding—I saw a knife in Seiger's hand at the forecastle door, before the mate entered the first time; the mate had not called out to Seiger then, but Seiger had said that it was not right to tell the porter not to let them through the gate, and he had the knife in his hand at that time.</p>

Foster was coming along, and I asked him if he would mind helping me with it; he said "No," and he carried the box with me. We went into the shop to get some sweets, and when we came out, as we were going along the gentleman asked us to go and get him a pennyworth of cough drops, and gave us a shilling. I went in first, and got the change, and then Foster went in. He gave us sixpence apiece. Every time we got him change he put the change in his pocket, and sent us with another.</p>

On 2nd July I was with Detective Westwood, watching Mr. Moses's premises—I saw Goodman leave the warehouse about 1 o'clock, and followed him to the corner of Jewin Crescent—he stopped, turned round, looked back, and then ran into Aldersgate Street—he stood in the doorway, looked back again, and then ran on to Aldersgate railway station—I said "One moment, we are police officers, you will have to go back to the warehouse with me"—I took him to the station, and found 12 dozen yards of trimming, some ladies' jackets, two fur capes, and three hare skins, wrapped round his stomach—about 4 o'clock on the same day I went to Colski—he lives in one room and Goodman in the other, in the same house—I said "Does Mr. Goodman live here?"—he said "Yes"—I said "We wish to ask you a question, and I advise you to be careful. Goodman is in custody for stealing fur; has he sold you any?"—he said "No, I never bought or sold him any fur"—I said "I am going to search the house"—Westwood and I followed him upstairs—there was a room on the first floor—he said "That is my room, do not go in there"—I said "I am going to search Colski's room," and I went into it and there found these three muffs and 13 dozen yards of fur</p>

               <p>JAMES JOHNSON. I am a carpenter; I live next door to Mr. Varney. On the 12th of April, near five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner turn up the boots and look at them. I did not see him take them away; I saw them in his hand.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner take them off the place where they were hanging; he turned them up to look at the soles, and then he looked round to see whether any body saw him, and then he ran away; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>JURY. You never went and told the man, did you - A. No; I thought the man had been in and paid for the boots.</p>
               <p>JOHN Mc'DUGGET. On the 15th of April, I took the prisoner up; he said if I named the day the boots were stolen he could tell me where he had been at work: he said he worked on board a ship at St. Catherine's; he could not tell me the ship's name.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the boots found - A. They were exposed to sale in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. A deaf and dumb man that works for me saw them in Rosemary-lane; he came to me and wrote it down on the slate; then I wen there and saw them exposed for sale.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of the National Baths, High Hol<lb></lb>born. About five or six weeks ago I was taking a tepid bath—I put an emerald and diamond ring on a seat of my box—I swam about ten mi<lb></lb>nutes or a quarter of an hour and returned to my box, and when dressing I looked for my ring—it was not to be found—my room was quite separate from the other rooms, there being a bolt, of which I availed myself—the prisoner was in my employ, and being the principal man in care I called him, and told him to search for it—he came and searched for it, and said he could not find it—he might have entered the room while I was in the water without my seeing it—neither of us could find it—I heard nothing of it except in some matters of condolence or sorrow on the part of the pri<lb></lb>soner several times—he remained in my service for some time—I called him into a private room and charged him with embezzling some money—I and Mr. Ball began searching him—we found a knife and a purse—I saw him take something wrapped in paper from the purse—he turned his back on us, put it into his mouth, and made a violent effort to swallow it—Mr. Ball collared him, and pulled him across his thigh to endeavour to choke him—the prisoner then took the ring from his mouth with his own hand and dropped it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Shoreditch, and am a friend of the prosecutor's. I was at the Baths—the prosecutor asked me to come to the room—he said to the prisoner, "Will you submit to be searched, or shall the officers come up who are waiting below?"—he began to search himself—he pulled out a number of things from the pocket—he drew the purse from one end, and pulled out three half-sovereigns and put it on the table—I said there is another end to the purse—he drew the ring from there, and I saw something in paper—he turned his back upon me and put it into his mouth—I collared him with both hands, threw him over my thigh, and forced my finger to his mouth—I called the prosecutor—the prisoner took something from his mouth—the prosecutor took it up and said, "Good God! it is my diamond ring."</p>

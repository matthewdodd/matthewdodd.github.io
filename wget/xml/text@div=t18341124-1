                  </hi>. I am a publican, and live at No. 113, Long-lane, in the parish of St. Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey. On the 30th of Septem<lb></lb>ber, I went to bed, leaving my cellar safe, at a quarter to eleven o'clock—I am quite certain the listenings were quite safe—I go to my cellar from the dwelling-house—there is a flap outside the house, which is only used to take in liquor—I am master of the house—it is my dwelling-house—I fastened the cellar flap by three bolts—I was alarmed about four o'clock in the morning by the policemen, William Shields and Thomas Bradley Beck—it was not light—I opened the window, got a light, and came down—I opened the door, let the policemen in, and they sent me back wards—I went towards the cellar door, and found that open—I had shut it at night—the back door leading into my yard was open—I had left that shut and fastened—on entering the cellar, I found the cellar flap also broken open—the bolts were bent, and partly off—I found nobody there—I missed a bottle, con<lb></lb>taining two gallons of brandy, and a stone bottle, containing shrub—I am sure they were in the cellar the night before, at a quarter before eleven o'clock—I had seen the prisoner, John Holgate, the morning before—he helped the brewer's man to put two barrels of ale into my cellar—I never saw him before, to my knowledge—I am sure he is the man—I saw him in custody of the policeman close to my door that very morning when I was alarmed—the hinges of the cellar flap were wrenched out of the wood work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About three o'clock on the morning in question, I went down a passage by the side of the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's house, which leads to his cellar—when I got down, I saw a man stand<lb></lb>ing by the side of Thompson's cellar flap—it was the prisoner, James Hol<lb></lb>gate—I took him into custody, and asked what he was doing there—he said he had been drinking with his brother at Dockhead, and had come down there to ease himself—Dockhead is near Rotherhithe—I told him he must go with me to the station-house—I took him there, and then returned to the passage, and found the prisoner, John Holgate, in the passage—he was five or six yards from where I had found his brother—I asked him where he came from—he said he had been lying down there asleep—I asked him how long he had been lying there—he said it might be an hour, or it might be two or three hours, for what he knew—I took him into custody—I took him nearer to the cellar flap, and knocked my foot against a stone bottle, which I have here—I examined, and found the cellar flap open—I found another stone bottle near the one I first found—one con<lb></lb>tained brandy and the other shrub—the passage is no thoroughfare—there are some small gardens at the bottom, but it is no thoroughfare—I pro<lb></lb>duce the bottles.</p>

I said, "Yes"—he asked me if I knew where the Rose and Flower was—I said, "No"—I turned round, saw a constable passing, and asked him in their hearing, and he said, "It may be the Rose and Crown?"—"That is it," said the prisoner, John Holgate—he told them where it was, and they both went away—I am positive they were together.</p>

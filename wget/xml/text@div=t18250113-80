            . I am a constable of St. Pancras. I searched the prisoner Hudson's premises on Christmas-eve - he deals in phials and rags, and other things. I found there some bottles, which he said he had bought of Lianam, for 1d. a piece, and that he had bought some other things. I took the bottles away; and he said if there was any thing else he would use his best endeavour to bring it forward: in the evening I took another person up, who was discharged.</p>

            . On Christmas-eve, about nine o'clock, I went into the garden of Mr. William Harvey, where I live: I missed some bottles, which I had seen in the rack three quarters of an hour before. I called for a light, and Harvey came - we found no one in the garden, but traced some persons over the summer-house into a lane. As we were going round we met Lianam, coming from the rag-shop, near a place where four or five bottles were standing. Master then went to the rag-shop, but I did not go with him. I saw Lianam come out of the rag-shop, and asked him to go with me to master's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HUDSON. Q. How did I conduct myself on Christmas morning? A. Very well; you gave up what you had, and asked if there were any other articles lost - I said there was.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 14th of October my husband met me and some friends at the Angel, at Islington, on my return from Derby; he hired a hackney coach and a chariot; I saw my box put on the footboard of the coach in which we rode; a lady and gentleman rode in the chariot; we went home to <placeName id="t18251027-38-crimeloc213">Mecklenburgh-square</placeName>

When we came to look over the luggage next morning the box was missing; it contained the articles stated - I have not seen any of them since.</p>
               <p>JAMES MORLEY re-examined. Q. Did you notice the number of the coach? A. I did, but I have forgotten it. I remembered the number of the chariot, and found by that the driver of the coach; they were hired about half past nine o'clock.</p>

            . I was driver of the chariot; the prisoner drove the coach. When we got to Mecklenburgh-square the coach was dismissed, and I remained. A day or two afterwards Mr. Morley came, and asked if I knew the driver of the coach; I saw the prisoner a day or two after that, and told him if he had the box to take it home; he said he had made it away: I said it was a very bad job.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known him long? A. About a year and a half; I did not see the coach on the stand that night: I do not know the number, the colour, nor the owner of it. The prisoner does not drive regularly - he stopped at the house about a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took up the prisoner on the 20th of October, in Bedford-street, Covent-garden. I told him I wanted him for a felony, and asked if he knew any thing about a box; he said No. I then took him to Bow-street, and found upon him 7 s., a key, and some copper. He said he lived at Westminster, but did not recollect the name of the street - it was a private house, but he refused to tell me where.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you notice the coachman? A. I noticed his being a short man, but I cannot swear to him. I cannot be positive whether Glover ever said he did not know the man.</p>

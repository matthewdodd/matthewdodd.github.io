                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, and live at 13, Collier Street, Deptford—the prisoner worked for me about six weeks previous to Septem<lb></lb>ber—I had some conversation with him about purchasing a pony and harness—I told him if he could see one that would suit, I would buy it—on 24th August I accompanied him to Mr. Aldridge's, a horse dealer, at Greenwich, and he bargained with Mr. Aldridge, on my behalf, for a pony, and harness, and whip, the sum to be paid was 46<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Aldridge, knowing the prisoner, gave him credit for the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not receive a receipt—on 31st August I had some words with the prisoner, and told him I could dispense with his services—at that time the pony, and harness, and whip were in my possession—on 2nd September, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I missed the pony—I had seen it safe at 5 o'clock in the morning—I had locked the stable, and it must have been opened by another key—I went in search of the prisoner, but could not find him that evening—I met him on the 3rd—I asked him where the pony was—he said it was at Mr. Aldridge's, grazing—I went there, but could not find it—I said to the prisoner, "If the pony is not in the stable by 12 o'clock, I shall advertise it, and give you in charge"—he said, "Do you think there is anything up?"—I said, "I don't know, but it looks greatly like it"—I gave him into custody next day, for stealing the pony, and harness, and whip.</p>

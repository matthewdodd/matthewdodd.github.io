                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, E</hi> 16). On 5th June I went to the Royal Oak beer shop, in Chenies-street, kept by the prisoner—I found him in the back parlour—I told him I must take him into custody for having stolen property in his house—he made no reply—I gave him into custody, and searched the house—I found some property—in going from the bar to the kitchen I found one stair loose—I removed it, and found under it a basket, which I now produce, containing counterfeit coins—I looked further, and found a tin box, or tray, in the washhouse containing coin—I put them with those in the basket, and counted them all together—there were 28 sovereigns, 33 half sovereigns, 153 crowns, 198 half crowns, 15 florins, and 207 shillings—I have known the prisoner living there about eighteen months—I said to him, "How do you account for this?"—he said, "I don't know how it came there."</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you been up to the prisoner's place at Waterloo Bridge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; perhaps three times—probably three or four months after the appointment of the prisoner—on his house was a large board on which there was "Richard Bache, Sole Consignee"—but not on the store—his house is in Southampton place, near the store—I have seen these invoices, probably about six months after the appointment of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say one word to the prisoner about them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, some time in the summer he was down and produced one of these, and my partner spoke to him on the subject—on my oath the prisoner was present when my partner made a remark on the incorrectness of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you found out that there had been some deficiencies in Nov.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It must have been quite the end of Nov. or the beginning of Dec.—I will swear it was not the beginning of Nov.—when my partner spoke to the prisoner about these bills, we were all three together—it must have been alluded to by Mr. Perks, but I cannot charge my memory whether any direc<lb></lb>tions were given to the prisoner. I saw the board at his place four or five months afterwards—I did not make any remonstrance about it—this is my letter to the prisoner on 3d Nov.: "We have forwarded a parcel of invoices which we request you to use."—I should say it was not the first direction we gave the prisoner that he was not to use the other bill heads—I must have told him it was wrong—I will not swear that I had—we got those papers printed in the country that we sent up on 3d Nov.—we never sent any before—I have no recollection of seeing one of the prisoner's circulars—I know it was early in Dec. that we heard of some defalcation—I should say I was early as the 1st of Dec, this letter of the 24th of Dec. is my writing—</p>

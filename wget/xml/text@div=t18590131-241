                  </hi>. I am a barrister, and live at Romford in Essex—on 22d January I was on a visit with my wife at Mr. Hudson's, 3, Upper Lansdowne-terrace, Notting-hill—I was disturbed about 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, looked down the well staircase, and saw a light at the bottom, which appeared to come through a glass partition at the basement of the kitchen stairs—I immediately went down—the light continued till I went over the drawing-room passage, when a person could see anyone coming down, and as I got to the last stair, the light suddenly vanished—I then examined all the doors as I passed; the drawing-room door was fastened, and the door leading down to the passage also—I opened the green baize door of the room, and it was perfectly safe, but I heard a door slam in the kitchen, looked out at the hall-window, and saw the prisoner climbing up the area stairs and over the area gate into the path—I rushed out after him; he ran down the terrace, and directly he saw me he called out for assistance—I followed him about one hundred yards; he turned round preparing to strike me, and I knocked him down, held him, and called "Police"—three policemen came up, and I gave him in custody; he directly pretended to be tipsy—the constables went into the house, and left me to guard the gate and the hall—one of the ladies, Mrs. Maldon, said in the prisoner's presence,</p>

               <p>"Walter, are you alone? is any one with you?"—he said, "I am by myself"—I had known him in Mr. Hudson's service upwards of four years—the door he was attempting to open used always to be kept locked in his time—I examined the hall door, which was fastened; the lock had been tried with some instrument, and the wood was burnt as if a candle had been held to it—three panes of glass had marks of a man's fingers, and one pane had had the putty cut by a knife like this, which was found in the area, and which had been used to snuff a candle—two panes in the kitchen window had been broken for a hand to undraw a bolt, and two panes at the bottom were broken—I saw some meat found in the kitchen, which had been cut off, and mustard and salt put on it—the piece of candle was found on the mat at the door—I also saw a quartern loaf, which had been recently cut—I saw the piece matched with it, and it corresponded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you quite sure it was me on the area steps? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Positive; I saw another man in the road when I came back, when I was watching the area gate—he was not there when I ran after the prisoner—I am sure he was not the person who ran up the area steps—I knew the prisoner to be Mr. Hudson's servant—I saw his face by the gas when he was on the area steps.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, T</hi> 121). About 2 o'clock on Sunday morning, the 23d January, I was on duty on Lansdowne-terrace, heard cries of Police," and saw the prisoner in the custody of the last witness—I took him back to the house, and found a pane of glass broken in the back kitchen window, and an entry made there—this piece of candle was burning on the mat—I went with the inspector and matched this piece of bread to the loaf—the prisoner said in the passage, "Oh, I have got in many times before," meaning when he was a servant there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook to Mr. Hudson—I went to bed on Saturday night at a quarter to 11, and fastened up the kitchen window—I afterwards saw that there had been a pane of glass taken out—I was aroused by Mrs. Maldon about 1 or 2 o'clock, went downstairs, and heard somebody leaving the area gate, and saw Mr. Mashiter follow the prisoner—the bread and the beef had been cut, and I saw a piece of candle lying on the mat by the door; it had been taken from a cupboard in the kitchen, and was a whole candle when I went to bed—I had looked and bolted the passage door the night before—some wine was taken from a full bottle which stood on a table in the passage when I went to bed—when the prisoner was brought back, Mrs. Maldon asked him if he was alone, and he said "Yes"—he did not say what he came there for.</p>

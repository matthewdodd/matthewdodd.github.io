            . I am an officer of the city. On last Thursday, I happened to be in <placeName id="t18140706-72-crimeloc402">St. Paul's church-yard</placeName>

I laid hold of the prisoner. The crowd was so pressing I was obliged to take care of the prisoner. I could not reach the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg leave to state that my prosecution is carried on alone by mere suspicion, as the handkerchief was found in my possession. It was on Thursday the 7th of July, I went out on purpose to see the procession at St. Paul's; the crowd was great. I felt something at my feet. I had some difficulty to pick it up; it was a handkerchief. I placed it in my bosom. The officer seeing me stoop and pick up something, took me into custody. The officer is my prosecutor. I never was a moment before confined. I work hard for my living. I rely on your lordship's consideration.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

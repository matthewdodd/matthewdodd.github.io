               <p>Between the 15th and 20th of July I went into the cabbin, the lumpers had done work, and I saw a box broke open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Captain, your ship was just arrived, I believe? - She had been arrived a good while from Jamaica.</p>
               <p>How long was you in your outward bound voyage? - About nine months.</p>
               <p>This box of hats was a part of the outward bound voyage? - Yes, they were merchants goods, shipped on board by merchants in Jamaica; I should never have known what it contained, unless it was broke open.</p>
               <p>How long had you been delivering your homeward bound cargo? - I cannot say exactly; I believe about five or six days.</p>
               <p>How many lumpers might you have had on board? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You naturally enough I suppose came on shore as often as you could? - I was on 'Change every day.</p>
               <p>What is the nature of your contract? - To deliver goods in the like good order I received them, unless I meet with damages by sea; I carry the things to the keys, if I deliver any thing short, I must pay for it.</p>
               <p>Court. He is certainly answerable to pay for the delivery of the goods.</p>
               <p>I was going to ask whether the proprietor of the cargo does in fact send down a lighter for it? - No, the people where we land our goods, generally find lighters.</p>
               <p>Do they do that at the expence of the owner, of the master, or of the proprietor? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who pays the expence of carrying them from the ship to the Customhouse? - The proprietor.</p>
               <p>Where was the box? - On board the ship.</p>

               <p>I was second mate of the ship, on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140107"></xptr> 18th of July, this man with three more were down in the gun deck clearing some coffee casks to be put in the lighter, and I desired him to be careful in moving them chests, I told him there were things in them that I knew not myself, and to be careful not to break them; immediately after that the casks were all out of the place where we were clearing them from; the chief mate of the ship searched the rest of the people, he passed this man, and imagined he found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Where were they searched? - They were only felt upon deck as they came from below to see if they had got anything;

             stopped the prisoner, and desired he might be searched again, immediately the mate searched him and found a hat in the back part of his trowsers, and saw it taken from him, pulled out of his trowsers, I immediately looked at this chest and found it broke open, and some of the paper of the hats laying about; he said it was a hat that he had found in the cable tier, and that I had told him it belonged to a passenger.</p>
               <p>Had you said so? - No, I never said so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had the care of the delivery of this cargo? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many lumpers had you on board? - I cannot tell you positively the number of the whole, but there were four down with me.</p>
               <p>Had you had any rough weather? - No, no rough weather.</p>
               <p>Steady breezes out and back? - Yes, the chest was taken aboard at Kingston, I remember bringing it with others in the long boat, we had but indifferent weather outwards.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was not it very like that this chest carried out and brought back, might not be broken in the carriage? - No, I verily think it could not, it stood in a steady place.</p>
               <p>Did you know what it contained? - After I saw it broke open I knew.</p>
               <p>So should I, but before you saw it broke open you did not know any more than I did? - To be sure I could not see through a deal board.</p>
               <p>Has it always been customary to examine the lumpers as they come up, to see they have not embezzled the goods? - They all know that they shall be searched when they come up. The prisoner had been searched that same day, he had a coat on, or a jacket, I think it was a canvas frock; this box was whole in the morning, and the hat was found inside his trowsers or breeches, I am not clear which; he had both on.</p>

               <p>On the 18th of July about four in the afternoon, the prisoner was in the gun dock at work with some more lumpers, they were called on deck, and some of the witnesses saw something concealed in the prisoner's breeches, I asked him what he had there, he said nothing; I made him unbutton his trowsers, and I pulled a hat out that was concealed; we immediately went down to the gundock, and found the box broken, and several hats missing, and the paper that covered them strewed about, and three more hats were concealed in different places; he said he found it in the cable tier, and that he thought it belonged to some of the passengers.</p>

               <p>I was at work on board this ship, and I found this hat stowed in between two cable tiers, I put it into my trowsers, to ask the mate about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Lamb. Was not a hat found afterwards in a moulded state, which must have laid among the cables for some time? - That was the next day.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to have been in that place for some time past? - No, it was only the dirt.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you first asked him what he had in his breeches, what did he tell you? - He said nothing then, the first time, then afterwards he acknowledged he had something there which he before denied.</p>

               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Does the invoice mention the number of hats? - I never saw the invoice.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was that box carried out from here to Jamaica or not? - To the best of my recollection I think it was, but I cannot be sure, I am sure it came from Jamaica.</p>

Last Tuesday three weeks, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, William Darby, came to my house with his brother and Mr. Green; they said they had come to make up an old quarrel. We had a pot of beer and some gin; the prisoner Sarah, came in and took tea with my wife. She came to me and said</p>
               <p>"You *** if you owe my Bill any animosity come and take it out of me." She tucked up her sleeves and struck me. Green carried her down stairs; and in about two minutes William Darby offered to strike me but was prevented - Green and my wife held me. I went out in about ten minutes to go over to the Duke of York public-house, and met the prisoners, both very drunk. I asked if they did not think they had acted wrong in kicking up a disturbance in my place; the woman said</p>
               <p>"No, you ***." She ran at me, to claw my face, but did not do it - I knocked her down twice; William came up and struck me - I felt a great deal of pain in a certain place - I collared and threw him down - he ran at me five or six times, he leaned against the wall and seemed much fatigued - I went home and found I had been stabbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Whatever dispute arose was at your lodgings - you went out afterwards and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070008"></xptr>began with them? A. Yes, the female prisoner is my wife's sister; I knocked his wife down before he came up to me.</p>

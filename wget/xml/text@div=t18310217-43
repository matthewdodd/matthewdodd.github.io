On the 22nd of January, about half-past ten o'clock in the evening, we had two roasting pigs on a basket near the door - I heard a shout that a man had stolen a pig; I ran, and saw my father's servant and a Policeman in pursuit of the prisoner - he was stopped; I came up and gave him into custody - I had not seen him near the house, but I saw him at a distance; I would not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where did you see the pig afterwards? A. In the shop, covered with mud - it had been ready for sale.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Somers. I was in the shop, and saw a man taking a pig off the pavement which had been on some baskets - he walked away; I asked a person in the shop if it was sold, who said No; I pursued the man - it was the prisoner; when I came up to him he had dropped it, but I did not see him - the pig was taken up, and carried back to the shop; I asked the prisoner what he had - he said he had no pig, and had stolen none.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him take it off the pavement? A. No; he took it as if from the pavement - it is a pretty good thoroughfare, and the pig was outside the shop on a basket - I did not see it on the pavement.</p>

I saw the prisoner running from the shop - I ran after him, and as I was pursing him I ran over a pig; I followed the prisoner from three to five minutes, but he was never out of my sight - I never saw him with the pig; a young man came up, who offered me 5s. to say he did not run.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What had be upon him? A. A piece of beef, tied up in a handkerchief.</p>

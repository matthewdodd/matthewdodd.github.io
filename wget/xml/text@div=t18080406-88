               <p>Q. On the 6th of April did you lose two pair of stockings from your shop - A. Yes; about half past seven o'clock in the evening, both the prisoners came in, they asked for a pair of black stockings at about two shillings, or half a crown; I shewed them the two shilling ones first; they did not approve of them; I then shewed them two pair of half crown ones, they told me they would not do, they could buy cheaper away they went; scarce a second after they were gone I missed two pair of stockings, that I had in paper and that I shewed them, of the finest sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what value were they - A. Two shillings and sixpence a pair; Mr. Fisher watched them when they were in my shop he came into my shop; he watched them to a pawnbrokers, they offered to pawn them for eighteen pence a pair; I knew the stockings again.</p>
               <p>MR. FISHER. I am a linen draper, 87, Shadwell. On the 6th of April, about half past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoners were in my shop; in consequence of suspicion I followed them to Mrs. Norris' shop; I saw them come out. I went in and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060062"></xptr>communicated my suspicion to Mrs. Norris; I saw the prisoner Wezer go into a pawnbroker's shop, about twelve or fourteen doors off; I stood at the pawnbroker's window; I saw Wezer take a pair of black worsted stockings from her right hand pocket and lay them on the counter to pawn; I immediately went to Mrs. Norris, told her the circumstance: she told me she had missed two pair of stockings; I applied to an officer; he and I went together; we detected the prisoners as the pawnbroker was making out the duplicate for the two pair of stockings;

            . I lived with my mother in three Crown Court, Chancery-lane; my father was upon his death-bed.

I ran away from him, and stood at an alehouse door; I thought he was gone, so I crossed the way as fast as I could; he directly ran after me; I stopt at Mr. Adams's door; he came up to me, and said, d - n your eyes, you b - h, what makes you run away? I said, because I was frightened; he gave me a slap in the face; I cried out murder, then he knocked me down, and tore my hat from my head, and ran away; as soon as I recovered, I ran after him, and cried out, Stop thief; a gentleman that is here, took him, and found my hat upon him.</p>

            . I am a constable, I was the officer of the night; as I was going down Holborn, I heard the cry of, Stop thief; I ran across the way, and a number of people had got hold of the prisoner.

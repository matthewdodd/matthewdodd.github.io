                  </hi>. I live at 5, Adman's Road, East Greenwich, and am store-keeper and time-keeper to John Stockwell, a ship-builder—on 1st November I had some straw for Mr. Stockwell in his mangold-wurzel field, and on 11th November he had some more bundles put into the same field—about 7.30 on the same evening I watched the straw, by Mr. Stockwell's direction—I was about fifteen yards from it, and my wife was with me—we had just reached within fifteen yards of the straw when I saw the prisoner, who I have known about three months, cross the road, pick up a bundle of straw, put it on his back, and walk away with it—his half-face was to me—he lives 300 or 400 yards from there—it would take me about six minutes to walk there—he came in a direction from his home across the field towards the straw—I saw his face by the light of the furnace, which shone in the direction of the straw—I left my wife there, jumped over the railings, and pursued the prisoner, but missed him, because, when I got out of the light of the furnace, I could not see my hand before me, and the thistles were two feet high—I examined the ground next morning, and saw thirty or forty bits of straw lying for about 200 yards in the direction he went in—it was littered right along—I went to his house, and saw a large piece of straw in the back yard—he keeps a stable—I was present when it was searched, and saw three or four bundles of straw in one heap, which I should say had been there three months, and another fresh bundle, which looked clean and tidy—that was the same kind of straw as Mr. Stockwell's—it was wheaten straw.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 210). I took the prisoner in his yard, and said "Dixon, I am going to apprehend you for stealing a truss of straw on Thursday evening"—he said "I know nothing about it, I was not out of the house"—a female there said in his presence that he was not out of the house more than ten minutes—I took him to the station, and then examined the premises—I found one truss of clean straw put up on some rafters under the roof, and three trusses of old straw put by themselves.</p>

I have been eighteen years under one employer, but he cannot come to give me a character. I have had thousands of pounds in my hands to pay men, and never stood before a bar before. Hicks is connected with Taylor, and they want to get this plot of ground from me without buying it, and they injure my character in every way they can. I worked all day on Friday, and nothing was said about this till Saturday, when I was having my dinner, they then took me, and I could not get bail, and had to lay in the station all Saturday and Sunday. There was loose straw in my yard, because I have pigs and fowls, and give them beds nearly every day. I do not notice whether I drop a straw in the yard.</p>

I remember the police coming on Saturday. They did not say they had a warrant; they said they did not want our advice and told us to go away, and said they should take what they liked."</p>

               <p>the only representative of the family—my mother and sister Alicia, the testatrix, went to live at Southend after my father's death—my other sister, Albinia, was an imbecile from her birth—she went with them, and they stayed there till 1855, when they removed to Feltham, and took up their residence, temporarily, at the cottage of the prisoner, whilst a suitable house could be obtained for them—in December of that year my mother took the "Hollies" at Feltham, and she and Alicia went to reside there—Albinie remained at the prisoner's house, who, with his wife had been servants in the family for many years—in 1858 my mother died—I saw them but very little during the time they resided at Feltham—after my mother's death, Alicia gave up the "Hollies" and went to live at the prisoner's cottage again, taking her furniture with her—Alicia died in February, 1866—I received a telegram, stating that her clothes had caught fire, and that she was seriously ill—I discovered, on my arrival, that at the time the telegram was sent she was dead—her clothes caught fire accidentally—I arrived at Harris's cottage in the middle of the night, and after her death I was there occasionally, and at other times I was in London—this continued till the 9th April—on the day after my arrival, Harris gave me a will, executed by Alicia, and dated, 1857—he told me that his wife, Mary Ann Harris, had had charge of it during her lifetime—she died in March, 1865—there was a legacy of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left to her, and some shares in the New River Water-works Company to my sister Albinia, but the bulk of Alicia's property I took possession of as heir-at-law and next of kin—at the time the will was made my mother was living, and she had possession of the shares in the New River Company—the will was proved by me—Harris said that another will had been made, but Mrs. Harris had told him it was a very unjust one, and ought to be destroyed, and they believed it had been destroyed—some portion of Alicia's furniture had been sent to a warehouse at Hounslow—there were a great many pictures and a quantity of plate, and the latter was stowed away in Harris's cellars—I removed most of the furniture in April, 1866, and returned to Torquay—a portion of the furniture I left for the comfort of my sister Albinia—when I removed the cabinet and pier glasses, Harris seemed to be annoyed, and complained of the stains upon the paper where they had been fixed—on my return the night after, he said that I had taken away the bed on which his niece slept, and that she was obliged to use the pillows as a bed since—he expressed great annoyance—on the 16th April, a telegram reached me at Torquay to the effect that another will had been found, and was in the hands of Mr. Young—I came up at once and saw Mr. Young's solicitor, and I afterwards went to Harris's cottage—he said that the second will was found amongst some <hi rend="italic">illustrated London Newspapers</hi>, which they had lent to Alicia, the testatrix—that will was much more favourable to Harris than the first one—before I received the telegram, I had discovered, in the drawers of the furniture, a number of old papers in my sister's handwriting, and from what I then read I was led to dispute the second will—I had proved the first will before those papers were discovered—they were used on both trials—I had no evidence as to my sister being incompetent in 1857, but I had my doubts afterwards, from what I read of the papers I had discovered—the first trial was managed be Mr. Sadler, who is now dead—upon the evidence of additional witnesses, a new trial was granted, and a great many medical and other witnesses were called—the resnit was that, after eleven days, a verdict was given for Mr. Young and against me, as before.</p>

SERJEANT SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you reside at Bream's Buildings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only two days at Mr. Dendy's chambers—I have a house and a brewery at Croydon, and I go there when I can—since I first saw Mr. Dendy, in 1866, loss has accrued to me—I have refused all payment; Mr. Dendy has very honourably offered it to me—I have had money from 1866 to 1869, but no remuneration—I have had 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for travelling and hotel expenses from Mr. Dendy; about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of that was for my railway fare; I was in most of the counties of England, to make inquiries about the late condition of Miss Dendy—I have met Webb, a detective officer, on two or three occasions, but not as an agent; I called upon him—my place of business during 1856, 1857, 1858, and 1859 was at Elm Cottage, Feltham—I was a professor of brewing; I studied the science for thirty years, and practiced it also—I have also had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in this prosecution since January 7—my two sons have been conducting the pale ale business at Croydon, while I have been going all about England making inquiries—I visited a place in Oxfordshire called Pillerton Horsey, on February 13, 1867—I went there to see a sister of the prisoner, and to see the whole ramification of the family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you introduce yourself as a friend of Harris, and sleep there one night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I introduced myself as Dendy's friend; it would be very dangerous to answer that question directly—I was invited to stay there a night, as there was no inn in the neighbourhood, and I did so—that was about 14th or 15th November, 1867—the expense of that trip was included in the 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for 1866 and 1867—I pursued my inquiries very little in 1868—I have passed a part of my life on the other side of the water,</p>

               <p>near Newington Sessions House—I was a month of 1859 in Horsemonger Lane for a debt to a gentleman in the Strand—that was many years before I commenced these inquiries—I knew Mr. Sadler, the solicitor, from December, 1866, to his death—besides the 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Dendy, I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Sadler, which was returned to him; he lent it to me during Mr. Dendy's absence, for the expenses of travelling—I afterwards made my reports to Mr. Dendy, after travelling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel Coe, of Ealing—I resided at Feltham from 1852 to 1860, in a cottage near Rose Cottage—I remember Mrs. Dendy and the Misses Dendys living at the Hollies quite well, and they lived with Mr. Harris a little while before they went to the Hollies—I remember the mother's death—when they first came to Mr. Harris's I saw Miss Alicia get into her mamma's carriage and jump out again just as the horse was going on; Harris was the coachman—she shrieked out her usual shriek that she had—Harris tried to get her back, but she would not come—I heard him talking to her, and begging her to get in, but she would not, and her mamma got out, and Mr. Harris took the carriage up to the Lion, where it was kept—tin 30th March, 1859, when the Powder Mills blew up, I heard her shriek—I knew her voice, and saw something white in the road—I saw her very much. exhausted in the road, with her bead on Mr. Harris's shoulder, and nothing on but her night gown, which was <hi rend="italic">draggled</hi> up to her knees, and she had no shoes or stockings on—that was near Harris's cottage; his front door was open, and he took her in—this was 12.15 or 12.20—after she got in I heard a moan—I then wentindoors—on another occasion I saw her measuring the garden paths with a walking stick, she took one of her stockings off and tied it to the walking stick, and pulled her clothes up very indecently, and jumped over the stick which she had laid across the path—Harris, who was at the corner of the house, got hold of her, and she very soon went in—there was screaming that day; she always did scream when he got hold of her, and she used to call him all sorts of names—I have seen her in the garden, measuring the path, and Mr. and Mrs. Harris trying to get her in; he threatened to send for Dr. Kings-ford, and was obliged to take her in by force; and one day I saw her out in the garden, with nothing on but a flannel petticoat and chemise—Harris fetched her in—I have many times, between 1855 and 1859, seen her pull her clothes up indecently—we were so used to her that we did not take notice of her—Harris used to watch her more at the latter end than at first, as she get worse—I only saw her out once in her night dress, but in the day time I have seen her in the garden, in her chemise and flannel petticoat; that was while her mother was alive—she was in the habit, during her mother's lifetime, of staying at Harris's for a whole week—I have seen her at 6 o'clock of a morning, running from the Hollies to Rose Cottage—I never saw Harris with her then, but he used to go back with her—she did not stay any time—she was dressed in a light muslin dress and no shawl or bonnet, when it was a sharp frosty morning—I have seen her go across the common towards Harris's cottage many a time; holding his arm—I never saw her dressed like another lady—when she went back</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness, and am a gardener, at Ealing—up to 1860 I lived in a cottage close to the Harris's, at Feltham, when Miss Alicia carne with her mother—after staying a short time at Harris's, they resided at the Hollies—I knew Alicia Dendy, as well as the imbecile one—once, when I was going to or from my dinner, the carriage was at Harris's gate—I heard a screaming and shrieking in the road, and saw the lady get into the carriage and jump out again; her mother got out, and went into the house, and Mr. Harris took the carriage round the corner to the Red Lion—Harris tried to persuade Miss Alicia to get into the carriage and take a ride afterwards—I have heard her scream out on other occasions, and I have met her two or three times late at night—Harris might be twenty or thirty yards behind her, when she was scream<lb></lb>ing, running after her—that was at the time she was residing at his house, about 1859, if I make no mistake—she had a light dress on that night, and a light straw bonnet—being darkish, I could not tell whether it was a night dress—they both went towards the Red Lion—I stopped to see them go by, and then I went home—Harris was twenty or thirty yards behind her, going faster than a good walk, but not so fast as a man could run—I have several times met her in the lane of an evening—she was living at Harris's—I have also met her out at night when she was living at the Hollies—I have seen Harris following her when she was going to the Hollies at night—you hardly ever saw her walking like a lady, except when she had got hold of Mr. Harris's arm—I have heard her screaming on those occasions, but what it was about it was not my place to stop and listen—on the first night I spoke of, when she was followed by Harris, her stockings were down over her ankles—she had got shoes on, to the best of my knowledge—it was about 12 o'clock, or a little after, and it was moonlight—Harris spoke to me about her before November, 1859—I often used to go and sit down in his kitchen, and I have seen Miss Alicia there—she never conversed with me—I did not make a memorandum of the date, but about 1855, she was sitting down when I first went in, and she then stood against the kitchen door—I had a glass of ale, and she wished to talk about the Saviour coming into the world—I was talking to her, and trying to impress upon her mind about religion, and Harris said it *as useless to talk to her, as she had no mind—I have been a preacher among the Primitive Methodists for several years.</p>

Come out!"—no charge of indecency was made before a Magistrate—Mr. Jacobs was a witness—through that I fell out with the station-master, and I resigned—I have since been head gardener to Mr. Phillips, and seven years and a half with Mr. Thomas Belmont—the charge about receiving stolen wood was this: my little girl, four or five years old, went into a place with a hundred more, and picked up bits of lath which fell down, and they searched my house, and found the pieces which the child had picked up; the Magistrate paid the fine for the child—with the exception of the charges I have mentioned, I have never been in trouble in my life.</p>

I am the wife of William Horwood, of Notting Hill—we resided at the Red Lion, Feltham, from February, 1853, to Feb<lb></lb>ruary, 1858—I knew Mrs. Dendy and Miss Alicia Dendy, and have seen Harris about with her a great many times—they walked arm in arm, and some times his arm was round her waist—at other times when he had been with her she had her clothes up higher that they ought to be, not like another lady with any common sense would walk, seeing people laughing at her, she held them above her knees—I have seen ladies hold up their clothes, when it is dirty, but never so high as she did—I have seen her hold them up above her knees dozens of times—she did not walk like any other lady—she ran on her toes—while we were at the Red Lion, I remember a bonfire taking place under a walnut tree, in Harris's garden, on November 5th—I think it was in 1856—we bought the wal<lb></lb>nuts in 1855, but we did not have any in 1856—I saw the fire—the leaves of the walnut tree were scorched all one side.</p>

Feltham up to 1861—I know Mrs. And Miss Alicia Dendy, living at the Hollies in 1857—Harris spoke to me about Miss Alicia before 1859; it was at the Hollies, in 1857—I had occasion to go from Mr. Fronde to Mr. Harris to haul up the carriage, and Mr. Harris said, "If Miss Dendy comes out, do not take any notice of her, for she is not right, poor thing"—on another occasion I went to haul the carriage up again, and Harris said, "Morris, I have got some nice little partridges here; do you know where you can get some ant's eggs for them!"—and while I was talking, Miss Alicia came out (I cannot tell you the exact date, but it was about the same time)—Harris said, There is the poor thing; do not take any notice of her, Morris," and, as she was going, she passed a little haystack in the corner of the yard, and made a kneel, and said some kind of a prayer, but I was not close enough to hear it—on another occasion, I was on the Queen's River bank, near Warleyboy's bridge, and Harris came to me, and said, "Oh, Morris, have you seen Miss Dendy this way!"—I said" No"—he said he had missed her, and could not see which way she had gone—this was about the same time, but some months before—he did not seem in a state of excitement—he came up early.</p>

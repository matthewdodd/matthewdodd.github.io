                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Portland-mews. On the 26th of February, at half-past one o'clock, I met the prisoner—she asked me to take a walk with her—I refused—she caught my arm, and desired me again to go—I said I would not; and my coat being unbut<lb></lb>toned, she put her hand into my watch-pocket, and took my watch—she ran away—I pursued and caught her—she fell down, and I fell on her—I saw her put the watch into her mouth—I took it out, and called a policeman, who took her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 129.) I was called, and took the prisoner in St. Martin's-street—the prosecutor charged her with taking the watch out of his pocket—I said, "Where is the watch?"—he gave it me, and it was quite wet—I told the prisoner to go with me—she refused, and laid down—I took her to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook to Mr. Christopher Phillips, of River<lb></lb>ter-race North, Islington—I saw a dish, some mutton, a pie, part of a goose, and a cloth, at the police-office—they were the property of Mr. Phillips—none of them are here—they were taken from the front area—I saw them safe about half-past ten o'clock at night—the door was not locked—no violence was used to it.</p>

               <p>Scotch churchyard, and there found a haunch and loin of mutton behind some bricks—I took Field about two hours afterwards at a low lodging-house in Field-lane—when Phillips was charged with it he said the girl gave it him up the area—Essex saw the articles at the station and identi-fied them, and Mr. Phillips also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Phillips's Defence.</hi> I was going to work at Clerkenwell prison, a man came up to me about twenty yards from the burial-ground and said, "You can have this," and picked it up off the pavement; I walked on, and somebody came running past me; (I do not know who it was,) and the policeman stated so at first; nobody stopped and spoke to me; the policeman then came up and took me; as I was going along I asked a little milk-girl, who saw it given me, to come to the station, but the po<lb></lb>liceman told her not to come.</p>

He lost his watch-stand from the mantel-piece, with the watch in it, on the 2d of December; we went out about half-past two o'clock, and left it safe - we returned a little after five, and it was gone; the prisoner lodged in the next room - he returned after us, and came to our room for a light; he returned to his own room, and told a young woman that he was going out for about an hour; I followed him; he saw me about halfway down St. John-street, and began to run - I returned home, he came back a little after seven, and went into his own room.</p>

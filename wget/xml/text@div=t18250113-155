I saw it quite filled at three o'clock - there was a sample taken out for the Excise, and another for the merchant, which reduced it about a pint and a half - it was then hanged up and turned. I delivered that puncheon to James Johnson, with nine others; on the 6th of January I was sent for to Mr. Field, the surveyor of Excise; about ten o'clock, in the forenoon I went on board the craft called the Charles, in the export dock; and saw the ten puncheons there - I reguaged No. 21, it then only contained 117 gallons.</p>

            . I am an Excise extra watchman. On the 5th of January, I received charge of ten puncheons of rum from Hopkins; they were pull into the Charles, which belongs to Lucey, the lighterman; they were to be exported; samples of them were to be drawn, and taken to the Excise office; the puncheons were to go into Limehouse basin, and I went there, after they had arrived, and took charge of them, about a quarter to four o'clock into afternoon; they continued in my charge till six o'clock. I then gave them up to the prisoner - it was all safe then; he was to watch them till six o'clock, next morning. the lighter was lying on the north side of the basin. I went about ten minutes before six next morning to take charge, and then found the lighter on the opposite side - the prisoner was there. I asked why he had moved the craft? he said he did not know - he came out of the craft - I asked if the charge was all safe - he said yes, and went away. Soon after some persons came down - I heard somebody call Johnson - I went and found it was one of the police officers; in consequence of what they said I remained in charge till the puncheon was regauged by Hopkins.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police constable. I was stationed at the West India Dock gate, on the morning of the 6th of January, and saw the prisoner about six o'clock - he was coming along the basin side toward the gate; I took the key of the gate out of my pocket to let him out, and said</p>
               <p>"Have you got any thing about you;" he told me No. That is a question we commonly ask. I said I wished to examine him before he went out; he said I was welcome; he opened his great coat; I felt him all over till I came down to his legs, where I found a bladder; I asked what that was - he gave no answer - it contained one gallon of ruin. I found a small gimblet in his coat pocket; I told him to stop in the police box and unbutton his trowsers and let me have it out. I asked him afterwards where he got it, he said he picked it up just ahead of a barge which was laying in the basin; there was only one barge laying there; she had discharged her cargo and was going out. I asked where he got the gimblet; he said he picked it up just by the rum. I asked where his charge was - he said</p>
               <p>"There it is, astern of the brig;" I lodged him in the guard-room, and went to examine the craft astern of the brig, on the south side of the basin - I found Johnson, the watchman, close by it.</p>

            . I am a surveyor of the import dock. On the 6th of January between nine and ten o'clock; I was called to the brig Charles, belonging to Thomas and Charles Lucey; she had ten puncheons of rum on board. I examined No. 21, and found a spill in it; it appeared to be newly bored, and it was a deal spill, those used by the Dock Company or by the revenue, are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130058"></xptr>beach; a gimlet was shewn me and I have no doubt but the hole was bored with that; the import mark was H. W. and the export mark was W. R. No. 13; it wanted two gallons of being full.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOY. I am the principal of the police. On the 6th of January the prisoner was brought to me, about six o'clock in the morning, charged with having a bladder of rum in his possession - he said he found it a-head of the brig Diana, which laid in our basin; that he was on charge there, and had found it on the Quay. I asked where he got the gimblet, he said he found it near the rum, but more a shore. Luke stated in his presence, that he had examined the prisoner's charge but could not find any cask that had been plundered; I went on board and found the spill in the puncheon; I went to Mr. Field and we raised the bung, and found it two inches dry; the spill was cut off, but evidently not by a cooper; it was wet and smelt of rum, and was not the same description of wood. I took some rum out of the cask and compared it with that in the bladder - it seemed to be the same.</p>

My only motive for concealing it was because I thought some of my fellow servants would lose their places.</p>

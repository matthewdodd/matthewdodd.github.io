            , Surgeon. I saw the Deceased about three Days after this unfortunate Affair happened; the Reason I sent my Apprentice was, I thought it to be only a common Quarrel, and I love to keep out of those Things if I can: My Servant gave me an Account in what Manner he was wounded, he had one of his Teeth beat out, and had a Wound upon his Forehead; I visited him several Times, he complained of Bruises; he had declined taking of Things some time before he died, I apprehended the Reason of that was, for fear of Expences: I opened him the 16th of this Month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any Thing when you opened him, by which you can swear, what was the Occasion of his Death?</p>
               <p>Perkins. All the Inwards of the Body were perfectly found, except the Left Lobe of the Liver; I made an Incision and found an Imposthume in it: I understand he had been an ailing Man before, and had lately had a Fever; the Fever might have settled there, and have been the Occasion of the Imposthume: - I believe this might hasten his Death. - The Blow he had on the Head could not occasion that Disorder in the Body; a Blow on the Body will too often occasion an inward Disorder. <rs id="t17430223-21-verdict113" type="verdictDescription">

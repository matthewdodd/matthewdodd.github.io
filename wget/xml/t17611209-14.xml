Several salesmen came to see them, and they not buying them, the prisoner, with another <rs id="t17611209-14-deflabel88" type="occupation">Jew</rs>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burgoine. I think it was about the latter end of March. They looked about, and saw a sash hanging up near the door upon a brass screw in the dining room. The prisoner said, is that to be sold? I told them it was; I offered it for a guinea. They bad me 18 s. I said it would make more money to any officer in the army, and took and hanged it up again; and they went away about their business and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176112090011"></xptr> bought nothing. The next morning I set out of town to the regiment I belong to, and did not return for about a fortnight. When I came back, I got my boots off, and went into the dining-room; and, missing the sash, said to the maid, What is become of the sash that hung up there? Said she, I know nothing at all of it. She searched about, but no sash could be found. I imagined those Jews had got it; and gave orders, if ever either of them came, to get them stopped; but they never came there till last Thursday, as I heard of, then I happened to be at the Hog in the Pound in Oxford Road, and in came the prisoner. I said to him, O Mr. Smouse, you are the man that stole my sash. Your sash, Sir? said he; I bought a sash of you. Said I, Dare you look me in the face, and say you bought a sash of me? Said he, I did. Said I, What did you give me for it? Said he, 18 s. I said to the Landlord, Go call me a constable. Before the constable came, he said, Sir, Don't you remember you gave me 2 s. out of a guinea? Then I said, That was 19 s. He said. I can't say which it was, it was thereabouts. When the constable came, he said, he did not buy the sash at all, it was another Jew that bought it. I took him before justice Wright; and, upon his examination, he said, he went to my servant-maid, when I was gone out the next morning, and said, Such was the price of the sash, and bought it of her. Then we sent for her, though she was turned out of my service, partly for losing the sash. When she came, she absolutely denied ever selling it to him, or that ever he paid for it. Then he said, the other person, whom he called

               <p>Q. Was that room locked up when you went from home?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burgoine. No, it was not; I found my wife in it when I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a suspicion of your servant maid?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burgoine. No, I had not of her stealing it. I have had a thousand pounds in the house together, and never missed a farthing. I was angry with her, and thought she had been careless. The prisoner told me he had sold it in Monmouth street, and lost three shillings by the sale of it; this was the very day I took him up, before I took him before the justice; and he told the justice the same: After that, he told the justice he bought it of my maid; but he denied it afterwards, when he saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it hanging in that place after he was gone?</p>

               <p>Mr. Burgoine. I did; but I suppose he might step in after I was gone, when the door was open, and take it.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Burgoine. There came two Jews to buy these things, as my master was to dispose of them; the prisoner was one of them. There was a silk sash hung up in the dining room by the door; they did not buy it. My master went out of town the day after. What became of the sash I know not, for I never saw it after. Though I went into that room every day, I did not miss it till my master came home. I was before the justice when the prisoner was there: He said before me, It was not this woman that I bought the sash of, it was her master; then he said it was not he that bought it, it was another man that bought it: I heard him tell the justice that he had the sash.</p>

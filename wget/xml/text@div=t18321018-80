            . I remember the time when Cousins found the potatoes and fowls in my brother's possession; I had been with him to London that morning, as far as Shoreditch church - I did not go to the market with him- I saw him buy these fowls of a higgler, in Shoreditch, at 1s. a piece; the man said he was going to Leadenhall-market - he bought the potatoes for 18d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far does your brother live from Mr. Talbot's? A. About half a mile; you go across two fields from his house to Mr. Talbot's - the place where I received the fowls was the nearest place to turn off to go to my brother's; the higgler was a dark man, and he had a cart - he bought the potatoes of another man.</p>

               <p>MR. DONNE. Q. Where did he buy the potatoes? A. Just by Shoreditch church; I did not notice that man - I have always given the same account of the transaction; I swear I never said that they were bought at the corner of White Lion-street - I was not at the prosecutor's that morning; I only shut the gate, but I was not in the yard - I was waiting for my brother.</p>

The prisoner and two other persons stopped me. The prisoner laid hold of me and pulled out a pistol and said, Deliver your money. I said I had none, and offered to get away, thinking they had been merry making and got in liquor. The prisoner said, If I continued to make any noise or resistance, he would blow my brains out. The others searched my pocket and took my watch, with a shagreen case, metal box, two guineas and a half in gold, and two or three shillings in silver. They went away directly.</p>

They all three had blue great coats, or surtout coats on, and their hats flapped. The other two were shorter than this.

            . It is not tw enty yards from Plough-Alley. I was coming home from Mr. Cornwell's, the Watermens Arms. I was afraid to come alone, and the gentleman came along with me. When they were taking the buckles out of his shoes, I said, Do not take the buckles out of his shoes, I think you have got enough. The gentleman that was with me was the mate of a ship; he is gone to sea; he was afraid he should lose his ship. He was robbed before Mr. Smith was. This was a little after eleven o'clock at night. I said to the mate afterwards, I know one of them, he was a bailiff's follower (meaning the prisoner); but I did not know his name. It was right under a lamp, and I stood still while the robbery was done.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, at Bedfont. Some lead was stolen from his granary, on the 22nd of October—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>)—I know this to be part of it, because I have seen it fitted on the roof of the granary—I have not the slightest doubt of its being part of the same lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Hounslow. On the 22nd of October I was sent for to take some lead away from the prisoner and one Woodman—I found them with some at Hounslow—I asked how they came by it—the prisoner said he had been to meet his brother at Han<lb></lb>well, and had bought the lead of a man there named Earl—I asked how he came to bring it so far as Hounslow before he sold it—the other boy said they could not sell it at Brentford on account of the police—this was on Saturday night—I locked them up, and they were sent tot he House of Correction for a fortnight, and for want of further evidence discharged—after that, Mr. Bailey came to me—I saw the lead fitted to his gra<lb></lb>nary—it fitted as far as it went, but there was a larger piece than this, it appeared lead of the same quality—the place is sixty yards long that it was taken from, I should think—I cannot swear to the lead—it was about three feet long, and appeared to match, only there was no cut in it—it was not fresh cut at all—it appeared one solid piece—very old and dry, as it is now, and clean.</p>

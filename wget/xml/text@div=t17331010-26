            . Crossing Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, about 12 at Night, I was set upon by 5 Men, 3 of whom, + Richardson , Grace and Smithson were convicted last Sessions. Grace collared me, and swore, Damn you, you Dog, deliver your Money; Richardson gave me a Blow on the Arm, and took my Hat and Wig, and struck me on the Head; two others rifled my Pockets; one took 5 d. and the other half a Guinea - One drew a Knife, and threatened to stab me. A Light coming by the Corner of the Fields, they let me go, and after I was got from them, I heard one of them say, God damn you, why did not you stab him, for he looked back, and he'll know us again - I went off towards Clare-market - I can't swear to the Prisoner's Face.</p>

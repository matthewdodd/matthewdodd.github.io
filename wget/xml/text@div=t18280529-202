            . On the 18th of April, in the afternoon, I was at Islington, and saw Crossley with four others: I followed them to Clerkenwell-green, and then fetched Hobson - he pointed him out, and said he was certain of him; I brought him to a lamp-post, and told him to look well at him: I had Crossley and another boy; he looked at them both, and said that was not the boy, but Crossley was; I took him to the watch-house. On the 1st of May I saw Aston with three others, in St. John-street-road - there was a crowd looking at Jack in the Green, and I saw Aston untying a handkerchief from a child's neck: I could not take him then, but watched him, and in the afternoon I took Hobson there, and he pointed him out.</p>

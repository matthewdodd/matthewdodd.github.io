               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you observe whether the corner shop was closed? A. The oyster shop at the corner was not closed; one shop at the corner is usually closed early - in the part of the street the chaise had passed, there is a coach-stand, and a few of the coaches were in advance, also a cabriolet was passing at the time, I am a certain - the horse appeared a fine looking animal; I made an angle and overtook him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the shriek come from before or behind you? A. From the opposite side, in front of me rather - the horse was coming towards me; I stopped it as it came by me.</p>

            . I was walking with Mr. Haigh, and heard a shriek - I looked across the street, and saw a person in the attitude of falling; he appeared to have been struck by the near shoulder of the horse, or the shaft; he fell and the near wheel passed over his body - there was a momentary stoppage, and repeated calls from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100026"></xptr>people for the chaise to stop; the driver applied the whip, and the horse was forced into a canter - Haigh stopped it; I saw one person get out and go towards the spot where the accident occured, and the prisoner was taken; he appeared a little elevated with liquor, but I considered him fully competent to manage his horse - when he was stopped he used abusive language, swearing at his being stopped - he afterwards gave his card.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say any damage he had done, he should be glad to repair as well as he could? A. I believe he did tell the officer so; the shriek appeared to me thirty or forty yards off - I thought it was a female; I heard it plainly - it might frighten some horses; it was a spirited animal.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you look over as soon as you heard the shriek? A. I did, and the man was in the act of falling.</p>

            . I live in White Lion-street, Seven-dials. I was in Oxford-street, standing at the corner of Berwick-street, and observed two men in a chaise cart, driving at a very furious rate; the deceased in crossing the road was knocked down either by the horse or shaft -I saw the near wheel go over his left leg, after he was down; I assisted in carrying him to a chemist's shop, and then to the hospital on a shutter - three other persons assisted; I have not seen them since - when he was put on the shutter, blood came from his mouth; I did not notice the cart afterwards, as my attention was directed to the deceased - two men were in the cart; I cannot swear the prisoner was one; it was going furiously - I should suppose at about twelve miles an hour, but I am not much acquainted with horses - several persons called to them to stop, but they did not, till they were stopped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far from where it happened was the horse stopped? A. About five yards from where the man fell - I merely judge of the rate it went; I am a waiter, and have no knowledge of speed.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you observe how the horse went? A. When I saw him at first he was in a gallop.</p>

            . I am senior house surgeon of the Middlesex-hospital. On Thursday night, the 6th of August, between nine and ten o'clock, the deceased was brought to the hospital; he was breathing with great difficulty, and expectorating blood mixed with mucus - he had a trifling wound on the face, and was only partially sensible at times; I found several of the ribs on the left side of the chest fractured, and it was evident the lungs were wounded - I saw him daily till early on the morning of the 8th, when he died; I opened the body, and in my judgment his death was occasioned by the external injury he had received on the chest - several ribs were fractured on the left side of the thorax, and the lungs severely wounded; there was an escape of air into the integuments of the thorax, and an escape of blood into the lungs; a wheel passing over his chest might have caused the accident.</p>

            . I live in Marsham-street, Somer's-town; I have been a butcher, and I have belonged to a farm - I did not know the deceased. I was going towards Berwick-street on the evening in question, and observed a chaise cart coming along, with two men in it; the deceased was in the act of crossing, when the shaft struck him, and knocked him down; the wheel passed over him - the cart went on about fifteen yards, and was stopped; as soon as the man was run over, I observed that both men in the cart had hold of the reins, endeavouring to stop the horse - I should not suppose it went at the rate of more than eight or nine miles an hour before the accident; it afterwards went at the rate of nine or ten miles, I should think; the horse never stopped till it was stopped; I saw it stopped; one man got out, and went back to the crowd -I heard nobody call out - at the time he was stopped a cab came by, and asked him whose horse he was driving, and who had trusted him with a chaise; that perhaps might have made him more angry than he would have been - I did not know the prisoner before - I was there when he was taken; Valentine came up while he was in the chaise; he asked if he was a Police-officer; he said Yes - he said, "You are the man I want; if you will show me your authority I will get out, and go to the man;" he got out, and saw the man in Well-street, and told him he would make him any recompence in his power - the cart was taken to Blenheim-mews, behind Marlborough-street - the prisoner gave his address "Sago, Crawford-street;" Mr. Steel took the horse and cart home - it was coming towards St. Giles', from Regent-street; there was a brilliant light at the oyster shop at the corner of Berwick-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do I understand you to say you have belonged to a farm? A. Yes; I have been used to horses for twelve or fourteen years - this appeared a spirited young horse; the persons in the gig did all they could to stop it - I had observed it before it got to the corner of Berwick-street, before the accident; it was then in a trot - I had a very good view of him; I was in the dark and the horse in the light - I should not think it was above seven or eight yards from me when it happened - the deceased was not in the regular crossing.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Queen-street, Edgware-road. I was at the corner of Berwick-street, and saw the gig, with two men in it, immediately before the accident happened; they passed me, going at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour, not more - the horse appeared in a trot; I saw the cart strike against something, but I was behind it; it made a momentary stop, caused by the jerk, and I saw the driver holding the reins in.</p>

            , JUN. I was in my father's employ, and served in his shop - I became acquainted with the prisoner - I first saw herwalking in Oxford-street - I accosted her one evening, and after that I saw her many times - that was in August - after I had been acquainted with her a fortnight or three weeks, I went to her lodgings - I had seen her almost every evening in the street, and told her where I lived - I made her a present of a ring the first night I spoke to her; and the next night I made her a present of a ring and a coral necklace - I made her presents at our following meetings; Amelia Saunders was mostly with her - I went to her lodgings in Hertford-street, Fitzroy-square - I saw her, Phillips, and Saunders there -I visited her there two or three times a week; she removed from there to Pettit's-court - I visited her there two or three times a week, and carried presents - I have seen Phillips and Saunders there: Phillips once asked me, in her hearing, there, why I did not rob my father of 100l., or as much as I could get - and the prisoner made answer, what would be the use of 100l., my father kept a good deal of cash in his possession - when I took things to the prisoner's lodgings, from time to time, Phillips used to take them out and pawn them - I generally stopped there till she came back - she produced the duplicates and the money, and the prisoner mostly received it-I had shown the articles, in the prisoner's presence, before they were taken out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You first accosted her? A. Yes; I had my father's property in my pocket at the time, but I did not mean it for any one - I meant it for her - I had seen her before, but not spoken to her - I asked her if she would have the ring - she took it, and I walked away; I met her again the next evening; and I asked her if the ring fitted her, and gave her the coral necklace and ring, which I had in my pocket, and which I had stolen; Saunders was with her, and she asked me to bring her something - that was all that passed the second time; but I made an appointment to meet the prisoner on the Sunday following, at the corner of John-street; I met her there, and took something with me for her - I believe it was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180092"></xptr>buckle; she had not asked me for any thing at that time; she only said, "Thank you," when I gave her the things; she never asked me where I got the things; I told her that I had lent a young man 10l., and I was obliged to take these things for it; that was when she said she should like a silk dress - and I asked her, if I brought these things, if she would pawn them to get it; I told her the young man had paid me in jewellery, which was a falsity; I told her so because she should not think I had taken them from my father; my object all along was to conceal from her that they were stolen; she asked me my age, and I told her I was going on for eighteen, but I was not fifteen then; I said I wished I was of age that I might come to some property; I said I should like to marry her - I showed her two 5l. notes of my father's at one time; I told her I had been to the banker for my father - I have told her that my father did not allow me money, but I did not say I had rich friends, who gave me 10l. at a time - I remember her being ill; I was a constant attendant at her bedside; I remember taking her a pair of ear-rings; I told her I gave 2l. for them in the City; I told her I liked them better those she had.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do we understand that she never asked you to bring her any thing, but accepted what you took her? A. She once asked me to bring her a weddingring, to persuade her landlady that she was married; I asked for her in the name of Mrs. May - I never gave her any name of my own.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you not told the landlady that you were married? A. No, Sir; I never spoke to her only to ask if Mrs. May was at home - I had robbed my father before I saw the prisoner; I called at her house one day, when she was not at home - I sent her one letter, but no more; I had given my father's property to a woman of the town, named Lee, before I knew the prisoner - I had visited Lee; I had been in the habit of robbing my father for five months - I was sometimes without any thing in my pocket to give to women; I remember telling the prisoner, shortly before our acquaintance terminated, that I had overheard my father, and mother talking about sending me to sea - I told her that I had got away my boxes, and I said perhaps I might get a situation; I have been to bed with May and with Lee - what I gave them was the price of their prostitution; I used at that time to wear a frock-coat - I told May that I was going on for eighteen years of age, on purpose to deceive her; she wore some of the ornaments I gave her about the street - I remember taking her to the theatre one night; and when we came away I told her she had better not go home, as I thought it not unlikely my father might come - I have taken tea at her house, but I never dined or supped there; I have drank there, we have sent for brandy, and it has been paid for out of the money the things fetched - I had been in custody on a charge of robbing my father before I mentioned this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she have the silk dress? A. Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had you been in custody before you told this? A. Three or four days; I had been in the New prison, Clerkenwell - I came from there this morning; May had seen me in my father's shop, after I gave her some things - Phillips once said,"I wonder your father does not find it out - if he does I shall get the worst of it;" I thought May looked into my father's shop rather hard the second night I - spoke to her, and I told her not to look in so hard, as I lived there, and she said she would not - Saunders was with her that night; I never told her that my father kept the shop, but his name was over the door; I told the prisoner my name after the Sunday I speak of - she was to pawn the goods I took her, to buy a silk dress; the goods pawned might come to more than 10l. - I took her two pairs of candlesticks.</p>

             (Police-constable E 86). I took the prisoner on the 31st of August, in High Holborn; I had been to her lodging, in Pettit's-court, Hanway-street - I knew her before, and saw her remove her goods there; I found on her a pair of bracelets, a pair of pearl earrings, a wedding-ring, two caddy-ladles, a buckle, a coral necklace, a coral negligee, and a duplicate for a pair of gold ear-rings; I told her I took her on suspicion of being concerned in the robbery at Mr. Steele's - she said they were the things that young Steele had given her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was any one with her? A. Yes, Phillips.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating, that the prosecutor's son had been in the habit of visiting her - that he represented himself as nineteen years of age - and that he had the property from a young man who owed him 10l.</p>

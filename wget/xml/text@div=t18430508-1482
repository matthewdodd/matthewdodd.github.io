                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in George-street. On the 25th of April, at a quarter to eight o'clock in the morning, I was on the pavement in High-street, St. Giles's, waiting for some person—the prisoner came up to me, said, "Oh, my dear," and put her arm round my waist—I pushed her away, and told her to go about her business—she left me, and the moment after I missed my handkerchief, which I had in my pocket three minutes before—I called a policeman, went after her, and found her in the Hand and Crown, Church-street, St. Giles's—as I spoke to her, I found my handkerchief under her right arm, under her shawl—this is it—it is mine.</p>

I went with the prosecutor, and found the prisoner at a public-house in Church-street—I told her I wanted her for stealing a handkerchief from a gentleman in High-street—she was smoking a pipe—I saw this handkerchief under her arm—I went to get hold of it—she shuffled it down—I took it off the ground—she said at first she knew nothing about it—as we were going to the station, she said, "I suppose, Baker, you mean to <hi rend="italic">lag</hi> me."</p>

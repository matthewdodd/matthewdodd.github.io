                  </hi>. I live at Barnstead, in Surrey, and am a railway con<lb></lb>tractor—in 1875 I was in treaty with a person in the City to get me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and when I was at the office, in Lombard Court, the prisoner was there and overheard the conversation; he met me the next day in Chancery Lane and said "If you want any money I can get you the money you want"—he said he was a clerk in the Rule Office, and he took me down there—he sat at an office desk writing, and he said he could get two bills of exchange for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. discounted for me at once—I said if he could I would give him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he agreed to get them discounted or they were to be returned in eight or ten days—I thought he was a respectable man—he wrote me two or three letters which had the Government stamp on them—they are with the papers—he was with Mr. Dax in the Rule Office and said he was managing clerk—I saw him three or four times—on the second occasion I saw him he was sitting at a desk and he took a key out and unlocked a cupboard, and took out two bottles of wine, and asked the other officers there and me to have some wine, and we drank the two bottles of wine—this is the bill for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I gave him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have not received a shilling value for the bill—I have applied to prisoner several times for the return of the bills, and he has told me he had not got them discounted, end at last he told me they were in the hands of some jewellers in St. James' Street—I then gave the jewellers notice not to part with the bills—they obtained judgment on the 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and I have not settled the matter yet.</p>

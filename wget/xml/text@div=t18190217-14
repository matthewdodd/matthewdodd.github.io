On the 4th of February I went out to get a chimney-sweeper - I was going to Mr. Morris - I met the two prisoners in the street, and asked who they swept for? they said, for Mr. Morris.

            . I then desired them to tell Morris to send two men next morning to sweep our chimnies, and told them to come at six o'clock - they came at six o'clock, and the footman,

            , let them in. I heard them come. I met Field on the stairs, and he said he had let them in. I went down, and met Hines standing in the passage, I asked him if he was the only one - he said the other was down stairs. I went down, found Close there, and they both went into the kitchen with me. I stood there while they swept the kitchen chimney, and observed that their cloth was very bad, and would not do for the drawing-room chimney; they said they would fetch another before they swept that, but their master was very busy when they came out, and the cloths were in use. Close came down the chimney - I found afterwards that he could not have been up, as they never took off the fan of the jack, and he could not go up without taking it off. He came down much sooner than I expected, and I told him he had not been to the top - he said he had; Hines also said Close had been to the top. I took them into the butler's pantry to sweep it, it has a cupboard in it where the plate is kept. I stood there while they swept that chimney also. I went out with the housemaid to shake a green cloth, and left them in the pantry. I was not absent three minutes. I returned into the pantry, and met Hines coming out; he said he was going for a better cloth. I told him to make haste. He said he would return in five minutes. He went out, left Close there, and never returned. I sent Close after him in about five minutes - he seemed anxious to go to fetch him; he proposed going himself before I proposed sending him. They never returned. The plate that was lost weighed above 1 lb., and was worth more than 5 l.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to shake the cloth, where was Close - A. In the chimney. When I came back he was come down, and in the pantry - they had gathered up the soot and ashes while I was away. I am certain I was not absent above three minutes. The footman came down a very few minutes after they were gone.</p>

            . I was footman to Mr. Rushworth. On the 5th of February I had the care of the plate, and kept it in a cupboard in the pantry. I let the two boys into the house on the morning of the robbery - I do not know that they were the prisoners, they were about the size of the prisoners. I went up stairs, and did not return till after they left. I went into the pantry soon after, opened the cupboard door, and immediately missed the plate - I had left the key in the door the night before; I found it in the door, and the lock was locked. I missed the articles stated in the indictment - I dare say they weighed a pound together. I observed black finger-marks inside the cupboard-door, they appeared sooty. I had seen the plate safe, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170013"></xptr>counted it the night before. I went to Morris's to look after the boys.</p>

             re-examined. I went into the pantry when the plate was missed, and observed the prints of black feet round the cupboard. The floor of the pantry was whitened with pipe-clay. I opened the cupboard-door, and saw the prints of two black fingers inside the door, which is painted white. The plate was taken off the shelf. I could see the footmarks were of a person with his face towards the door - the toe was towards the cupboard - they appeared to be the marks of only one person.</p>

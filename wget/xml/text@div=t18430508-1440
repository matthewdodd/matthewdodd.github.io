                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Thomas Nicholls, tailor, Regent-street. I was cleaning the inside of the shop window, on the 24th of April, and saw the prisoner walking out of the shop, with the cloth under his arm—he turned round to see if any body was coming—I beckoned to him—he turned the corner, and got out of my sight—I saw him in Maddox-street—I pursued till I got nearly opposite him—two men came up—I sung out, "Stop thief!"</p>

               <p>—he then threw cloth doth down, and ran away—I punned, and never lost sight of him till he was stopped—I am certain be is the man—this it the cloth—it is worth 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is Mr. Nicholls' dwelling-house, and in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square—the doth was at the further end of the shop.</p>

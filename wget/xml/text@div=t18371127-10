                  </hi>. I live in Upper White Cross-street, and am a pattern-block maker. On the night of the 2nd of November I was in the Cat public-house, Upper White Cross-street, and put a shilling on the bar to pay for a pint of ale—the prisoner took it up and handed it over to a person standing along<lb></lb>side of him, who took it, and went out to the door—he had a hat on at the time, and the other one too—the second man made his escape at the</p>

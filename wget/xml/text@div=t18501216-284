                  </hi>. I live at 7, King-street-terrace, New North-road, Islington. I am not out of employment—I have been convicted of felony two years ago, and suffered six months' imprisonment, which expired on 28th Feb., 1849—about two months after I came out of the House of Correction, I went into the prisoner Newham's service—he knew I had been suffering imprisonment—he worked at the same place as I did—he left before me, and I took his place—in consequence of something I saw at Newham's, I wrote a letter to the prosecutor on 15th Oct.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—about the latter end of Nov. I saw Knight the officer—I afterwards had an interview with Newham—I told him that an officer had stopped me on the way from Mr. Elliott's and told me he wanted a word of confidence with me; it was at the corner of Bishopsgate-street; that he told me he could not ask me in the street, but must take me into a parlour or coffee-house, or wherever I liked to go, and I told Newham I thought it was not all right; some one had written a letter, and he had shown it to me to ask if I knew anything about it—Newham said he believed it to be <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Channon, another young man who used to work there previous, and wished me to go there and see if he knew anything about it—he said he had only got a few things at his house, what few he had got he would put on one side—when I came in the morning he asked me whether I had been up to Channon—I told him I had, and he knew nothing at all about it—Newham said he had taken what few things he had away, in case there was anybody watching him—he said he did not feel at all satisfied about it, he could not get on with his work for thinking about it, that he had taken the duplicate of the cutting gauge, and the parcel he had taken the night previous—about nine months ago I heard Jones ask Newham if he could do anything with a cutting gauge (it is for cutting leather)—New<lb></lb>ham said he was in want of a thing of the sort, and he would give 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I saw it at Newham's about a week afterwards, and heard Jones tell Newham he had better keep it in the house in case Mr. Lane (Mr. Elliott's foreman), or any one from the house, should come down and see it—I have seen that gauge used, and on one occasion I pledged it at Mr. Atten<lb></lb>borough's, at the corner of Long-alley, by Mrs. Newham's directions, and she has pledged it herself—I know Mr. Kite—he is a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> proprietor—Newham told me about five or six months ago that he had an order for harness from Mr. Kite, and Jones came down and told him in my presence he had got an order for a set of brass <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> harness—he asked Jones if he could get him the furniture—that is the buckles, rings, &amp;c.—Jones asked him when he wanted it—he said in the course of a few days—Jones said, if he could manage it he would get it—two or three days, after Jones came and asked me if I knew where Newham was—I took him to him, at Mr.</p>

               <p>Cook's public-house, about a hundred yards off—Jones took a set of fur<lb></lb>niture out of his pocket in brown paper, and slipped it along to Newham on the seat—Newham gave it to me to take home, and told me to make it up in the harness for Mr. Kite—I cut it, and made up part of it on this harness (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—all these small buckles, the terrets, and this buckle are part of the set Jones brought—Jones brought some ornaments the next week—I put some of them on the harness—these are them—I took some off again, as Mr. Kite objected to them, and put on these roses instead—I remember Newham giving Jones an order when he had to make a set of silver cab harness—he asked Jones if he could get him the furniture—he said he would—part of the furniture on this plated harness (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was brought by Jones to the shop—these small buckles, a horse's head like this, and these tug buckles—I helped to make it up, and it went to Mr. Kite's—these roses and other ornaments were brought with the brass ones—I think eight ornaments were put on—there are seven here—they precisely correspond with these five produced—I heard Newham tell Jones that Mr. Kite objected to the stars and the rosettes in front, and in consequence of that, twelve orna<lb></lb>ments were afterwards brought, and some of them put on—about six or eight weeks ago, I heard Newham tell Jones he had got an order for three compo brushes for Mr. Bell, a publican of Brick-lane, and he asked him if he could get them—Jones said he would if he could—I do not know whether they were brought or not—I am not in Newham's service now—I was working for him when he was apprehended.</p>

I watched Jones (I was in plain clothes)—he went from his master's warehouse by Martin's-lane, Cannon-street, to the Eastern Counties Railway, where he delivered some goods, and then went to George-street, Spicer-street, Spitalfields, up a gateway to a work<lb></lb>shop belonging to Newham—he remained a very short time, and went to Cook's public-house at the corner of Wilke-street, and met Newham at the door—they remained talking there a short time, and then went in, and were together an hour and a quarter—on 15th Nov. I followed Jones in the same way from his master's, and left him at Newham's workshop—on 28th Nov. I saw Huntley in Union-street, at the corner of Bishopsgate-street—I took him into a parlour there—on 29th Nov. I took both pri<lb></lb>soners, Jones in Mr. Elliott's warehouse, and Newham in the counting-house—I told them the charge—they both denied any knowledge of it, and to the best of my recollection Newham said it was all a lie—I went to Mr. Kite's, and got these two sets of harness—I searched a room occupied by Newham, a front parlour at 35, George-street, and found these five rosettes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in an old mug on the side-board—in consequence of a communication from Huntley, I went to Mr. Attenboro's, and found this gauge—I produce it, and also these compo brushes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to John Hawkins Elliott, of 4, Mattin's-lane, Cannon-street, saddler and ironmonger; he furnishes the furniture and ornaments for harness. Jones was in his service—Newham used occa<lb></lb>sionally to do work for Mr. Elliott at his own place—in the early part of Feb., I missed a gauge from the stock, and believe this to be it—I believe these terrets and buckles on this brass furniture to be his—on this plated furniture here are three kinds of plating—they would not be sold as a set, they are odd pieces—it is very unusual to have plated furniture for <hi rend="italic">cabs,</hi> it is so expensive—these buckles are plated on German silver—the rosettes and ornaments do not correspond—here are two very peculiar buckles on this kicking-strap, and on this hip-strap are two German silver buckles, not plated—here are two ornaments plated on iron—the price of these buckles plated on German silver is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each; ordinary ones plated on iron would be about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—we had such in stock—Jones had access to them—sometimes work was given to Newham to make, and sometimes he found his own leather, but on all occasions we found furni<lb></lb>ture—it was Jones's duty to take furniture or ornaments to him—these brushes are Mr. Elliott's; one is marked "4," and the other "O. 4," and has "Elliott" stamped on it—the "4" is the maker's mark—they are worth 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and the gauge 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—as far as Mr. Elliott was concerned, Jones had no business to be at Newham's on 14th Oct.—I took precautions to prevent his going there about the latter end of Oct., after the receipt of the letter—I have missed property for the last twelve months—these five</p>

               <p>ornaments are all alike, and are the same as those on the plated harness—we had such—I have not missed them—the prisoners have not bought a dozen of them of us—on the day Newham was apprehended, I sent for him—Mr. Elliott said to him in the counting-house, "I have received a communication that I am being robbed, and you are removing the goods, and the communication names a cutting-gauge;" and then we both spoke to him, and said, "And another article was silver furniture"—he replied, "I never made a silver harness for any one except Mr. Elliott;" and then after a pause, he said, "Except the one I am now making"—I then left him.</p>

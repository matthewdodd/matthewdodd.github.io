                  </hi>. I am barman to Joseph Walker, who keeps the Albert Tavern, Victoria Street, Westminster—on Monday night, 22nd May, the prisoners came in together, about 9.30, and Cox asked for two glasses of bitter ale, which came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he put down a sovereign, I told him it was bad—I knew that by the lightness and feel of it—he said that he did not know it—I asked him if he had any more of them—he said "No," and asked me to give it back to him—I said "No," and rang the bell for Mr. Walker—the young woman drew the ale, and they drank it while I was talking—Mr. Walker came and sent for a constable—there was no one else in the bar—Cox tried to get away, but Mr. Walker stopped him, and then I went and got a policeman—while they were being searched I saw Cox drop a bad shilling behind him—I picked it up and gave it to the policeman, with the sovereign—Cox said that either I or Mr. Walker put it there.</p>

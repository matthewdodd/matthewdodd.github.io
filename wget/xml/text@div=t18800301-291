                  </hi>. I am a carman, of 27, Church Street, Spital<lb></lb>fields—in September last I gave the prisoner a silver watch to clean in the Alfred's Head public-house, Brushfield. Street—I saw him about a month afterwards in Houndsditch, and said "Have you done my watch?"—he said "No, I will get it done as soon as I can"—I saw him again in Bevis Marks about five weeks afterwards, and said "Have you done my watch?"—he said no, but he would bring it round next day to the public where I was working, but he did not, and I did not see him again till he was at the police-court—the watch has never been returned to me—it was worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at least—I know the prisoner by his being at the Alfred's Head on Saturday evenings—I did not know his address.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> the Prisoner. I do not remember your telling me that the watch was past repairing—I remember telling you to get it together as I was in need of it—I do not remember your telling me you had a very nice watch and could take mine in exchange—you gave me a ticket and I went and looked at a watch and changed the ticket into my name—you did not say that you were compelled to pawn the watch for 1?., and that I should have the ticket for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the price you fixed for the ticket was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not offer you 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or is. for the ticket and my old watch—my watch was not mentioned; they were separate transactions altogether—I took the watch out and paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 84). On 26th February I saw the prisoner in a cell at Woolwich police-station, and told him he would be charged with stealing a watch—he said, "It is all right, the watch is all to pieces; when I get out of trouble I will return it to the man."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor gave me a watch to repair; I examined it and found there was no go in it, and I told him the test thing would be to get it together and pledge it or Bell it I purchased the ticket</p>

               <p>of a first-rate watch which I thought would suit him, and offered to take his watch in exchange and sell him the duplicate for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which would give me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. profit. I did not see him for three or four weeks, and he said if I would take 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and his watch he would give it to me, but he would not do so then. I afterwards met him in Bevis Marks and asked him to give me half-a-crown off the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I retained the watch, as 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would make 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I put it together, but could not sell it, and was compelled to pledge it for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I have got the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back, for what I sold him for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. it is worth 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I consider that the old watch belongs to me for the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which I have not had.</p>

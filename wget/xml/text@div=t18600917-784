I am a boot and shoe maker, carrying on business at 2, Johnson-place, Harrow-road, Paddington—I have known the prisoner three or four years, he is a leather seller—I have had dealings with him during that time, several times—I have recently had credit of him for goods—about 12th March last I had some goods of him to the amount of 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I bought the goods myself, and accepted this bill of exchange for that amount—it is made payable at my house at 2, Johnson's-place—I have had two bill transactions with him before—the last bill I gave him previous to this was on 13th December, 1859, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is payable at three months—I have paid this one previous to this 12th March—there was no money owing to him, and no bill outstanding—the name in the corner, James Logan Dyer, is in the prisoner's writing, and the endorse<lb></lb>ment on the back—I do not know the writing on this bill of 12th March—it is not my acceptance—it is not the bill I gave—I have not authorized the prisoner or any one else to accept a bill for me—I had never seen this bill till it came, from the hands of the holder, Mr. Simmell—he called on me about the bill before it became due—he asked me if I had accepted a bill for young Dyer; he named the amount and the date—they corresponded with what I had accepted—I showed him the invoice, he said he was very glad to hear it, and then he went away—this bill is on a lithographed form.</p>

"I hear the game is all up with Jim: what is he going to do about the bills I gave him? I expect he will make me all right,"—nothing of thd sort—I never attempted to take some of the stock out of the shop, saying to him that it would secure me against loss—I don't know whether there was an execution in the house at this time—I don't know whether there was another person there when I said something to Wilson I about the governor; I don't know that there was a Sheriffs officer.</p>

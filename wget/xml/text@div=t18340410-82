            . I am in the service of Mr. Fleming. This piece of silk the prisoner pawned on the 24th of February, for four shillings.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WHITFORD. This is my master's silk - I have brought the piece it was cut from.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was that piece of silk in the warehouse before you came to live there? Witness. I do not know- about three quarters of a yard may be used from a piece to make patterns - I do not know how many pattern cards were made - I have found mistakes in the books - I do not know that there are many pieces of this pattern silk in the trade - I did not see you cut the silk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This is the first time I ever was in such a situation. I have a wife and two children.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 15th of August, between four and five in the afternoon I observed the prisoner in Aldgate High Street. When he came to me he had a bushel basket on his shoulder covered over with an apron, and on the top of the apron was straw. In consequence of suspicion I followed him into Petticoat Lane, there I stopped him and asked him what he had got, he said lead, and he was going to dispose of it at the first rag-shop he could find, I asked him where he brought it from, he said from the Commercial Sale Rooms in Mincing Lane, I asked him if he had the priviledge to sell the lead from there, he said there were three or four in it besides him and the foreman knew of it, but he had it of the foreman's brother. I told him I must take him to the Compter, he begged and prayed I would not, and said I might have the lead, that I might call upon the foreman, he would satisfy me for my trouble. I took him to the Compter, the lead has been in my custody ever since. This is the lead, it is fifty-nine pound weight.</p>

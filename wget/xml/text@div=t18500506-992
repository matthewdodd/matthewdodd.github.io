                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 19, Norland-road. On the morning of 4th May, a little boy (neither of the prisoners) came and brought a pair of boots—in consequence of what he said, I called Bowen, who was on the opposite side of the way to me, and asked him where he got the boots—he said Mr. Apted's lad had given them him to pawn or sell, and he was to have sixpence—I immediately took him and the boots to Mr. Apted's.</p>

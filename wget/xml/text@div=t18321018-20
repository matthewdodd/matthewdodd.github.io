            . I am a constable of Portsoken-ward. On the 22nd of September, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in the Minories; I had no acquaintance with him - he asked if I bought glass; I said I would if it suited me, and asked to look at it - he said it would not do to look at it in the street; I said I would go into a house then - he said he would go into no house in the Minories; I said, "Well, I will take you to another house," and when I got to the door he began to suspect me, I believe, and said, "I will not go in here:" I said, "I will see it now;" he wanted to get away - I took him by the cuff, took him in, and said, "Now, put the glass down, and tell me where you got it;" he said, "That is nothing to you;" I asked where he lived - he said that was no business of mine; I took him into custody, and as we went along a young man told me his name, and where he lived; I went to Mr. Dorgan, who claimed the property.</p>

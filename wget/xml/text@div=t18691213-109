                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, and live at 21, Short's Gardens—on 22nd November, about 3.30 in the afternoon, my brother called me down stairs—I went down and saw William Barrett—I said, "What do you want,</p>

               <p>Bill?"—he said, "Will you fight me for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "No, Bill, I have no provocation to fight you;" with that he up with his hand and hit me—I was outside the house at that time—John Barrett was standing at the corner, and he halloaed out "It's all right;" and with that six of them came up, and William Barrett was the 7th—I had 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket—a man named Finch came up and halloaed out to William Barrett "What are you a doing of, Bill?" and at the same time he caught me by the throat, and hit me and knocked me down, and carried me into the passage, and began hitting me, and he deliberately put his hand in my pocket and took out the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and tore the buttons off in doing it—he then dragged me out of the house again, and said, "Fight, you b—"—I said, "I don't wish to fight"—I was hurt, and had my hand bit—my face was all over mud, and I had a little bruise on my nose—I had had a bit of a quarrel about four months ago with Michael Barrett, but I thought that was all dropped and past—I never said anything about it.</p>

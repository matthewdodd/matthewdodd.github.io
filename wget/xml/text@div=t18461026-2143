                  </hi>. I am the son of Farmer Turtle, a gardener, and live at Old Charlton. On the 20th of Oct. I had some carrots, which I was taking to Mrs. Peacey's—she paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I then went to Mr. Salter's for some bread, which I paid 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for—I came out, and laid the money on the corner of the barrow while I tied my bread up—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>

               <p>put his hand and take it off the barrow—I said nothing to him at that time—he directly ran down the lane as hard as he could—I ran after him, caught him just by the church, and said, "Master, you have got my money"—he said, "I have not," and ran down the lane as hard as he could—I ran after him, but did not overtake him—I saw Mr. Mantle—I was crying, and told him of it—I ran and told my father—Mantle said he had seen him, and next day I saw him behind Mr. Randle's tap-room—I and my father went to the inspector, who told us to fetch Mr. Harris—I pointed him out to Mr. Harris, and he was taken in charge—I had known him before, but never spoke to him—I saw him standing by when I came out of the baker's shop—I was not quick enough to take my money up—there was no one else near—the baker had gone in to breakfast.</p>

On the 11th of July I was digging for some sand, and found the articles named in the indictment—I called a man to look at them—I then asked the prisoner if there was any thing in the corner which belonged to him, he said, "Yes," I said I had broked the sugar jar—he said, "B----you, and the sugar-jar too"—he said, "Connolly had brought them there, and that a woman was going to call for them on the morning—I afterwards saw the prisoner go the hold and take something away—he went up stairs with his wife to where they live.</p>

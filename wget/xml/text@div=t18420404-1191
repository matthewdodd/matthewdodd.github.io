               <p>my till in the bar on Saturday, the 5th of March—John Cooper, the bar-man, had access to the till—in consequence of some suspicions, and infor<lb></lb>mation I received, I gave him some directions, and saw him mark a half-crown, seven shillings, ten sixpences, and three fourpenny-pieces, which I placed in the till after every one was gone to bed on Thursday night—I left the till unlocked, but fastened the bar up—on the following morning I got up first, and the money was all safe in the till—I took all the marked money out, and placed it there again at twelve o'clock at night, after every one was gone to bed, except the barman and myself—on Saturday morning the barman was down first—he called at my door for the key of the bar—I gave it him—I came down at eight o'clock, went to the till, and missed two shillings of the marked money that I had left in on the Thurs<lb></lb>day night—I sent for a policeman—he came, and we went into the parlour—the prisoner came in—I did not see her down before eight o'clock, but she had cleaned out the bar parlour and the bar, so she must have been up some time—there was no one but her to clean the place)—when she came in, I said, "Ann, I suspect you have been taking some money out of the till," and said, "Place the money you have got on the table"—she put her hand into her pocket, and put her money on the table—there were two shillings and four pence, and the two shillings were two of the shillings I had marked the previous night—I knew them by the cross filed on the head of them, which was done by my barman, by my orders, in ray presence—the prisoner came behind me, and said, "I hope you will do nothing to me"—the policeman took her, and took charge of the two shillings, which he has kept since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called to Mr. Hobbs's house on Saturday morning—the prisoner came into the parlour—I asked her if she had got a pocket on—she said, "Yes"—I asked her if she had got any money in it—she said, "Yes"—I asked her to let me see, and she turned out all that was in it on the table—among it were these two shillings—I showed them to Mr. Hobbs, and he identified them—he gave them to me, and I have kept them ever since.</p>

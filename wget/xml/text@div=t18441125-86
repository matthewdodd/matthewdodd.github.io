                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Hammersmith. On the 3rd or 4th of Sept., about the middle of the day, Miller came to me, and said he had taken a place at St. Peter's Cottages for three years, and he wanted some furniture for his best room—he said he had been in business in the silversmith line, and had given it up to his nephew, who would send things for his other rooms—he said he wanted no credit, he paid at the end of every month—he called again when I was not at home—he called again, and I saw him—I showed him the things, and he agreed to have them—they were in an unfinished state—the chairs were not stuffed, and the car<lb></lb>pets had to be made up—I said it would take nearly the time he named to get them done—he said, "You must get them done by the 27th, or you will not have your money for another month"—he had fixed on a car<lb></lb>pet, and said I could go at any time, as his housekeeper was always there—I took the carpet, and I thought I would ask the housekeeper a few questions—I saw Edge, and asked her if she knew much of Mr. Miller—she said she had known him for eight years—she said he had been a sil<lb></lb>versmith, and was retiring, and giving up his business to his nephew, and that Mr. Miller and his wife were going to live there, that he had taken the house for three years, and if he had ordered any things I need not be afraid about the money, as he always paid his money at the latter end of every month; he was a very honourable man, and a man of good pro<lb></lb>perty; he was sometimes very close in his dealings, but was sure to pay what he had agreed for—through hearing such a good account, I cut off the carpet, and cut it out that day, and took it down to fix it, and got the other things sent down—I did not ask for any money when I took the carpet to fix down—it was a trust for everything till the money was paid—the other things were sent in—I think the last article went in on the 23rd or 24th of Sept., and Edge said Mrs. Miller wished her to order two more pillows, and they were not to be later than the Thursday, and to send in the bill, and they were to be paid for on the Friday; but on the Friday morning, before six o'clock, they were all gone—I trusted Miller on the good account that Edge gave—I could not ask for money in my business before the things were sent home.</p>

               <p>"SIR,</p>
               <p>THE savage brutality which you have thought proper to act towards me, truly justifies me to inform you, that I consider you as a scoundrel; that you disgrace your profession; that you would be more in character at a plough tail; at the same time I shall take occasion to observe, that the manner in which you have involved your client, betrays the most consumate ignorance. It ever must be lamented, that such petty-fogging attonies, as yourself, should be permitted to soil so honourable a profession. And some circumstances to reflect that you will (on this occasion) get your well merited reward the first opportunity, namely, a horse-whip.</p>

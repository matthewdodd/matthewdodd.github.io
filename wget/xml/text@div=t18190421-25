On Sunday evening, the 4th of April, I was at the Nag's Head, Islington, with George Hill - we had a glass of gin each, and left the house ten minutes before ten o'clock - we had not staid in the house above two minutes. Immediately we came out of the house, Hill was knocked down by a gang of about a dozen men, who were coming along as we came out. I went to pick him up - they came up, and asked me what I had to do with it? One of them knocked me down, and I immediately missed my watch out of my fob. I took one of them into custody, and gave him in charge to the watchman - it was Elliott - they took him to the watch-house. They knocked me down first. The watchman came up, and assisted me in securing him. The rest of the gang ran off, and did not attempt to rescue him. I did not see the prisoner, Harris, among them. The gang all assisted each other, and were of the same party. They attacked me on the pavement, hustled me about, and knocked me down. My watch was safe just before. It had a key and seal to it.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I was in company with Willan. We called at the Nag's Head, had a glass of gin each, and came out directly. When we got about three steps from the door, we were met by a gang of ten or a dozen men - they pushed against my left shoulder. I made way for them to pass, and said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, my lads, what is that for?" Immediately as I said the words, I was knocked down. Willan came to my assistance, picked up my hat, put it on my head, and helped me up. The prisoner, Harris, came up to Willan, and shoved him back - I saw him draw his hand off. Willan immediately said,</p>
               <p>"George, I have lost my watch!" I know Harris to be the man by his dress and his hair. He had a light drab great-coat on, and a small-brimmed hat. Next morning I sent Willan to Lack to give information and to describe him. He was apprehended with two others that morning. I went to the Nag's Head and saw him in custody of Lack, and pointed him out from two other immediately. I said,</p>

               <p>"This is the man who had the watch" - he said,</p>
               <p>"So help me G - d, you are wrong!" I am sure he is the man - I took particular notice of him. He said he was elsewhere that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. I had been with Willan all day - we only drank a glass of gin. We had a pot of half-and-half at another house in the afternoon, Harris drove the prosecutor back, face to face, several paces.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had a better opportunity of observing him than you had - A. They were close together. I saw no watch in his hand, but the moment I saw Harris draw his hand up Willan said he had lost his watch. He was apprehended next day at the very spot where the robbery was committed, and said he was in Drury-lane at the time.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. I received information, and went in search of the prisoner, Harris. On Monday, the 5th of April, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I saw him about two hundred yards from the watch-house, in company with another man, they were leaning against some railing, talking together. I watched them till they got near the watch-house - they then joined a third man. Harris left them, and sat himself down on the railing of the watch-house, close to the door. I sent for Willan and Hill. All three were then coming down together from the watch-house. I followed them into the Nag's Head - I then told them that I took them into custody, and put them into the tap-room. The landlord, the man-servant, and another person were there. Willan and Hill came; I told them to go into the room, and see if there was anybody there they knew - I followed them in. Hill instantly said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man who robbed Willan of his watch" - pointing to the prisoner, Harris. They both said they did not know the other men, and they went away - I kept Harris. I had told him he was suspected of robbing a man of his watch the night before. He asked me what time? I said I did not know. He said he was at home and in bed at ten o'clock, in Drury-lane; and if he had been guilty of the robbery, he would have seen me b - d before I should have taken him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say he was at home going to bed, or that he was in bed - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>HARRIS'S Defence. I can prove I was not near the place.</p>
               <p>ELLIOTT'S Defence. I was returning home, and saw the mob - the prosecutor laid hold of me, struck me, and gave me in charge. He was very much intoxicated.</p>

On Sunday, the 4th of April, I went to Mr. Branden's, who lodges at No. 8, Charles-street, Drury-lane, for some money which he owed me - I saw Harris there, sitting in a chair by the fireside - it was about quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before ten o'clock when I got there - I was there about five minutes, I went straight home, and got there about twenty minutes after ten. I have no doubt of his being the man who was there. I went to Clerkenwell prison on Tuesday morning to see him, and am sure he is the man.</p>

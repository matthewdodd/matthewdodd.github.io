                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer and plasterer, at No. 11, Tonbridge Street, New Road. On the night of 11th May, about 9 o'clock, I was at the Hunters' Arms public house—I met the prisoner outside—he interfered with me as I walked up the street, and asked whether I had spoken to the landlord of the Hunters' Arms about him—I said I did not know whether I had or not, but I would do so; and then, as he got at me, I pushed him away twice with my arm, and he deliberately opened a knife and stabbed me, under the gateway, in front of the house—he came in with the knife in his hand, and struck me—I was in the act of calling for a pot of porter—I said, "pot," but had not power to say, "porter," for the knife was put into me in a moment—he struck me at the side of my head, I bled a good deal—I have known the prisoner for years, and his father and mother also; they are very honest, industrious people—I had not struck him, or spoken to him on this occasion; he spoke to me first, and asked if I had laid any information about him to the landlord of the Hunters' Arms—a pair of boots had been taken off a man's feet some eight months ago, and I saw</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185706150029"></xptr>
               <p>the prisoner with a pair, but I did not say that he took them off; I only said I saw him with a pair.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 26, Compton Place. I was outside the Hunters' Arms on the night of 11th or 12th May last, and saw the prisoner there—I heard him say so help his God he would do for Connor—he went in at the side door after Connor—I heard a mob inside, and went in and saw Connor standing against the door, bleeding from the face—I put my hand to his cheek to stop the blood; it was spirting out, like turning a water cock on—he was taken to the surgeon's, and I got a policeman, and secured the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Marchmont Street Connor was brought to me on Monday evening, 11th May, between 8 and 9 o'clock; he had a very small wound on the left cheek bone; there was. a great effusion of blood, an artery had been wounded—I dressed it, and plugged it with lint—he saw me three or four times afterwards in the course of a week or ten days—it required very little dressing after that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> About what size was the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not one<lb></lb>eighth of an inch—it was a simple incision—a penknife would produce such a wound—it might happen by stumbling against the knife.</p>

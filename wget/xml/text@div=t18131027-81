I said to the prisoner, my good girl, let me have my protection-box; I do not mind the money, or the watch; she said, I had no such thing in the house, I got an officer to search the girl; he searched her, and found no more than ten shillings My notes, watch, and protection-box, were not found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the evening of the 18th of this month, I met the prosecutor, he appeared to be in liquor; he accompanied me home; he sent for several half pints of liquor; he asked me what he should give me to sleep all night with me; I said, eight shillings. We went to bed; he gave me three shillings, and his watch to keep for the other five shillings, saying, that was all he had. I went out for more liquor, on my return he was a sleep. I then undressed and went to bed. In the morning he asked me for his watch; I told him he gave it me to keep for five shillings. He sent me out for some liquor; I pledged the watch to get the gin. When the officer came he said, he had lost three pounds, and his protection-box.</p>

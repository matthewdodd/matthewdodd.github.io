               <p>Hassler. I am servant to Mr. Sloper; she was accused with taking the things, and owned it, and by her directions many were found again: she had sold the gold clasps to a silversmith, and the other things were pawned to Mr. Gunson.</p>

               <p>Westery. I had known her about twelve months (he produced four shirts, and three pair of ruffles) on these she had thirty-four shillings, and six-pence; I lent her fourteen shillings upon two of them, and my master's brother, who is sick in the country, lent her the money on the other two.</p>

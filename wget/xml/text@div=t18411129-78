                  </hi>. I am a brewer's servant. On the 13th of October, about a quarter to four o'clock, I was sitting on a dray, which my fellow-servant, John Sneezeby, the deceased, was driving out of Rupert-street into Coventry-street, Haymarket—it was quite light—two <hi rend="italic">busses</hi>—were coming from the Black Horse public-house, which is at the other end of Coventry-street, one behind the other—the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>—which knocked the de<lb></lb>ceased down, and ran over him, belonged to Thomas Powles—the pri<lb></lb>soner was driving that <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>—they—were coming at from ten to twelve miles an hour, from a trot to a canter—Sneezeby was at his fore-horse, by the head, turning round the corner—he was going as carefully and steadily as any man could drive a horse—it was the second <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>—which knocked him down—he was knocked down by the fore-part of the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>,—and both wheels went over his body—he did not die for eight days—the people went up to the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>,—and told the prisoner he must step down, if he pleased, and took the name and number of the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>—the prisoner gave himself up to the policeman, who was standing on the side of the street, and he was taken to the station—the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>—was certainly not driving carefully—he had pulled from his right side against the deceased.</p>
               <p>

               <p>— <hi rend="smallCaps">EASTWOOD</hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody—I saw two <hi rend="italic">busses</hi>—coming towards the Haymarket from Whitcombe-street—they were going at between ten and twelve miles an hour, which is a very fast pace—I saw the driver of the dray turning the corner, and saw the omnibus knock him down—he was driving the dray at a moderate pace—the omnibus was stopped, and the prisoner given into my custody—in my judgment the omnibuses were driving improperly and carelessly—there are a great many foot-passengers crossing the road there fre<lb></lb>quently, and, in my judgment, it was dangerous to those persons for the omnibuses to drive so fast—when the prisoner was taken he said he was very sorry it had happened.</p>

               <p>the 13th of October, I was in Coventry-street, driving Mr. Clark's Pim-lico omnibus, coming into the City—when the deceased was driven over I was at the corner of Panton-court, on the near side of Coventry-street, with my face towards the prisoner's omnibus—I saw the pace at which he came—he began with a walk and did not come on above five miles an hour—he could not have come more than that, the distance would not allow him—he had not got above twenty-five yards from the Black Horse at the time—the wood pavement is very slippery in wet weather, and very dangerous for horses—the prisoner's omnibus was on its right side, the near side—one of Mr. Powell's omnibuses had just passed us, and was about thirty yards off—the brewer's dray came out of Rupert-street—the deceased had hold of the first horse with his left hand, trying to stop the other horse from coming on the pavement, but being on the wooden pavement the horse could not stop the weight of the dray, and the chain-brace of his own horse caught him and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi>—him under the omnibus, which came on the near side—being on the wooden pavement the deceased could not hear the noise of the omnibus—the omnibus was going so slow at the time, that he had time to scream between the first and second wheels going over him—he did not know that he had run over the man till I called, "Stop, stop, look what you have done "—he looked the re<lb></lb>verse way—he pulled up almost immediately and got down—it certainly appeared to be an accident on the prisoner's part and nothing more—if the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>—had struck the deceased it would have <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi>—him under the dray—if the splinter bar had caught him, it would have thrown him to the off side, but the chain-brace of the dray caught him—no one could have seen so well as I could from my position—there was nothing passing at the time but the two omnibuses and the dray.</p>

On the 13th of October I was standing at the corner of Oxendon-street and Coventry-street, and saw the Brentford omnibus, which the prisoner was driving—tothe best of my judgment it was going at about seven miles an hour—it was nothing like ten or twelve miles an hour—it was not going at a pace dangerous to the persons about—I saw the dray coming from Rupert-street into Coventry-street—the deceased was at his fore-horse's head, cross<lb></lb>ing Coventry-street from Rupert-street, endeavouring to get to the near side of the street—I saw the omnibus going by on the near side of the street, which was on its right side—the deceased was more than in the middle of the road—if he had obtained the near-side, he would have been on his right side—in order to turn round the post, it was necessary to make a bend to go to the near-side—he would have to go straight across the street to get to it—the dray was going towards the Haymarket, which would bring the deceased more into the middle of the road, on the side which he was endeavouring to avoid—he had his two horses and part of the dray out of Rupert-street, in Coventry-street—the omnibus was going by on the near-side-of the road, consequently the deceased, who was at the fore-horse's head, was on the off-side of the omnibus—by some means, I do not know what, he was knocked down—I was not on the off-side to see—I was on the Oxendon-street side—the moment the omnibus passed him, I saw him lying in the road on his back—I do not know whether he was knocked down by his own horse, or by the omnibus—I could not per<lb></lb>ceive any negligence or carelessness on the part of the prisoner—I had crossed the road myself the moment before—the prisoner pulled up as soon as he could on the wood pavement—it is very difficult to pull up on the wood.</p>

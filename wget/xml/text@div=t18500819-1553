                  </hi>. I live at 158, High-street, Borough. I am clerk to Henry Pigeon, the younger—it is his dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. George-the-Martyr, Southwark—the distillery joins to the house—I and the housekeeper were the last persons who were up on the night of 11th Aug.—about six o'clock next morning I was looking out of my bedroom-window, and saw the prisoner on the roof of the distillery—the dwelling-house is in front, and the distillery runs from the back of it—he was crawling on his hands and knees—I went down-stairs, and gave an alarm—I went into the distillery, and observed an inner door forced open, leading from the dwelling-house into the distillery—I went into the distillery, and found two desks had been forced open, and an attempt had been made to force two more and a drawer—I did not miss anything from the desks which had been forced open—the locks in the counting-house had been forced—one of the desks which</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Abraham Walker, and am house<lb></lb>keeper at that house. About seven o'clock in the morning, on 12th Aug., I came down-stairs, and from some information I went into the dining-room—I observed the window open, and the floor very much dirtied—that window had been shut down close the night before, but not fastened—I went into the kitchen, which is on the same floor, and missed the keys, which were on the shelf, with a padlock—I have seen the keys since, in the policeman's possession—these are them; they are all mine but one, which is Mr. Pigeon's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was eight o'clock on the night before, when you saw the place fast? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is no servant in the house but me—I have a charwoman, but she is not there at night—she was not there the day before—there are two clerks in the house—I sat up till half-past eleven that night—I left the keys at eight at night, not in the kitchen but on a slab through the kitchen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A.</hi> 99). I went to Mr. Pigeon's just as the clock had gone six—I went on the roof, there was no person there then—I had seen the prisoner on the roof; he was coming towards the Dun Horse, as if to make his escape—he saw me, and turned back—I went into the Dun Horse, and went into the washhouse—I found the prisoner there, he was crouched up in a screen—I asked him how he came on Mr. Pigeon's premises—he said two gentlemen put him over the gate, and said there were some keys they wanted—I looked in the water-closet of the Dun Horse, which was near where the prisoner was; I found there this screw-driver—in an hour and a half after, I went and found these two ends of wax candles, and these matches—Mr. Brine found these keys, in my presence.</p>

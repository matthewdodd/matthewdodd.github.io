             appears to be entered the 16th of April, 46, able seaman; he was discharged from her the 30th of August following, to the Pembrook man of war; the neat money due to him for the Pembrook was 4 l.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270031"></xptr> 19 s. 3 d. there was a ticket made out for this man's wages.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Redman. Here is a column in our book for that purpose, where it is set forth.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have been paid his wages without producing the ticket?</p>
               <p>Redman. No, my lord, he cannot; that must be produced at the pay office, on the payment or recall of the ship. So that upon producing this ticket, and a proper authority, an indorsement is sufficient, when the sum is under 10 pounds, it is necessary it should be signed by the person and a witness, without which, they would make an objection, and would not pay the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when it is so signed, is it the method usually to pay the money?</p>
               <p>Redman. Yes it is, my lord, when the person cannot come himself, supposing the debt is under 10 l. it is generally put in such like words, pray pay the money to such a person. I look upon this in the same light as an indorsement, he is shewn the ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you apprehend this to be?</p>
               <p>Redman. I apprehend this to be a very good ticket that was delivered out of our office.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the indorsement on the back of it?</p>
               <p>Redman. This is sufficient for the treasurers to pay the money by.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose there was not such an order on the back side?</p>
               <p>Redman. They could not answer paying the money, if a person buys a ticket without that common form, pray pay, &amp;c. he cannot receive the money.</p>

I suspected that he was an apprentice, being a very young fellow; he told me he was but nineteen years old; I told him as to that, I had no doubt, but he was the very man to whom the ticket belonged, by what appeared to me on the ticket; he said he was no apprentice; I desired he'd bring me some security upon that. I had let him have some money, he returned and said, he could bring no vouchers, but positively declared, he was no apprentice; had he been an apprentice I should have lost it all. I paid him half a guinea more. After I had bought it he made me this indorsement on the back of it, as is customary.</p>

            's name; that would not satisfy them, but they came to me two days after, and said, I might have more money to keep me two or three days; said they, go and tell the gentleman, you have no body to vouch for you, and get some money, if you can't get so much as you would; I went, and the gentleman gave me half a guinea more: I came back and they gave me three or four shillings, and turned me about my business. My father was a captain of a troop of horse, but when I came home from sea, my friends were all dead; in the ship I came home in, I had been midshipman two years.</p>

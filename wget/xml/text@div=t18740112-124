               <p>to Sandrock House, Petersfield Road, Midhurst—I got assistance, and rang the bell at the front gate, the prisoner came to the gate, and I asked him if his name was Jackson—he said "Yes"—I said "I want to speak to you"—he turned round and ran towards the house—I jumped over the gate, and was met by a black retriever dog, which pinned me by the coat for some minutes, and the prisoner got into the house and shut the door; the superintendent released me, and we burst the door open and found the prisoner sitting in a room with his wife—we were in plain clothes—I read the warrant, and asked him if his name was Jackson <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Faulkner—he said "Yes"—I told him I must search the house—I went up stairs with the wife and found this sealskin jacket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found in an outhouse this box, on the lid of which is "From J. Shoolbred &amp; Co., Tottenham Court Road, London"—I showed it to the prisoner—he made no answer, but called his wife, and told her not to answer any questions—she put her arms round his neck, and he said "This is my affair, not yours"—I brought him to town, and before going into the Police Court, I said something about the property, and he said "Do you think they will confine me or <hi rend="italic">remit</hi> me to bail?—I said "It is very unusual"—he repeated the question, and I said "I don't know"—I afterwards spoke to him again, and he said that he would rather see somebody from Shoolbred's.</p>

As the prisoner was coming out of Court at Bow Street, he spoke to me, and said he had seen a great deal of trouble, and was in great distress, and requiring money, he pawned the goods—I asked him if he had the tickets—he said "No; but I will write to you to<lb></lb>morrow, and give you information where the goods are"—two days after<lb></lb>wards I received this letter and envelope.</p>

               <p>Being unable to do so, and fearing I should be arrested, I took a lodging in the name of Faulkner. I ordered only one jacket for my wife, which was found among her clothes, and I thought Messrs. Shoolbred would give me credit for that. The doctor ordered my wife change of air, but being in arrears for my lodgings I could not leave. I did not ask the prosecutors to send me this quantity of goods; and being placed in possession, of them at such a critical time, I was induced to pawn them to pay my rent and give my wife the change which she required. I only expected to get one jacket, and having them suddenly put into my possession tempted me to do this. I should have returned them if I had been allowed more time, but my being taken in custody prevented my getting the loan. Of course, it was not proper; but one does not act so calmly and conscientiously when placed in difficulties. My wife is seriously ill, and I have a young family depen<lb></lb>dant upon me. <rs id="t18740112-124-verdict-1" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am errand-boy to Messrs. Brogden and Garland: it is my duty to take the workmen's cans every night at eight o'clock, and place them in the iron chest. On the 30th of December I collected them - the prisoner and Goodfellow worked in the lower shop; when I took Goodfellow's can I observed the prisoner's can was not locked, and I did not take that - I took up the cans and a drawer of leaden patterns; when I got up stairs, near the place where I was to deposit the cans, I saw the prisoner - he said to me, "Let me take some of the cans, or else you will let them fall;" I do not know how many I had, but I had carried them up stairs safely - I could have carried them to the safe; the prisoner was not in the habit of assisting me - Goodfellow's can was one of those which the prisoner took from me, to put on the drawer-bench, near the safety-chest; he took them from under my arm - I had no objection; I put the drawer into the counting-house, and then went down - I afterwards saw the prisoner at his bench, where I had seen his can unlocked - his can was not there, and I asked him if it was gone up; I had not met any one going up as I came down - I took up the other cans, but I did not lock the safe; Mr. Hamson gave me the key that night - I opened the safe the next morning with that key; I took out fourteen of the workmen's cans, and one large one containing silver - I delivered the fourteen cans to the workmen; I knew by the numbers who they belonged to - Goodfellow's can, which was No. 15, and the prisoner's, which was No. 22, were not, in the chest that morning; I asked the prisoner if he had got his can, and he said No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you been in the prosecutors' employ? A. Four or five months: about twenty men where in the prosecutors' employ - I cannot tell how many remained that night; I left at half-past eight o'clock - when I took Goodfellow's can I did not look into Green's can; Green was not there - I do not know how many cans I had; my arms were full - they were placed near the safety-chest; I do not know who put them in - I went out almost directly to a public-house in Bridgwater-gardens; it took me about five minutes to go there and back, but it was before I went that the prisoner said his box had been taken up stairs - I had gone to Mr. Hamson's counting-house, put the drawer in, then came down, and saw the prisoner in the lower shop; I asked him if his can was gone up, and he said Yes - I did not count the cans before they were put into the safe.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you leave the cans? A. On a board outside the counting-house - I had gone round<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060056"></xptr>and had ultimately taken all the cans but Green's; the prisoner had gone below when I went into the counting-house to put the leaden drawer there, and when I went down found him below in the lower shop, in which he was in the habit of working - I do not know what he was doing; he was at his board.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the prosecutors - I worked at the same bench with the prisoner. On the 30th of December I locked up my can at half-past five o'clock in the evening - the usual time to leave is eight o'clock, but I left at half-past five o'clock; and if a man leaves earlier it is an invariable rule to leave his box locked up - I left about 18 dwts. of gold in my can; I do not know what would be the value of it - I also left some filings in it, and when it was discovered, the filings were in it; I went to the shop the next day, about ten o'clock, and my can, which was No. 15, was not before my place as usual - I saw Mr. Presant find it in the dust-hole, near the privy; Presant had gone there before me, but I saw them taken from the dust-hole - on the discovery of one, the other was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you worked there? A. Upwards of six years - I have worked over-hours, but not on that night; I had been working on some split rings, and finished them - I had some wire and flatted gold in my can- the padlocks on the cans are all different; my can has three small cans in it - we are not in the habit of showing each other our cans when we lock them; our masters rely upon us for what we put into them - I had finished what I was about, and had no work to go on with; I had not applied for more work for that evening.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is not the gold weighed to you, and are you not called to account for every grain of it? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Brogden and Co. - I was searching for the cans, which were supposed to be lost; I directed my eyes towards the dust-bin, and there I saw a tin-can - I did not stop a moment, but returned to Mr. Garland in the back counting-house, and wished him to go with me to see it - we went, but I did not touch the cans; the whole of the gentlemen, who were assembled, then went with us to the dust-bin, and I pulled out the cans, one by one, with a small iron rod, till the whole of them, with their locks and their contents as they are here, were taken out; I then gave them to Mr. Brogden.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. Were these little cases out of the cans? A. Yes, some of them were; there were all the fittings of these two cans.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see these cans opened in the presence of Mr. Brogden and the other person? A. Yes- I do not know what gold was deficient - I do not give it out; there was only limmel or filings in Goodfellow's can, they are worth 2l. or 3l.; in Green's can there was about two ounces of gold, wrought and unwrought, worth about 6l. - it is two rings and some flatted pieces of wire; I am what is called a cheque-clerk - I have the prisoner's gold book here, in his own hand-writing; on that Thursday night, the total weight of the gold he had was 7 oz. 17 dwt. 17 gr., some wrought and some unwrought, I should think, but I do not know; I found 2 ozs. remaining in the can - the value of the gold missing from his can would be about 14l., and the value of what was missing from Goodfellow's would be about 2l. 15s.; the whole value of what was missing would be about 16l. 15s., which would go in a very small compass.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are the rings and flatted pieces in a state in which they would be delivered to the workmen? A. Yes - they are what is called metal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found some pieces of flatted gold in Green's can, which had not been taken away? A. Yes - that is in a form in which it is delivered to the workmen; I do not know whether Green had delivered any work that day - the book does not show any.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Is that book kept wholly in the prisoner's hand-writing? A. No, the prisoner's, Mr. Hamson's, and mine; if the prisoner had delivered any work he would make the entry himself, and he has not.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. BROGDEN. Q. Was any gold sent to the hall to be stamped that day? A. No gold is ever sent there unless it is in so clear and distinct a form as to bear a name - unless it does, and is so described, it is not received; that must be after the workman has delivered it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Would it not have been the duty of the prisoner if he had manufactured any article, to have entered it as so manufactured? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It would in no case be the duty of any of your workmen to send goods to the hall? A. No - the article must have our mark upon it, which we keep in our counting-house; we sometimes allow a clerk to stamp it, but the mark never goes from our presence.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you put them in the night before? A. Most likely not, but when the clock strikes eight, I send the boy down to get them - there is another boy, but I did not see him that evening; I do not know who put them in - I saw the prisoner on the Thursday evening; he came to me for some gold, and said he should be excluded from a club from which his wife would receive 30l., if he could not pay 10s. 6d. - I lent him the money; I think it was a quarter or twenty minutes before eight that he first came - I said I had not the sort of gold he wanted, and he came a second time and said an inferior sort would do; I gave him that - I think that was at the time the boy was bringing the cans up; he came to his work as usual the following day - he wanted the gold for a very valuable locket which was wanted in a hurry, and he worked over-hours to do it; I was the proper person for him to apply to; and the boy passed him with the cans.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you look at the cans, or count them that night? A. No; I had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>JOHN PRESANT re-examined. Q. What led you to the dust-hole? A.

            . I am an errand-boy to the prosecutors. On Thursday night, the 30th of December, I put some of the cans of the upper shop into the chest, but none of the lower shop - I put in five or six I should think; I saw all the cans that were in it that night before it was locked up; I did not count them but I know there were two rows, six in a row, and two over, which would make fourteen - I noticed that particularly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not usual to count them? A. No; sometimes some of the gentlemen have their cans out and work over-time.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN BROGDEN re-examined. On the following morning I called together the different persons in our employ; whilst they were there Presant made his communication: I was either present when the cans were found, or they were brought to me - I was on the spot - these are the cans; they are now in the state in which they were found; I had previously taken down the names of those who had worked over-hours in the lower shop - I have the list here - (reads) "Green, Moore, Smith, and Stewart;" and those in the upper shop, were "Chamberlain, Palin, Hawkins, Salmon, Sambrook, Presant, a brother of the witness, and Baylis" - I then asked them whether any of them had been down the night before to the privy, but I had previously asked them what time they left, and they all left within ten minutes of each other, about ten o'clock- there was much confusion previous to the finding of the boxes and when they were found, the four men in the lower shop, and Green amongst the rest, said the question is limited now, it is among us, nearly all speaking together, or all acceeding to it - I could not say who spoke first, but that Green was one, is quite clear - they said "It is now in a narrow compass, it is one of us four;" I then said I would take their answer separately, as to who had been down to the privy, and told them to be very circumspect in their answer - I suppose I asked Green first, as his name is down first on the paper, and his answer was, "I did not" - I then asked a second man, and I remember his answer was, "I did not leave my stool;" another said, "I did not leave the shop during the two hours" - there was then only one to be asked, and with surprise I heard him declare, he had not left the shop; I had scarcely said, "This is very mysterious, the boxes could not go by themselves," when Stewart, one of the four, said "With great grief, I state this fact Mr. Green, you did go down" - he said it two or three times, upon which the prisoner with rather violent gestures, lifted up his hands, and said, "Oh! oh! how can you say so Mr. Stewart, I never did go down at all during last night" - Mr. Smith, another of the four, then said, "Oh, yes Mr. Green, you did go down, I also saw you go down" - the prisoner then hesitated, and said, rather sullenly, as it struck me, "Well, I did go down;" I then looked to Moore, another of the our, and he said,"I do not know whether he did or not, as my back was towards him, I could not see" - I then said, "It is clear to my apprehension, that you are the thief," and I sent for the officer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had they all been present at the finding of the cans? A. I imagine they had, but perhaps not; I am quite clear Green said, when I first asked him, he had not been down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There were four men in the lower shop? A. Yes, and seven in the upper; the dust-hole is at the extremity of the yard, from the bottom of the stairs; they all go down those stairs to go out, and pass through the dwelling-house, as the back gate was locked - they did not approach the dust-hole to go out; I think Green stated that he left with Moore.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the same staircase lead to the counting-house and the shop above? A. Yes - so that any person working in the lower shop must see a person go down from the upper shop, or up to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The counting-house is on a level with the upper shop? A. Yes; a person could go from there into the counting-house, without being seen by persons in the lower shop.</p>

            . I work for the prosecutor. I worked over-time that night, in the lower shop - Moore, Smith, and Green worked with me; the prisoner asked me to stop half an hour later that night, as he was going to stop, and wanted my advice about some work he had to do - I stopped, and went away about ten o'clock; I certainly saw the prisoner go down between nine and ten o'clock, two or three times; I am quite certain he went down twice - I certainly did not go down - I was present on the Friday, and heard the prisoner deny going down, but he afterwards acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go out of the workshop that night? A. I went up stairs about nine o'clock - I did not know of the cans being placed up there; I did not sit next to Green - I swear he went down twice, and am almost certain he went three times; had he gone but once I should not have noticed it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. In order for the men who were up stairs to get out that night, would it be necessary for them to come down the stairs into the lower shop? A. Yes, they must all use those stairs.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Where is the privy? A. About three yards from the foot of the stairs, and the dust-hole is, I think, about five yards from that - Green did not return up to his work while I was there; I came down, went through the dwelling-house, and went home - I did not go near the dust-hole.</p>

There is a part partitioned off, which is called the counting-house - the iron chest stands in that; the place on which the cans were deposited is in the work-shop, close by the door of the counting-house - any person dealing with them must have been in view of the persons in the upper shop.</p>

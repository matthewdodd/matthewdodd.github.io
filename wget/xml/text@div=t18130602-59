About two or three days; I then saw the bill in the hands of Burgoyne; that was on the 5th; when Mr. Burgoyne brought it it was payable at the house of Stevens, Rimington, and Smith, that had been added since the prisoner took it away.

            . I am a surgeon; I am a native of Ireland. I came here to improve myself in my profession.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you known the prisoner in Ireland - A. I knew him about two or three years ago, a clerk in the mail-coach office in Dublin.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of February, or beginning of March last, did you meet him in Long-lane - A. He called on me the day before I went with the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the 4th of March - A. Yes. I was not at home; he left a note at my lodgings; in consequence of that note I called at his lodgings, agreeable to the desire of the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was his lodging - A. No. 68, Long-lane, Smithfield. He asked me to take a walk out with him; he told me he had a bill of the Lord Mayor of London, for an hundred pounds; he said he had called a few days before with the bill at Messrs. Gill and Thomas to get the bill discounted, at the time he called there was only George Scholey and Company on the bill; they told him if he would get the bill made payable at a banking-house, they would discount it for him; he told me he was ill that day, he could not go back according to his promise. He then shewed me the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he produced the bill was it in the words "payable at Stevens, Rimington, and Company" - A. Yes, it was; he asked me to go with him to Gill and Thomas's to get it discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and he go into any house together - A. Yes. I observed the bill was not endorsed by him, the prisoner; I told him if he would endorse the bill I would go; upon that he and I went into a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he there endorse the bill in your presence - A. He did; P. Ennis.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the house in which he wrote the endorsement - A. Some place near Moorfields. After he had so written that, he gave the bill to me to go to Gill and Thomas.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to Gill and Thomas did he go with you - A. He went with me nearly opposite of the house, and shewed me the house, he told me he would stop there until I came out again; I went there; they discounted the bill for me; I received one hundred pounds by the discount. Having received it I came to the place where I had left the prisoner. I did not find him there. I walked about nearly half an hour to find him; not finding him, I went to his lodgings in Long-lane, and gave the money to his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner - A. I did not see him for three or for days I think; he told me that he had received the money of his wife, and that he had been robbed of it.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been to a house of a certain description and got robbed of it - A. Yes.</p>

            , one hundred pounds sterling value of mine in sundry parcels of seed, consigned by your order as per cent, rendered, which place to account as advised. John Spuirier. To Messrs. George Seholey and Co. London. Payable at Stevenson, Remington, Smith, and Co. March 1st, 1812. George Scholey and Co. Endorsed to the order of Johanna Scott, of Dublin.

               <p>Mr. Gurney to the Jury. Gentlemen, If you look and compare the body of the bill with the endorsement you will see who drew it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In consequence of my expectation to put off my trial I am not able to bring any person to speak in my behalf; I am now without any witness to come forward to prove that I am not the person, nor did I offer it with intention to defraud Messrs. Gill and Thomas. I went to Bartholomew coffee-house; I knew a number of Dublin gentlemen frequented there, and as I was sitting there I was telling some gentlemen my situation, and shewing them some letters that they might know who I was. One of the gentlemen asked me was I distressed. I said I was. He then asked me could I get a bill discounted. He said, if I could get a bill discounted, he would give me an hundred pound. He walked with me as far as Bartholomew's hospital; he gave me this bill. I went to a gentleman in Copthall-court; he could not discount the bill. I applied to Gill and Thomas. They told me if I got the bill made payable at a bankers they would discount it. I went to Bartholomew coffee-house, left the bill for the gentleman, and a note with it. On the next day I received the bill as it is now; and after receiving the money for the bill I went at nine o'clock to Bartholomew coffee-house; three gentlemen came in. I walked out with them to Blackfriars-road; they made me intoxicated. They sent four men after me, who robbed me of my watch and my coat; the produce of this bill was in my inside coat pocket. I have no doubt it was these men that gave me the bill that robbed me of the money. Mr. Mathers, if he is in court, he can say that I never acted in a dishonorable way.</p>

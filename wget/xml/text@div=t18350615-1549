                  </hi>, I am a policeman of Woolwich Dock-yard, No. 10. The prisoner was in the employ of the Dock-yard, as a blacksmith. On the 11th of June, at five o'clock in the evening, he was coming out of the dock-yard gate—he had been at work there—I saw he had something about him—I took hold of him, and felt something hard about him—I took him into the room at the station-house, unbuttoned his clothes, and found four pieces of copper, weighing 18lbs.—they were between his shirt and skin—two on his belly, and two on his sides—he said nothing at all about it—I have known the prisoner eight years, and never heard any thing against him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of Police, in Woolwich dock-yard. I went with the prisoner, next morning, before Captain Warren, the Super<lb></lb>intendent—no threat or promise was held out to him—the Commodore asked where he got the copper—he said he picked it up near a kiln, oppo<lb></lb>site the smithery—I went there, but there was no copper of any descrip<lb></lb>tion about there—there is a deal of copper in the dock-yard of this kind, but not packed in this way—there are copper funnels and pipes, and other copper, belonging to His Majesty's steam-vessels.</p>

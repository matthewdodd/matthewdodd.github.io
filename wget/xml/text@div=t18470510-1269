In Jan., 1846, I was lodging at No. 5, Goulden-terrace Islington—the prisoner lodged there—I was on intimate terms with him—he suggested, on the Sunday evening, that I and a gentleman, lodging in the same house, should witness an execution at the Old Bailey—I concerted with Mr. Gays that the prisoner was to call as up the next morning at half-past six o'clock, instead of which, the prisoner remained in the room where I went to bed, and took away the candle—about four in the morning I was awoke by his coming into my room, putting his hand under my pillow, taking my watch and chain, and going away—he being a friend, I thought he intended to call me at the proper hour—he went away, and I went to sleep again—I was awoke by the servant at the usual hour—I went into the pri<lb></lb>soner's room, and found he was gone, and had I left a portmanteau behind him—I began to feel suspicious—I thought it strange he should go to an execu<lb></lb>tion with a valuable watch like mine—I went to business at the Stock Ex<lb></lb>change, and about twelve I received a letter from the prisoner, saying he was sorry he had taken the watch, but he wished to cut a dash amongst his friends, and would return it in three weeks—I went to Scotland-yard, and got a number of bills spread about, but I could not find the prisoner—about a fortnight ago I heard he had delivered himself up to Forrester to meet the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Spencer, of No. 5 Alford Place, Old Kent Road, in the parish of St. George, Southwark; it is his dwelling house. On 8th Sep. I fastened up the house about 10 minutes to 11 o'clock; all the windows and doors were safe; the kitchen window was shut down, but I cannot say whether it was fastened I placed this pair of trowsers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) op a chair in front of the fire, as they were damp, and I looked up and saw this candlestick and tobacco box safe—I was not disturbed in the night, but missed the things in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mrs. Spencer. I came down at half past 5 o'clock, and found the kitchen window partly open, and the kitchen and garden doors—there is no shutter; the bolt of the garden door was not broken—I cannot say whether there was any fastening to the window; if anybody opened it they could get in—I informed Mrs. Spencer, who came down.</p>

I am the wife of William Underhill, who keeps the Bricklayers' Arms beer-shop, Battersea-square—on 21st July, about 9 o'clock in the morning, as near as I can recollect, the prisoner came in, and asked for a glass of sixpenny ale, which is three-halfpence—I served him, and he gave me a sixpence—I tried it in my teeth, and found it was bad—when I was bending it, the prisoner said, "Don't bend it"—I bent it a second time, and returned it to him—he said he had taken it at the Albert Tavern, in Battersea Park—he broke it in two pieces, and put it in his pocket—he then paid me with good money, and left—I am quite positive it was a bad sixpence.</p>

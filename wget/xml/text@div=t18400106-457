                  </hi>I am a police-constable of the Great Western Rail<lb></lb>way. On the 26th of December, I went to the building which Mr. Col<lb></lb>lard has mentioned, and saw the handkerchief rolled up and thrust in between the wood work of the roof—it was so fixed in that it could not fall—I fixed myself in the adjoining water-closet—several persons came to the urinal while I was there, and after every one I went out to see that the handkerchief was safe—at last I heard some footsteps, and saw it was the prisoner—he went in the place, and returned again—he did not stop—I saw him come out—he was going into the second class booking-office, but as soon as I came out of the water-closet he went in—I went and saw the handkerchief was gone—I then went to the door of the water-closet, I knocked, and called "Mayhew"—he said what did I want with him—I said I wanted to speak to him, and asked him to open the door—he refused, and I looked in at the top where there had been glass, but it was broken—I saw he was stooping down, busy with his hands in his trowsers—I thrust open the door, and told him a handkerchief was missing, and I believed he had it—I asked him for it—he denied any knowledge of it, and said he knew nothing about it—I told him I knew he had it in his trowsers, and wished him to give it out—he would not—a scuffle ensued between us, and in the scuffle I got it from inside his trowsers—he said, "D——it, how is this? "—his trowsers were not undone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. How long have you been in the service of the Company? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Since the commencement of it—I was before that in the metropolitan polite—I was two or three years in the service of Mr. Gill, at Galway, in Ireland—when I desired the prisoner to open the door of the water-closet he was not doing it, and I considered that a refusal—I waited about a minute and a half—he had the handkerchief in his trowsers, where it could not be seen—I put my hand in and got it—I will not swear it was not in his pocket—his trowsers open in front—I think it was about half-past six o'clock in the evening—some of the men go to tea at four o'clock, and some later.</p>

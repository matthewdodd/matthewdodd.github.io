               <p>ANN BRISCOE. I live in King-street, St. Giles's; I am <rs id="t18170521-118-viclabel596" type="occupation">employed to keep the board-room in the Stamp-office clean</rs>

He laid hold of my right shoulder, shook me, and said, "shew your property!" I cried out, and the watchmen came to my assistance. When they came, he said he would not let me go-the watchmen got me from him. I went a step from him, turned round, and saw a penknife open in his hand-the point stuck out. I was very much frightened, and told them of it. The prisoner did not ask for any money; he only said, "shew your property." I did not see the knife till I got from him - He laid hold of me as if he was out of his mind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you think that I meant to rob you, or that I took you for another woman - A. I thought he was out of his mind.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PEARSON. I am a watchman. I was about four or five yards from them in Russell-street - I was at the corner of the street, and heard a woman scream. I turned round, and saw the prisoner holding her with his left hand, and a knife in his right - He held it up, and I seized it as he was putting it down on her. I said "let her go;" he said he would not, for he would stick it into her. I held him fast by the right wrist, when Clarke got the woman from him; he then turned round, and said "I will serve you the same." I sent Clarke with the woman, as she seemed frightened, and took the prisoner to the watchhouse, he still having the knife in his hand. As we went along, I told him he was a bad fellow for attempting to do such a thing; he said," I have been out all night, on purpose to stick it into somebody, and will now stick it into you," and made a stab at me. I seized him by the wrist, and told him I would knock his brains out, if he did not deliver the knife - He said," take it, then," and gave it to me; I carried him to the watch-house - He was quite sober. As we were going along he said," now you will take notice that I am perfectly sober."</p>

               <p>Court. Q. When you first heard the cry he could see you - A. He could. He said he was sorry he had not done it, as it would bring something out. We asked him what he meant - He said he would explain that here.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take the knife out of his hand - A. I was afraid to lay hold of the blade. I did not like to open his hand.</p>
               <p>RICHARD CLARKE. I am a watchman. On the 8th of May I was coming up Brydge's-street, and saw the prisoner take hold of the woman; she screamed out - I asked him what he was going to do with her. Pearson came up, and caught hold of his right arm, and I let loose his other arm from her throat. I saw the knife in his hand with the blade out - I did not see it till after the watchman caught hold of his arm; I was about five yards from them - I saw him all the while. Before the woman came he stood opposite to Russell-street, for some minutes; when she came by, he turned round all of a sudden - He was not looking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210037"></xptr>the way that she was coming; it was all done in a moment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When the other man laid hold of me, did you see me with the knife, stabbing it at her - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>JOHN SWAIN. I am the constable of the night. On the 8th of May, about half-past four o'clock, Pearson brought the prisoner into the watch-house, charging him with attempting to stab a woman, himself, and the other watchman, with an open knife, at the corner of Russell-street. I asked the prisoner what he had to say? he said it was perfectly right. I asked him if the woman had been in company with him, or if he knew her? he said, No. I asked him what could induce him, with an open knife, to attempt to stab people? he said it would lead to a farther discovery, which he would explain before the magistrate. I thought he must be deranged. He said he had been walking about two or three hours, and intended it. He spoke broken English, and behaved very civil - He could not write his name, but gave me a letter which was directed to him from the War-office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had supped with some friends, and not being well, my liquor had effect upon me. When I got home, I had some words with my landlady; I went out again, and a woman laid hold of me, wanting me to go with her - I gave her a 3s. piece, and she ran away. I followed her, but lost her, and took this woman for her. I took hold of her, saying, "shew me my property." I put the knife into my pocket, and afterwards gave it to them. I have been eleven years in his Majesty's service with respectability.</p>
               <p>PEARSON. He never had the knife out of his hand.</p>
               <p>CLARKE. His right hand hung down all the while, by his side.</p>
               <p>JOHN DANIEL. I had supped with the prisoner that night, and left him between twelve and one o'clock - He was very much intoxicated. I went home with him - He had some words with his landlady, and went out again.</p>

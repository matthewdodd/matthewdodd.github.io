             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been sworn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you? - Twelve years old the 18th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. What will become of you if you swear that that is false? - Go to the naughty man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner and see if ever you knew him before? - Yes, he came down to my grandmother's the 5th of January, Monday, about half after six in the evening; I stood by the prisoner in the shop, and when he went out my grandmother said she had missed two pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come into the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he do when he came into the shop? - He cheapened some breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do on her missing some breeches? did you go out after him? - Yes, she bid me, and when I went out I see him drop a pair of breeches on the pavement next door; he ran up the street, and I called out stop thief, and he turned up a gateway; I went to the bottom of the gateway and called out stop thief, and see him standing against the wall a little farther up, and he came down and said, what! what! and he ran into the road and I ran after him, and my mamma stood on the pavement and said, which is the man? and I said, that is the man; and she ran after him, and me too, but I soon turned back and went up the alley, and in the alley picked up a pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the alley where the prisoner had been? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him throw down those in the alley? - No.</p>
               <p>Q.As to the other pair of breeches that you see him throw down what became of them? - I only see that one pair fall in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. There was one pair dropped in the alley; you did not see him drop them; then I think you said, he dropped a pair by the door? - He did, but he picked them up, and ran further on with them. Presently after I had picked up the first pair, I was sent of an errand, and in passing by I see something lay white against the wall, and I went up and found it was another pair of breeches in the same alley.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with these two pair of breeches? - I brought them home, I gave them to my grandmamma.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man, did you see him stopped in the street? - He kept running on, one Mr. Merchant ran after him, and followed him, and I went home with the breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. During all the time that this man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140024"></xptr>run, did you lose fight of him till Mr. Merchant followed him? - Yes, just when he turned the corner of the gateway, I did not see him till I got to the bottom of the alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the man; did you see his face at any time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you prefectly sure that is the man that had the breeches on him? - Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him after he was taken; after you see him with the breeches? - About ten minutes; but first I was sent into Grub-street, before I see him at my grandmother's house he was at a shoemaker's shop in Grub-street, he went in to cheapen some shoes.</p>
               <p>- MERCHANT sworn.</p>
               <p>I fell coals just by Mrs. Ballard's. I was standing at my own door that night, and heard this little boy crying stop thief; this prisoner was running along the middle of the road, I followed him along Whitecross-street, till he turned up Chifwell-street, and then he walked leisurely, and I walked after him, he ran but a very little way; he turned down Grub-street, and I followed him about a quarter the length of the street, some way down, and he crossed over, and he went to look in at a window where they sell shoes, and he went in there and began to cheapen some shoes, and I went to Mr. Davis, a constable, and acquainted him that he had certainly done something that he should not do at Mrs. Ballard's, because they cried out stop thief; but he said I must go and fetch the prosecutrix, and I went and fetched them, and this little boy, and he said he was the man. I left him in the shop while I went to the constable; all I know is, that he was the person that ran up the road at the cry of stop thief.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I produce two pair of breeches, I got them from the prosecutrix before the justice; I had got the charge of the prisoner, I have had them ever since. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Q.to Bird. Are these the two pair of breeches that you carried home and gave to your grandmother? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they of that colour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in a part of the alley where the prisoner had been? - Yes, where he stood.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They are my breeches, I missed them from the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they on the counter when the prisoner was there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they the very breeches he cheapened? - Yes, the same.</p>
               <p>Q.How many might be on the counter more than these two pair? - There were four or five pair.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going up to my sister's, through Whitecross-street, to let them know my wife was very bad in bed; with that there I was coming along Whitecross-street, and there came a man just as I got about the middle of the way, running along, and had liked to have pushed me into the kennel, with that I steps out into the highway, and walks on (my sister lives in Grub-street, up a turning) and I went to Grub-street, and this man came and followed me into a shop, where I was cheapening a pair of shoes; he came in with a woman and this lad, and she said, it was a lustier man than I; and the constable says, please you, will you go with me to the shop? says I, where is it; says he, in Whitecross-street; says I, I will with all my heart. The young body would have let me gone about my business, though I was willing to go back to the shop; I have gentlemen to prove my character, that I never was before a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140025"></xptr>justice in my life, nor ever wronged any body of a farthing. The man came running against me and pushed me down almost, and I went out into the highway.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses to his character, who said he was brought up a weaver.</p>

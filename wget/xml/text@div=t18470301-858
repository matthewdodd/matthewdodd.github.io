                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant L</hi> 8.) I was in company with Cudley, another officer, between eight and nine o'clock on Saturday night, the 20th of Feb.—I saw the two prisoners in company together near the Ele<lb></lb>phant and Castle, looking into a stationer's shop—they then crossed near to the alms-house—they went up towards Kennington—they followed a wagon to the Goat's Head, in the Wandsworth-road—the wagon then stopped, and the prisoners stopped at the same time—I saw them for about a minute, and then lost sight of them—I remained there till the wagoner went on—I followed him for about 300 yards, and then saw the prisoners—they had changed their cap and hat—they followed the wagon to the Nag's Head, where it stopped—they turned back, and came to Vauxhall again—I and my brother officer ran after them for nearly a mile, till we came to the waterworks at Vauxhall—there Brocksop held up a basket, and Bentliffe was with him—we followed them to Kennington-cross, and there I stopped them—Brocksop wanted to know what it was for—I said, "For being about the road to commit felony"—I found part of a loaf and a bit of cheese in the basket, and when I took Brocksop he was eating bread and cheese—the man who was driving the wagon appeared the next day—he identified the basket and a fork that was in it—the prisoners had been following the wagon for about half an hour.</p>

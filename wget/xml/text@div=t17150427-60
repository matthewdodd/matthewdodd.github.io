It was sworn by Mrs. Arthur, That her Husband and she lodg'd in the Prisoner House, and there being some Misunderstanding between 'em, the deceas'd was putting up his Things in order to go away next Morning; and that while he was so doing, the Prisoner came into the Parlor, and gave him such foul Language, that at length he drew his Sword; whereupon she interpos'd and got the Prisoner out of the Room; but that he still sav'd without the Door, and threaten'd to fight the deceas'd; and then went through the Garden to the Parlor window, and there got the deceas'd Sword from him, and gave him the Wound. There were other Witnesses to the same purpose, but said the Prisoner express'd a very great concern for what had happen'd, sucking the Wound, and doing all he could for help. The Prisoner did not deny the first Occasion of their Difference, but that the deceased drew his Sword upon him without Provocation; and when he was in the Garden call'd him to the Parlor-window, and push'd at him several Times, till at length he let his Sword fall; and then run and fetch'd a Gun which stood in the Parlor, with which he struck him upon the Head, and broke it very much, as he was stooping down to take up the Sword; and that the Confusion he was in by that blow render'd him infancible how the deceas'd got his Wound.

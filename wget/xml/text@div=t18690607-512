                  </hi>. I am employed as a detective officer at the Charing Cross Hotel—on the afternoon of 14th August, I saw a brougham and pair drive up to the door of the hotel—I saw Clifford get into the brougham, and a woman; I could not sweat' to the woman, but I believe it was Martin—she had on a blue silk dress, with a thick fall over her face—it was a silk dress, I would not swear it was blue—Clifford told the coachman to drive to Bond Street—there was another man who also got into the brougham, a short dark man—they came from the restaurant; they were not stopping at the hotel.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, New Road, Sloane Street—I sot as door-porter at Messrs. Hunt &amp; Roskell's—I have been in the army—on 14th August I saw a carriage drive up to the door of Messrs. Hunt &amp; Roskell's—I opened the door—two men and a woman got out of the carriage and passed into the shop—they remained there about twenty minutes, and then came out—I opened the door to let them into the carriage again—the male prisoner did not get into the carriage, but the others did—the male prisoner came out first, the woman followed him, and then the second man—he put the woman into the carriage, and stood alongside me at the carriage door; the other man kept Mr. Cavey in talk in the passage when he saw the woman was in the carriage—he came out, and went into the carriage, and said, "Charing Cross Hotel," and this man went towards Oxford Street, seemingly in a hurry—I noticed him particularly—I had a reason—I am in the habit of letting ladies and gentlemen into their carriages, and I could see that he did not take off his hat or bow to the lady as a gentleman ought; he merely said, "Good-day," and away he went—the female prisoner is the woman—I am quite certain of her—I had an opportunity of seeing her when I let her out, and when she came back she wore a dark green silk dress, a black sash round her waist, a dark bonnet, with a red flower on the top, and light green ribbons, not anything like the dress—she had not a shawl, it did not come down low enough for a shawl, it was a thing that just covered—the neck behind, a kind of scarf—I have not seen the other man since—they could not have driven off above a minute and a half before I heard of the lose of the bracelet; they were just out of sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you not said before that you did not notice the man more than you should anyone else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't think I ever made use of those words—I can't say that I did notice him more than any one else, but I thought it was very curious his being in such a hurry to get away; and another thing I remarked, one gentleman always waits for another when he comes out, but he did not; that attracted my attention.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you see Clifford again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Horsemonger Lane Gaol—he was walking round in a circle, with, I should say, about thirty people, and I picked him out as being the person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CAVEY</hi>. I am an assistant to Messrs. Hunt &amp; Rotkell, jewellers, of 156, New Bond Street—on 14th August, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, two men and a woman, came to the shop—I went up to attend to them—I took them to the jewellery-room, as they requested me, to show them some turquoise and diamond ornaments—the male prisoner was one of the two men, the female prisoner was the woman who came in with them—I showed them some ornaments, and the man not in custody said they were not rich enough—I took them to the other side of the shop, to the diamond counter—I showed them some richer ornaments—the remark was made that they were more the kind of thing, but still they wanted turquoises—I then said to one of the assistants, "Give me the came with the complete parture of diamonds?"—he brought me this case, which then contained a diamond necklace, a brooch, a pair of earrings, a bracelet, and a head-ornament—I took out the head-ornament, and showed it to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186906070008"></xptr>
               <p>them—the male prisoner said, "What a beautiful thing!"—the young man assisted me to put it before them to look at—the male prisoner took up the bracelet, looked at it, and put it back again—it was then agreed that a drawing should be made of some ornaments, and were to be ready on the Wednesday following—I proposed to call upon them, but it was agreed that they should come again—they gave me the address at the Charing Cross Hotel, and another address in the country, and also left this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they said I had better have the drawing made as proposed—I took a piece of paper, and said to the female prisoner, "What will you require? "—she said she would have the head-ornament, the bracelets, the earrings, and brooch, making a whole set—she spoke very little—Clifford left first, the woman went after him, and the other man stood talking to me in the plate room—I asked if they required anything in plate as well; they gave no answer, and seemed in a hurry to get out—when I returned to the shop an assistant came to me, and my attention was called to the fact that the bracelet was missing—I went after the prisoners immediately, but they were gone—one of them stood conversing with me in the lobby while the other two went to the carriage—I don't know whether the lady was inside the carriage when he left—when he went out the carriage drove off imme<lb></lb>diately my attention was drawn to the bracelet being missing within a minute after—there were no other customers in that part of the shop at the time I showed them the diamond ornaments—no one could have had access to the bracelet but the three prisoners, myself, and Mr. Morris—I am quite positive of that—Clifford took up the bracelet, but he put it down again—, it is my very firm belief that Clifford was one of the men—I have also a very strong belief that the other prisoner was the woman who was with them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many assistants were there round that counter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was the young man assisting me, Mr. Morris, and Mr. Nash, who was close to my left hand side—there are not two entrances to the shop—there is a way you can get out from the diamond counter, but not into Bond Street—that entrance is for the work people—a person could not go out that way without being seen—the woman had a very thick veil on—I was paying greater attention to the things I was showing than to the persons—it would be very difficult for me to swear to them—I should say the persons were in the shop from ten to fourteen minutes—I did not pick out another man instead of the prisoner, to my knowledge—there was a man there, and I said to a companion who was with me, "How much that is like the short man"—I did not say it was the man, I said how much he was like him.</p>

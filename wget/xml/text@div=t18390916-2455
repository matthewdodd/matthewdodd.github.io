                  </hi>. I live in Brick-lane, Whitechapel. I have been a carpenter, but am occasionally employed as a broker's man—I am often employed by Mr. Wearing—on the 11th of September I was employed by him to go to No. 2, Great Arthur-street, Golden-lane, St. Luke's, to remove some goods which had been distrained-Wearing and Wood<lb></lb>ing were with me-we got there between five and six o'clock—Wooding knocked at the door—the man in possession opened it, and we all three went in—I saw the prisoner sitting on a chair—he said, "You are come, are you?"—he said, "The first that touches the things, I will run a knife into him"—I stepped forward, and so did Mr. Wearing—we all three stepped forward, and I was the first—I said to him, "You had better not do such a thing as that "—I was persuading him, and said "Don't put yourself in a passion"—he jumped up off the chair immediately—there was a clasp-knife lying open on the table, close to hit hand—he laid hold of it, and struck me immediately over the eyebrow—It penetrated, and I fell against the wainscoting—It was a very violent blow—I could not move—I lost above a pint of blood in less than five minute—I saw the blood about the place—I was taken to Mr. Leeson, the surgeon, in about half an hour—my handkerchief and apron were put to stop the blood before I went there—It bled all night long, after I went home—the surgeon washed my face with some warm water, and dressed the wound—I have been in great pain in my head, just on my eyebrow, ever since—I can see with my eye, but it is inflamed very much still—I do not believe the pri<lb></lb>soner was under the influence of liquor.</p>

               <p>Bethnal Green-road. I made a distress on the prisoner's premises about eleven or twelve o'clock on this morning—the prisoner was not there then—I left Barton in possession, and went again about five o'clock in the afternoon with Cardingne and Wooding, for the purpose of arranging the matter without seizing, but when I went in, the prisoner got up from his chair, and said, "Oh, you are come," and I think he said he would <hi rend="italic">job</hi> my eye out if I offered to take a thing—I am not sure that was the expression, but I am sure he said something about the eye—he had a knife in his hand—that prosecutor said, "You must not do that," and the moment he said that the prisoner turned round, and said, "I will give it to you"—he immediateiy said, "I will serve one of you out then," and struck Car<lb></lb>dingne on the side of the eye with the knife which had been lying on the cable—(I had shown him our authority—the table was close to him, and I saw the knife on it)—the wound bled very much—the prisoner kept wearing, and said be wished he had <hi rend="italic">done</hi> for one of us—he was very violent—I went out directly and got two policemen, who took him into custody, or I think there would have been murder-his wife was in the room at the time the blow was struck—she was very violent all the time, and kept hagging him on to serve us out.</p>

               <p>when we went in the prisoner was sitting in a chair, and said, "You are come, are you? I will <hi rend="italic">job</hi> out the eye of the first man that dares take any of my things away"—the prisoner took up a knife from the table, and made a thrust with it—I rather expect it was intended for Wearing, but it caught Cardingne—Cardingne had said to him, "You must not do that"—I took up a piece of wood, and knocked the knife out of the prisoner's hand—It was a clasp knife—the handle was about four inches or four inches and a half long—I did not see the blade distinctly—I cut Cardingne on the top of the eye—he bled most tremendously—he moved, and leand against the wainscot to support himself-a policeman was sent for.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>Q. How long did she live in your service - A. It did not exceed five weeks. On the 15th of this month, about eight o'clock in the evening, my wife was washing in the washhouse in the back yard; there were some articles wanting to wash; the servant maid went up stairs and found the room door of my bed chamber locked; the property was taken away from the first floor; she came down and said the door was locked. I looked about for the key, supposing it had been mislaid; I took a candle; the entrance to my bed chamber is very dark. I went up one pair of stairs to ascertain whether the room door was locked; I found the door locked and the key out of it; I asked my wife about the key, and all my domestics; my wife said she believed it had been left in the door. In a few minutes afterwards my wife went up stairs and found the room door open; she called me up; I found the room door open, and the room was all in confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after the first time of going up - A. About ten minutes. I have sworn to the room door being locked, and the prisoner was in the room at the same time; I found several things were missing and the bed clothes tumbled and the sheets apparently going to be taken away; my wife opened the drawers and found they had been ransacked, and the articles in the indictment were missing; the property was not removed off my premises, they were taken up to the attic story and placed in a basket ready to be carried away. There were several other articles found on the prisoner when she was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that those things that you saw in the attic in the basket, were ever in your bed room - A. They were in my bed room in the morning, that I have sworn to. When I was acquainted that the drawers were ransacked, I said no person has come down stairs with a bundle, they must have ascended after I found the room door locked. I watched the passage to see that no person came down.</p>
               <p>Q. You went from this room that you saw so ransacked up into the attic - A. I did. Upon the landing place I saw the bundle of clothes, but I did not immediately inspect them; I made a search near the tops of some of the houses out of my own trap door, I could find no person whatever. I came down stairs; my apprentice went up and saw these bundle of clothes, it was brought down by him, it is the property that is laid in the indictment. I am sure I saw my coats in the bed room in the morning; we went up again; a thought struck me that there was a possibility of a person being concealed behind the partition, and the prisoner was found behind a partition adjoining my premises, at the top of the house, that separates my neighbours and my own.</p>
               <p>Q. The second search you found her behind the partition - you were present the second time, were not you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170023"></xptr>- A. I was present; the prisoner was found by my apprentice; I saw her there, I gave her in charge of the constable; she was then taken to the watchhouse and searched in my presence; there was a piece of silk, two gown sleeves, a pair of plated sugar-tongs, several pieces of gowns, and pieces of linen, found in her pockets. When the prisoner was seized I said to her, how could you do such a thing, one that has been my own servant; she said that she had robbed me; I had been robbed a few months before; she confessed that she implicated my wife's son; I suppose he was innocent. This key of my bed chamber was taken out of her pocket by the constable.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Lindler.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember going up to the top of the house searching with your master - A. On Monday evening last, a few minutes after eight o'clock, I left off work, I heard my master say you have mislaid the key; I understood my master had been up stairs; I went up stairs and perceived a counterpane full of things on the landing place of the garret; I asked my fellow apprentice whether these things had any business there; he told me no; I told him to look at them while I went on the top of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. You went to the top of the house - you did no, find the prisoner - A. No; I went out a second time then I found the prisoner behind a partition, which parts my master's house and the next door. I immediately broke down the partition and seized the prisoner by the arm; she exclaimed to me, Tom, you blackguard, do not ill use me; I brought her to the trap door, where my master laid hold of her and took her down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing she said - A. When I entered the landing place. I heard her say, pray forgive me, sir. I accompanied her to the watchhouse; there were several things found upon her, they have all been described. The constable took my master's key out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>HENRY HUTCHINS. I am a constable; I went with Mr. Lindler to the top of the house, I found the prisoner there behind the partition; she said she hoped her master would forgive her, and began to cry; I searched her at the watchhouse and found these things upon her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received information he Wood, and went to Mr. Bilney's front gate—I saw the gate and door open—I ran up the steps, and saw the prisoner coming from the further part of the hall towards the door, with the cloak under his arm—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he made no answer—I asked again, and he said, "I came to light my pipe"—I said, "What have you under your arm?" and seized him with the cloak—he struggled, but with a little assistance I got the hand-cuffs on him—when I came near the canal he ran on the bank with the hand-cuff on, and said, "Here goes for the water"—I said, "Here goes one that will follow you"—he jumped in—I jumped in after him, caught hold of his coat, and pulled him down—we were out of our depth, and to detain him, I put him under the water again—at last I found the bottom with my foot, and succeeded in getting him ashore—he was quite sober.</p>

               <p>Q. By what number of people?</p>
               <p>Jones. Eleven or twelve people husled me, and pinned me up against a wall, and a little youth, about as high as my navel, took my watch out of my pocket - It was a lad about the size of the little boy at the bar [Gadd] I am pretty well assured it is him, but I can't be positive. There was one little fellow (I think it was Jack the Sailor), who said, You dog, or D - n you you Dog, I'll peg you; and gave me a little blow, but did not hurt me - I can't be positive to any of them, because it was in the dark. I was sent for to Bridewell, and they informed me there was one they called, the Old Man, who was turned evidence; I went to him to the Poultry Compter, and he told me who they were that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Field. I desire he may be asked what circumstances he has to know that any of us were concerned in the robbery.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was Field the person that struck you?</p>
               <p>Jones. That little chap, [Potbury] I saw something of his face by the light of the lamps, and I believe he is the person - they husled me up, and I said, Gentlemen, what do you mean by husling me? and I cried out, Thieves, and murder! Then one of them cried out, Coach; one called out one thing, and another another thing: they made a noise like a parcel of ravening wolves. I did not imagine that a robbery was committed; it was done in a quarter of a minute, and then they went about their business. I thought they had been a parcel of srolicksome young sparks; I did not think they were street robbers.</p>

               <p>Harper. He had not one then; I believe he never carried one, for he used to tell them it was wrong to cut and slash People after they had robbed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a cudass ?</p>
               <p>Harper. I never carried a cutlass or pistol; Billingsly, Potbury, and Wells, used to cut and abuse People, and threaten to murder them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you heard Field complain of their cruelty in cutting People in that manner?</p>
               <p>Harper. Yes, I have; and I have heard him say they were worse than Blewitt and Frasier, to cut and slash people in that manner; and told them, if they did so, he would not go with them, and he often persuaded them from it; they were angry with him because he would not buy a hanger, and he used to tell them he had no money; when he had money they told him, you have money now, why don't you buy one? but he made some excuse, and would not buy one, because he did not approve of their proceedings. He frequently told them, is it not enough to rob people without cutting and hacking them? We went that night into Goodman's-fields, and took another Gentleman's watch, but they did not strike him because the man was pretty easy, and went away about his business; then we came up Rosemary-lane, and coming towards Aldgate they attacked another man, but they did not rob him because some people came out of their shops, and we were pursued. Wells had a horse pistol that belonged to Jack the Sailor; he said, shall I fire at them, he turned about and fired, and they all left us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Field. I said to the evidence Harper, how came you to put me into the information, when you know I am not guilty? He said, he had given his information, and he could not help it. Said I, would you send your soul to the devil, to take away the lives of so many poor innocent People? the Thief-takers make a trade of it, and do it for the sake of the reward.</p>

             (Beadle of Portsoken Ward) on the 28th of September, between nine and ten at night, hearing a noise in the street, and a cry of Stop thief, I went out, saw several fellows, and catched at one of them, upon which he cut at me two or three times; I got my hat and staff, and called out, Thieves, murder, Thieves, murder; one of them, a tallish Person, presented a pistol at me, and fired; I stooped, and it happened to miss me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harper. Who fired the pistol?</p>
               <p>Harper. Wells did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had any of the others a pistol?</p>
               <p>Harper. I believe Jack the Sailor had one, but it was a pocket-pistol, the pistol that Wells had belonged to Jack the Sailor.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this?</p>
               <p>Harper. It was on a Friday night.</p>
               <p>Day. It was on a Friday night; there was one Rosse stopped that night, and I hearing an outcry went after them; Mr. Rosse was not robbed, but there was one Mr. Winwood robbed that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with Harper?</p>
               <p>Day. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be here?</p>
               <p>Day. I am here upon a subpoena upon another account.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him what circumstance he came upon to day?</p>
               <p>Day. There was a watchman killed in August last, and I understood that the person who is charged with that fact, was to surrender himself to day. I attend upon that account.</p>
               <p>Harper. Billingsly and Jack the Sailor were generally very cruel; for if a person did but turn about to look at them, they would knock them down: there was a piece of a skull taken out of a man's head, occasioned by a blow that they gave him, which would surprize you if you were to look at it.</p>
               <p>Wells. I don't know any thing of him.</p>
               <p>Harper. What, don't you know me?</p>
               <p>Wells. No, I know nothing of you.</p>
               <p>Harper. Don't you remember when you went to the Windmill in Cow-cross, in order to kill Mr. Jones the City Marshall, and Mr. Broomer?</p>
               <p>Wells. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you any relation to him?</p>
               <p>Holt. I am his own aunt; I don't know any harm of him, he had a very good character in the country, and is as honest a young fellow as ever was born, for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he lived lately?</p>
               <p>Holt. Really I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Field. I worked three qu arters of a year with one Mr. Austin in the country, and at Sir Danvers Osburne's house near Cliston, and at a Lady's at Hutton.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Holt. Has he lain at your house lately?</p>
               <p>Holt. No, he has not; - he has not within these three or four months. All <rs id="t17441205-48-verdict311" type="verdictDescription">

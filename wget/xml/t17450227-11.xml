               <p>Taylor. The Prisoner at the bar. If your Lordship pleases to hear me. First of all it was a young woman that brought the spoon into my shop. I asked her, What she wanted upon it? She said, Five shillings. Says I, Is the spoon yours? She said, Yes; and she said, My brother is at the door: whether he fetches it, or I, it is the same thing. I asked the Prisoner, if the spoon was his; he said, Yes. I said, if the spoon was his, it was better to set it down in his name; and so I did. - I cannot swear this is the spoon that was brought to me by the young woman and the Prisoner.</p>

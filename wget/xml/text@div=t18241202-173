On the 1st of November, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the door of Mr. Forward, which is two doors from my house, on the other side of the way - he put up his hand, took down the handkerchiefs, and walked away - they had been pinned outside the door - I gave an alarm, and he was taken in about half an hour. I am certain of his person - there was another little boy, about twelve years of age with him - they ran away together.</p>
               <p>MATHIAS FORWARD. On the 1st of November I lost five handkerchiefs, which were tied to each other, and hung by the turn of the door, within the shop - I was not at home at the time, but I saw the prisoner in custody at Bow-street, about eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

            . I am a cooper. Barry gave an alarm while I was at work at his door; I pursued, and overtook the prisoner just at the corner of the street, and followed him to Bedfordbury; I never lost sight of him. I cried Stop thief! and some persons stopped him. I saw him throw the handkerchiefs into a coal-shed - a man called me in, and gave them to me as I came by.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the corner of Leicester Square, I met three boys whom I had a slight knowledge of, but never knew them as bad characters. I accompanied them and in passing by the shop, they took down some handkerchiefs and ran - I heard the cry of stop thief - I then saw the dangerous situation I was placed in, and the only thing that occurred to me was to run also; we were pursued - I was taken, and being dressed, and exactly in appearance to one of the thieves, I was charged with the robbery.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

On the 24th of March, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me, and said he knew of a customer for her; I took him to the stable, and went with him and the pony to shew to the customer - I asked who it was, he said if I went with him he would shew me; he took me to New-street, Carnaby-market; we went into a public-house, and had a pint of beer, then went to another public-house - he went in, and I stood at the door with the mare; he came out, and said the man was at the Ship, public-house, in Wardour-street - I went to Wardour-street, with him and the mare; he went into a public-house there, and gave the halter to a foot soldier, who stood at the door, to hold. I was standing by, and a man named Balls came up, and pretended to look at it - the prisoner was in the public-house at this time; I went in and asked him if Balls was the man who was to be the customer - he came out, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! Mr. Balls you are the man I was looking for, this is the thing that will just suit you;" I had hold of the halter then. Balls said,</p>
               <p>"I think it is rather stiff behind." The prisoner took the halter out of my hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"No it ayn't, you shall see;" he jumped on her back, and rode away with her - I thought he was coming back, and went up the street, returned in about ten minutes, and Balls was gone also. I knew the prisoner before. I went to Ball's house, as I knew he lived just by, and asked if he had seen him; he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! no I have not seen him since," and he did not want to have any thing to do with it. I have never found it. I saw the prisoner a fortnight or three weeks after, about nine or ten o'clock at night in bed - I did not know I had a right to take him, and while I went down to tell the watchman; he left his bed, and could not be found. On the Thursday following I saw him in the Haymarket, took hold of him, and told him I wanted him to come with me; he said if I would go home with him, he would - I went part of the way, and met

             the beadle, and gave him in charge; I charged him with stealing my mare - he said he had sold it to one Large. I have not seen it since. He never represented that he meant to purchase it. I have known him twelve months by sight, but did not know where he lived. I had refused 3 l. 10 s. for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did Large pay you for it - A. No. The prisoner came to me about nine o'clock. I believe the soldier stood by when the prisoner took the mare. I did not know Balls before - I did not entrust it with the prisoner to go and sell for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been after him, and said to his friends<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170050"></xptr>that the money was all you wanted - A. That was after he was taken. I never said I gave him authority to sell her, or that I knew the money was all I ought to have - I said I heard he was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the horse fit for any thing but slaughter - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a carman, and live in Edward-street, Soho. I bought the mare of the prisoner; I cannot tell on what day it was - I had her nine days, and sold her again before he was taken. I bought her in the evening at dusk; he rode into my yard, and was very drunk indeed - I asked what he was going to do with it; he said to sell it, and wanted 3 l. for it, I said I would buy it for 2 l., I gave him 1 s., and said I would pay him in the morning if it was sound; he came next morning, and seemed sober - I ordered him to take it away for I would not have it, it was such a dog horse thing, and had a broken back; he was taking her out of the yard, and a man said give him 30 s., I did so, and kept it nine days, it got no better, and I sold it for 2 l.; I swapped it for hay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whose it was - A. He said it was his, and had been given him for a chop in Long-acre, for a black horse - he gave this account in the evening, and in the morning also when he was sober. I do not know where the person lives who bought her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him - A. I have known him for years. I do not know that he was acquainted with Warner. The prisoner deals about Smithfield in horses. I never knew any harm of him, only when he gets drunk, he is like a madman. I believe 30 s. is more than it is worth.</p>

            . I was taken to Marlborough-street by the prosecutor, as a witness; the prisoner's father brought me here to-day. I knew the prisoner about Wardour-street, and Berwick-street, as a workman for Mr. Large. I saw him and Warner together. I am a porter, and do chair-work; and lodge at No. 4, Meard's-court, Dean-street, Soho, on the first floor; and have lived there fourteen years. I saw them at the corner of Peter-street; Warner had hold of the pony in a halter. I went over, and took no notice of what passed; Verney came out to me, and said -</p>
               <p>"Do you want to buy a poney;" - I said, No; he had not spoken to me about one before I said I did not want one; then Warner turned the halter out of his hands into Verney's, and said,</p>
               <p>"Verney, take the poney; and see how it goes." Verney got on it; and it had like to have fallen all on one side; then he went up the street, and I saw him no more.

            . I am the prisoner's father. Warner came to me on a Sunday before my son was taken, and said it was a bad job that the prisoner and him went out together to sell the horse. I understood that my son had bought it for him at Smithfield, and was to have it to sell when he wanted to part with it; and that one morning they both went out to sell it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he accuse your son of stealing it - No; he said he wanted the money or the horse. He asked where my son was; I could not tell him, I had no reason to know that he had run away. He afterwards said he wanted 5 l. for it. I enquired among the neighbours; they said 2 l. was enough. I said I was poor enough, but would give him 3 l.; he would not take it. He said he would go into Court, and do his best to punish him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your son wrong in the head - A. Yes; I got him into St. Luke's, eight months at one time, and ten at another. When he gets in liquor he is wild.</p>
               <p>COURT Q. You would give 3 l. to prevent his punishing your son - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

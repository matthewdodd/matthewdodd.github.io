I knew the deceased as a shopmate—his name was Thomas Roberts—on Monday evening, the 9th of Nov., I and several others, were at the Prince of Orange public-house, Greenwich-road, near the Terminus—we came out about eleven o'clock, or a few minutes after I—Roberts was with us—we stood outside, and conversed with each other, I and after a while each took his road to go home—deceased and Maloney were I going to the same house, they went one way—I went the same way, and passed them on the carriage way in the middle of the toad—I heard a noise as if a horse was running away with a cart, or some vehicle—it appeared to be coming towards London—that would be meeting me—I was going to Greenwich—the horse was galloping at a very rapid rate—ten miles an hou—the off wheel of the cart struck the forepart of the deceased high up his person—he was standing in the road sideways, with his face towards me, and Maloney before him—he was struck first, and knocked against Maloney—I they both fell—I was five or six yards from Maloney at the time—I went to his assistance—he was taken to a doctor, and afterwards to the hospital—he was the worse for what he had drank—it was a cart with a tilt—I should not know it again—it appeared to be a dark-coloured cart—nobody called out to give any warning till after the accident—there was a gas light near enough to show a light.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 311.) On Monday night, the 9th of Nov., I saw a cart on this side Greenwich College, about twenty minutes or half-past eleven o'clock, coming towards Deptford—it seemed a new cart, or fresh painted—the tilt-board hung down with chains, and I saw some egg boxes in it—it was going at a canter, but I did not consider it anything out of the way—I did not see anybody in it—I heard of an accident when I got to the railway—I saw the prisoner on Thursday, the 12th—he is an egg merchant, and lives in Worcester-street, Borough—I have seen his cart—it is just such a cart as I saw that night—I told the prisoner I wished to speak to him respecting an accident at Greenwich—I produced this pad to him—he said he had not had any like that, and showed me a pad with blue marks, and said those were the marks he had—I asked him if he had seen a constable in plain clothes at Deptford, yesterday, (meaning Buckmaster)—he said he did—I asked if the constable did not ask him if that was his cart standing out<lb></lb>side Mr. Duval's shop—he said he told the constable yes—I asked if the con<lb></lb>stable did not ask if he had been down at Greenwich or Woolwich on Monday, and if he did not tell him he had not, he had been another road—he said yea he did—I said, "Did not the constable tell you it answered the description of a cart which killed a man that night at the railway-bridge?"—he said yes, he did—I asked what made him deny that he had been down at Greenwich—he said he did not think it was requisite to tell him where he had been—he did not think it proper he should tell him—I told him I had been at Woolwich, and found he was there on Monday night—he said, "Yes I was"—I said I had found a pad at a house at Charlton, answering the description of the one found in the road, which he left there with some herrings—he said possibly it might be, he could not tell, he had so many—I asked if he had any object<lb></lb>tion to put his horse in the cart and send it down to Deptford for the people to see it who had seen the cart that night—he said, "No," and told his man to put the horse in, and I believe he sent it down, but I had to go another way—I saw the horse out; I asked what time he got home on Monday night—he said about twelve o'clock, or a little after.</p>

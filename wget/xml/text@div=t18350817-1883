                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of the London Hospital. The deceased was brought to our hospital between six and seven o'clock on the evening of the 2d of August, quite intoxicated—she had two triffing bruises, one on each leg, one on the chest, and a slight wound of the scalp on the left side; another on the lip, and a fracture of the lower jaw, on both sides—I paid attention to her, and she went on very well till the evening of the 6th, when she became very restless, and during the course of the night, delirious; and died on the 7th, at noon—she was con<lb></lb>scious that she was in extreme danger for two or three days before she died—I did not hear her say that she should die—after she was dead I examined the body—as far as I could judge, her constitution was broken from drinking—I am not enabled to say what was the cause of her death—from the appearances on dissection, I believe it was from the constitu<lb></lb>tional disturbance. occasioned by these blows, and the shettered state of her constitution—that is the only way we can account for her death; but I cannot say positively that the blows did cause her death—the anger and irritation of the moment, added to her bodily state, might have caused her death—she might possibly have recovered if she had been in a good state of health—there was no mortification of the wounds.</p>

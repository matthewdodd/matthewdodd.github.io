                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Perring Matthews, a glass painter. I keep the Cumberland coffee-house—the prisoner has lived with me nearly three months, as servant of all work—I missed the articles stated in the indictment—they might all have gone at one time—about three o'clock on the 14th of December the prisoner's box was searched—the prisoner was in the act of opening it when my husband went into the room, and demanded to see its contents—he called me—I said I would have it instantly searched, and the prisoner took out a great number of articles which are mine—as soon as I saw them, my husband went for a policeman—the prisoner begged for mercy, and said she had taken them—I said I would forgive her if she would confess that she had got the locket—she said she had not got the locket.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's house on the 14th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon—I found the prosecutrix in the bed-room—the prisoner and Mr. Matthews were there—the prosecutrix pointed out the prisoner to me, and said she had been in her service two or three months, and had been robbing her of wearing apparel and such like—she pointed out sundry articles, which were then out of the box, some were on the floor, some on a bed, and some on a table—the prisoner said she was extremely sorry, and begged her mistress's pardon, and hoped she would forgive her—I took nothing out of her box—I have had the things ever since.</p>

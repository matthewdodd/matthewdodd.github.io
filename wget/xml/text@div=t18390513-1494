On the 6th of March, between one and two o'clock in the day, Mr. Manning sent for me to an empty house of his in Lisson-place, Marylebone—I went to the next house, got on the roof and then on this house, and saw the prisoner lying flat in the gutter, taking up the copper gutter—I asked what he was about—he said he was moving ft tile—he Jumped up and tried to get away—I caught hold of him—the tiles broke in and let me through, and he made his escape—he was taken afterwards—I knew him well before—he is the man—I examined the gutter—it had been ripped, and one piece of the copper was lying in the room, underneath the roof—he had this iron ripping it with, and this poker was in the room, under the roof, with the piece of copper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an india rubber web Weaver. On the 10th of April, Mr. Truste called and told me he had been robbed—I went to the workshop, and found the warps, ready-made work, add raw materials were all taken away—we went to the prisoner's father, but could not find him—on the 22nd of April, I went to Mr. Godby's, in Holborn, and saw this, which I believe is the prosecutor's property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Lewis, and live in Cromer-street—we sell sweetmeats. On the 27th of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, a man came in and asked for some lemon-drops, and the prisoner stood half in and half out of the door—I told him to come in—he came forward, but stepped back a little, and while I was getting the things the other man kept getting between me and the prisoner to prevent my seeing him—while I was turning round to get the change the prisoner took the clothes from behind the parlour door and went out—the other went out with the lemon-drops, and while I turned round to get change for him these things were taken—he went away—I never saw my property after—the prisoner was taken two days after and sent to the House of Correction for three months—I took him before the magistrate when he came out.</p>

I said, "No, I have nothing to do with you, this is the man that took my things"—that was the prisoner—the man who came with the policeman was not a policeman in plain clothes—the prisoner was taken before the Magistrate that day, and sent to the House of Correction for three months—but not on my account—I made this charge when he came out.</p>

                  </hi>. I occupy the adjoining room to Mrs. Lewis. On the evening in question I came suddenly out of my parlour door, finding her door open—I heard somebody there, and conceiving it to be Mr. Lewis, I said, "It is a cold evening, sir"—nobody answered—I said again, "It is very cold to-night," and I found I was speaking to the prisoner, who had the clothes on his arm—he took them from his left arm and placed them on his right arm—I then considered it was Mr. Lewis's son—I went and curtsied to him, and said, "Sir, I ask your pardon for the liberty," and saw the prisoner with the coat and cloak on his arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 29th of January I apprehended the prisoner, on suspicion of committing several robberies—I took him round to several places, amongst others to the prosecutrix—he could not then be identified—I took him back to the station-house—he was examined on this charge before the Magistrate on the 28th of April—he had three months on two other charges in January.</p>

                  </hi>. It was the prisoner's duty, in April, last year, to pay 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Mr. Peck, and he charged it in his relief list—this bill is for money due to Mr. Peck; it extends over two weeks in the prisoner's relief list—it would have been his duty to pay it out of these two cheques; one is for 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 5th April, and the other for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 12th April—he produced this bill to me on the following week after 12th April, on passing his accounts—these initials were to it—I then treated this as a settled account, and put it amongst other vouchers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He was to pay the money out of these cheques? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—these cheques were given to pay all the relief of the poor for these two weeks—I do not know whether any account had been rendered by Mr. Peck at the time these cheques were given—the cheques were given to pay the accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they given on an estimate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, an estimate furnished weekly by the prisoner of the amount he thought he would require—here it is in his writing; "Second week, ending 8th April, 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090091"></xptr>
               <p>third week in money column, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—they give cheques according to the estimate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the estimate, to your knowledge, sometimes fall short of the expenditure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may have done so on some occasions, but very rarely—in such instances the balance was carried on, and paid next week—I only know of the beer supplied by Peck, by the bills produced—this bill was produced to me on passing the accounts—they were passed weekly—this bill was produced to me on 20th April—if in any instance the estimate was less than the expenditure, it would be carried on, and would be paid by the estimate being increased the next week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But would he be left to pay it out of his own funds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be his own fault if he did not make his estimate sufficiently high—I cannot say that I saw these cheques delivered to the prisoner—I may have delivered them myself—the duties of the relieving officer are very-extensive in that parish—the number of paupers is very considerable—the prisoner was required to give his attendance at the workhouse for a large portion of every day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner produce this bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and it was my business to see that it corresponded with these particular items—it is here in the names of the paupers, Bartlett, Bowdler, Lang, and others—on his being discharged he was found a defaulter.</p>

P." are not my writing—I have supplied beer to the parish for eighteen months or two years—I have been paid some bills, but he said, "Let them run on till they get more, and I will pay you altogether"—I sometimes let the account run on from week to week—I consented to it; I said it was no particular matter.</p>

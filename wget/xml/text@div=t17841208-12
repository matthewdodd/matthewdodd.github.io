As soon as I spoke to them at the tail of the cart, they dropped my fork immediately, and came up to me, the other came before me, and lifted a stick over my head, and swore if I did not deliver my money, he would dash my brains out; I pulled out my purse, containing four guineas and two shillings and sixpence; one of the guineas I can swear to, as I had refused it: the moon was up, but it was rather cloudy, I am punctual to the prisoner Williams, as to Hanks, he stood rather behind me, I had very little sight of him, I should not care to say any thing about Hanks, as he was behind me; they followed on the outside, and followed some time, and swore I had more money, I told them I had an iron key, and they should have it if they would, and they demanded it immediately; they said, damn your eyes, here is your dung-fork; I ran on, I did not come back for it, I ran on to where I was to sleep, I left my team, and went to the door and called the landlord and the hostler, the landlord and I pursued them up to Tyburn; in a very few minutes we met the patrol, and we sent two or three one way, and two or three another, and I and these two gentlemen went down the Edgware road, and there we met these two men coming along, one was at a distance from the other eight or ten yards: I suppose it was near upon an hour upon the Edgware road that we met them; they went away over the field for the Edgware road, they went over the hedges and ditches; as soon as we met Williams, I says to one of these gentlemen, that is the man I am sure that robbed me; we took them into a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080055"></xptr> tallow-chandler's shop there, that gentleman pulled out my money, the four guineas, and two sixpences, four bad shillings, and three pence, a key, and a knife; Williams had the money, the man that took it from me; as soon as he pulled out the money, I said that is my guinea, I can swear to it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you speak to Wright, and desire to know whether the things were silver? A. Not to the auctioncer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I think you are a Lancashire person? A. Yes; on my first entrance there were about ten persons in the room, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear when you asked whether the tops of the glasses were silver, that he did not say they were German silver? A. It was the top of the large one - he said it was silver: he did not mention German silver till afterwards. (The dressing-case was here produced.) I am not twenty-one years old; I believe this is the box, but do not know it to be the same - I am not able to say whether it is worth 35s.; this is the top which he alluded to; I bought it after he represented it as silver -I swear positively that he did not say it was German silver; my friend said his handing over the 10s. would make no alteration whatever, but it might have some influence with the Jury - I was told the prosecution should not cost me a farthing, it should be done at the City expence. I did not hear any thing said about the other two boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you wit enough to know if that top was silver, it would be worth all the money offered? A. I should think not - I should have tried the weight of it before I could judge the value; I will not swear I have not said I did not wish to prosecute, but do not think I used that expression - I do not think I said a word to Wright about the dressing-case before I purchased it; I suppose he was two or three yards from Duggan when I had the conversation about its being silver - the shop is very dark; Wright could not see Duggan, nor Duggan see Wright, at least I think so; I mean to say Wright could not see the transactions of Duggan, so as to be able to see the articles which were showing round.</p>
               <p>MR. MIREHOUSE. Q. Wright was in the pulpit? A. Yes, acting as auctioneer, and Duggan as servant; Wright was near enough to hear what Duggan said, and then he enlarged about it - I bought it in consequence of what Duggan said.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you speak to Wright respecting it, and tell him it was not silver? A. After I bought it I did; he said he was answerable for the acts of his servant - I never heard him say it was silver.</p>

            . I was present in the shop on the afternoon in question, when the dispute took place between Mr. Walton and the auctioneer, but not when the box was put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180076"></xptr>up - I had been in the shop a minute or two, when the prosecutor said to Wright, "Now mind you have stated, all the tops of the glass-stands in the box are solid silver;" he said that to Wright, and Wright said, "Oh, no" -Walton replied, "Why. you represented them to be so, and that induced me to purchase the lot" - Wright then said,"I only represented them as German silver" - I do not know what German silver is; I believe there is a distinction between German and common silver - Walton said, "If they are not as you have represented them to be, solid silver, I am taken in, and you must therefore refund my deposit"- Wright refused to return any money, saying the goods, were in fact what they were represented to be, German silver - finding he could get no redress from Wright, he turned to Duggan, and said, "Why, you represented that the articles were solid silver;" Duggan began to laugh, and said, "Oh, no, Sir, they are silver mounted" - Walton told Duggan immediately after, that he had not only stated them to be silver, but had guaranteed it - I understand the conversation to refer to all the tops distinctly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is your way of life? A. I am not at present in any regular business, and have not been so for several months - my mother was a laundress and mangler; her business came into my hands at her death; but I have since disposed of it - I held the concern about four months, and mangled - I have done nothing since - I have money to live on - my mother died about ten months ago, and I came into a little property - about seven years ago.

            , a dealer in fancy trimmings, and was seven years with him; I have followed the same business ever since I was fourteen years old; I never kept a shop - nobody employed me to go to this auction; I went to give evidence on this case, and was bound over by the Magistrate - I had looked into the auction-room, as other people do, to kill time, seeing respectable people there; for the last seven years I have lived with my mother, and conducted her mangling business - I am sure Walton charged Wright with representing the articles as silver, and Duggan also, both of them; I have been at the extreme end of the Court, and did not hear Walton's evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state before the Alderman that you heard nothing that Wright said? A. I do not remember answering such a question - I am sure I never stated to the Magistrate that I did not hear Wright say any thing; I did not distinctly understand the question before - I did not hear Wright represent any of the articles as silver.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SMITH. I am street-keeper of Cheap ward. I know the house, No. 96, and have been in the habit of seeing the prisoners there. Wright as auctioneer, and Duggan handing the things about, repeatedly; I have seen that gentleman (Mr. Genesse) with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long will you swear you have seen either of them at that shop? A. A long time back, but not long at this time, because the place has been shut up once; it has been a trunk-maker's since, and then it was re-opened - it has not been re-opened as an auction-room above two or three months, but had not been an auction-room for twelve months before.</p>
               <p>MR. MIREHOUSE. Q. Has it been going on ever since this transaction? A. Yes - I am obliged to drive the people away.</p>

            . I know the auction-room in Cheapside, I believe it is No. 19. I live in Howland-street, Fitzroy-square; I was at the auction-room on the 26th of December, and saw the prosecutor there; I do not recollect seeing Curtis there; there was a dressing-case put up for sale - this is such a case; I cannot swear it is the same - I heard Mr. Walton bid for it; I did not hear any thing pass on the subject of the tops - I was there half an hour before the case was sold; I do not know at what time the prosecutor came in; I did not see him pay any thing, as there were persons standing between us; I heard Walton say to Wright, "Are the tops silver?" or to that effect - I cannot be positive to the words; he replied, "I don't represent them as solid silver at all;" that was the first I heard; Walton and him seemed to have a dispute about it - I do not know what was said; I had bought six goblets, and had a very fair bargain.</p>
               <p>MR. MIREHOUSE. Q. Then there was a dispute? A. yes, but I did not hear what was said; I heard that he did not sell the case representing the tops to be silver - what had passed before I do not know; I heard nothing about German silver.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. If Duggan had said before it was sold, that the tops were silver, must you have heard it? A. Yes; I was close to the place.</p>
               <p>SAMPSON GENESSE. I know the auction-room in Cheapside; Mr. Martin is the proprietor of it - I am clerk there: Wright is an auctioner, and has a commission for what he sells - Duggan is the same; I was there the whole of the morning in question - I saw Mr. Walton come in; no observation had been made by Duggan on the subject of the tops being silver; if it had I must have heard it - Mr. Walton paid a deposit to me of half a sovereign; he came to me in about five minutes after, and asked if the tops were silver - I said they were not; he said he understood they were, and wished for his 10s. back; I said they were not mentioned as silver, and I should not return the 10s. - if I had he would have been glad to go away; he went out, and came back with a respectable person, whom I do not see here - he then wished for his 10s., and I said we would not give it him; I suppose the regular shop price of an article of this description would he about 50s.; it is rose-wood - it is cheap at 35s.</p>
               <p>MR. MIREHOUSE. Q. Had you heard 38s. bid for it? No; I am paid so much a week by Mr. Martin - he is not here - I did not interfere till the article was knocked down; the room was full.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you sure you heard all that the other persons heard? A. Yes; if such an observation had been made I must have heard it - Mr. Martin lives in the Haymarket, and has two auction-rooms; he has broken the bone of his thigh.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is your desk from the pulpit where Wright was? A. Close by the side of it; Wright could not have made any declaration from the pulpit that the tops were silver, without my hearing it - he never made a word of such a representation.</p>

I am a judge of such articles as this - the lowest price for putting together the materials would be 10s. - it is made of rose-wood, and the inside is cedar; the value of the materials wood be 6s. or 7s. - the veneering. lock, and brass, would be 7s. or 8s. more; the French polish, about 2s.; the lining, about 1s. 6d. or 2s.; it would be about 20s. altogether - I think the maker would sell it for 35s.; I am sure there could not then he more than 6s. profit to the master maker - I never made such a thing for less than 10s., and I have had 15s.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HASSELL. I am a cabinet-maker. This witness was my apprentice, and is a good workman - the lowest I should sell such an article as this (and that is a sacrifice) is 28s. or 30s.; I had 30s. from Mr. Jupp, and that is a sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you in the habit of making them? A. I have ever since 1790; I served my time to it - we call the tops of these Birmingham metal; they are plated - there is nothing but the standard silver, and these; these are like other plated articles.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is there a shop in Holborn for the sale of German silver? A. Yes, Mr. Edwards' - I do not know whether that is Birmingham metal washed with silver.</p>

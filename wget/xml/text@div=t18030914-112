I can only be positive to my own; I was absent from the prisoner about a quarter of an hour; I had had my own shilling for a week, and observed it many times, W being the initial of my Christian name.</p>

No; we got a constable, and he took charge of her; she was delivered to Mr. Clark, the marshalman, and searched; there was found upon her the shilling Gulley described, a bad shilling, and three more shillings; they were in a little box.</p>

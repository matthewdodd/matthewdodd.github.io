                  </hi>. I keep a cafe at 49, Tottenham Court Road—I have known the prisoner eight or nine months—I met him in Tottenham Court Road—he said "Would you mind discounting this bill for me; Eades is a friend of mine"—he produced a bill of exchange—I said "I do not can to do anything of the sort"—he said "It is all right, he is a friend of mine and has got plenty of money, and can pay you, and he will give you a sovereign for discounting the bill"—upon that he gave me the document and I handed him this cheque for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said "I will do it as a favour for you"—in July or August I again saw the prisoner—I handed him the bill and asked him to collect it for me as the acceptor was a friend of his—he said "All right"—a few days afterwards I saw him again—he said I have re<lb></lb>newed that bill for you again; Mr. Eades is not in a position to pay it; here is another sovereign for you"—that was for the renewal—he then handed me this renewed acceptance and a sovereign. (<hi rend="italic">This was a bill of exchange, dated 7th July, 1879, for </hi>15<hi rend="italic">l., drawn by J. R. Tanner upon and accepted by R. E. Eades, ivory-worker, 30a, Wharf Road, Islington Wharf.</hi>) This acceptance was returned to me dishonoured—I went and saw Mr. Eades, and about a fortnight afterwards I saw the prisoner in the street several times—I said to the prisoner on one occasion "That bill of Eades's is returned from the bank"—I cannot give the dates—I also said "I am going to see Eades to-day"—he said "It is all right"—one time I said "How is it that 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you collected for me has never been paid?"—he said "My wife took it out of my pocket and I will pay you as soon as I can"—he said nothing about the bill on that occasion—I gave my cheque for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. believing the statements he made to me to be true—I have not received payment of the bill, and it is very much overdue—I saw the prisoner about a week afterwards—I said "I have seen Eades, and he distinctly denies having written the bill or accepted it, or having given anybody else authority to do so"—he said "Eades told me to write the bill myself, because he had had a bad night, and I wrote it myself"—that was the first time the prisoner indicated that he had written the name or that he had been asked to do so—I said "I shall prosecute</p>

               <p>Eades"—I subsequently gave the prisoner into custody—Mr. Eades re<lb></lb>fused to pay me—the prisoner was taken to Clerkenwell, there was some question as to jurisdiction, and he was taken to Marlborough Street and subsequently sent for trial.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ivory worker—I have known the prisoner about eight years—the acceptance to this bill is not my writing—I never gave the prisoner or any one authority to sign my name to it—I know nothing about it; it is not like my writing—I did not in July give the prisoner a sovereign to take to Mr. Nicholls and ask him to renew the bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had one bill transaction with the prisoner about 15 months ago—he put his name to a bill for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to oblige me—he never had a penny of it—I have consulted him once or twice about business connected with the manufacture, and if a person owed me an account I would put it into his hands—he wrote letters for me—I am not aware that he ever signed my name; certainly not by my authority—I am under the impression that he has signed my name to letters in my presence and by my authority—when he called, my man, John Lampard, was present in 99 cases out of 100, and sometimes several friends were there, and perhaps Miss Parker, the young lady who does my cushions—I did not know Mr. Nicholls till he came and produced this piece of paper to me—I never signed a bill for the prisoner—we were very intimate friends—he is married, and has three young children.</p>

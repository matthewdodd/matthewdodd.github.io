            . I am an officer of the ward of Cornhill. On the 2nd of March I was on the evening duty, I saw a man with a shutter on his shoulders; I came up to him, I asked him where he got that shutter; he replied, from Drury-lane, he had bought it there. it was his property, he was going to carry it to Rosemary-lane. I told him I thought he would not carry it there to night, immediately he broke away from me and ran down Finch-lane; he threw the shutter down; I pursued him and catched him just as he was turning into Spread-eagle-court. I never lost sight of him; my fellow servant had possession of the shutter at the time.</p>

I went over the way<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110015"></xptr>to him, he had got hold of the prisoner with the shutter, he desired me to lay hold of the shutter, we conveyed him to the Counter, it is a door shutter. It was taken from Kings Arms Passage leading into Change-alley.</p>

On Sunday the 10th of October I had three pigs in my stye; I saw them safe between eight and nine in the morning; I went out in the forenoon; I was returning home between twelve and one; I met the prisoner a little way from my house with two pigs upon his back in a basket; I had not the least suspicion of their being mine; I went home at three o'clock; I went to look after my pigs and they were gone; then I suspected the prisoner; I ordered my men to secure him if he came again; he came on Monday morning and they secured him. I went to him in order to take him before a Justice; then he told me that two of my pigs were at Mr. Bannister's, and the other at Mr. Loft's; I went to both of them and found my pigs.</p>

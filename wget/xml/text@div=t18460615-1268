                  </hi>. I am one of the presidents of the London district of the General Post-office. In consequence of circumstances which, occurred on the part of the Post-office, I made an arrangement for posting twd letters at the Aldgate receiving-office—on the 19th of May I made up twd letters—I put inside one, directed to Maty Donahue, a half-somelgw and a shilling, wrapped in a piece of brae paper—I marked both pieees of com hi two places—it was addressed to "Mary Donahue, at Mr. D.V public house, Sackwell-street, Dublin, Ireland"—I gave thctt letter to Welcome Cole, inspector of letter-carriers, and at the same time gave him another letter, ad<lb></lb>dressed to Miss Coventry, Upper Brixton—I gave him directions what to do with the letters—if they had been posted at the Aldgate district receiving-house before eight o'clock on the morning of the 20th, they ought to hare arrived at the General Post-office about twenty or five-and-twenty minute after eight—I was in attendance at that time, on the morning of the 20th of May, at the Post-office—I examined the letters which came from the Aldgate re<lb></lb>ceiving-house about half-past eight—the letter to Miss Coventry was among them, on the top of the bundle of paid letters—the paid and unpaid letters</p>

               <p>were tied up separate—the postage had been paid on Miss Coventry's letter<lb></lb>there was no postage-stamp on it—the letter directed to Ireland I had put two stamps on—I did not find that letter among the letters from Aldgate—a bill accompanies the letters from the district-office—there was one that morning with these letters, giving an account of the number of stamped letters—I found the number of stamped letters corresponded with the bill—I immediately went to the post-office at Aldgate, taking Cole and Tyrrel with me—Mr. Davis keeps the post-office there—I found the prisoner there—he is his servant—I told the prisoner I belonged to the Post-office, and asked him who made up the eight o'clock collection that morning—he said he did—I said there was a money-letter posted there which had not been forwarded to the office—he said, "Oh, yes, I sent it; it was addressed to Miss Coventry"—he produced a memorandum-book in which the entry of the letter to Miss Coventry appeared—I said, "I want a letter which was addressed to Dublin, which wag dropped into the letter-box"—he made no answer to that—I then directed Tyrrel to search him, which was done in my presence, and the half-sovereign and shilling were found in one of his pockets—I immediately iden<lb></lb>tified the money by the marks—the letter was found on him, with the seal broken—this is the cover of the letter, and these are the coins I enclosed—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—the Right Hon. Edward Granville, Earl of St. Germans, is the Postmaster-general.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter-carriers in the London district-office. On the 19th of May I saw Mr. Sculthorpe mark the half-sovereign and shilling, enclose them in a piece of blue paper, and put them into a letter addressed to Mary Donoghue—it was delivered to me that evening—I dropped it into the box at Mr. Davis's receiving-house, Aldgate, on the morning of the 20th, about twelve minutes before eight o'clock—I took another letter at the same time into the shop, addressed to Miss Coventry, and placed it on the counter, with the money for the postage—the prisoner was behind the counter—I then returned to St. Martin's-le-grand—the letters from that office would be delivered to the carriers at eight o'clock, to bring to that office—I saw Mr. Sculthorpe examine the packet of letters which came from there at eight o'clock—I examined them myself—the letter to Miss Coventry was among them, but not the one addressed to Donovan—I then proceeded to the Aldgate post-office, and saw the prisoner searched, and the half-sovereign and shilling, arid the wrapper of the letter, taken from him.</p>

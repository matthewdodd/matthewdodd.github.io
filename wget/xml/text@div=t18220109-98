In the beginning of December, I was servant to Mr. Sowden, of Wanstead. I left my place on the 27th of December, between six and seven o'clock, and was on the road from Wanstead to London; I went into a public-house, at Stratford, to dry myself - it was a wet evening, I had my box with me, containing my clothes, it was a kind of band-box; I saw three young men and two women in the public-house, in company together; one of the men asked me to drink a little beer, which I did; I stopped there about an hour and a half - they all followed me out, the prisoner Bailey was one, he followed with the rest - one of them asked, if he should carry my box, Bailey was present, I let him carry it, they walked on till they got through Bow-fair-fields, with my box, the women walked with them, they all walked faster than I did - I never saw the box again till it was broken open; Bailey knocked me down in <placeName id="t18220109-98-crimeloc507">Bow-fields</placeName>

Soon after two patrols came up.</p>
               <p>Did you complain that they had ran away and stolen your box - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor that you had been knocked down - A. No; one of the witnesses brought me my box, it was broken open. I have got every thing but the shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where did you get the shoes - A. My sister gave them to me, she lives at Leightonstone, I was going from her to Cannon-street-road. I do not believe, that either of the prisoners intended to rob me.</p>

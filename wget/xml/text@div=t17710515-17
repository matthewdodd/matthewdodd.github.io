I ran out and saw the prisoner running, and several people running after him last Friday afternoon. I pursued him; he ran down Gravel-lane, as hard as he could, and several people after him; a man came out of the Black Moor's Head, when the prisoner was spent with running, and he was taken. I was present; he had this knife in his hand (produced a clasp knife) we carried him to the Poultry Compter, and there searched him we found this pocket pistol loaded with two slugs, and this watch we found in his breeches pocket ( producing them.) I ask'd him how he came by the watch; he said he bought it of a man in London. I took the watch to Sir

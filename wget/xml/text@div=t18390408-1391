                  </hi>. I am a brick-maker, residing at North Hyde, in Middlesex—on the 8th of April, between nine and ten o'clock, I was at a public-house at Hanwell—the two prisoners were there and another per<lb></lb>son with them—I went in to have a pint of beer—I had taken a £10 note from home and changed it—I had seven sovereigns with me and some silver—Hacket forced herself into my company—she came and sat along-side of me, and put her hand into my breeches—she said she would have it, whether or nay—I said, "Keep off, I don't want any thing of the kind"—we had a drop of beer together—I cannot say that I was exactly sober—I was rather <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>—I know she pulled me and mauled me about a good deal—after that, I put my hand into my pocket, and missed six sovereigns besides some silver—no other person could have taken it—she and the two men were gone then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hacket. Q.</hi> Did you not send me for some snuff, and give me some money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not a halfpenny—when I paid for a pint of beer, she saw the sovereigns in my hand, and she wanted to pick a few halfpence out from among them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the public-house. The two prisoners came there together—the prosecutor sat opposite to Gladman, and Hacket sat by his side—I saw her take very great liberties with him, and her hand was either in his small-clothes or his pocket—I suppose the pri<lb></lb>soners went out first, but I did not see them go—the prosecutor did not state his loss that night—I did not hear he had been robbed till the next morning—he staid at our house waiting for the arrival of his wife—he went home with his wife—he paid for what he had.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. He told me of his loss—on the Tuesday morning I went to Hanwell, and saw Gladman and an old man drinking with him—the men were pointing to Gladman about a pair of new shoes he had on, and a smock frock—he put up his leg, and said, "I should not have had them, if she had not worked hard last night for them."</p>

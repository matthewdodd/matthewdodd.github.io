On Sunday evening, the 14th of October, between nine and ten o'clock, I was in a house in Field-lane, sitting by the fire, in the back-room, ground floor, with a child on my knee-a woman, whose name I do not know, came in, and asked for a drop of water—the prisoner followed the woman in—I did not know him before—he asked her for some money or some gin—she said she had got neither one nor the other—he then took hold of her arm, and said he would break it if she did not give him some—she screamed out, and he knocked her down with his band—the table fell down, and the candle went out—Ann Ivory and Diana Owen were in the room with me—they picked up the candle directly, and lighted it—I said,</p>

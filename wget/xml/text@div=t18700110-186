I am the wife of William Bowers, and live at 70, King Street, Lambeth—on the night of 11th December, about 10 o'clock, I was in the side bar of the White Horse public-house, in Cornwall Road, Lambeth—the prisoner's wife is my daughter—they were there on that night—I heard my daughter ask the prisoner for some money—he said he had none for her, he wanted it all himself—I said to him, "Jack, it is very wrong of you that you should allow me to keep your wife and child, a poor woman like me;" I said, "I don't think so much of that as I do of what you have done, to spit in her face, and say she is only fit for a spittoon; had you done such a thing to me, I should have put it straight for you"—I then said to my daughter, "Come home, for he is a starving vagabond"—as I was turning out of the door, he caught me by the neck, and cut my</p>

I am a labourer, and live at 31, John Street, Cornwall Road—I was in the public-house at the time Mrs. Bowers was cut—the prisoner waft in conversation with her, and his wife was there—he made a jump from the corner where he was standing, and made a out at the same time—I got my left hand round his neck, and <hi rend="italic">collared</hi> him, and I saw the knife in his hand—I said, "What are you going to do with that?"—he said, "I was going to cut her throat, but I did not do it"—I did not see exactly what he had done to her, because she went out.</p>

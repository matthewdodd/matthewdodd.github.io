I went into the fore room to him, and said, such words were not agreeable to me, and desired him to pay for his liquor and go about his business. He seemed to be pacified for a while, but soon began again, and repeated words worse than before.</p>
               <p>Q. What words did he make use of?</p>
               <p>Moutlow. He was damning his present majesty.</p>
               <p>Q. Repeat the words he said.</p>
               <p>Moutlow. They were so many that it is out of my power. I went and took hold of him, and said, you rascal what do you mean by making use of such words as these? He immediately cross'd himself, and told me I was a thief, and his present majesty was a thief, and he was determined to shoot him if it lay in his power, that he had no right to the throne. I am resolved as far as in me lies to set Charley on the throne, for he is the right heir, and he was in duty bound to kill us all, he being a catholick, with a great many more expressions of the like nature; he damn'd the royal family, and said he'd shoot his present majesty on the throne, and that he'd destroy them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in liquor?</p>
               <p>Moutlow. I think he was not; but upon hearing those abominable expressions, I was in a great heat, so that I cannot be so good a judge as if I had been cool, or had been more used to him, having never seen him before.</p>

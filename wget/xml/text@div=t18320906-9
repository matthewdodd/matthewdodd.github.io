               <p>Wilson. Q. When you had the third pot of half-andhalf, did you not offer the landlord's daughter your watch to pay for it? A. No; I was not at all intoxicated.</p>

            . I am the landlord's daughter. I was backwards and forwards in the room - there were some chimney-sweepers there; I believe they were tossing up; I heard a noise in the room, went in, and saw Towers holding the prosecutor - I said, "George, leave the man alone;" he did so, and sat down; I turned round, and saw a watch, as I thought, on the floor - I said, "Young man, pick up your watch;" it turned out to be the case - Wilson and the young woman were then gone, but at the beginning of the evening the prosecutor certainly did offer me the watch for a pot of beer; I told him to mind his watch, or he would lose it.</p>

               <p>Wilson's Defence. When I met him at the City Arms he looked at me, and said he thought he knew me - I said I thought I had some knowledge of his features; he said it was not in this country; I said No - he asked where I came from; I said from the North; he said he came from some other part, and asked me to drink - I drank with him - he took me to a public-house; I had a glass of rum, and he had rum and shrub - we then went to the Cooper's Arms; he called for half-and-half; several sweeps came in - he asked them to drink, and after the second pot he asked them to sing - he offered his watch to pay for the third pot; she refused, and he was some time before he would give her the money; he then put his watch on the table; the men in the house told him to be quiet - he threw his hat up, and said he would toss any man for a pot of beer; a sweep tossed with him, and he said that man, Littles, cheated him; he struck him, and Littles went out; he then said he would fight anybody - nobody took notice of him - some sweeps came in; he struck them, and said they were the men he had been tossing with; Towers came to light his pipe, and he said he was the man who had tossed with him; he denied it - he said he would knock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060011"></xptr>his head off, and they began to fight; I went out, as I had some work at the canal tunnel.</p>

               <p>Towers' Defence. I took the young man out who he was tossing with, as he struck him: I went in again directly, and he said I was the man who had lossed with him - I said I was not; he said he would knock my head off; he struck me, and I struck him again - he then said he had lost his watch, and he would fight any man in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Ipswich; I am manager of the Provincial Bank of England, at Ipswich. The prisoner carried on business there, and at Stowmarket—he had an account at our house—he brought me this bill for discount—I am acquainted with his hand writing—the bill is not drawn in his hand writing—the signature is his—I am not acquainted with Mr. Gill at all—I discounted this bill myself, and had it in my hand three or four days—I did not discount it till I had made inquiries as to Mr. Gill's responsibility—the bill became due on 25th March—that was on Sunday—of course it was payable on the 24th—I saw the prisoner on the 23rd on the subject of the bill—he came to our bank, and requested us to retire this bill—he gave a cheque on his own account for the amount—I have the cheque here—at that time he had not funds in our hands to meet this cheque—he had overdrawn his account, but I considered it safe to take it—I had a very good guarantee—I took steps for detaining that bill—I sent word that night, and gave the London Joint Stock Bank instructions to pay it—if the London Joint Stock Bank had paid it it would not have gone to Barclay's—I presume the bill was at the London Joint Stock Bank—we transmitted the bill to our London office, but the London Joint Stock Bank pay and receive—we cannot pay or receive at the office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known thus gentleman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Many years—he was always an honourable man—that is his general character—he is a corn merchant—he had that guarantee about a fortnight or three weeks before this cheque was given, but that had nothing to do with this bill—the guarantee was for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should hardly say the account was overdrawn, till it exceeded the amount of the guarantee—the 255<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was expressly given by him to withdraw this bill, and and for no other purpose.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>at the time—I told him he must come to London to explain respecting this bill—I think he said he wished to see some friends, or to go home—I told him I could not allow that—I sent the railway porter for two tickets, and we came off by the train to London—when we were in the railway carriage, I said, "The bill is dated 21st Jan., for 255<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at two months"—he said, "I am not ignorant of the bill"—I did not tell him who I was till I arrived at the Ipswich station; when I arrived there I told him—he did not say anything particular; I think he said he had heard of my name.</p>

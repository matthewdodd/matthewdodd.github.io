                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective.</hi>) On 22nd February, I was with Child, about 11 a.m., and saw the prisoners at the corner of Old Change—we followed them; they stood opposite to a van there, and everywhere where vans were pulling up they looked at them—we followed them to Carey Lane, where several vans were standing, laden with goods—Morris stood at the corner of Carey Lane, and Haslam stood stroking the horse—the driver was engaged behind, unloading the van—an officer in uniform came by, and Morris gave a signal, and they walked into Wood Street, and round other streets, into Carey Lane again, and Morris resumed his former position, and Haslam got on the shaft of the van—a case of goods was in front of the van, and the driver was behind—a parcel fell, and the driver jumped down—Haslam jumped from the shaft, and the prisoners walked away together—while Haslam was trying to pull the things but, Morris was standing where he could see him—they then went to Wood Street, where a van was unloading, at No. 50—they walked round it; Haslam went on the near side of the road, and Morris stood right opposite—we had then watched them four hours—they remained there ten minutes or a quarter-of an hour, and appeared to be watching Swain the driver—Haslam went and spoke to Morris, left him, and came to the van, again jumped on the shaft, pulled this parcel off, and walked towards me—Morris ran past me—I pushed Haslam into a doorway, and said "Where are you going with that parcel?" and took him in custody—I found Morris at the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I was with Downs; his account is correct—when Haslam took the parcel Morris ran into Cripplegate Build<lb></lb>ings, where he stopped till I took him—he did not see me till I got close to him—this strap and apron were found on him, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.: and similar things on Haslam—they were wearing the aprons.</p>

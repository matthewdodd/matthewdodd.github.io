                  </hi>. I am shopman to Charles Hughes, and another, cheese<lb></lb>mongers, Edgware-road. On the 24th of Dec., about ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came there—I had not known her before, but I am sure it was her—I said to her, "A nice piece of bacon"—I saw her looking at it—I was then wanted to go out, but before I went, I missed her and the bacon—I went and overtook her about 100 yards from the shop—I told her she had stolen a piece of bacon—she said she had not—I took her by the shoulder—she came with me, and I gave her in charge of the policeman—he laid hold of her, and she dropped the bacon from under her arm—this is it—it is my roaster's.</p>

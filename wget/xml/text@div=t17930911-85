               <p>I keep a little clothes shop in King-street, Seven Dials; the prisoner brought the cloak to me about the 8th of July, about nine o'clock in the morning, or rather better; it was on a Monday, I knew her before, she had been at the shop buying trifling articles and I thought her a very decent well behaved woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her how she came by the cloak? - She said it was her own. I bought it of her for six shillings and six-pence, that was the full value; I think the trimmings are very much broke, the cloak is stained.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it found out you had it? - The officer was enquiring about it, I carried it up to the officer when I heard of it, and left it there.</p>

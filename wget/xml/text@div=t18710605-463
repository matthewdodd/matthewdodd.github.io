                  </hi>. I live at 3, George Street, Wentworth Street, and am a labourer—on Saturday, 20th May, about 10 o'clock, I was in Wentworth Street—I saw the prisoner, leaning against the wall, some yards before I got up to him—I knew him before—as I passed him, he put his foot out and knocked me down, face forwards—someone else came up, and held my shoulders—the prisoner put his hand in my trowsers pocket, and tore the pocket out—there was 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—he ran away after that, and when I got up, I could not see anyone—I spoke to a constable on duty—I went to the station-house about two hours after, and I picked the prisoner out from the middle of a lot of men—he is the man—I knew him before—I had a slight scratch on the eye; I don't know whether it was done then or not.</p>

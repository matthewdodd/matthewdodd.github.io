                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Baker, greengrocer, of 1, Berner's-street, Commercial-road East; we kept a chandler's shop at Chester-street, Kennington, the stock and good-will of which was sold for us, for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Mr. Mould—I received the 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him on Tuesday, 7th May</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185008190166"></xptr>
               <p>—there was a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note among the money, which I put into a little bag—on the following Thursday I went out, and pinned the bag of money in my bosom—we went to several places, and had some drink; and between four and five o'clock in the afternoon we went to Peter Paine's, at Brandon-street, Walworth-common—a Mrs. Allen was there, who is Mr. Paine's daughter, and the prisoner, who is a needlewoman, was there at work—I had tea with them;—I do not think my husband did;—he fell asleep—I had not taken my bag out from the time I went out in the morning—we had some liquor before tea, and sent a second time for more—I asked Mrs. Paine to lend me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or so—she said she would not—my husband awoke, and said I had got money—(I had not mentioned anything about having money before that)—I said I had money, but I did not want to take the bag out, for fear of an acci<lb></lb>dent—I then went to the bag—it was quite safe, as I had pinned it in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and the string was tied in a knot—I took the boy out, and could not undo the knot; Mrs. Allen undid it, but I had it in my hands all the while—I took a half-sovereign out, sent for some liquor, tied the bag, and put it back again—it was hardly a moment out—the prisoner was sitting at a little table in the room—Mrs. Allen offered to put it back for me, but she did not; she did not touch it—I left, with my husband, about half-past eight, went straight home, and went to bed, putting the bag under my pillow—I found it under my pillow at eight or half-past next morning, and missed the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—I imme<lb></lb>diately told Mrs. Paine, Mrs. Allen, and also Mr. Eden, who had bought our shop—I mentioned it all over the neighbourhood, and offered half of it if it was brought back—I got the number, and stopped it at the Bank—about ten weeks afterwards I went to the Secretary's-office at the Bank, and, in consequence of what I learnt there, after a fortnight, which it took me to trace out all the particulars, I went to the prisoner—I told her I called respecting the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note; that I had traced it to her, and found it, and had been and seen it—she said it was not her; I must make a mistake.—that she had heard there was only a sovereign reward—I said she must make a mistake, for my husband said he would give half of it—I said she had better tell me the truth at once—she said it was not her—I told her that Mr. Alexander, in the Walworth-road, said he thought he could identify her, and asked her to go there with me—she said she could not go till the next day, for she was engaged out to work, and they must come to her—I asked her to fix some time, and she said she would go on the Thursday, at three o'clock—I went on the Thursday, and said I had come once more, and I hoped she would go to Mr. Alexander's—she said she did not think she could come then, made a pause, and did not wish to go—I said Mr. Alexander said it was gloves that was bought—she showed me a pair, and said they were the only pair she had—at last she said she would go if I would wait—I said I could not wait—I went and fetched a constable, and we went to Alexander's.</p>

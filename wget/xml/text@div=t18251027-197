            . I am a constable, and live in Shore-place, Hackney. On Sunday last, about three o'clock, I saw the two prisoners passing my house. I had reason to suspect them, and followed them about fifty yards. I stopped Taylor, and saw something inside his waistcoat - I asked what it was - he said a plane, which he had found; I then saw another in his coat pocket - he said he had found that; I then turned to Reeves, and saw the handle of a file, which he said he had found. I took hold of them by the collar, and Reeves said he would not go back unless he was carried; he took hold of some pales; I desired two young men, who were going past, to loose his hands; I then took them back - and in Taylor's hat I found another plane - and in Reeves' hat a cap and a small bag - I asked where they got them - they said they had already told me, and they would say no more - the cap, Reeves said, was his own - that he worked in the Docks, and made use of the bag to carry his victuals in, but in about two minutes he said he found it with the planes in it. I then took them to the watch-house, and in Reeves' fob I found two duplicates.</p>

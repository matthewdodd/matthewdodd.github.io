                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Green Dragon-court—I have known the prisoner about 12 months—I was in a place in Farringdon-street, and he was in a place in Fleet-lane, and I knew him by his being there—about eight, or half-past eight o'clock, one night in Nov., I met him in Farringdon-street, and he said "Eliza, I have got this book to give you; me and Gorman has put our money together to buy it for you, to make you a present," and I took it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>, "Uncle Tom's Cabin")—I had it a fortnight or three weeks, and then, in consequence of what was said to me, I gave it up. Gorman was with the prisoner when he gave me the book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Leighton and Hodge, bookbinders, of Shoe-lane. Mould was in their employ seven or eight weeks, and had free access all over the place—this "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was in the possession of Leighton and Hodge to bind—I know this identical book, because it was sent to Routledge and Company, in Farringdon-street, on 6th Nov., and was returned to us, the cover having been put on upside down—I could speak to it in thousands—I did not see it again till Green, the policeman, showed it me—it is not unfrequent that books are bound so, and they are always returned—we never send them out again until they are rectified.</p>

I am a carpenter, living at Bridgewater—I remember the election of 1865—I was in the Golden Lion on the morning of the day of election, and I saw the prisoner there—I did not recognize the last witness—I can't say who let me in—I saw the prisoner in a room up stairs—he asked me what I wanted—I said I did not scarcely know what I wanted, and I said "What is it?"—he said "We are doing <hi rend="italic">tens</hi>"—I told him I should not vote for Mr. Westropp for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not offer me any<lb></lb>thing more, and he told Mr. Vezey he ought not to have let me in—I told the prisoner that I had told Mr. Vezey, before I came in, that I would not take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said "Won't you take it I"—I said "No, sir"—he said "Then you can go about your business"—I believe that was all that took place.</p>

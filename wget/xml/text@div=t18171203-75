On the 21st of November, the prisoner came to the stables (I knew him before) - He wanted a saddle-horse to go to kew. I shewed him several, none would suit-at last, I shewed him a tall bay gelding. It was about half-past ten o'clock in the morning-it was to be saddled, and taken to Charlotte-street, Blackfriars-road, by eleven o'clock. A shoe being loose, I was obliged to get it shod, which made it rather later than that time. When it was shod, I was taking it to Charlotte-street, and met the prisoner just as I had passed the Circus gate; he asked what made me so late? I told him what occasioned the delay. He wanted the horse - I asked him for the money, which is a customary thing - I asked him for 10s. He took some silver out of his pocket, and said he had but 10s, and would give me 9s., as he must have 1s. left to pay the turnpikes. He said, very probably he might not return until the next day, and if he did not he was to pay me 10s. more for that day, and 1s. that he owed me. Between three and four o'clock I had occasion to take two horses for sale to Smithfield. I had not been there long before Price, who was with me, told me that he saw a young man riding the horse up and down the market. I went up to the young man - He jumped off the horse as soon as he found what my business was, and said he would shew me the gentleman who had hired him to sell the horse. He took me to the prisoner, who had hired the horse. I asked him what he was about? he made no answer. After a short time I sent for a constable, and had him taken up. I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I never saw him before. I did not know his name until he was taken to the Compter. He was to have it for one or two days - He gave me 9s. He might have had it all that day and the next.</p>

            . I am a hackney coach-driver. I was in the stable-yard at the Obelisk. Simpson asked me to go to Charlotte-street with him. He met the prisoner by the Obelisk gate - He asked the nearest way to Kew; I directed him to go towards Vauxhall-bridge - He was on the horse at the time. I am sure the prisoner is the man. In the afternoon I went with Simpson to Smithfield; as I stood on the side, I saw the horse go by with a young man on it; it was without a saddle. I am sure it is the same gelding that was let to the prisoner. I told Simpson there was the horse that the gentleman had hired to go to Kew. I was on a horse at the time-Simpson followed me. I looked at the horse before he came up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner never attempted to go away. I heard him say something about selling the horse - He said the saddle was in the stable.</p>

            . I work at Dixon's Repository, in Barbican. I was not at work on the 21st of November, but was standing in the yard; the prisoner came up to me about two o'clock, and asked me if I could get a customer for a horse which he had no further occason for? I told him I did not know until I saw what kind of a horse it was. I asked him if he had it with him? he said, No; but it was not far off. I asked where? he said, "in Little Britain" - I went there with him to see it; it was standing at Robson's yard, at that place. He asked the hostler to let me see it, the hostler shewed it to me; the prisoner was in the stable with him, and shewed it to me. I examined it, and brought it to the door - I saw it was an old horse. I told him if he would let me take it to Smithfield market (it being market-day), that was the most<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030035"></xptr>likely place to sell it. He said, he would much rather I would bring a customer to the stable than to take it out. I told him, people would not be at the trouble to come to the stable to see it, horses being so very plentiful. He at last agreed that I should take it to Smithfield; and said, if I got a customer I should have 5s. for my trouble. He came with me into Smithfield, and said, he did not like to be stopping there till I got a customer for it, but if I would name any place, he would go and wait there till I found one. I told him the King's Head was the most genteel place. He went as if he was going there - I do not know whether he did. I got on the horse, and walked it once up and down, when one of the witnesses came up and looked very hard at it while I was on its back. I asked him if he would buy it? he asked if it was my own? I told him it was. He asked if I had bought it? I told him I was authorized by a gentleman to sell it, and it was mine while in my possession. He left me for a minute or two, and then brought Simpson to look at it. I told the young man directly that I would shew him the gentleman who employed me to sell it. One seized me, and the other seized the bridle. I went over, as if I was going to the King's Head, and saw the prisoner walking on the pavement outside the house. I told the young man that was the gentleman who employed me to sell it, and pointed to the prisoner. The young man said he was the person to whom he let the horse to go to Kew that day, and said he would send for an officer. The prisoner pulled out 4s. or 5s., and offered it to him not to send for one. An officer was sent for, and took the prisoner to the Compter. Simpson asked him for the saddle; he said it was at the stable. I took Simpson to the stable where I got the horse from, the saddle was not there-it could not be found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was an old bay gelding, worth about five or six guineas.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hired it from the prosecutor, of whom I have had horses before to go to the country, to settle some business in my way. I met the witness, and asked him what it was worth, and I would give him something for his trouble. He seemed anxious for me to tell him to sell it. I wanted to know what it was worth. He rode it about to try it, when the young man came up. I declare I never intended to sell it, I only wanted to know what it would fetch, to tell my friends, as I was going to sell one in the country.</p>

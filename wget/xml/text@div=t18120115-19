            . I am an officer. I went into the inn yard. The report was that Snow had lost his coat. I went into the tap-room, where the prisoner was eating his supper. I told him suspicion fell upon him: such a one had seen him in the yard, having the coat on his arm; he denied it, and laughed. I told him he might be made to laugh on the other side. I took him into the parlour, and searched him. I found these three gloves in the crown of his hat. I said I am sure these are Snow's gloves; he denied it at first; at last he acknowledged that he had taken the coat, and had run and left it at the Bull's Head, in Wood-street. I went there, and saw the coat. I then took the prisoner to the Compter. This is the coat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure it is my coat. These are the gloves that were in the pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

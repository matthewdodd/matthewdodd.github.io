I took the prisoner into custody, having received information respecting him—I took him to the station at Featherstone-street—I found on him five counterfeit crowns, concealed between the lining and the cloth at the bottom of his coat—they were wrapped in paper separately, so as to prevent their friction—I asked him if he had any more—he said, "No, you have got all"—I asked if he wished to give any account of them—he said, "No"—I have kept them ever since—they were wrapped in this paper—one piece was in each fold of the paper—I took him in St. John-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gun-smith, and live in Goldsmith-place, Hackney-road. I have known the prisoner six or seven years—on the 5th of Dec. I met him in Chiswell-street—I went into the Hind's Head public-house with him, and we had a pot of beer—while we were sitting drinking, he had a paper in his hand, containing a crown piece—he said he had got rid of some of them—I saw the crown, and I conceived it to be a bad one—I said, "How in the world do you get rid of them?"—he said he got a simple girl out of Vinegar—yard to pass them for him—I said, "For God's sake, don't have anything to do with them"—he said, "What can a poor man do?"—I asked where he got them from—he said, "From Westminster, at the back of the White Horse"—I left him there—he came out directly after me and my son—my son informed the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Legs, at Uxbridge. I remember the last witness coming to me with a shilling when I was in the kitchen—I looked at it—it was bad—my wife examined it, and we went in the bar and proved it to be a bad one, and called in a policeman—my niece put a mark on it—I took possession of it, and gave it to the policeman—this is the shilling (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—when the policeman came he took White, and gave me a charge to escort Simpson—as we were going along White dropped a purse into a gutter—I heard it drop, and saw the policeman pick it up, and he said "I expected to see that."</p>

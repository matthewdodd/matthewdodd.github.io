            's people; the first house we went to was Mr. Wollaston's, a distiller, there we were informed that the prisoner had changed a note; we found her at last at dinner at Stepney; when I first saw her there, she said she did not know me; as soon as she was taken into another room, she acknowledged that all the money and notes about her were mine; I found in notes to the amount of 320 l. 25 guineas in gold, and twelve half crowns, and a note of hand for 29 l. that she had taken up of some other persons.</p>
               <p>It is needless to ask you whether you had ever given her these notes? - No, I never had taken my pocket-book out.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was this? - Sunday the 25th of August, that I met with her; but I suppose it was the 26th in the morning when I went with her.</p>
               <p>Had you known her before? - Yes; but I had not seen her for four or five years; I have known her by sight these ten or a dozen years.</p>
               <p>And had occasionally been in her company before? - Not three times in my life.</p>
               <p>You had been with her? - In the publick room; the room I met with her in, there were fourteen or fifteen people in it.</p>
               <p>What was the place you met her in? - It is the Newcastle coffee-house, Saint Ann's, Soho.</p>
               <p>That is a coffee-house I suppose where both gentlemen and ladies resort? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Were you there before her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what company were you? - In none, I was sitting by myself.</p>
               <p>How might you be amusing yourself, was you drinking? - I had called for a pint of wine and water, I was drinking that.</p>
               <p>About what time did she come in? - About ten, I believe; I came in about half after nine.</p>
               <p>Was there any other company in the room besides? - About fourteen or fifteen.</p>
               <p>How long did you sit together in that house before you went away? - We did not sit together at first.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you scraped acquaintance? - I believe about three quarters of an hour; she was drinking with another man, and then came and sat by me.</p>
               <p>I presume you was polite enough to ask her to drink with you? - She might ask herself, but I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>The fact was, I suppose, that you did sit and drink together for some time? - She and two men that were there and I drank three pints of wine and some water.</p>
               <p>At what time in the morning was it you quitted this coffee-house? - Past two.</p>
               <p>Where did you go to? - Haddock's bagnio.</p>
               <p>Where is that? - In the Piazzas, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Then it was between two and three when you got there? - Almost three.</p>
               <p>In the course of the evening it is probable you asked her where she lived, and her circumstances<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110057"></xptr> and situation in life? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Nor did you know where she lived, and with whom she lived? - I heard her say that she lived with a counsellor named Leonard.</p>
               <p>She told you in the course of the evening that she lived with counsellor Leonard? - She did.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you where counsellor Leonard lived? - I found out next morning.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you she lived with him entirely? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In short, that she was in keeping by counsellor Leonard? - I imagine so.</p>
               <p>Did not your conscience smite you at all in this invasion of counsellor Leonard's property in the course of your walk? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>But when you knew this lady to be the sole property of counsellor Leonard, the fact was, you and she went together to Haddock's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you not at all in liquor? - No.</p>
               <p>Sitting so many hours drinking had not affected you? - We had three pints of wine and water; I had half a pint at first coming in, and I believe I had some cold beef for supper; it was half after nine when I came in, and I sat there till two in the morning, and there were four pints of wine; the last pint was between her and me, I believe.</p>
               <p>It was quite day-light when you awoke? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And had been day-light two or three hours; she had opened the windows to let in the light upon you that you might discover your situation? - She had done that I suppose to discover the breeches.</p>
               <p>She let the sun shine upon you; when you awoke, perhaps you went in search of this lady at counsellor Leonard's that morning? - I called at the lodging where she lodged, and saw the man; I understand his name is Leonard.</p>
               <p>What time did you call there? - I believe before seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you find Mr. Leonard at home? - He was a bed, I suppose, for he opened the door, and had not got his cloaths on.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you and he had some conversation together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was the first place you had been at in the morning? - The first place I went to, was to a man that was in company to know where she lived; it was her lodging, as the man supposed, but it proved to be this man's.</p>
               <p>You and Mr. Leonard had some conversation about the matter? - O yes, I told him the whole affair as I have told you.</p>
               <p>Who were in company with her at Stepney? - Some people that I do not know.</p>
               <p>Then there were some people that heard what passed upon your coming in and charging her with this? - There might be five or six there; they were all at dinner.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Did any thing particular pass there? - She was sitting at dinner; the constable went in; I said, that was his prisoner; he took her and found these things upon her.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Have not you known her eleven years? - I may have known her so long ago.</p>

I said I was going to receive some money of that woman, if he would change the 50 l. note, I would pay it; she put the cash in her pocket; I gave her captain Percival's note, and that would not satisfy her without a receipt in full; Mr. Wollaston's clerk gave twenty guineas out of it; I wrote

               <p>So a 50 l. note was changed at Mr. Wollaston's, and a 20 l. at Mr. Smith's? - Yes, Mr. Smith gave her sixteen guineas, and I lent her 3 s. because she would not change any more gold; then I said I would come home; she insisted that I should take a ride with her somewhere; I said our two-penny brewer lived at Stepney, I should like to go there: at Aldgate pump we bought two fowls; when we came to Mr. Harding's, we ordered the fowls to be got ready; we rode in the coach to near justice Sherwood's, there we had a bottle of wine; my husband paid for it, and while we were at dinner she was taken up: I never saw her without plenty of money, and had no reason to suspect her.</p>

               <p>(It is read as follows.)</p>
               <p>My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I solemnly protest, before God and you, that I am perfectly innocent of this charge, this being the first time in my life that I have been at a bar or in prison, charged with either crimes or misdemeanors, not even for debt: my lord, on Monday the 25th of August, Mr. Leonard, a gentleman I have lived with two years, went out, I went to many places to enquire for him; at last, on returning home, I went into Mr. Hall's, where I had never been before; it is a place I had heard Mr. Leonard mentioned once he had been at; the woman I enquired of did not know him, but said, there was company in the parlour, I might go in and see; I went in, Mr. Wynter said to me, where the devil have you been all this time, and pulled me on the seat near him, to drink with him: my lord, I had known him eleven or twelve years, in the course of which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110060"></xptr> time, whenever opportunity offered, he continually solicited me for favours, but without success, the reason of which was, a servant of mine some years ago cautioned me against him as a bad man; and though he often came to my lodgings, he was continually denied admittance, nor in the whole time could he court me to his bed: my lord, our conversation turned on the very servant who had so often warned me against him as a man of bad character; as I lived very near, and had the key in my pocket, I staid till past twelve, when every body being gone, except the prosecutor and me, I thought it time to go home to Mr. Leonard's; upon going out, I said, good night; he answered, you shall not go, you shall go with me; I told him I must go home, No, by G - d, you shall not, there is something for you, giving me a case, you shall sleep with me at Haddock's; I felt in the case, which was of leather, without string, lock, or clasp, and felt bank papers in it; I put it into my left pocket, he having my right hand under his arm; I suffered him to take me where he pleased; we went to bed, I awakened in the morning, I got up, opened the curtains of the bed and the windows, I saw it was light; I got up, dressed myself, opened the door, called the waiter, and went out: I went up James's-street to Cockran's in St. Giles's, to enquire for captain Percival; that was a house I knew he frequently went to; it cannot be conceived, were I guilty of such an act as I am charged with, that I should have gone to the very spot I was so well known in; I pulled out the case and examined it, and upon Mrs. Cockran's asking me whether I had that from the captain, I told her, No, but I had slept with a gentleman in the Garden, who had given it me; I made no secret of the money I had received; I had many sums of money from captain Percival; I mentioned his being indebted to them 29 l. I have lived with him near eight years, and have almost always paid his bills; I was seldom without bank notes; I told them I would pay his bill if they could give me cash for a bank note; they could not, but proposed going to the distiller's; they afterwards proposed dining at Stepney, where I had never been; I complied, upon condition that they would return with me to Covent-garden; so conscious was I of my innocence, that I did not want to avoid the place: before dinner was half over, two men came into the room, and said, they wanted me; Mr. Wynter came in, and said, that was the lady; they desired me to go into the next room, I did; they searched me, and took from me the case containing what I thought my property; I told them I was made a present of it, that some I had in my pocket was mine before he gave me the case; they took all from me, and took me in a coach to Bow-street; and I was sent that night to Bridewell: on Wednesday I was brought up again; Sir

             asked me if the property was Mr. Wynter's? I said, none of it; my reason for leaving the prosecutor when I saw it was day, was, that I had been told by many women, particularly that servant, that in order to seduce a woman, he would give any thing, when in the morning he would always take it away again, alledging that he could not be so great a fool as to give so much for a night, though that perhaps might ruin the woman for ever: I took the case without knowing the contents; had there been 1000 l. in it, I should have taken it for my own; I went away because he should not have an opportunity of forcing it from me when he awoke; and therefore he was resolved to swear I robbed him.</p>

I should have known them all in six months; I said, she seldom went out, and I always forbid her to mention where she lived, for I disliked visitors: I asked where he met her, he said, at Hall's in King-street, and then we went to Haddock's; d - n me, yes, I believe she had the book before we left King-street; he asked me if she could read and write?

               <p>So you did not say to Mr. Wynter, aye, she has often picked my pocket? - Not that I recollect; I believe I did not say any such thing, for I had no reason to say it.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not say it? - I will, to the best of my recollection that I did not say it.</p>
               <p>To Mr. WYNTER. Whether you said to the last witness that you believed she took your pocket-book from you at the house, and that you gave it her; you have heard what Mr. Leonard says? - I have.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell him that you gave these bank notes to the woman? - No; Young went with me, I knocked at the door; when he opened the door, the first man that spoke to him was Young, he called him by his name, and said, he wanted to speak to him; said Young, I have not seen you some years.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time tell him that you gave the prisoner the pocket-book? - No; I told him the whole fact, that she had picked my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell him that you thought you had lost it at Hall's? - No; I told him she had picked my pocket, in the manner I have now told the court.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say that she was gone to France with it? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give a different description of the notes than you have now? - No, never; when I got to Sir

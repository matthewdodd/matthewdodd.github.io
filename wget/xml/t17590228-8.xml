               <p>Swain. I was not sober nor quite drunk, I had been drinking a little with my customers.

               <p>Swain.

            . I happened to be drinking at Mr West's in Newgate-market, on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning; there came in the prosecutor with his face all over black, he sat down and called for a pint of purl, or beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober?</p>
               <p>Jackson. He was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his face appear dirty or done with blows?</p>
               <p>Jackson. It seemed to be the smut of a chimney.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with him ?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No: after he sat and dozed about half an hour, Mr West came and shook him, and said, Sir, you must not sleep here, you had better go to bed; he fell to dozing again, and in about five minutes after, I saw the prisoner's hand in his pocket; he awaked and took hold of the prisoner's arm, and said, your hand was in my pocket; then I got up and said, I saw his hand in Mr Swain's pocket; then Mr Swain said he had lost four or five guineas, he did not know which; then the prisoner pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and pulled out of his breeches pocket four guineas and a half and a sixpence. I saw when the prisoner's hand came out of the prosecutor's pocket it was clinched.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he asked how he came by the four guineas and a half?</p>
               <p>Jackson. He was: but would give no account at that time: but before the Alderman he said he had it from the proprietors of the St George or Royal George privateer; that he had got a hundred pounds to receive there besides that: he had another hearing before the Alderman, then he brought a woman to prove she lent it him; she would have swore she lent him five guineas the Saturday before, and that he lived in her lodgings; the Alderman telling her the heinousness of her crime if she should forswear herself, then she would not swear it, and said she did not lend it him.</p>

            . This was at my house in Newgate-market, about two o'clock on the Wednesday morning; Mr Swain came in with his face all smutted; he sat down in a box near the prisoner at the bar, who was drinking punch with another man. I saw Mr. Swain dozing, I went and awaked him, and desired him to go home; after which, I went into the bar, and in about five minutes time the prosecutor arose up and said, the prisoner had his hand in his pocket. I came and took hold of the prisoner, and said, Let me see what money you have: he took out four guineas and a half, and put them into my hand; I kept my hand close and ask'd Mr Swain what money he had lost? he said he had lost five guineas; I said, can you remember any particular pieces? he said he could remember he had a bran new half-guinea of the date of 58; I opened my hand to Mr Swain, and said, here is the money which he put in my hand, which was four guineas and a half, the half-guinea was an old batter'd one. I desired him to look at it, he did, and said he believed he could remember two of the guineas, but was not positive; I returned the money to the prisoner as he said it was his own, and call'd in the watchman that was just without my door, and the prisoner was sent to the watch-house, and Mr Swain went with him, and what happen'd after I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr Swain before ?</p>
               <p>West. I have seen him several times, he comes into my kitchen often.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>West. I was; there Mr Swain said he remembered the last house he had been at, a person had blacked his face, and that he had four guineas and two half-guineas in his pocket, and that he had given one half-guinea to a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this on the first or second examination of the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>West. It was on the first examination before Sir Crisp Gascoyne.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>When Mr Swain was before the Alderman, he asked him how much money he had in his pocket, and whether he was sure he had the money when he went into Mr West's house? he answered he was not sure; the Alderman ask'd him, what house he went into? he said he had been in a tavern or bagnio in Covent-Garden; the Alderman ask'd him if he had a girl in his company there? he said he had: the Alderman ask'd him if he had been concern'd with the girl? he hardly denied it; he said, after he came from thence, he went in at the Wheat sheaf behind St Clement's church; he came in at Mr West's with his face all black. and very much in liquor, and sat down in the box by me; I was with a gentleman that is a manager of a ship, I wanted a birth to go abroad. The prosecutor started up, and said, you have had your hand in my pocket; you have my money in your hand; and said I should be searched; I put my hand in my pocket and took out what money I had, and put it into Mr West's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jackson. Did you hear the prosecutor say he had been in a house in Covent-Garden with a woman, and had given her half a guinea?</p>
               <p>Jackson. He said he had met with a young woman, an acquaintance of his, and they went into a tavern; he said she was not a woman of the town; he said he lent her half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. You have given no account of this half-guinea?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had two half-guineas in my pocket, the one a new one of 58, on the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the other?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not; it might be an old or a new one, for what I know; and on that day (I mean Tuesday) I received 2 l. 7 s. for a piece of shalloon, and 3 l. 2 s. of Mr Brown in Grace-church street; out of this money I gave

               <p>Q. When did you divide it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I was in the room with the woman, after I had given her the half-guinea; then I put the gold in one pocket and silver in another, and then went to the Wheatsheaf behind St. Clement's church, and there spent the evening, and staid 'till about one o'clock; there I was sleepy, and a gentleman there put some black spots on my face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between the woman and you after you had put your money into your pocket?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, nothing at all, only bidding her a good-night, and then came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not lose your money at the Wheat-sheaf?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was with none there but gentlemen of credit.</p>

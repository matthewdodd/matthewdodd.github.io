                  </hi>. I am a fireman employed on board a steamboat On 31st Jan. I was coming from my work in the East India Docks, with Thomas Sheen, and a young man named M'Carthy; they are not here—we were near a paper stainer's shop, in Bluegate-fields, when M'Carthy was struck under the ear with a snowball; we both turned round, and saw a man running into the paper stainer's shop—I cannot swear whether it was the prisoner or not, or whether it was the man who threw the snowball—M'Carthy ran after the man into the shop—I saw the prisoner in the shop and another man, who I imagine is one of the paper stainer's men, and M'Carthy; there are four or five steps—I stood on the bottom of them, and heard M'Carthy say to the prisoner, "You b——vagabond, if I knew it was you who struck me with the snowball, I would give you a dig under the ear"—I stepped in to prevent them fighting, and the prisoner said, "You b——b——, I will fight a pair of you"—he <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> hold of M'Carthy and me, and pulled us both down the stairs; I had gone up to make peace between them—he and M'Carthy did not fight, but they were collaring each other—I told them to <hi rend="italic">drop it</hi>—when they got in the street, they began to fight—I said, "It is a shame for you to fight with M'Carthy, because he had his hand broken not long since"—two other men laid hold of me, and there was another one fighting with them—some one cried out, "The policeman is coming," and then they all ran away, and we went on our way towards home without another word—when we came close to Cannon-street, I looked behind, and saw a large quantity of people coming towards me—the prisoner came up to M'Carthy and said, "You b——vagabond, it is you who struck me with a tin bottle on the nose, I will be revenged on you"—I said, "For God's sake <hi rend="italic">drop it</hi>, you will get into trouble"—he was determined to fight with M'Carthy and Sheen—I said, "I am an old man, and do not like fighting, but if you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> fight, I will fight you," because M'Carthy had had his hand broken—I tried all I could to stop them—when we got further on into Cannon-street, near the railway arch, I saw the prisoner come towards me, and could see the blade of a knife in his right hand, by the light of the gas—I think it was a shutting knife; there was a crowd of people after him as he ran towards me—Sheen <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Murphy, mind the knife"—I tried to avoid his stabbing me in the chest or belly, and tried to catch his arm—he grasped my shoulder with his left hand, flung his other hand over his head, and struck me as hard as he could between the shoulders—M'Carthy and Sheen lifted me up—I felt something dropping in my inside, and said, "For God's sake put me down"—I was taken into a druggist's, to have the wound dressed, and then in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the hospital; it was about 6 o'clock in the afternoon—there were gas lamps and lights in the shops—I had six articles on, and was stabbed through them all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital. I examined the prosecutor there on 30th Jan.; he had a punctured wound between the fifth and sixth ribs, extending into the chest, and penetrating the lungs—it was a dangerous wound—the width of this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) corresponds with the width of the wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at the corner of Cannon-street, and saw the prisoner and two men holding one another and struggling together—when they let the prisoner go, he said that he was choked—a gentleman undid his handkerchief, and I pulled it off; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he ran after the men, and I saw him put his hand into his breast pocket, but did not see anything in his hand till he ran and made a thrust at the man—the man turned round, and the prisoner put his hand on his shoulder, and as soon as he had done it, I caught hold of him, and he fell across my knee—I do not know whether he was pushed, or knocked, or whether it was the force of the blow—he fell back, I caught hold of his arm, and this knife dropped from his hand to the ground—I saw him drop it; it was then shut—he dropped it about a minute after I had seen him strike at the man—I did not see him shut it—I picked it up, wrapped it up in the handkerchief, and afterwards gave it to a policeman.</p>

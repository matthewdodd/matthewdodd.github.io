                  </hi> I live in Kingsland-road, and am a glass-cutter, in the employ of Thomas Millington, of Bishopsgate-street. On the 20th of March, the prisoner came to me and wanted some sheet-lead—he wanted 5-lb. lead—I said I had no 5-lb. lead, we had 4-lb. lead, but I was not going to cut it unless it would do—he had produced this order—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. Kingaby, builder, Lea-bridge road, and Morning-lane, Hackney, will feel obliged by Mr. Millington getting him cut out the undermentioned pieces of lead, for cisterns, by ten or eleven o'clock this morning, when his man will call for it on his way to the job.")—I dealt with Mr. kingaby, of Lea-bridge—I sent him things occasionally—I believed this order came from him, and gave the prisoner some lead, believing it to be written by Mr. kingaby, or on his behalf—the prisoner was alone—he went away with the lead.</p>

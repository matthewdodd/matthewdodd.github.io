                  </hi>. I live at 3, Parker-street, Drury-lane, and am a porter in Covent Garden Market—I have lived with the prisoner as my wife for about three years—about two in the morning of 31st August, I was standing at the comer of Parker-street, the prisoner passed by me, and made a kind of jeer at me—I let her pass, and passed by her afterwards—I went down Drury-lane, and stopped about ten minutes—she came back, ran across the road, and struck me—she made a second blow—I put up my hand and found something running down my chest—she saw the blood and ran away, and I after her—I ran across the road to where she threw the knife down an area—she fell down, and I caught hold of her—I saw her throw some<lb></lb>thing from her left hand—a policeman came up, and I was taken to the hospital, where I was for four days.</p>

Q.</hi> How old is she? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I cannot say whether I have been living with her since she was sixteen—I used sometimes to be two months with her, and sometimes three months—I saw nothing in her hand, and do not know what she struck me with—I had had no quarrel with her, but I had not been with her for a month—I did not live happily with her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 116 <hi rend="italic">F</hi>). I was on duty, and heard cries of "Murder!"—I saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner on the ground, and bleeding profusely from the chest—he said, "This woman has stabbed me in the chest, and thrown the knife in the area"—I took them both to the station, and found the knife in the area at about half-past 5 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Why did you not find the knife before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because it was dark—when it got light I saw it—the large blade was half shut, just as it is now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Charing-cross Hospital—Collins was brought there on 13th August, with a punctured wound on the chest, which had been previously dressed by the divisional surgeon—it had been made about au hour—I suppose this knife would produce such a wound—it was not dangerous, because it did not penetrate to the cavity of the chest—it was an inch and a quarter deep, and was between the third and fourth ribs—he is quite well now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Could it have been done with the corner of the blade when shut? No, it was a punctured wound—it only penetrated the flesh in an oblique direction upwards.</p>

               <p>go back to my parents—they live in Drury-lane—I quarrelled with the prisoner sometimes, when she called me names, but the last time was through drink—she has threatened to leave me many a time—I did not ask her to come back to me just before she stabbed me—I have no idea why she stabbed me; she never spoke to me—she only laughed and jeered at me—I never struck her—we had no scuffle or words—when she struck me, I told her she had better go home or I would have her locked up—I did not take the knife from her, because it was dark, and I did not see it, or know that she had it till I found the blood running down my side—I am not living with any girl now; I live with my sister in Pitt's-place.</p>

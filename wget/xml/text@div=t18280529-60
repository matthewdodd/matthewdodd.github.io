             there; the prisoner said he came to vindicate his character, in consequence of a report being spread that he had taken away some of my property; he said he had taken some iron by the desire of one of the persons employed on the premises, and was going to take it to his own house; I said I had better send for an officer, and while the man was gone for him, the prisoner attempted to run away; he then went on his knees, and said if I would forgive him he would tell me all about it; I told him not to say anything to implicate himself; he said, "I took the iron - it is of no use denying it" - he said he did not wish to implicate other people; he said he had sold it at an old iron shop close by, and directed us where to go; the officer and I went and found it there - I know it to be mine.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NEEDES. I met the prisoner in Paddington on the Monday, with some iron on his shoulder; I asked where he was going - he said to Wingrove's who serves my master with gravel; I told my master of it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was discharged from a master; I was out looking for work, and found this iron in a field, tied up with a cord; I never took it off the premises; I went to an iron shop with it; the man was not at home - the woman said it was worth nothing, as it was all burnt iron, but if I would call again I should see her husband; I went and saw him - he asked where I got it; I said just over the bridge: he gave me 3s. 6d. for it.</p>

               <p>Are you clear it is the same will? - Yes, I am, to the best of my remembrance, she came and said she had a will to prove, upon looking at it, I perceived she was not the excutrix.</p>

               <p>What name did she give you? - I am not certain whether she told me her name.</p>
               <p>How came it you did not ask her what her connection with the executor was, or any thing about it? - I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Have not you a recollection then? - I think she told me that her husband was a creditor.</p>
               <p>Did she say that her husband was the executor? - No, she did not, I believe, she said her husband was the attorney of the executor, the I told her it was necessary her husband should come himself; I dare say I asked her name, but I cannot recollect I did, all that I recollect was that her name was Murphy, but I am not sure to the christian name, because I always called her Mrs. Murphy.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she tell you that her name was Murphy? - Yes, I believe she has told me so; I do not recollect the time, but in the course of the business she told me her name was Murphy.</p>
               <p>During any part of the transaction afterwards, did you see the other prisoner with her? - I have since that time.</p>
               <p>Did they pass as man and wife then? - I always understood and looked upon them as man and wife.</p>
               <p>When you told her that she not being the executrix of course could not prove the will, what did she say? - I do not recollect what she might say, I suppose she might say she would bring her husband.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not suppose, tell us what she said, tell us what passed on the occasion, what you said and she said? - I think at the time she came and offered the will, I finding she was not the executrix, I enquired I suppose -</p>
               <p>Court. You must not suppose about it, tell us what you know and no more? - Perceiving she was not the executrix, I naturally asked her if she had not a husband.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ask her that? - I am not certain, but think from the nature of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250076"></xptr>business I must, I told her when she told me that her husband was the attorney of the executor and was a creditor, I am sure she told me that, I told her he must come and take administration with the will annext, as the attorney of the executor; she told me at the time her husband had a power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Did any thing else pass between you by way of question, from your observation from her where the executor himself was? - I made enquiry after the executor, I am not sure whether she said he was at sea or in Ireland, it was either one or the other, I think it was in Ireland.</p>
               <p>What more passed between you at that time? - I believe nothing more.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she leave the will with you? - I have it not in my recollection whether she did or not; she came in a day or two with Mr. Landy who was my clerk at that time, he spoke to her, I did not see her, I did not see her some time after that, for Mr. Landy did the business; several times afterwards I saw her again.</p>
               <p>Did any thing particular ever happen at any of the times subsequent when you saw her? - No, I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>Did any thing pass between you and him? - I do not recollect any thing.</p>
               <p>What did he come for? - He came at different times afterwards, finding a caveat was entered by two proctors.</p>
               <p>Had you yourself in consequence of this, taken any steps in the business? - No, I did not take any steps.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any thing that ever passed between you and Timothy on the subject.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever heard the husband say any thing about it, one thing or the other? - I have several times since the administration was got under seal, the husband first came, in some time after her application to me, it was before administration was granted.</p>
               <p>Did the husband when you first saw him come with the wife or not? - That I do not recollect, it is so long ago I cannot tell, I have seen him at different times with her and without her, but the first time I do not recollect whether he came with her, or without her, he came the first time about this business, I do not recollect what he said.</p>
               <p>When was the first time you heard him say any thing about this? - The first time, I cannot recollect the exact time, but I recollect that he, upon representing how the business was to him.</p>
               <p>At the time you are going to speak of now, did he come with the wife or alone? - He came so often that I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>I want to know when he first interfered in this business, and said any thing to you about this will, or whether he ever did? - Several times, but he came so often I cannot say whether he came alone, he came oftener alone, sometimes with his wife.</p>
               <p>When did you first understand from himself that he had any thing at all to do with this will? - It must be some short time after the wife first came to me, but how long I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Then when you understood that he had any thing to do with this will, what did he say about it? - I do not recollect the words that he said.</p>
               <p>Can you tell nearly, can you tell the exact particular part of what he said? - He asked me once who the parties were that entered the caveat, I told him.</p>
               <p>What did he say to that? - I told him the nature of the proceedings in our court in those cases, and upon that he told me to warn the proctors to the caveats.</p>
               <p>Did he himself make use of that expression? - I told him the nature of the process of our courts; accordingly the proctors to the caveats were warned.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the husband Timothy ever tell you what he had to do with this will? - He appeared as the attorney of the executor.</p>
               <p>Did he produce any power of attorney? - He did produce the power of attorney in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250077"></xptr>my office, I have not got it, there is a gentleman who has it, who is a witness, I saw it afterwards, I did not see him produce it at that time.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any talk with him about that warrant of attorney afterwards? - Not in particular any more than as the attorney of the executor, I was to warn the other proctors to the caveats, and assign a time to appear before the court accordingly; I do not recollect whether I appeared that day on the court day or not myself, but both proctors were assigned to exhibit proxies as the proctors for the creditor was to exhibit affidavit or shew bond; accordingly after the form of the court, there was a proxy exhibited by Timothy, authorizing me to appear as proctor.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect about when that was? - The date of it will shew.</p>
               <p>Did you take any step yourself when you was apprized of the caveat being entered, did you enquire at all into the ground why a caveat was entered against this will? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Did you do the business yourself or your clerk? - I was ill at the time and the clerk did the business.</p>

             had been the first time was it that this power of attorney was produced? - Some few days after; then the prisoner Timothy came and Philip was with him once or twice, but whether Timothy came alone that time I cannot say, I have seen them altogether repeatedly; they gave proper instructions that a proxy should be drawn.</p>
               <p>Is that the proxy, and are you a witness to it? - This proxy is of my own engrossing and executing.</p>
               <p>Did you see Timothy execute that? - I cannot recollect positively, it was some little time after this proxy was signed.</p>
               <p>Are you in the habit of witnessing things that you do not see signed? - We see them signed, but we do not take any particular notice of the parties.</p>
               <p>Court. Then all that you know is, that you saw somebody sign this? - A Timothy Murphy did sign it; to the best of my belief it was the prisoner, but I cannot swear positively, because there was another person, Philip; I should know

               <p>Had they any business at that office, but relative to this will? - No other that I know of; I left his service almost immediately after that proxy was signed; he has no clerk now that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. Then understand that you cannot swear positively that the prisoner was the person that signed this? - I cannot; I can swear positively, that I have seen Timothy at that office, but whether or no he signed this proxy, I cannot say.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was clerk to Messrs. Bishop and Weller, I have seen both the prisoners before at the office of Messrs. Bishop and Weller several times.</p>
               <p>Upon what occasion, and upon what business was it that you saw them? - A caveat was entered in the month of January. 1786; in May, the same year, Mr. Jenner entered a caveat also; and about two months after that there was a caveat entered, they both brought in their wills.</p>
               <p>Which will did the prisoners both or either of them bring? did they bring you any will? - I cannot say, we were not for them, we were for a creditor, Ryan.</p>
               <p>Upon what occasion was it that you have seen the prisoners, or either of them? - By reference from Mr. Christian, I believe they were referred to me from Mr. Christian.</p>
               <p>Did they come to you? - Several times, some times together, and sometimes otherwise.</p>
               <p>When you saw them separate, what was the business they came upon? - About the business of Ready.</p>
               <p>In what character? - As the attorney, I fancy.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not fancy, tell us what they said? - If you will give me leave, I will tell the circumstance; Mr. Christain, I believe, was arrested by some of his creditors, and he was under confinement for some considerable sum, during this confinement I believe Mr. Jenner declined proceeding, the prisoners came with a power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Did they produce any power of attorney? - The power of attorney which I have brought, this is it.</p>
               <p>Who produced that power of attorney? - They were both together.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you know this power of attorney by? - I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Then you are sure that is the one that they produced? - Yes, I then told them that I should do nothing; I went in to the register, and looked at the will, and the appearance was not very well, and I told them I should do nothing for Mr. Christian, or them in business, unless I was satisfied it was a fair and proper will; and I told them there had been a great many frauds, and bad wills that were brought, and I should do nothing without I was satisfied; they told me they did not know whether it was a fair will or no, but there was one of the witnesses in London, but it had been delivered to them by a man who had made a power of attorney to them.</p>
               <p>Were they both together then? - Yes, I believe they were; I did not prepare a warrant till I was satisfied in my own mind that the will was proper, and had been inspected before it bore the seal of the office; still I suspected it; some time after this, they brought a person who said he had witnessed the will; I asked him a great many questions about it, I did not shew him the will, but I asked him to wrote his name.</p>
               <p>Were the prisoners present? - I cannot say particularly that they were, but I could almost venture to say that they were, because he could not know where to come without them; the man wrote his name to this paper.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot receive that as evidence against the prisoners, what he said; when you are sure the prisoners were present you may tell us. Were the prisoners both or either of them present, when you had this conversation with the witness? - I should rather think so.</p>
               <p>But you must be sure of it; will you swear it? - I may venture, I think, with safety so to do, I cannot say; I know I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250080"></xptr>a long conversation with the witness, and I will tell you his answer.</p>
               <p>Court. No, we cannot hear that? - I am sure that one of the prisoners brought the man to the office.</p>
               <p>But was either of the prisoners present, and in the hearing of that conversation? - I should not choose to swear positively that they were.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I cannot hear what he said? - In consequence of this I 
               <persName id="t17880625-82-person697">

             that warrant.</p>
               <p>Is that warrant signed? - It is signed by the Surrogate and the Notary, I was not present when it was sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Did you send Mitchell with the parties? - I rather think Mitchell did not attend the swearing; I rather think that one of Mr. Christian's clerks did.</p>

               <p>Court to Davidson. Have you any other plate than one for seamens wills? - They are always left in the possession of Mr. March.</p>
               <p>Was any one repaired at that time? - Only one.</p>
               <p>Is that the one? - I cannot take upon myself to say.</p>
               <p>To March. Did you send that plate to be repaired? - No Sir,</p>
               <p>Who did? - Messrs. Mount and Page, I cannot say whether this is that that was repaired, I have had it in my possession these five or six years.</p>
               <p>To Gale. Have you a doubt about it? - I have not a doubt but this is an impression from this plate in the state it is in at present; it appears to be a repaired plate, here is a mark in the plate that has been done by some accident, and the motto is wrong, it is officie instead of officii.</p>
               <p>Court. Then this is the very same plate that was attempted to be proved here before on another trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Yes, my Lord, it was, and it failed.</p>
               <p>March. I do not keep in memory when we send our plates to our employers.</p>
               <p>How long have you had that plate in your possession in the state in which it now is? - I believe four or five years.</p>
               <p>Can you say that it was not longer than that? - No, I do not think it was longer.</p>
               <p>Have not you had it in your possession nine years? - I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>To Gale. When did you alter the plate? - I do not know when it was altered, if it is the same plate, it was the 2d of April, 1783, but whether this is the same plate I cannot say.</p>
               <p>To Davidson. Had you ever any altered but this? - We had but one, I can't recollect the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Court. We tried at it before.</p>
               <p>What became of the plate that was altered? - It was repaired and was sent to Mr. March.</p>
               <p>Mr. March. I have had the plate I dare say four or five years, I have had no other will plate but that, I really cannot say how long I have had it.</p>
               <p>To Davidson. Was it sent to Mr. March when it was repaired? - That plate which was repaired went to Mr. March.</p>

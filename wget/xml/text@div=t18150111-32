I pulled out the key out of the door, and put my ear to the key hole; I heard footsteps running up and down stairs, I could not tell which; there was a lad going past; I desired him to go to the public-house about twenty yards distance, to get me assistance for there were thieves in the house; the lad went a contrary way. I was returning back to go and get assistance myself; I heard the door unbolted; I immediately returned back; I met two men coming down the steps of the door way; I held the lanthorn up to their faces, and asked them what business they had there The first that came out was not the prisoner. I immediately seized him by the collar; the prisoner drawed off to my left hand side; he took something out from under his coat, I thought it to be a pistol, it turned out to be an iron crow, it had green baise cover over it.</p>

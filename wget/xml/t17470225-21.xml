             go out with this Parcel under his Coat; I ran immediately to the Parcel, and I missed one of those Parcels; I followed him immediately after I missed the Parcel; I ran out after him, but I was afraid I should lose other things; I did not take him immediately, I went and loaded my Waggon, and afterwards I went in search after him, and last Tuesday Night I took him at Hick's-Hall Gate, then he owned the Fact.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you charge him with?</p>
               <p>Turney. I charged him with stealing two Pounds of Tea; I told him if he would tell me where it was, or pay me for it, I would not hurt him; so he desired to go up Stairs; and he said, will you not hurt me? I said I would not; then he confessed he had sold the Goods in Fee-lane for 6 s. I told him, George, I will not hurt you, if you will tell me where it is: and he told me that he sold it to a Woman in Fee-lane for 6 s. one Part of it, and the other Part he sent into the Country.</p>
               <p>Q. Any thing else?</p>
               <p>Turney. We went before the Justice, and he said before the Justice he had taken it, and sold it for 6 s.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be that Tea?</p>
               <p>Turney. I can take my Oath of it, because I brought the Parcel out but about a Quarter of an Hour before.</p>
               <p>Court. You have informed us in the Course of your Evidence, that you would not hurt him; how came you to endeavour to get his Confession in that Way, and then set up a Prosecution? You got his Confession at the Breach of your own Word, which should be sacred to every Man.</p>

               <p>Q. to Turney. Did you see him take it off the Truss?</p>
               <p>Turney. I did not see him take it off the Truss; but I saw it under his Coat.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say?</p>

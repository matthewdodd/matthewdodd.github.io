On the evening of the 7th Feb. the prisoner came for a pennyworth of apples; I served him, and he gave me a sixpence to change—he appeared tipsy—I was frightened at him, and gave him the change before I looked at the sixpence—when he got to the door I tried the sixpence on the counter, and found it was bad—I called to the prisoner; he did not come back—I went to the door; there were some boys outside; I asked them to stop him—they met a policeman, and gave him in charge—I gave the sixpence to the policeman; I had not parted with it before—this is it.</p>

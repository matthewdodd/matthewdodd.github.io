               <p>Q. Did you employ Mr. Davis to bring any road stuff to you in October last in his cart. - A. I did, the cartage came to sixteen shillings. The prisoner drove the cart, I paid him seven shillings, and five shillings afterwards on account to his master; he called on me about a fortnight afterwards, on a Saturday evening, he said, if I would pay his master the four shillings, he would give me the twelve shillings, and I might pay it all to him; he said, his master was at the door at the time.</p>

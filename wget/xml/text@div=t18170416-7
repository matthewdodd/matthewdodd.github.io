I went down stairs, but found no marks of violence on the door or shutters; I called up Phillips, who was my apprentice, and told him that I had been robbed, and could not see where any person could get in. I charged him with the robbery, and he was secured. The check was given on the partnership account, for 295l. 17s. 6d.

            . I was apprentice to Mr. Want; I had known the prisoner, Yates, about six weeks, and Gregory and Rouse, about three days before the robbery. About four weeks before the robbery, the prisoner, Yates, asked me to go to a public-house, in Wild-street, with him; he gave me something to drink, and then asked me about robbing my master. I told him that the property laid in a box in the back room, and that there was more money there sometimes than there was at others; it was then dropped for some time. A little before Good Friday night I met him, Gregory and Rouse; they got two ladders to rob the house, on Thursday night, but the watchman saw them tying the ladders together, and they could not commit the robbery that night. I was not with them, but I came out to get a pint of beer, and Gregory told me of it; I saw them with the ladders, but was not with them when they were disturbed; I saw them again the next evening, it was then agreed that when I went in I was to leave the door open; the servant let me in, and told me to shut the door, I said I would, but left it open - I only pushed it to. I went into the parlour and got a light, and then went down stairs, when I came up I found Rouse in the house. I had left them all three together. I sat in the parlour sometime, and then went to bed. About one o'clock my master called me up, and said he had been robbed, and that I must have done it. After sometime I told him how it was. It was agreed, before the robbery, that I should meet them at the White Hart, in White Hart-yard, at half-past twelve o'clock. I told my master of it, and he watched. I went, and in about ten minutes after I got there, the prisoners, Yates and Gregory, came in. Yates took me into the back yard, and shewed me a 10l. bank note, and said we had better come and have our shares of it; we then went into the house, and the constable came in and took us into custody. I afterwards went to the Three Tuns, in Monmouth-street. and saw the prisoner, Rouse, going in at the door, and the constable took him. My master was with me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. I returned to my master's house about half-past eight o'clock, and left the door open. I have nearly served seven years of my apprenticeship. I have told the truth. Yates proposed the robbery, and asked me where the property lay. I served my master truly until that time. I never robbed him before. I did not disclose it till I was taken. I told it to save myself. It was agreed that I should leave the door open.</p>

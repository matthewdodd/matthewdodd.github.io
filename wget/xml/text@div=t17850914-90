               <p>The prisoner came to my house the 11th of August last, to enquire for some silk handkerchiefs, we shewed him some; he desired me to take down some cotton handkerchiefs that were behind on a shelf; and while I was taking them down I rather suspected him; and he bought a cotton handkerchief, I put it into a paper; I suspected he had taken something, and I saw a silk handkerchief in his pocket, the corner was out; I missed the handkerchief, he ran out and I ran after him to a passage just adjoining my house; I said, hark you, my friend, and he ran and he dropped the handkerchief, and I laid hold of him and the handkerchief; he had not run three yards before I saw him drop the handkerchief, I took it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140124"></xptr> up; he said a lady had put it into his pocket.</p>

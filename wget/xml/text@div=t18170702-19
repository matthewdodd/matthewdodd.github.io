            . On the 22d of March last I sent the prisoner to pay 22l. 8s. into my banker's; among it was 20l. note - I gave it into his hand myself. He left the room, as I supposed, to go there; he entered it previous to his going out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was on a Saturday morning, about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not four o'clock - A. Certainly not-it was before twelve o'clock. I did not ask him to let me see the banker's book. I did not go out of town that evening. There was money in his hands to answer any necessary purpose in the office.</p>

            . I refer to the waste-book. There is no entry of money received on the 22d of March-there was 100l. paid on the 29th.</p>
               <p>MR. FROWD. There was 100l. paid in on the 29th of March. I do not know who took it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I thought you said you always entered the name of the person who took the money - A. I think I sent it by another person. I made the prisoner enter the 22l.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not seen the entry in the book should you have known that he took it - A. Yes, I should. I remember giving it to him when I received it, independently of my book.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The money was paid at the office. I entered it in the book-it was not paid till four o'clock. Mr. Frowd sent the boy out, and when he returned it was too late to send it to the banker's.</p>

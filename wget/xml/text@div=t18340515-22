               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got into company with two young men, and they took me to the play. When we came out, I got intoxicated - they took me to a lodging, over the water, and robbed me of all the money but half a crown. I was so frightened that I made up my mind to go to Liverpool, where I got into a comfortable place. I then came to town, and got a place at Mrs. Logan's.</p>
               <p>MRS. LOGAN. I live on Tower-hill - the prisoner lived with me, and was a very honest boy - I would take him again.</p>

               <p>Q. What else passed between you and him? - A. I asked him how many he should want, and he said a considerable quantity; I then told him it would be necessary he should leave me some money, which he said he had no objection to; he would take all I could procure him; he left me 420 l. in Bank-notes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a Bow-street officer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you applied to by the prosecutors for the purpose of apprehending the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it? - A. On the 10th or 11th of February last.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you did in pursuit of the prisoner? - A. I first went to Bristol, by the direction of Messrs. Robarts's house; I made enquiry there, but I did not find the prisoner; I then went to the Post-office, and in consequence of the information I obtained, I went from there to Andover; I got some information, and from thence I went to Basingstoke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any information of the prisoner there? - A. Yes, I went back to Whitchurch, and from thence to Market Hilsley, between Newbury and Oxford.</p>
               <p>Q. At Market Hilsley, did you come up with the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him? - A. In the Oxford coach, going to Oxford; I addressed him by his name, Hansard; he said his name was Hansard; I told him I wanted him, he must come out of the coach; he seemed very much surprised, but got out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this? - A. On Wednesday, the 15th of February; I took him into the public-house where the coach was standing; I asked him for his money; he asked me at what suit I apprehended him, I told him it was for forgery; I asked him for his money, he pulled out a purse with upwards of 40 l. in gold; I asked him for the remainder. After some hesitation he told me he had left 420 l. with a friend in Coventry-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention that friend's name? - A. Not at that time; I believe he did afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether he did or not? - A. I believe he did, and 2001. he had sent in his saddle bags from Whitchurch the night before, directed to a friend in Eastcheap, and a letter at the same time, desiring that friend might send it to Messrs. Robarts the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at all say what the money was composed of that he sent, whether notes or money, or what? - A. I cannot charge my memory; he said he had no doubt they had received it before the time of my apprehending him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any thing from him? - A. I took upwards of 40 guineas in gold from him, and a pocket-book, in which there was some writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you looked at the writing at all (produces<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110020"></xptr>it); Does it contain any thing relative to this? - A. I believe it does. (It is read).</p>
               <p>January 28th, Left Goldsmids, engaged a passage to Jamaica. February 2d, Paid J. Bennett 7 l. a loan. 9th, A very narrow escape for my life; slept at Brentford. 11th, Slept at Andover. 12th and 13th, Slept at Salisbury. 14th, Slept at Whitchurch, Hants. 15th, Hilsley Fair, 26th August.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you look into the pocket-book immediately after you had apprehended him? - A. No; it was two or three days afterwards; it has never been out of my possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Is it exactly in the same state in which you took it from him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else to you? - A. I do not recollect any thing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he express any astonishment at being found? - A. He was very much surprised; he said, from what had happened, his friend having sent back the 420 l. and the 200 l. having been sent to the bankers; he did not suppose they would have troubled their heads in sending after him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say the signature of the note is not your hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say that from the want of resemblance to your hand-writing? - A. No, from finding my account was overdrawn; it resembles my hand-writing very much, but I can swear I never signed it, because I did not know any person of the name of Chapman; I applied to the bankers to know why they placed it to my account.</p>

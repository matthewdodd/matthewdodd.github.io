I am the prosecutor's mother, and live with him—on the evening in question I was in the bar-parlour, and hearing a noise I got up and went into the bar, and my son had just turned the prisoner's brother out, and he was going away—the prisoner came behind my son and collared him—my son directly said, "He has got a knife in his hand"—I saw him make a job with the knife, and I collared him—I saw my son's hand bleeding very much—the prisoner came back to the bar, and Mrs. Cook said a "You vagabond, you have stabbed the landlord"—he said, "And what if I have; you gave me the knife"—my son said, "Oh, let him go into the tap-room if he likes"—he had said he would go in and finish his supper—an officer was sent for and he was given into custody.</p>

I am a surgeon at Deptford-bridge—on the evening of 27th September Mr. Cook came to me, about 7 o'clock—I examined his hand and dressed it for him; he had a wound in the fleshy part, between the thumb and forefinger; it was bleeding very freely; I had some trouble to check the bleeding in order to dross it—it appeared to be about an inch in length and nearly half an inch deep—it was in a very dangerous part; there is a fear of lockjaw from wounds in that part.</p>

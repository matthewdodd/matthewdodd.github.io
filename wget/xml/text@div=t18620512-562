                  </hi>. I carry on business at 20, Old Fish-street, in partnership with Thompson, Heppenstall, and Limer, wholesale stationers—on 8th March, the prisoner called at our warehouse, and pro<lb></lb>duced to me this order, signed by himself, "Edward Clarke, 15, Eversholt-street, Camden-town:"—"Messrs. Thompson, Heppenstall, and Limer, for Wiseman and Collier, 12 reams of common, one hand, 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 3 reams of double S. hand, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., double column; 3 reams of 18 to D. crown, same quality as samples. If you will get this ready to-morrow we will call for them, Yours truly, Edward Clarke. P.S.—Also the samples as promised"—in consequence of his handing me that order, I directed the goods there mentioned to be delivered—at that time I believed that they were for Wiseman and Collier as that represented—previously to that we had sent</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186205120101"></xptr>
               <p>one other parcel of goods to Wiseman and Collier—they carry on business at 15, Eversholt-street, Camden-town—we have done business with them once before; about ten days before the 8th of March—the prisoner came down to the warehouse and ordered it himself—I knew Wiseman and Collier from their being in the stationery trade—I knew there was a Mr. Wiseman and a Mr. Collier—there is no doubt that there is a Mr. Wiseman and a Mr. Collier—I have seen them both; one of them is here—when the prisoner gave the first order I made inquiries to satisfy myself that Wiseman and Collier were a firm in the trade, and the goods were delivered—I believed at the time that they were for Wiseman and Collier—I should certainly not have parted with those goods if I had believed that the prisoner was taking them on his own account—to the best of my belief these two letters of 18th April, inclosing the two halves of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, are in the prisoner's hand-writing—(<hi rend="italic">These letters were dated on 18th April, 1862, from Stockton-on-Tees, stating that the prisoner had sent the two halves of a </hi>5<hi rend="italic">l. note, in part payment of goods he had, which were charged for Messers. Wiseman and Co., and that a post-office order for the amount should follow; and asked the witness as a favour not to call for the money till he returned from his journey, and also not to let them know that he had the goods</hi>)—on receipt of those I placed the money to the credit of Wiseman and Co.—I refused altogether to have anything to do with the prisoner in the transaction—I repudiated him altogether till I received that letter—I did not kaow that I was dealing with anybody but Wiseman and Collier.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You say that I brought that order in my hand on 8th March? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw you on 8th March—I believe you brought that letter—I saw you when the goods were delivered; we had a glass of ale together—I had a glass of ale with you before at Chelmsford—you were very tipsy then—I was not—I asked you were Wiseman and Collier's place was—I had heard of them before—I knew them from having had dealings with Messrs. John and Edward Sanders, two or three years ago—I received the letters with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note on 19th—we sent Messrs. Wiseman and Collier a statement, taking off the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we applied for it between the 18th and 30th—I cannot tell the date.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean by taking off, giving credit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; if I had received the post-office order on the following day, I should have placed that to their account—Wiseman and Collier said they knew nothing at all about the first order—we have applied for payment, and they have refused to pay—our clerk applied on the following Saturday, the 3rd—I think I never saw the prisoner after he wrote that letter—there was a letter came after<lb></lb>wards, on the 1st or 2nd of May—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—(<hi rend="italic">This letter was dated from 19, Eversholt-Street, Camden-town, and stated that the balance of the account, </hi>3<hi rend="italic">l. </hi>16<hi rend="italic">s., would be paid on the </hi>3<hi rend="italic">d; that he was sorry that the witness had told Messrs. Wiseman and Collier about the goods, and that he was going to set up in business for himself</hi>)—Wiseman and Collier gave the prisoner in charge first—I gave him in charge at Bow-lane Station—I forget the date—it was at Wiseman and Collier's request—I am sure of that—I knew at that time that he had left their service.</p>

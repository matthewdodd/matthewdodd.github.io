            ; the prisoner was my servant, and has been a number of years; In consequence of information, I went with Mrs. Sallwood, and Mr. March, to Mr. Sabine's, the Crown and Anchor, in King's-head-court, Shoe-lane; we saw Mrs.Sabine; we went up into the prisoner's room, and on a sort of bedstead, we found a quantity of charts and maps; there was one of them that he had been at work upon, and another, that had rough edges, not in a state in which they are when they came to my shop; they were not trimmed round; they were damp, and appeared not to have been out of the warehouse two hours; these are the charts of the British channel, which are very large, and are folded up in a small compass; whereas those which come to my shop, are trimmed round the edge, and as smooth as marble, fit to show a gentleman.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these charts, or any such, ever suffered by you to be taken to his lodgings? - A. Never.</p>

               <p>Q. Would these charts, in the state before they are prepared for sale, be in that damp state? - A. No; they are always put upon the line to dry; here are live books of directions for sailing, which are printed for me, and which I believe to have been taken away from my warehouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not engage him to take work home for his wife and himself to do, for you? - A. Some time ago, I did, some few trisling charts; but never did I suffer any of these large charts any where, but in my own warehouse.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been in the country yourself; who conducted your business in your absence? - A. My partner, and his son.</p>

               <p>Q. What there conduct towards the prisoner might have been, you cannot say? - A. I am sure they would never suffer these sorts of charts to go out.</p>

               <p>Q. You have sold a vast number of these sort of things? - A. I have.</p>

            ; I keep the Crown and Anchor, in King's-head-court; the prisoner at the bar lodged in our house, and has done three months: On the 23d of October, Mr. March, Mrs Selwood, and Mr. Whittle, came to our house, and I shewed them up stairs, the prisoner had been home, and gone again; he went up, he had been gone again about a quarter of an hour; when I went up stairs, I saw these things found.</p>

               <p>Q. They were in his room? - A. Yes, upon a bed sacking, where there was no bed; and his great coat upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Any body might have gone in, and seen these things? - A. Nobody went into the room, but him and myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not the servant go in to make the bed? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I do not admit the taking of these things away, but times are very hard, and I had but a very small pittance; I did not take them with any view of defraud; I had only sixteen shillings a week, out of which I allowed my daughter eight shillings a week to learn a business, and that made me take them, with a view of making a few shillings upon them, till a friend came to town that I expected to assist me.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18001029-37-verdict207" type="verdictDescription">

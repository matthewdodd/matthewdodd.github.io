                  </hi>. I am an engine fitter, and live at the Sailors' Home, Whitechapel—on 13th April, about three in the morning, I was at the back of Dock Street, and saw the prisoner—he asked me where I lived—I said, "That is nothing to you"—then he asked me for some tobacco—I put my hand in my pocket for a stick of tobacco, and felt in my other pocket for a knife to cut it, on which he knocked me down, put his knee on my chest, and put his hand in my trousers pocket—he wanted to pull my purse out, but I held it tight—he got it from me and ran off—there was five or six shillings in it, a half-crown, and some small silver—the police ran after him—this is my purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had never seen him before, but there was a lamp, and I saw his features well.</p>

               <p>Court. But he did not do that at once I suppose, tell us all that passed between you? He had often asked me for them, and I told him I could not give them to him, because my mother would be angry.</p>
               <p>How came the buckles in your hand? - I was going to put them by.</p>
               <p>What in the back yard? - No, Sir, I had them in my hand.</p>
               <p>So he took them by force, and carried them away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay, with you that time? - Not ten minutes.</p>
               <p>What did you do about the loss of these buckles? - About a fortnight afterwards, one of his comrades wives told my uncle of it, and he told my mother, and then went for a warrant.</p>
               <p>Court. You got a warrant, after your mother knew of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You need not go any farther on with this I believe gentlemen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer T</hi>). I received instructions and took the prisoner on 4th June—I told her that the charge was marrying a man named Lloyd, her first husband being alive, and asked her whether her name was Margaret Dudley; she said "Yes, but my name is now Murphy, I have not seen my husband for the last twelve years, and I do not know and do not care where he is"—on the way to the station she said "I am very sorry for what I have done"—when the charge was read over to her she said "I have heard that my first husband, Murphy, was married about six years ago to a woman, and that they went to America; I am very sorry for what I have done."</p>

I live at 2, Kensington Buildings, Earl's Court, and am a chimney-sweep—I now know Daniel Murphy, he is a coachman—on 1st July, 1871, I married the prisoner as Margaret Dudley, spinster—this is the certificate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not know that she was a married woman—I saw Murphy last Sunday week, he lives at Twickenham—the prisoner has not been with me when I have seen him—I also produce a certificate of the marriage of Daniel Murphy from Somerset House—I compared it with the register there, it is correct—the prisoner said, when I produced it, "That is all right"—she did not read it, she cannot read—the inspector read it to her—she lived with me about five months; I then challenged her with having been married before, and she said that I had got to find out—I did find out, and she said that she had not seen her husband for twelve years.</p>

I live at 5, Park Mews, Notting Hill—the prisoner is my sister—I was at Bristol in 1850 or 1851, and saw her living there with a man named Murphy—I know that she was living with Murphy at Twickenham in 1860, and I never saw him after that; she went down to bury her mother, at Bristol, and when she came back he led her a dreadful life, and she was obliged to leave him, and has been maintaining herself in London as a cook.</p>

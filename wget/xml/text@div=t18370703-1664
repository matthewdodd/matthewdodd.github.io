                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Hardwidge, and live in King-street, Cheapside, and the lodgings. Some time in May, the prisoner came to me, and asked if I had a spare bed—I told him I had—he engaged it—next morning, he told me he had come of London from Oxford seeking a situation—I kept my cash-box in a drawer in the bedroom he slept in—he went away on the 15th of may—on the even<lb></lb>ing of the 14th of May, I went into the bed-room, about half-past ten o'clock, to take something out of cash box—when I had taken what I wanted there remained on in sovereigns and some silver, and two foreign coins—one</p>

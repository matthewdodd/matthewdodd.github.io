               <p>woollen-drapers on Ludgate-hill. On the afternoon of the 8th of December, the prisoner brought this order to our shop, and left a pattern of cloth which I have here—I have a customer of the name of Foster—the prisoner did not succeed in obtaining the goods, but I gave him into custody imme<lb></lb>diately—the order requests me to furnish three yards of cloth, the same as the pattern—I have other orders which I have executed, which seem to be in the same hand-writing, both the signature and the body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employ. I remember the prisoner coming and presenting the order—Mr. Peeke asked him his name—he then took the order to the lower end of the shop, and while he was gone I said to the prisoner, "Are you Mr. Foster's man?"—he said, "I am <hi rend="italic">the</hi> errand-boy," or errand-boy—I cannot be certain whether the article <hi rend="italic">the</hi> was named—he having the appearance of manhood, I thought it singular he should call himself a boy, and I said, "You do not call yourself a boy, do you?" but he made no reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Pray, how long was Mr. Peeke away with the order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say five minutes, and in that time the prisoner and I were talking—he did not say he was an errand-boy, on my oath—I was examined before the Magistrate—I believe what I said was read over to me, and I signed it (<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—this is my signature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say there he said he was an errand-boy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I recol<lb></lb>lect saying to the Magistrate at the time, errand-boy, or an errand-boy—I have just said I cannot say exactly as to the article—if I recollect, at the Justice-room, at Guildhall, I did not recollect the word an being repeated—I see it now, but at the Justice-room the word an was not entered into—I should not think of looking into an article of that kind—he told me he was errand-boy or <hi rend="italic">the</hi> errand-boy—he plainly gave me to understand he was Foster's errand-boy—it is impossible to recollect every word a customer lets out of his mouth, but I say it is one and the same thing—I do not recollect that the words an errand-boy were read over to me—he said he was errand-boy, or something of that—from what I recollect he said he was errand-boy.</p>

                  </hi>. I was foreman to Mr. Foster at the time this transaction took place—I left on the 13th of December—his name is John Gilson Foster, he lives in High-street, Aldgate—I know the prisoner by seeing him in Hitchcock's shop—I was purchasing goods there at the time he came</p>

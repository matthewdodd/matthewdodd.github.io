            . I am a newsman, and live nearly opposite the prosecutor. On this night week I saw the prisoner and five others parading before his door, and watching his house - I watched; one of them went into the house and bought a candle, and when he came out he put it into his pocket, and buttoned it up - the prisoner then went into the shop, and bought a candle; he came out with that in his hand, and this bundle of wax candles under his arm -I went and asked him where he got them; he said he had been in the shop and bought them - I took him, and the the others all ran off.</p>

               <p>EDWARD ALEWOOD. I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner, and have the candles.</p>
               <p>MR. FREEMAN. These are my candles, and are all marked; I was in the shop, and served the candles - I missed this parcel about five minutes after they left.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The candles were taken in Leicester-square, and I was taken near St. Martin's church.</p>

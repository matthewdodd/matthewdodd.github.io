            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. In consequence of information, on Tuesday, the 23d of July, I went to the house of Guest, between one and two o'clock, and found him at home - it is a private house. I told him what I wanted; he unlocked a small trunk in the first floor back room, and produced a cream jug. He made no objection to my searching, but assisted me. The trunk was not concealed at all. In consequence of what he said, I called at Joseph's with a search warrant - I did not see him; he was afterwards summoned to attend the office, and came on the 24th, and was confronted with Guest. Guest was committed on the 24th, and discharged on the 27th, when the case was gone through and the prisoner was committed, I produced the cream jug - it was doubled up rather more than it is now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Did you produce your warrant - A. Yes. He knew I was an officer; I should have opened the box if he had not. He lives in Crown-court, Soho. The box was on the first floor; there was a bed there, but it was not under it. I searched the prisoner's house, and found nothing suspicious. He was a witness against Guest at first, and denied having sold them to him; he was afterwards bailed, and has surrendered to-day.</p>

            . At the time of the robbery I lived in Crown-court, Little Pulteney-street. I have known the prisoner about a year and a half, he was a salesman and dealer in wearing apparel and plate, and lived in Chandos-street, Oxford-street; and keeps a shop. The officer searched my house; I gave him the cream jug; I bought it with the other property of the prisoner. He came to me on Monday, the 15th of July, between seven and a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening; I live up stairs; the street door is always open, but there is a centre door. My wife and daughter were present when he came.

             worked for me at the time, he has absconded now; I have done all I could to find him out, but cannot. I was called down from my workshop, by my wife or daughter, to the prisoner, in the room on the first floor; he had a bundle with him, and said he had some second-hand plate that would suit me - he produced it - it consisted of a teapot, cream ewer, seventeen tea spoons, two egg spoons, a dessert spoon, two dessert forks, and one pair of sugar tongs, weighing together 44 oz. all but 2 dwts.; I considered I had no occasion to ask how he came by it. I agreed to give him 5 s. 6 d. per ounce, which amounted to 12 l. 1 s.; I gave him twelve sovereigns and one shilling; my wife was present when I paid him, but I am not positive whether my daughter was. I only had the milk pot when the officer came, having sold the rest; I had not sold the ewer because there was a crack in the handle, which I did not perceive previous to erasing the crest, and it was unfashionable; I could not mend it without, and being unsaleable I put it there to be melted.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you erase the crest - A. Yes; I beat it up in that shape. I erased it, to polish it up, to sell the better - and afterwards perceived the crack.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by ALLEY. Q. He came to you, on the 15th of July, was that the day your house was searched - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not some of the spoons gilt, when you got them - A. No; it was towards the evening when I bought them - and I polished them that night. I saw no gilt on them. I did it between light and dark, and polishing might rub it off. I filed the crests off of course, as I do thousands in the year.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your reason for breaking up the ewer, because the crest was so deep that in filing it out, you broke a hole in it - A. No; but beating it up to make it small for the pot, might make a hole.</p>
               <p>Q. If you did not intend it for sale, why file out the crest - A. I always file out crests and cyphers.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you say who you sold the spoons and other things to, till after the teapot was found - A. I had no occasion - I think the teapot was found on the Tuesday following. I gave 5 s. 6 d. an ounce for it - it was bruised, and all over dirt. I sold it all at 7 s. an ounce. I was in custody two days and a half. Bouser coloured the teapot up next morning; he has absconded. I was at Bow-street two years and a half ago, about some linen.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What was that - A. I was deceived by a young man, who was a shopman in New-street, Covent-garden. I was charged with buying linen of him; I was discharged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner came to your house with them, between seven and eight o'clock - A. At half past seven - Bouser was up in the workshop with me; he saw Josephs on the first floor, as he came down stairs to leave work.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the milk pot not worth selling, could you not as well have left it in the state it was - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230037"></xptr>knocked it up to make it small for the melting pot. I did not knock it up for a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. When you shewed that milk pot to Clements, on your oath did you mention to him the teapot, spoons, or other things - A. Yes; and told him where I had sold them.</p>

            . On the 15th of July, my husband lived at No. 4, Crown-court. Mr. Joseph came that evening into the front room, on the first floor, which is the sitting room - he brought some plate. I called to one of my sons to tell my husband to come from the shop, which is at the top of the house. The prisoner was not many minutes in the room, till he came down - he opened the plate which he had in his bundle. I heard all that passed. He said he had brought forty-four ounces of plate, and my husband bought it for 5 s. 6 d. an ounce; it came to 12 l. 2 s.; 4 s. was taken off for the dirt on it - he gave Joseph twelve sovereigns and 1 s.; nobody else was in the room. My little girl was in the passage with the children - he went away, as soon as he got the money. Bouser, the workman, came down to leave work, while he was in the room, and saw him. I do not know what has become of him. The plate was taken up stairs into the shop the same night and finished off. I think my husband went to work again after the prisoner was gone. I heard him say he had sold the teapot to Jupp.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. When did you first appear at Marlborough-street - A. On the Saturday. My husband had then been in custody four days. I called to my son Joseph to call his father down - he is not here. Bouser left work about seven o'clock. I do not know that I saw the things after Joseph brought them.</p>

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. It was in very good condition - A. Certainly. It was equally as good as the sugar bason, which I produce - it corresponded in pattern with it. Ten of the spoons were gilt inside, and seven plain - they had a motto strongly marked on them.</p>
               <p>COURT to GUEST. Q. Look at this sugar bason, and say on your oath had not the ewer and spoons the same crest and letters on them - A.

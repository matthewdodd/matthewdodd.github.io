            . I am a fishmonger, I live about twenty yards from Lord Uxbridge. On the 7th of June, between twelve and one o'clock, I was standing at my own door, I saw the prisoner, I observed him picking up a spoon, and I heard it fall, Mr. Goodman, who was with me, seized him. We went to Lord Uxbridge's, and asked the porter whose spoon it was; I cannot say whether the prisoner heard me or not; I looked round and saw the prisoner was gone; I cannot say how he got away. This is the spoon that I heard drop from him and which I saw him pick up.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Church pawnbroker, Whitechapel. On the 8th of June, about half past eight in the evening, I saw the prisoner lurking about the shop a long time before he came in and exactly at hall past eight he came in, and took this spoon out of his pocket, and wanted five shillings on it; seeing the crest upon it, I asked him how he came by it; he informed me that he found it upon a dust heap. I detained him, and sent for an officer.</p>

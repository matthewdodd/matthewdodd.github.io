            . I am in the employ of Mr. Henry Hammer. I remember the prisoner coming to his shop on the 5th of August; she was looking at some shawls, and they did not agree about the price; she then asked to look at some cotton, and while the young man, who served her, was turning round, I saw her put the shawl into a basket in her hand: I took no notice of it; she then asked to look at some stockings, and said if he would take 10 d. a pair for them she would take three pairs; I then went out and got an officer; she then took up a parasol and asked me if she did not look handsome; I said she was quite killing; as she was going out of the shop, I asked her if she could not agree about the shawl; she said No, and went out of the shop; I followed, and brought her back, saying, I would just look at the contents of her basket; she said she had nothing but what she had purchased - I opened it and found the shawl.</p>

I remember the prisoner coming to look at some shawls; she did not buy any but bought a remnant of calico, for which she paid 4 d.; she then looked at some other things; when she was brought back, I saw the basket opened, and the shawl found in it; she was about an hour in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman baker; I live in Liquorpond-street. Last Saturday night I went to a cook-shop, about twelve o'clock, and had a basin of leg of beef soup—I fell asleep—I had been drinking previously, but nothing of any consequence—I cannot exactly say what money I had in my pocket, but I thought about eight shillings, two or three sixpences, and some copper—I had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, besides—I awoke in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and found a woman near me at my left side—I saw two policemen looking in at the door—one of them spoke to me—I felt in my right-hand pocket and missed my money—I afterwards found the money in my left-hand pocket was safe—I did not give any woman</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Worrall, who keeps a cook-shop. On Saturday night the prosecutor came in alone, about twelve o'clock, and had some soup—the prisoner was sitting opposite to him—he fell asleep—I then saw the prisoner go and sit on the prosecutor's right-hand side—she put her left hand into his right-hand trowsers' pocket, and pulled out some money—he laid with his back against the settle, exposing his right side to her—I said, I thought she was not doing the thing that was right, she said she was, she knew the man—I awoke him, and could make no sense of him—I let him sleep—my master awoke him—we would not let the prisoner go out till they went together—my master asked him if he had lost any money, or missed any—he said, "No," till he got out-side the door, then the policeman followed him, and asked if he had lost any money—he said he had—I had seen 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the prisoner's possession, which she put down on the table immediately after she put her hand into his pocket—she took it up again when I spoke to her—there had been no symptoms of her knowing the man before he fell asleep—they had not talked together.</p>

I know the prosecutor well; I had seen him before, and drank with him several times; he said he would go home with me, but told me not to expose him, as he was married, and he could not give me any money till he got change—we went to the eating-house—he said, "You go in first, I will come in after you, take no notice of me"—I went in, and sat down—he came and sat opposite me—presently he said, "Will you have any thing to eat?"—I called for a basin of soup, and he did the same—he then laid down his head on his arm, and beckoned me to sit by him, which I did—he then pulled out this 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said, "This is all I have got about me, take this"—I took it, and said, "Very well—I will trust to your generosity for what you promised me," which was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then laid his head down, and whether he went to sleep or not I do not know—when I was going out I tried to awake him up to come with me,</p>

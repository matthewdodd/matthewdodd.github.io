            . I am an officer. From information in the neighbourhood, I waited until the prisoner came home, and when he did come home, I went up into the room; I found him in bed; the woman that was in bed with him came out of the room and spoke to a person in the house. I asked her who she had in bed; she said, my husband; this was at No. 7, Cable-street. I awoke the prisoner; he said, you will find nothing here, I heard of your being here. While he was dressing himself I proceeded to to search the room, and in a box in his room, I found this jacket, waistcoat, and breeches. I asked him how long he had them; he said about a twelvemonth, they were to be his wedding suit, though they were not married, they were to be married. I searched him; I put my hand into his breeches; I took out this card of Mr. Chambers's shop. I then said, it appears you bought these new clothes there, you have not had them a twelvemonth. I took the clothes out of the box, and tied them up. These are them. The next morning I went to Mr. Chamber's shop, and asked Hatfield if he remembered any person yesterday coming, and buying clothes; yes, he said, he took a five-pound note of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Hatfield. Look at them clothes - A. They are part of the clothes he brought of me.</p>

I said to the young woman that I live with I have picked up a five-pound note. She said Joseph, as we want things, let us go and buy some, and appear decent among our friends. The chissel I have had in my possession five or six months. I was in bed all night at the time this offence was committed.</p>

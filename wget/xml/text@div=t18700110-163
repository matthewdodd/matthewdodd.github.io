                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> In 1854 I was married to Ellen Henderson, and was forced to leave her through her drunkenness. I was despatched to the Cape in 1855, and the night I passed through London, she was in prison for drunkenness, and I could not see her. I did not see her till 1863, when she was living with Mr. Stafford. I have seen him in her room at Horsely<lb></lb>down. I went away to Manchester, and came back in 1864, and then she was living in New Compton Street, still kept by this man. I took her away from him, took her to Manchester, and lived with her there; but she was locked up there two or three times for drunkenness. I took her to London, and in one of her drunken fits she told me that since she was married to me she had got married to John White. I then left her, went to Somerset House, found that she was married to John White, and have never lived with her since. I have no children by her, but I have one by my second wife.</p>

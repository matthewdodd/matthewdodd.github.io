                  </hi>. I am salesman to Messrs. Neville. On 4th Dec. I re<lb></lb>ceived this order from Roe—I selected the goods, and delivered them to Roe, calling on him to sign the receipt in our book, which he did, in the name of Thomas Serle—Catley was not with him—Catley had brought me a genuine order on a former occasion, which I have here.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Catley's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows</hi>: "My master sent me with a note to Gresham Street; I met Roe; he asked me where I was going; I told him; he said he would come with me; as we were going along, he asked me to let him look at the note; I showed it him, and he copied another off like it; about a week after he got the goods."</p>

                  </hi>. Catley was in the service of my father-in-law—I gave him this genuine order on 22nd Nov., and he brought the goods all right—after he was taken, he told me when he was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> that he met Roe, and he got the things; that they were sold by dozens, he did not know where, but his share was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had been with us a month, and had a very good character from a gentleman in Grosvenor Square—he had been in his employ six months—I believe he has been the dupe of the other—this second order was not written by me, or by my authority.</p>

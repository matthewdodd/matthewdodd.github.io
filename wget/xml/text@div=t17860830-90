             were there together, they were endeavouring to persuade her to have a fine ell-wide muslin, and to make it the contrary way; the prisoner said, she would endeavour to make that do; we had a very fine piece of ell-wide muslin; we could not find it; my servant came to me into the compting-house, and asked me if I had seen the muslin that day, I told him I had; I examined the wrapper in which it should have been, which was the wrapper I opened, it was not there; I examined several other wrappers; I then accused the prisoner immediately with the thest; she moved about a yard and a quarter from the muslin; she stepped to the counter, took up three pieces of muslin from the wrapper, gave them a shake, and pulled the other from under her left arm; I examined the wrapper particularly, and am sure it was not there; she had a black cloak on, and the other three pieces fell on the floor with the piece that had been missing.</p>
               <p>Was the situation of her body in such a direction that you could see the piece fall from under her arm? - Yes, I can swear to that; I saw it with my own eyes; I am very sure it did not fall from the counter; she was very dextrous in taking it from under her cloak.</p>
               <p>In the dropping of it, did she employ one hand or two? - She took it from under her left arm; I think she pulled it with her right hand.</p>
               <p>Do you speak with certainty as to that fact? - Yes, I believe I can; I believe she threw it down with her right hand; she was charged with the constable; I took the piece up immediately. (Produced.)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300132"></xptr> There are eleven yards of it; I did not know the quantity when I was at Guildhall, I thought it had been eight yards; there is my private mark, which is E. H. five quarter; it is a very particular fine one; we had never another of the same quality; that was the reason it was so particularly enquired after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. This was the finest piece you had in your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called your attention to it and that of the shopman's, by being dissatisfied with the fineness of all the others? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of a cloak had she on? - I cannot tell the length.</p>
               <p>Cannot you distinguish a long cloak from a short one? - It was a middling sized cloak.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the terms in which you accused her of having robbed you? - I told her, I believed she had got a piece of our muslin, on which she came to the wrapper.</p>
               <p>What did she say when she took up the other pieces? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do remember her saying, I dare say, Sir, if you examine accurately you will find it? - She did say something to that purpose; she took them up in a very confused manner.</p>
               <p>She had not at that time gone out of your shop at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there any stranger in the shop? - No, none at all; there were more than thirty different pieces of muslin in the wrapper; I looked them over very minutely, I suppose we were five minutes looking them over, two or three of us; she wished to go very much.</p>
               <p>What family has that woman besides that infant that is at her breast? - She said, she had four children.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with Messers. Railton and Woollett; the prisoner came into our shop at about quarter past six, and asked for a yard of yard and half wide muslin; I asked her to walk in, and I would shew her some.</p>
               <p>When she came in was the other servant in the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Before the other servant came into the shop, was there any of the property about the counter or loose any where? - Only that wrapper which I took down to shew her; I shewed her a piece which she did not think fine enough; the other man was not then come down; I shewed her another piece; she thought it was too thin, she said, she wanted it to work; I shewed her another piece, and the other man came down into the shop, and she said, she did not like the price.</p>
               <p>Was your back turned to this woman at any time while she was in the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Is your fellow shopman here? - No, he is not; I had no conversation with the other man; he stood by; he asked her whether an ell-wide muslin would do, and he would shew her one; and we looked for it in the wrapper and could not find it; it was a particular fine piece; I took out the pieces, one by one, and it was not in the wrapper, and the prosecutor looked there too; I am very sure I examined the wrapper before I examined the rest; I never left the woman by herself near the counter; she was a yard and as half from the counter during the time we were looking for the muslin; at first when she came into the shop she was close to the counter; as we could not find the muslin, we called our master out of the compting-house; he said, he saw it just before he went up to tea, in the wrapper which I opened first; the prisoner then said, you have no muslin that will do for me; and the prosecutor said, no, but he missed a piece of muslin, and rather suspected she had got it; she said, how can you think I have it, when the young man has not given me an opportunity of going near the wrapper? then she immediately stept up to the counter, and laid hold of three pieces of muslin out of that wrapper with her right hand; she immediately shook them, and said, I dare say we can find them, and she dropped them down, and immediately I saw the muslin drop from under her left arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300133"></xptr>Did she appear to you to lay hold of the muslins that were under her left arm at all? - She put her right hand across her break very quick, and took the muslin from under her left arm.</p>
               <p>Are you satisfied you saw it fall from under her left arm? - I am sure I saw it; I went for a constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. From the time this woman came into your shop, to the time this was missing, did any other customer come in? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel; what they have said, they have sworn wrong.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

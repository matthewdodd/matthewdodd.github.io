I reside in Cecil-street, Strand.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260004"></xptr>In September last year I was in possession of a pair of carriage geldings - I had bought them of the prisoner in the month of June, for 150l., but I had exchanged one, and paid him 25l. more - in the first instance I kept them about six months - he called on me subsequently, in consequence of my having commenced and action against him to recover the money I had paid for the horses, as they were unsound; he called and asked why I had commenced the suit - I told him to get the consideration back which I had paid for the horses; he asked what I was paying for their keep; I said 10l. a month - he offered to keep them for half that sum in his own stable; I agreed that they should be kept in his stable, and I was to pay him 5l. a month; he said it would take at least three weeks to get them in selling order; I told him to keep them in his stable, and not sell them at all, but if he found a purchaser to come and let me know. I went to his stable three days after, and they were entirely gone. I applied at the office, and did not wish to press the felony, but was advised to go before the Grand Jury, and they found a bill for the felony. The prisoner said he had sold one of them - I authorised him to look out for a purchaser, but not to sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. You named a price between the proposed purchaser and yourself? A. Yes - but it was to remain subject to my approbation.</p>
               <p>Q. He sold them without consulting you? A. That is what he said immediately he was asked about it - I believe it was some months before the officer found him. - When he had the horses I told him I was going abroad, and wished him to find a purchaser as soon as he could; he said their coats were very rough, and it would take three weeks to get them in selling order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How long did you keep the horses before one was exchanged? A. Probably two months - the two were 150l.; I paid 25l. more on making the exchange; I brought an action to recover all the money I had paid; I had not then sent back the horses - he called on me, about a week perhaps, after the action was brought; it might be about January, but I do not recollect dates - another person called with him, whose name I do not know; the prisoner asked why I brought the action - I replied that I had done it in a delicate way, by merely giving him a copy of a writ.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What has become of that action? A. I believe it is still pending.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. In January, when the prisoner and Mr. Shaw called, was there any agreement that he was to have back the horses and the action be dropped, and he was to pay a sum of money? A. No; there was an agreement that if he paid me 110l. I was to drop the action - he would keep the horses in that case.</p>
               <p>Q. You got a warrant, and the Magistrate said if he had heard the whole of the case before you should not have had the warrant? A. No - he said he did not think it a case of felony, but a gross fraud, and advised me to go before the Grand Jury; I went as soon as I heard that they sat - I went and told the same story as I have now.</p>
               <p>Q. From January to September did you not know a Grand Jury were sitting? A. I went the first time the officer told me they were sitting; he had promised to let me know - the officer was some months finding him; it might be about January that I got the warrant. I might have seen him at Bow-street, probably, about a week after the warrant was issued - I have no memorandum of the date; I think it was a fortnight after; I have not seen the prisoner since he was before Sir

             till to-day; I directed the officer to his stables in King's Head-yard, Russell-street - I cannot tell how long it was before he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. In January, when the agreement was made about the 110l., the horse had got out of condition, from not being used? A. Yes; I said, "You are to pay me before I give you any title to them." I suppose I was to pay for their keep. If he had paid me 100l., I should have given him a bill of sale, and I suppose I should have had no. thing to pay for their keep - he had no authority to sell them. I never wished to charge him capitally.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was the 110l. to he paid? A. I told him I was going abroad, and if he brought 110l. he might have the horses - no agreement as to time was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a time fixed? A. A person called and said he would pay it in a week or two.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there a subsequent application for further time? A. Not that I recollect; a person called once or twice, and had several conversations about them before I delivered the horses, but after I delivered them no person called.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. You are quite sure of it? A. I am, for two days after I delivered them I went to the stable, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear no person called between January and September, and requested an extension of time? A. They called several times between January and September. From the time the horses were delivered till this hour no person has called, but prior to the delivery they did call for an extension of time; they asked if I would trust Mr. Maltby, and take his bill for time - I refused. I told Mr. Shaw I brought the action to bring Maltby to terms.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had received the 110l. this indictment would never have been preferred? A. Yes, it would - I would never have received the 110l. after my horses were taken in the manner they were, for I never considered them sold.</p>
               <p>- LEADBETTER. I am an officer of Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner first in January, by a warrant which Mr. Halls delivered to me - I executed it four or five days after - I was present at his examination, and he was discharged; Major McCurdy desired me to let him know when the Grand Jury sat, but I was in France, and had no opportunity of letting him know. Some time before last Session I sent him word when they would sit, and after they had broken up I saw him; he said he had been before them, and from what they said, he had no doubt they would find the bill. I expected the indictment was for a fraud - I examined the books, and found no bill returned; I went and told the prosecutor - he said he was indicted for felony; I then got a warrant on a certificate of indictment, and apprehended him in about a fortnight; I had frequently met him prior to that time, but in that fortnight I had been looking for him, but could not find him; I went to an acquaintance of his, and told him to appoint him to meet me, and he came in consequence of that appointment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had seen him frequently be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260005"></xptr>fore? A. Yes - I knew him and he knew me; I had met him in Piccadilly, and said, "You may depend on it the Major will indict you" - "Oh!" said he, "I don't mind that."</p>

            . I am a commercial agent, and live in Sloane-street. I was at Major McCurdy's when the prisoner came there on business; it was in the summer, about May I suppose; I had breakfasted with him; in fact I was present when 25l. was paid, respecting the exchange of horses, and on the time in question the prisoner entered the room, and wished to know the cause of proceedings relative to the horse; the prosecutor said, "Why, you have been out of the way, and I have taken steps to meet with you, as I am not satisfied with the horses;" Maltby said he did not know he had given them a character which they did not deserve - that he was unable at that time to refund the money; the Major said, "Money is not particularly an object to me - you must pay me 110l. and have them back;" he said he had called to solicit time for the payment; the Major said he could not give him time, as he was going to America - Maltby said he had been to the stables and seen the horses, and they were in bad condition; the Major said he could not help that, he had not used them for a long time, and said, "Pay me a hundred guineas for them, and I will give you possession" - he said he could not, but if he would let him take the hores he would pay him in a few days, as he should be able to get them in condition, and raise the money; I said"Major, you must not part with them to Mr. Maltby, as he has not acted correct with you - you should not part with possession;" Maltby replied, "Oh! Sir, I don't mean the Major to give me possession - I don't wish to exercise any right of ownership over them - I merely wish to get them in condition for sale, that I may dispose of them, and so be able to pay the Major, and I shall be able to keep them at less than the Major now pays;" the Major said, "If you can get a purchaser, recommend that person to me - I have no objection to your doing it, but I do not part with my horses till I have received 110l.;" Maltby said, certainly he meant nothing more than that, and he need not fear trusting him with them.</p>

            . I was in the prisoner's service in June last year, when these horses were sold to Major McCurdy - one of them was afterwards changed, and after that I received an order from the Major to get the horses from Mr. Morton - I went and got them - they were much reduced, and out of condition. My master kept the King's Head stables, near Covent-garden, and carried on business there till September last, and resided over the water; he was at the stables every day if anybody wanted him.</p>

            . I am an accountant, About October or November last I waited on Major McCurdy respecting an action between him and the prisoner; I asked his reason (by Maltby's direction) for bringing the action after keeping the horses so long; he said he only meant it as a notice, and if Maltby was willing to come forward, and give him 100l. or one hundred guineas for the horses, he would take it; I said from what Maltby had said I thought it would not be in his power, but I would mention it - he said Maltby had better wait on him, and he would settle it with him; I communicated this conversation to Maltby. I saw the prosecutor again three weeks or a month after; the horses had then been delivered back, and I requested the Major would wait one week longer, understanding the time had expired for payment for the horses, and after a great deal of hesitating he consented to do it - he said he understood the horses were sold.</p>
               <p>Q. And he consented to give a week from that time? A. He did - he said he would give him a week, but it was to be perfectly understood he did not forego the action till the money was paid. I always found the prisoner at his stables when I went.</p>

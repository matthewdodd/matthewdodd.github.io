                  </hi>. I am a clerk, living at 9, King-street, Grosvenor-square—on Tuesday, 18th April, I went to Greenwich fair, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening—as I was going away from the fair I felt a pull at my guard; it was a cotton guard—there was a watch at the end of it, in my waistcoat pocket—I put my hand to my waistcoat pocket, and found my watch was gone—I saw the prisoner before me; he was going away from me—when I first saw him, he was about three or four paces off—two people closed in, the moment I <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> my eyes upon it, between him and me—as soon as I missed my watch, I saw the prisoner going away from me, and went behind him, and saw my watch in his left hand—I laid hold of him by his neck-handkerchief, and with my right hand tried to catch hold of his left hand—he put both his hands together, and the watch went into the right hand—he passed it—I caught hold of both his hands with my right hand, and he dropped the watch—I had a friend with me; he came up at the same minute and laid hold of the prisoner, and I picked up my watch; it was at the prisoner's feet—I said "You have stolen my watch!"—he said he hoped I would let him go, as he had a wife and two children—he tried to get away, but my friend laid hold of him, and kept him till the officer came up and took him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch.</p>

It was between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening—it was the second day of the fair—I never went there before, everything there was novel—I arrived at Greenwich at 6 o'clock that evening, and this was between 7 and 8; I was then leaving the fair—I was not tired of it, but I had a friend with me who wished to be at the West End at 9 o'clock—we had not been in the Park to see the people running down the hill—I never spent a farthing—I went by water merely to see the shipping—my friend was anxious to see the fair, and I went with him—I was about an hour going through the fair with my friend—he is not here—he is in the same office with me—</p>

               <p>I am quite sure I had not been talking to any persons before I met the prisoners—I was quite sober, I had nothing at all to drink—I reached home about 10 o'clock—I left Greenwich soon after the prisoner took the watch; I went by water, and came home by railway—I cannot say whether it was the prisoner who pulled at my pocket—I put my hand to my waistcoat pocket, found my watch was gone, and saw the prisoner going away with his hands down—he was an arm's length from me; there were two men between me and him—they stood quiet, and he walked away—I had to push by them; they closed in—I broke through them, and found the watch.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police constable, R</hi> 184). I was on duty in Greenwich fair, on Tuesday evening, in plain clothes; I saw the prosecutor there—I first saw him put his hand to his waistcoat pocket; I saw him look at his guard, and the watch was gone; there was such a crowd round I could not get to him; I saw his friend lay hold of the prisoner—he made his escape then, and made a bit of a circle round before I could get to him—I then got up to him, and asked what was the matter—he said, "He stole my friend's watch"—he was given into my custody—he said, "Let me go, it was not me that <hi rend="italic">taken</hi> the watch"—the prosecutor and his friends said, in his presence, that it was his.</p>

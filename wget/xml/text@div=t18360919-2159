                  </hi>. I am a Captain of the Royal Horse Guards, and reside in the barracks, in Regent's Park, On Saturday night, the 17th of September, I was walking along Albany-street—I turned across to some oaken palings, by the new church which is building, to make water in a corner—the prisoner rushed up to me with a gun in his hand, and with very violent abuse threatened to shoot me if I did not he off—he was very drunk—he came from against the palings, a little higher up the street—from the violence of his appearance I immediately seized the gun—he had not pointed it at me then—he had threatened me—he struggled for it—the ramrod broke, and the barrel of the gun slipped through my hands—I had thrown the prisoner down in the struggle—he immediately got up, put himself in the corner, pointed the gun at me, and said, "Now I will do for you," and he snapped the gun, but it did not strike fire—he still kept the gun presented towards me, after the trigger had gone down, and he let himself into a little door—it seemed to be his own premises—he shut the door, and said, "Now if you came near me, I will do for you again"—I got two policeman, and we went together—we knocked at the door of the hovel where the prisoner was, and desired him to come out, which he did—I then told the policeman what he had done, and desired them to take him in charge, and the gun—I went with the policeman down to the station-house, and saw the gun—the pan was open, and the lock at half-cock—he did not say any thing then—he was very drunk indeed—he said on Monday, at the examination, that five men had attacked him, and threatened to come back that night and beat him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I wish to ask if he is certain I snapped the gun—the pan was open as it was in the struggle—the cock did not stand in the right position to be snapped. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No; it certainly did not—I say it did not strike fire, but I heard it snap distinctly,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in Albany-street about twelve o'clock, and heard a call of "Police," and saw the prosecutor—when I came up the prisoner was inside the place, in a small office which is built for paying the labourers—he is a private watchman, employed to take care of the premises—he does not reside there constantly, but he is there at night—I asked what he meant by attempting the life of the prose<lb></lb>cutor—he said he would shoot him or any other man who would make</p>

               <p>water on the premises—I asked him where the gun was said, "There it is, "pointing behind the door—I found the gun with the open—I drew the ramrod, and it was broken—I got the prosecutor's cane, and measured the piece—I found it was loaded, nut I could not draw the charge, as the ramrod was broken—the lock was in good order—the pan was open, and the lock on the half-cock—I took the prisoner to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house—the prosecutor was stating the charge there to the Inspector, when the prisoner made a sudden rush at the gun, which I had in my hand, and said, "If I have not shot then, I would do for you now, you cowardly rascal"—he was very drunk—on Sunday morning, the 18th, I drew the charge, which I produce—it was loaded with powder and large shot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was employed to look after the premises, and on Friday night observed a man removing some boards off where there was some lead piping; he came with intent to cut it away. I came up to him; he attacked me, and we fought together for five minutes; he got over the paling, and told me he would have the pipe next night, in spite of me, and would come with four or five more. I told my employer of it, and he said I had better have arms to protect myself, and he furnished me with the gun. I went out that night for about five minutes; when I came back I found the gentleman making water against the shed door; I said, "If you do that again I will shoot you; "I went towards the door, and the gentleman caught hold of the gun, and, in struggling for it, the ramrod was broken, and the pan opened. The gentleman said he would get a policeman. I went in doors, and had plenty of time to draw the charge, but I did not wish to discharge any thing. It was the gentleman's hand that caught the top of the cap, and pulled it back; the piece was never cocked from first to last, nor was there any priming in the pan at any time.</p>

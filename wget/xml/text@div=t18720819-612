                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, at 17, York Street, Bethnal Green Road—on 3rd August I was in Lower Thames Street, about 11.20 in the morning—I saw Mr. Illingworth at the corner of Dunstan's Hill, waiting for a van to pass—I saw the prisoner come up with a coat on his arm—I saw him break the prosecutor's watch from the chain—the prosecutor crossed the road, not knowing that he had lost his watch—the prisoner stood a minute or two at the corner—I ran and told the gentleman he had lost his watch—I saw the prisoner's hand under the coat when he took the watch, and the ring of the watch dropped on the ground—I ran after the prisoner, but lost sight of him for a moment—I saw him again up against</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not say I was mistaken, I said I might be; and the reason I said I wished I was, for my own benefit, is because, if I come and give evidence against the prisoner, my life is in danger.</p>

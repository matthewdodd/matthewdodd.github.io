                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Featherstone, who works in a market-garden; I live at Deptford. On Sunday, the 21st of August, I went to the Fox public-house, Deptford, with my husband and brother-in-law, between nine and ten o' clock—after being there about half an hour there was a dispute between my husband and a party there—I did nothing, and never insulted them; but as I was standing with the landlady at the bar, the prisoner was following my husband with a quart pot, and struck me on the nose, saying he would murder me—it cut me right across the lip—a surgeon attended me.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you hire her? - A. I believe it is about six or seven weeks back; I knew nothing of the robbery till Friday the 28th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find out the robbery? - A. I was very ill in bed, and did not get up from the 17th to the 28th; I was forced to keep my bed eleven days; on the 28th my daughter came up to me, and said, father, I am sorry to see you so bad; says she, you want some clean sheets; I said, you will find some in the drawer; on her searching, she found that every drawer besides one, and every box in the room, there were some things gone out of; I had seen my things in my boxes and in my drawers before the 17th.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your drawers, in your bedroom? - A. No, in a private room where my wife died; I always keep the keys under my pillow; while I was so ill, I lost my senses, and I could not tell what became of the keys; I did not suffer any one to go into that room.</p>


               <p>Q. While you were ill, you were light-headed? - A. I used to have one or two fits of a day, but, thank God, I have not had any for this fortnight; I was not able to get up on the Friday, but on the Monday following I got up, and went and got two search-warrants to search two houses, and the first house that was searched they found more than one half of the things that were stolen; on Tuesday they searched the other house, and found what they could not find in the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long is it since your wife died? - A. She died on the 3d of March, five minutes before five o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been acquainted with the prisoner before the decease of your wife? - A. She never slept in my house, she only came backwards and forwards as a chair-woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you intrust the prisoner with the keys? - A. I would not trust even my own daughter with them.</p>
               <p>Q. I am sorry you should have suspicion of your own daughter - in point of fact, the question is whether you intrusted the keys with the prisoner? - A. I never missed the keys.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you ever intrusted her with the keys? - A. Never in my life, nor no person in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you gave your wife leave to dispose of her property? - A. No, I mean to keep it as long as I live, except I want to make away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. It had not been given to your daughter? - - A. No; I gave her my wife's wedding-ring, and what she died in; I would not trust my daughter with the keys, except somebody went with her.</p>

I had been there on the Monday before, I went to get the sheets; I told my father I could not find them; he said, look further; I looked further, and then I missed a gown; I went into this back room where my mother died, and found all these articles gone; they were taken out of the drawers and out of two boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in there before since your mother died? - A. Yes, I had been in on the Monday evening; my father sent me in to get my mother's ring; I took it out, I only opened one drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you then the keys of the room? - A. My father.</p>
               <p>Q. And you returned them to him? - A. Yes; on the Monday following, the 1st of July, my father and I went to Bow-street to get two search-warrants, because there were two houses, the daughter of the prisoner lived in one, and the prisoner lived in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these houses? - A. One is in Little Green-street, the son and daughter lived there, and the other is in College-lane (they are both in Kentish-town,) the mother lived there.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Bow-street: On the 1st of July,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100024"></xptr>I went to execute two search-warrants in company with Doyle, first to No. 4, Little Green-street, Kentish-town, and there I saw the prisoner at the bar; I told her I came upon a disagreeable circumstance to search her house to find some property of Mr. Cantell's; she said, very well. In the house I found two pillow-cases, and a white apron; her daughter came in, and I told Doyle to stop her, as she wanted to go out of the house, till I had searched the house all through; Mrs. Hartley could not swear to the pillow-cases, the marks being taken out; then I said, I shall by no means take them; I said to the mother and daughter, you have got another house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the pillow-case? - A. I left them and the apron, because she could not positively swear to them; then the prisoner at the bar, Mrs. Hartley, I, and Doyle, went to her house in College-lane; I followed them up stairs, and the prisoner at the bar and Mrs. Hartley went into a back room; I heard the prisoner, as I stood and listened at the door, desire Mrs. Hartley to shut the door, and not to let me in, and she would give up the property; I forced myself into the room; she was then taking the property out of a cupboard on the left hand going into the room, and I took it out of her hand. I produce a tablecloth, a white silk hat-band, a piece of lace, and a pair of sheets, that is what I took out of her hand; I took her into custody, and took her to Bow-street. Sir

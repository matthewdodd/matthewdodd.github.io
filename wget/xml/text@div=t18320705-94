               <p>ALBINUS CARTER. I live at Camberwell, but my counting-house is in Water-lane. On the evening of the 18th of May I was crossing <placeName id="t18320705-94-crimeloc513">London bridge</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Was the prisoner near you? A. Immediately I turned round I saw him; this was at the approach to London-bridge - I should say that this handkerchief is decidedly like mine, but it has not my initials; other persons might have touched me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This gentleman looked at another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050056"></xptr>young man, and then at me; there was a handkerchief in the road, and he accused me of throwing it there - I never had it.</p>
               <p>MR. CARTER. I am perfectly clear that he had it in his hand; there was another young man in company with him, and a friend who was walking with me, told him to be off.</p>

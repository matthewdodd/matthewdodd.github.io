I told him it was a bad one: then he gave me a shilling, and that was bad likewise. I kept the half-guinea, and put back the shilling to him: I told him I would not serve him, I would have nothing to do with him, and charged the watch with him: the constable of the night had the half-guinea: he was stopped till the watch came.</p>

               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury; Having already heard the evidence that is produced against me, and even before the magistrate, I humbly submit to you a question of law, whether the uttering proved is complete, within the statute? and, after some little observation to you, Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope I shall meet with an acquittal from your justice. First, then, it appears, that I was in a state of intoxication; it may be the lot of any honest man to tender half-a-guinea, or a shilling, which he may have received in change for a guinea, without knowing it to be bad, and without intention of defrauding: again, Gentlemen, what company does it appear I was in? why with two common prostitutes, whom in the hour of sobriety I should detest. Perhaps the conduct of the prosecutrix is not altogether so proper, in not detaining these women as well as me. I have the painful reflection of my family wanting bread, whose sole dependance was on my labour. With respect to the silver found next morning, I hope you will consider the distance of time, and the number of people that come in and out. I humbly submit to you, to direct the Jury, that, unless I did it knowingly and intentionally, which alone constitutes the fact, I shall be entitled to an acquittal.</p>

As soon as I recovered myself I saw several people about me. I got to the railing opposite the Abbey, as soon as I could, and had much to do to stand; I supported myself by the railing, and then I observed the prisoner, Pickett, take hold of my arm, saying, he would see me home, if I would go, I refused; that is all I know. I had been drinking, but was perfectly sensible before I received the blow.</p>

            . As I was coming home I saw Mr. Perry holding by the rails that inclose the green, and the prisoner, Pickett, attempting to release his hands from them-which he did, and Mr. Perry crossed over to some wood rails, nearly opposite - He caught hold of them, and then the prisoner, Pickett, crossed over too, and appeared to endeavour to release his hands from the wooden rails, but Mr. Perry held the rails so tight that he could not do it; I also attempted to release his hands, but he would not let me. A short time after that I saw the prisoner, Pickett, pull the watch from Mr. Perry's pocket - He pulled it up in a very forcible way, and could hardly get it out. There was a great number of costermongers standing about; I saw him deliver it to the other prisoner, Wood, who was close to his elbow. Perry was at this time close to the rails - I believe he was in liquor; then Wood walked round to the other side of Perry, and gave Pickett the watch back again, he then put it into his great coat pocket, and they both crossed over towards Tothill-street; I followed them half-way up Tothill-street, and then Wood returned - I lost Picket - I do not know where he went to, and I also missed Wood. The next morning I saw Pickett passing by the shoemaker's, and he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WOOD. Was it light enough to see me - A. Yes; I was close by the side of you; there were gaslights on the other side - I knew both the prisoners before, by sight, and also the name of Wood.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to speak to me when you first saw me in the public-house-A. I was afraid to speak to him in the public-house, but I swore to him as soon as the officers got him out. I went down with them, after I had described him, to the Crown, and he was there.</p>

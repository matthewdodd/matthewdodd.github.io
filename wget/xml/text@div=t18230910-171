            . I am a constable of Islington. I was at the fair, and saw the prisoners together for a quarter of an hour. I saw them go up to Mr. Jackson - they were joined by a third; I saw Ilsley go up and hold Mr. Jackson's right hand coat flap up, and take a red handkerchief out. I told Mr. Jackson, and he went with me and took Ilsley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There were a great many people there - A. Yes - I was there from curiosity. I have often been here on such cases as these.</p>

I met Colton in the fair, just by the wild-beast shew; he asked me to watch the two prisoners, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100079"></xptr>I did for a quarter of an hour. They fell into company with a third man; they went close to the prosecutor, and Ilsley put his hand into his right-hand pocket - the other two were close by his side; he handed it to the other. Grant was looking on. I took him on the spot - he kicked at me - I could not hold him without assistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ever been a witness here before - Yes, this Session - I job about for myself - I know Colton, because he lives near me. I was a witness with him, against another man here.</p>
               <p>GRANT'S Defence. I was going from Guildhall to the Compter. Colton came up, and said he should get no reward for transporting me, and if I could make up a little money, he would throw the bill out.</p>

            . I live in Spafields. I happened to be at Guildhall on a charge of robbery, and met Coulton with the prisoners, and hand-cuffed my prisoner to them. Colton desired me to go near to them, as he was afraid one of them would strike him - he never spoke a word to them.</p>

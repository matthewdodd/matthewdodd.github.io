On the 11th of August, I went out between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning - returned in about an hour, and missed this property - I had left some on a chair, and some on the floor. I left Mrs. Chapman at home, some persons in the garret, and people in the next room. I never saw either of the prisoners till they were before the Magistrate. The property I lost, was one shirt, one waistcoat, three frocks, three pairs of stockings, two pieces of flannel, a handkerchief and a cap, the whole was worth about 1 l.</p>

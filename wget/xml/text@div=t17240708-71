They prov'd all their Changes by the following Evidences. The Affidavits were produced in Court, the Policy of Insurance prov'd by the Persons concerned in the Insurance, and the Subornation proved by the Persons suborned. William Long depos'd, that coming into the Company of the Prisoner with one Blake, and being ply'd with Liquor, an Affidavit was drawn up, which he did make and sign to before the Justice, by the Sollicitations and Promises of the Prisoner, to this Purpose, That he did pilot the Ship William Gally, of which one Partridge was Master, to the Downs, tho' he was not a Pilot, nor did ever carry any such Ship to the Downs, nor ever knew that the Prisoner had any such Ship; and that afterwards, when he considered what he had done, and was not willing to stand to the said Affidavit, the Prisoner threatned, if he did not, he would pillory him; and that there was a promisory Note for 10 l. 10 s. to be paid to him, when the Prisoner received his Insurance.</p>
               <p>Lee, alias Pye deposed, that a Woman came to him, and desired him to come to be Bail for a Man, to get him out of Prison, that by that means he was brought into the Company of the Prisoner, who ply'd him with Liquor, kept him out two Days and Nights, and gave him a Guinea to make an Affidavit, that he was a Mariner on board the Ship William Gally, of which one Partridge was Master, and that it was lost near the Canaries; That he did give him a Guinea, when he was never on board any such Ship as a Mariner, nor knew any thing of her being lost. That afterwards being concerned in his Mind for what he had done, the Prisoner said, if he did go back, he should lose 500 l. and threatned to put the Law in Execution against him.

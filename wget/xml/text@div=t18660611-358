                  </hi>. I am in the china and glass trade, and I am the husband of the prosecutrix—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in the prisoner's writing—I know his writing—he was a shopman employed at Jacob's in the Haymarket, where I was employed—we were about ten months in the same shop—my wife is in her confinement, and not able to come out—I knew he was paying his addresses to my wife before I married her—I was paying her my addresses at the same time—she preferred me, and married me—my wife's master is not here—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are written by my wife's sister—I cannot swear to her writing—she is here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you go to Mr. Jacob's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was the second Monday in July, 1865—I am not quite positive—when I went there my present wife was in the service—I think she had been there about ten months—I cannot say for certain—I cannot say whether the defendant had been there about twelve months—it was the talk of the shop that the defendant and my present wife were keeping company together—it was a "chaffing" shop—I knew he was paying his addresses, but I did not know he wanted to marry her—if I had thought he wanted to marry her I should not have thought it right to interfere—I cannot say whether she was con<lb></lb>stantly walking out with him on Sundays—I continually went out with her on Sundays—I remember once going to Charing-cross; she told me the prisoner had dodged about the cabs—I cannot say that she concealed from him that I paid attention to her—I don't know that she has received money from him—I know that he alleges it—her sister is here—I took a summons out against him for ringing the bell on the 14th of March, and he was fined 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the Marylebone police-court—these letters were written afterwards—they were written to my wife's mother—she is not here, as the Magistrate said she is not a proper witness—her evidence was not taken at the police-court, she not being able to read or write—I said nothing to Mr. Jacobs after the fine of 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. until I received the letters—after I received the letters I complained—I did not refer all the matters in dispute to my master—I did not tell him the whole subject of complaint I had to make against the defendant—he was not dismissed in consequence of my complaint—he was in their employment till the day he was committed for trial—I don't know whether he was dismissed and then taken back again—my master dismissed me after I went before the Magistrate—when I came back I was told I might go—from what I have heard since the prisoner was there until</p>

               <p>the committal—my master dismissed me from my not being able to attend to business, owing to the worry and excitement of this—I was married on the 4th of February, 1866—last July was the time I went into the service.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Explain about the summons and the bell-ringing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think about the 7th of March the prisoner, as I was leaving our employment at half-past 9 at night, placed in my hands a letter, in which he stated that he had been familiar with my wife before her marriage to me, and that he was the father of the child she was then pregnant with—he said he had given her money for that purpose, and intended to have that money returned—that was in the letter—this money he intended to have, and would not desist till he had it—he never <hi rend="italic">said</hi> anything to me about it—several times he called at my house in my absence, and wished to see my wife, and demanded the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did on 14th of March—he called then early in the afternoon—he had commenced annoying by ringing the bell about twenty minutes in the evening, during my absence—I remained at home—he then came and kept ringing the bell, and I gave him in custody.</p>

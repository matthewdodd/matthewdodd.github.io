                  </hi>. I am a plumber, of 10, Church Road, Chelsea—on 4th March I had a bank book of the National Penny Bank in my pocket—I made the prisoner's acquaintance that day in a lodging house, and missed the book about 4 o'clock or a quarter past, and have never seen it since—I went to stop the payment and was shown my name is a book which was not my signature.</p>

I engaged you to go with me to the lodging where my bank book was left for safety—we had been to two butcher's shops before that and to a grocer's—I was to give you two shillings—we did not go to a public-house—you were with me when I received my bank book and put it into this pocket; I afterwards changed it into my trousers pocket, and we went to Kensington and met a party there—I did not lose the book in a house there but in the street—1 did not pull it out with my handkerchief, I had no handkerchief—I changed the book from my outside pocket to my inside pocket, as I had to go up a ladder—I lost you in High Street, Kensington—we went into no public-house—I was never in the Admiral Keppel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the National Penny Bank, Marlborough Road, Chelsea—the prosecutor had an account there—on Monday, 4th March, about 6.40, the prisoner came and showed me a depositor's book in the name of David Clarke—he said that it was his own and he wanted to draw out all the money, which was £2—the clerk asked him if the book was his own; he said "Yes," and the clerk handed the book to me—I asked him his name, he said "George" and then "William Clark"—I handed him the depositors' withdrawal book—he signed it David Clarke—we compared it with the depositor's signature book—it did not agree and we asked him to account for the difference—he said that he was drunk when he signed the signature book—we refused to pay the money and he went away saying that if we lived by other people's money we should not by him—he took the book with him—he came back in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour and asked if we</p>

               <p>would pay him £1 of the money—we refused until he could bring a re<lb></lb>spectable witness to identify him—shortly afterwards Clarke came in and stopped the book—I showed him the prisoner's signature.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective B</hi>). On 4th March, about 7.30, I met Clarke in Marlborough Road, and went with him to the National Penny Bank and from there to 10, Church Road, where I saw the prisoner in the kitchen with a number of others—I called him out and told him he would be charged with stealing a bank book from the prosecutor's person and endeavouring to obtain the money from the bank—he said that he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station—I have not found the book.</p>

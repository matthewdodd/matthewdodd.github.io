The prisoner Parry's brother-in-law was my apprentice; she used to come backward and forward for work which he did at home - we never delivered any of these articles to her; we have missed an immense quantity of goods from our back warehouse. On the 31st of May I went with Martin and Forster to Moon's house, in Creed-lane, and found a small quantity of brass claw feet and escutcheons - part of them were in a little box; Moon was at home, and acknowledged that she had bought a great quantity of such things of Parry, who was shewn to her, and that she had given her 5d. a pound for the escutcheons and feet; they were all quite new, and cost me after the rate of 30s. a pound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Which of the articles will you venture to swear to? A. I do not swear to any of them, but they are part of what Parry acknowledged to have taken - I have been told Moon said she was married, but I never saw her husband; Parry's brother never worked on brass - I have missed 50 lbs. weight of goods; I was missing things every day - nobody could buy them as old brass; they were not exposed for sale at her house - they are quite new and are made at Birmingham.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. On the 31st of May I apprehended Parry, at Mr. Barber's, and took her to Moon's house; the name of John Moon is over the door, but I found no man there - Parry wished to say something to me; I told her to be cautious what she said, as I must state it here; she said all the property she had taken she had sold to Mrs. Moon, in Creed-lane - I met Martin on the road, and desired him to take her into Moon's house; I went in afterwards - Parry saw the things found there, and said, in Moon's presence, that she had sold them to her; Moon said she gave her, I think, 6d. a lb. for them - Parry said she had got 5 1/2d. a lb. for them; I found three claws and an escutcheon in a small box in the parlour; also three small locks and keys - Martin found more property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The things found, I suppose, are worth 2d.? A. I am not a judge; Moon said she had asked Parry how she came by them, and she said her father or brother gave them to her - not that they had made them, nor that she had placed them in her window for sale - she said she had taken them to Petticoat-lane for sale.</p>

            . I am a City patrol. I went with Foster and Parry to Moon's house - I found Moon in the parlour, which appeared to be used as a shop; I asked Moon if she knew Parry - she said she did, and that a few days before she had bought about thirteen brushes of her for 18d., and had sold them in Petticoat-lane to people who came by in the street; I asked if she had bought anything else of her - she said Yes, some old brass at different times, about 2 lbs., for which she gave her 13d. or 14d. in all; not being aware that the prosecutors had lost brass, I said I was not looking for brass, but brushes - Mr. Barber and Forster came in at that moment, and said he had lost a great deal of brass furniture; we asked if she had any of it left - she went to the trunk and pulled out three or four of the brass things; I pulled out some - she said that was all she had left; she was questioned and said she had dealt with Parry for about three months - that she asked her where she got the things, and she said they were her father's or brother's, and said Parry had stated that what she gave 1 1/2d. for, her brother could get 2 1/2d. for, over the water; Parry said in her hearing that she had sold her a vast number of things at different times - none of the brass was exposed to view; I never saw her husband - her daughter was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Parry deny receiving 13d. or 14d. for them? A. Parry always said she did not give more than 5d. or 5 1/2d. a pound; she did not deny telling her she had them from her brother: Moon said she was no judge of the articles, and bought them by weight; nobody could buy them as old brass.</p>


               <p>JURY. Q. Did any business appear to be carried on there? A. She deals in old clothes, rags, and phials.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does this brass appear new or old? A. Quite new; she had but one room.</p>

            , JUN. I am in partnership with my father. We have lost a quantity of property, and Parry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030028"></xptr>confessed to taking it; these articles cost 30s. or 33s. a pound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you in a large way of business? A. Yes. Parry's brother covered boxes with leather; he did not work on brass: we missed most of the property the beginning of April - her brother seldom came except on Saturday, to receive his money; Parry said she had been in the habit of taking articles of this description, and others which we lost, at various times, for the last nine months; she had been told if she confessed who she sold them to she would be dealt mercifully with - my father told her so, but she had before that said she had been in the habit of selling them; she had been brought back by the officer with some of our brushes, and I believe she told who she sold the property to, before my father promised to be lenient.</p>
               <p>MR. BARBER. I looked at her, and said, "Have you been robbing me in this way?" A. She said, "If you will be merciful I will tell you all;" I said I would recommend her as well as I could - when the things were produced at Moon's she said she had sold them to her; I said nothing to induce Moon to make a statement.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did you not tell us this before? A. It did not strike you to ask me, or I should have stated it; I intended to recommend her strongly to mercy, but I could not let her go - she told me she had taken some things before; I said I would be lenient, and she acknowledged taking several things, but not that she had sold them to Moon.</p>
               <p>MOON's Defence. I asked if they were her own - she said Yes, and that her father sent her with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Highgate, and deal with Mr. Anstee. On 5th or 6th July I paid the prisoner 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not remember which day it was—it was money due to Mr. Anstee—a little ticket was produced—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he receipted it at the same time—here are two bills, one is for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the other for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he receipted them both—I do not think he put his name, he wrote on them—I lent him a pencil to do it with—here is the pencil mark, but it is nearly rubbed out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. George Howell, of Finchley<lb></lb>common; he deals with Mr. Anstee. On 6th July the prisoner brought some meat to my master's house—there was 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. owing—I gave him a sove<lb></lb>reign to bring the change back, and I gave him the book to receipt—he took away the book and sovereign—he never brought back the change.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> It was not my intention to defraud Mr. Anstee, but I met with two or three men, butchers, and had a glass of ale with one and another till I got rather excited, and did not know what I was about; after I found out my error I sent the money back to Mr. Anstee to recompense him; This is my first offence; I have a wife and two children; I was coming back to Highgate when I was taken.</p>

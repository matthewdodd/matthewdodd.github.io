I am a carpenter, of 26, Blantyre Street, Chelsea—I was in the King's Road about 12.30, and saw Davey holding the prosecutor, just outside a coffee-shop door, on the pavement—several others were there—Davey pushed him on towards Stanley Bridge, and said that he was going to take him to Fulham Station—one of the men said "Don't go over the bridge, or it will be all wrong"—I saw no blow struck, but the prose<lb></lb>cutor's face was all over blood—the blood ran on to the desk at the station—I did not see Bowerman.</p>

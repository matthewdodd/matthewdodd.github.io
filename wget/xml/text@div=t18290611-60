I had been up to Paddington with fourteen sheep; I was returning, and met the prisoner in Oxford-street - I had then about 24s. in my pocket; there were some half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences - they were loose in my pocket; the prisoner pleaded poverty, and asked charity - he said he was a gardener and a nurseryman: I said would he do a day's work - he said Yes; I said I would give him one to-morrow - I then took and treated him with some liquor and beer, and filled his belly; I drank rather too much. went out into the street, and fell asleep by a dunghill, in a livery stable-yard; the prisoner was the last person whom I remember being with me - I was taken to the watchhouse, and found myself there the next morning, and missed all my money.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor come into King-street, Golden-square, about half-past seven o'clock; the prosecutor was very drunk, and a number of boys were teasing him - he offered to fight them; he had two half-crowns in his hand - the prisoner ran up to him, and said, "I will hold your money;" one of the half-crowns fell on the ground - he then sat down; I went and touched him - he then went down the yard; we sat him on a dunghill, and he fell asleep - the prisoner was sitting by him; I saw him while I was cleaning my master's horse, feeling in his pockets - I saw him take out some half-crowns, shillings, sixpences, and coppers, and a very bright farthing; I went and fetched the officer - I do not think the prisoner was sober.</p>

            . I went and saw the prosecutor sound asleep, and the prisoner sitting by his side; I asked what he had done with the money which he had taken from his pockets; he said, "I have taken none;" I said, "Don't say so, you have been seen to take it;" he then said, "I have put it back again;" I searched him, and found only sixpence farthing; he then clapped his hands to his side, and said again, "I have got nothing but a pair of trousers;" as he did that, the flap of the trousers fell open, and I saw this money; he then said it was his pension - he afterwards said it was Stevens' money, and that he took it to take care of - here are four crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence.</p>

I went into the public-house; there were some women with him; when they had eaten what they liked, they gave me the rest, and we went into the gin place, and had some rum, and then went to some other places, and had some more liquor: they had a dog with them; the prosecutor said he would match it against any dog in England; he then threw some money down; I took it up, and gave it him: when we went out, he fell down; we then went down by the wall, and there, so help me God Almighty, he gave me the two half-crowns - I took and laid him on the straw; I meant to give him the money again.</p>

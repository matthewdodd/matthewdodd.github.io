            . I am a wheelwright. On the 11th of May, I missed these iron out of Mr. Ireland yard; I went to the different iron shops in search of them, at last I went into the prisoners shop in Well-street, I asked him if he had any irons half a yard long that crewed at each end; he said he believed he had one or two; I looked at them, he then brought me out fifteen, all that I had lost. These are the irons; he told me that they had been made for a cart, and that the man had gone in the country. I agreed to give him sixpence a piece for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he produce them from - A. From under a bench; they were not expose to sale. I do not think this took them.</p>

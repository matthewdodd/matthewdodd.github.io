               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you not sworn before that he brought you 15s. from her? A. That was on the 19th of March; I have a book in which I enter all I receive; I received none from him that day on her account. I have not the book here, but a copy of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then, except from the book, you do not know that he did not bring you 10s. from her that day? A. My book tells all I receive. I have a letter which I received from him on the 16th of April.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was not that letter delivered to you on condition that you should receive a bill of exchange for the amount? A. No - my wife had seen his sister; I received it on no condition; he said he was very sorry, and gave me a list of sums he had received from different people, amounting to 12l. or 14l.; he left me on the 7th of April, without notice; the note is his hand-writing; If he had staid till Saturday 23s. would be due to him; sometimes when he has paid money on Saturday I have said, "Take your 23s." (note read.)</p>
               <p>SIR, - It is with the deepest regret I have to acknowledge my improper conduct, but I entreat you not to make public my disgrace, as in a few days I will make every thing good; there is a sum deficient, which I will forward you. I have enclosed the account of my day's bread. Circumstances would have enabled me in a few days to make all deficiences correct if I had continued till then, &amp;c.</p>

When they came there, they were told she was gone to her Husband in Ludgate. They followed, found her, and told her they were come to search her Lodging.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172412040005"></xptr> A Man that was with her would have had the key to have gone to her Lodging before them. She readily offered to give it him; but the Prosecutor would not suffer it, thinking that his Design was to remove some of the Goods before any other came there. K. Keys then desired them not to expose her, and she would go with them quietly. They went, and there found 9 Ells of Gulix Holland, which appeared to be part of the 12 Ells which the Prosecutors had lost. By examining her, they understood that

             was another Acquaintance of Jack Sheppard's, and that she and Ned Betty (the other Prisoner) frequently lay together lay together at his Lodging in Litchfield-Street. Thither they went with a Search Warrant, and found a Pair of the Prosecutor's Shoes, but neither Kate Cook nor her Bedfellow. From thence they went to another Lodging that belong'd to Cook in Cranborn-Alley, Leicester-Fields, where Kate Keys and she sometimes lived together, and of which Kate Keys had the Key. Here was likewise no body at home, but they found the Prosecutor's Sword, the remaining 3 Ells of Holland, and a Basket with Thieving Tools, and Jack Sheppard's Feetlocks and Handcuffs in it. Mr. Gowder, at the Dolphin Alehouse in Long Alley, Moorfields, depos'd, that on the 3d of Nov. about six in the Morning, the Prisoners came to his House with a Bundle of Goods, and called for Drink. They were very earnest in whispering, and often mention'd the Name of Jack Sheppard, which made him suspect the Goods were stolen. When they had drank 2 or 3 Pints, they went out to seek for a Lodging, and in the mean time this Evidence and his Man searched the Bundle, in which they found several Wigs, a Coat, Gown, Petticoat, and several other Goods tumbled together. This increasing his suspicion, he went for a Constable, and at his Return was inform'd, that Ned Betty had been there again for the Bundle, and was just gone to the Black Dog, to which Place he went with the Constable and other Assistance, and there apprehended all the Prisoners. They found a Silver Handled Knife and Fork, a Silver Spoon, a Watch, Ring, and other Goods in Kate Cook's Stockings. She confess'd that she had them from Jack Sheppard, and added, with a vulgar double Entendre, that she was Jack Sheppard's Washerwoman, and had many a time wash'd his three Pieces betwixt her ***. She farther told them, that Ned Betty was entirely innocent, for she had only hired him as a Porter to carry the Bundle. These Depositions being corroborated by other Witnesses, the Prisoners then made their Defence.</p>
               <p>Edward Betty protested that he was wholly ignorant of the Matter, that he was hired to carry the Bundle for a Shilling; and as to the Shoos that were found at his Lodging, they were sent him by Kath Cook. Kath Keys in her Defence, said, that she was a Seamstress, and the Linnen that was found in her Room was brought her by a Gentleman to make him 3 Shirts. Kath Cook in Defence of herself and Ned Betty, said, that the Shoos were left her in Pawn, but the Owner never came to redeem them; that she wash'd Linnen for Ned, and he coming to her for a Shirt, and seeing the Shoos, desired her to lend them him, which she did: That he knew nothing of the other Goods which they were taken with in Long-Alley; and that he never cohabited with her, as was reported. As to her own part, she said the Bundle was brought to her one Morning by a Coachman, whom she had no Knowledge of. She asked him who they belong'd to; but he would not tell her, but bid her take Care of them, and the Gentleman that own'd them would be with her in the Evening. This Gentleman proved to be Jack Sheppard, who told her that they were his Wife's Cloaths; that she took Sheppard for a very honest Man, and did not in the least imagine that the Goods were stolen, till afterwards she heard that he was apprehended. She own'd indeed that she had known Sheppard two Years, and that she became acquainted with him by living next door to his Master when he was an Apprentice; and yet she pretended to be ignorant of his ever being in Newgate, tho his twice escaping from thence had been the common Discourse of the whole Nation. She then called two Witnesses to prove that she was not in Company with Sheppard that Night the Robbery was committed.

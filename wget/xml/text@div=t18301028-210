               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. She spoke to him about the tools as her husband's? A. Yes - I know Reardon; I told him if he would pay me for my tools it was all I wanted - I did not say if I was satisfied I would get the bill thrown out; I said I would not prosecute if paid for the tools, as I found the prisoner bore a good character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to Reardon or he come to you? A. He came to me at the office, with several people, and begged me to do away with the charge - I believe Peaty was in distress; her husband works on the road.</p>

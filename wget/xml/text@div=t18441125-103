                  </hi>. I live at No. 17, Park-street, Grosvenor-square—the house No. 16, Park-street, belongs to me. In Oct., 1843, I had that house with its furniture to let—a person named Beaumont waited upon me—he represented himself as a house agent and agent of the prisoner—there was an agreement talked of about the house No. 16—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner on the 23rd of Oct.—before I signed the agreement I required a reference, and the prisoner referred me to Mr. Corbould, the artist—the reference was quite satisfactory, so much so, that I agreed to let the pri<lb></lb>soner have the house—this is the agreement—the time<lb></lb>piece, the shelf, and the other articles named in this indictment, are enumerated in it—there were some cut decanters and nine wine<lb></lb>glasses, which were furnished by his request before he entered—he came into possession on the 24th—when the rent was due I did not get a farthing—I have had to pay 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a<lb></lb>year for the house besides the taxes—this is the time<lb></lb>piece that was in the house, and it is my property—I never gave him authority to sell or to pawn it.</p>

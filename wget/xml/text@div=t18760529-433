I live at 37, Charles Street, Hatton Garden; I let the shop and parlour to Hall in the name of Ralph Francis Hall—he gave me as a reference Mr. Watson, 180, Gray's Inn Road, but on second considera<lb></lb>tions he said that he was out of town, and named. Mr. Shaw, of 163, Great Dover Street—I wrote to that address, and received this'letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed "James Shaw" and stated that he had known Mr. Hall some years, and considered him a respectable man, and should have no objection to let premises to him, having no doubt he would make a desirable tenant.</hi>) After that Hall came and stayed from September till February—several persons came and made inquiries for him, but he was not there; he left in February without telling me that he was going, but I saw Shaw in the shop under the name of Henry Haws, and asked him about Mr. Hall—he said "Mr. Hall owed me some money, and I have given him something more and taken the business for my son"—Shaw stayed from the middle of February to 22nd March; I did not see him after that; he did not come at all, and Hall did not come back—Mr. Jones took the shop of Shaw, but in another line.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This letter—was dated 30th December; it contained the words, "The National Bank of England do not know you."</hi>) I received a telegram from Hall—on 3rd January I went up to Hall's shop—I did not see him—I was paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I could not say by whom, on 5th January, when I had promised to call—this was at 180, Gray's Inn Road—I received an order for sacks in the name of Haws on 17th December, 1875. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the writer had been referred to Mr. Wood, gave an order for sacks, and inquired how the money should be remitted.</hi>) I went up to London and looked at the premises, 58, Snow's Fields, the address given—I did not execute the order—I received another letter from the same person.

                  <hi rend="italic">The examination of the prisoner before Mr. Commissioner Holroyd on 17th Nov., 1851, was here read: he described himself as a general dealer, of No. 9, Minories, and was examined at great length as to the nature of his dealings with the bankrupt, with whom he stated he had been acquainted twelve or fourteen months, and that his dealings with him had not extended to the amount of 1,000</hi>l<hi rend="italic">.; that as he kept no shop, the dealings had generally taken place at Benjamins Coffee-house, in Duke-street, Aldgate, Abraham's Coffee-house, and St. James's Coffee-house in the same place. After stating that he had obtained from Davis various deposit notes for goods pawned by him at Attenborough and Sowerby's, his examination proceeded as follows</hi>:—"I do not remember going with the bank-rupt to a pawnbroker's in Sloane-street, named Lamb, to redeem goods and I say positively I never did go there with the bankrupt, but I did go with the bankrupt about Sept. last, but cannot say what day in particular, to a pawnbroker's of the name of Russell to redeem some goods—the bankrupt requested me to go with him to redeem those goods, assigning as a reason that he did not like to go in and sign his name; I consequently redeemed those goods, and signed my own name on that occasion on the pawnbroker's ticket—I have been to Russell's on more than one occasion, but Davis accompanied me only on one occasion—both times when I went to Russell was about Sept.—they were both the goods deposited by Davis—he told me there was a nice lot of goods which he wished me to redeem, and the bankrupt gave me the money to redeem them with, telling me at the same time that he would sell them to me and agree upon a price—there was but a short time intervening on the two occasions when I visited Russell's—the bankrupt himself had the money with which he redeemed those goods, and I did not advance it for him"—"the bankrupt gave me the money on two successive days"—"I never did, on any occasion, redeem any deposit made by Davis to Mr. Lamb, a pawn<lb></lb>broker, in Sloane-street, and that I speak positively to"—"I never sold any of Davis's goods to Barnard Phillips, of Castle-street, St. Mary Axe—in my dealings with Davis I always dealt with him in my own name and on my own account, and not as the agent of another, &amp;c." <hi rend="italic">A further examination of the prisoner on 1st Dec, 1851, was also read; after stating that the goods he had redeemed were redeemed with money furnished by the bankrupt, it pro<lb></lb>ceeded</hi>: "In your former examination you stated you had never, on any occasion, redeemed any deposits made by the bankrupt at Lamb's, a pawn<lb></lb>broker, in Sloane-street, and to that you spoke positively; was what you then said in that respect true?—It was true; and I never redeemed any goods of the bankrupt at Lamb's. Are you quite certain of what you now say in that respect?—I am quite certain of that. Now, take care what you say; did you not, on or about 8th Oct. last, accompany the bankrupt to, or meet the bankrupt at, Lamb's, in Sloane-street, and then redeem two lots of goods pledged by the bankrupt at Lamb's, one lot for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other lot for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—No, I did not; I never redeemed any lots at Lamb's—I recollect on one occasion meeting the bankrupt near the Exhibition in the evening, and he asked me to accompany him somewhere in that neighbourhood, and I did so, but it was not, to my knowledge, to a pawnbroker's—the bankrupt went in at a private door, and the bankrupt beckoned me in, and I saw the bank<lb></lb>rupt produce some letter or ticket, and I saw some goods handed out, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202020027"></xptr>
               <p>I helped the bankrupt to count out his money—I then left the room, and the bankrupt on coming out told me he had a fine lot of goods which he proposed to sell me—I cannot say whether that was at Mr. Lamb's house—upon that occasion I did not produce the money, and I did not myself redeem the goods on that occasion—Davis had the goods in a brown paper, and I declined to purchase them as it was night—I took away the goods on that occasion, as Davis said he had no great coat pocket, and I had—on the same night I gave Davis those goods, and told him I would see the goods to-morrow—Davis then went away with the goods and left me—I did on the next day see those goods—I did not buy them, as they were too good for me and too high priced—I cannot recollect whether I purchased any small portion of them or not—I cannot recollect what was about the gross value of those goods"—"I have redeemed some goods at Russell's, in Shoreditch, but I cannot say the date nor the amount, nor whose tickets they where, nor if I received the tickets from the bankrupt—I cannot say if I redeemed any goods whatever at Russell's since 17th Oct. last—I redeemed on two occasions at Russell's goods belonging to the bankrupt, but those I redeemed some time in the summer with money supplied me by the bankrupt for the purpose, and on those occa<lb></lb>sions I delivered the goods to the bankrupt—I did not, to my recollection, on 23rd Oct. last, redeem goods pledged for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Russell's, in Shoreditch—I did not, to my recollection, on 21st Oct. last, redeem goods pledged for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Russell's, in Shoreditch—the bankrupt did not give me money to redeem the goods at Russell's, which it is supposed I redeemed on 21st and 23rd Oct. last, but I do not recollect that I did redeem any such goods about that time at Russell's—I take out a great quantity of goods which are pledged by other persons all over London, and I cannot recollect one transaction of that kind from the other," &amp;c.</p>

On 24th Oct. last T became a bankrupt—I had carried on business for eight or nine months preceding my bankruptcy as a general dealer—I from time to time obtained goods from Messrs. Holland, and other persons—I think I first bad dealings with Heilbron, in the early part of the year, I had one or two little dealings with him in the early part of the year—I began to have extensive dealings with him about the month of June—between that time and my bankruptcy I received from him, for goods, as near as I can possibly state, about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was not much difference between the value of the silver goods I sold him and what I was to have given for them to the persons from whom I obtained them—in the gold goods there was a considerable difference, I should say nearly one half—I cannot say what proportion of the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for gold goods—I should say about a couple of hundred pounds was for silver goods, but I cannot say positively—the rest were gold—I sold them at about half the price that I was charged for them—I did not give any invoice with the goods before Sept.—there had been sales before Sept., beyond 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; some 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., some 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and upwards, and some 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave invoices at the request of Heilbron—he said that the persons he was acting for required invoices—I recollect pledging some goods at Lamb's, a pawnbroker's, in Sloane-street—I received these deposit notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the days on which I pledged the goods—one day was the 5th, and the other the 12th of May—I pawned various kinds of things on those occasions—there were gold chains and watches on the 5th to the amount of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I think I pawned a gold watch and a diamond ring then; and on the 12th, gold watches, gold chains, studs, and several diamond rings, to the amount of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those goods were redeemed, I think, in the early part of Oct.—Heilbron and I went</p>

Holland and Son—I made several purchases of them in Sept.—I recollect that I had some forks and spoons, I do not recollect exactly the number—it was about five dozen fiddle-pattern—I cannot recollect the weight—I sold them to Heilbron—I do not know whether it was the following day after I got them, or the day after—I had a pair of sugar-tongs and a sugar-spoon—I sold one pair of sugar-tongs and spoon to Heilbron, but I had sold a sugar-tong the week previous to another person—I have seen Barnard Phillips, but not to know him personally—shortly before my bank<lb></lb>ruptcy I did not know how to act or what to do, and Heilbron advised me that the best I could do was to say that <hi rend="italic">Dick, Tom</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> had the goods, and they could not do anything to me, or something to that effect—I cannot exactly say the words.</p>

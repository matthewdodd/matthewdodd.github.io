I said what was that to him; he said he wanted money; I said, for what? he insisted he would have my money, and d - d my eyes; the watchman heard him, and he came up; Watts took the prisoner by the breast, and we gave him in charge to the watchman; the watchman would not take charge of him without Watts and I; as we were carrying him along, there came his gang, three or four of them; they fell to knocking us and the watchman about like any thing; we called out, watchman! and the other watchman came to our assistance; then they ran away; then we got the prisoner to the Round-house; after that, the prisoner wanted to make it up.</p>

            . Mr. Malcome and I were coming along Cranbourn-alley; the prisoner came up, and asked him where he was going; he said, what is that to you; the prisoner directly said, I want money, d - n my eyes; the watchman being but at a little distance, came up, but the prisoner had repeated them words again; first I catched the prisoner by the breast, and said to the watchman, I give you charge of this man; the watchman said, I will not take charge of him, without he gives charge of you; then he gave charge of us; then the watchman and we went on the top of Newport-market; there came four men about us all at once; they said to the prisoner, will you go that way? and kicked out the watchman's lanthorn; then they began beating us about; I and the watchman had hold of the prisoner; one of them got to hauling the watchman's stick away; I got a kick on my private parts; I thought I must give way; but seeing another watchman coming up with his lanthorn, I thought I would hold out a little longer; at his coming up, they ran off all together.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was within about ten yards of them when the prisoner stopped them; there were four of them in all; they had walked once or twice by me that Monday night before this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Bullock. I did; he commonly walked Cranbourn-alley and about Leicester-fields on nights; there are about thirteen or fourteen of them that belong to that company; they resort at the King's-arms in Prince's-street; there is another company which have a pretty many bull-dogs belonging to them, but these have none. The prisonerca me up to the prosecutor, and said, money; he wanted money, and d - d his eyes, and said money he would have. Then I came up directly to them; the prosecutor charged me with the prisoner; after that, the prisoner charged me with them. I said to them, do you take care of the prisoner, and I will be answerable for you, if you assist me, for I knew we should be attacked. The prisoner went very quietly with me till his companions came up; they said to him, d - n you, will you go quietly with that man? then he began striking me, and the man that had hold of him; they got hold of my staff, and kicked out my light; we called out, and there were three or four watchman coming from Newport-market; they ran off, and left the prisoner in our custody.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were they when they first came up to the watch-house?</p>
               <p>Bullock. They were within three or four yards of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they walking as people walk in common?</p>
               <p>Bullock. No, they were coming together in a skulking manner, and I knew them to be skulkers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Bullock. To tell the truth, I do not think he was right sober; he had been drinking at the King's-arms with one Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen one man rob another, and not make use of his hands?</p>
               <p>Bullock. I have seen that done in Cranbourn-alley before now: they first br quarrels, two of them will go to fighting, in the mean time they go to picking of pockets; that I often see.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of another gang, what gang is that?</p>
               <p>Bullock. It is well known in the parish, there is a gang of about 50; that gang has been complained of to Justice Welch, and at the Rotation-office; there has been warra nts out, and some of them have been taken; they have bull dogs with them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had been drinking at a public-house; I got much in liquor, and met them two gentlemen in Cranbourn-alley; we had a few words together; I had no intention upon them; I had left my company at the public-house, and was going home; these two men charged me, and I charged them, and we went to the watch-house together.</p>

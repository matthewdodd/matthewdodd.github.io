                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 4). About 4 o'clock on the morning of 11th February, I was called to Gould-square, Cooper's-row, Crutched Friars, and received some information from Mr. Halm that some persons were on the roof of the adjoining premises—three other constables came up, and we made a search over the roof, and searched also a cooperage, but found roof trace of the prisoners—I found some boots there—we then searched the roof of the adjoining premises, and on the roof of Mr. Barber's cooperage we found a quantity of lead cut from the roof—two pieces were folded up, and another piece was lying flat in the gutter—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was recently cut—I compared it with the places it was cut from, and it matched—I then went to Mr. Statham's stable, and after about two hours got him to bring the key—I went in, and saw another constable find Lopman under the manager, covered with straw, and no boots on—Connor was found in a shed; he escaped through a window, I believe—Lopman got into the stable through a small square of glass—the lock was forced from the cooperage; this is it—we found that out afterwards—it was found by some person there—it was left secure the night previous—both the prisoners claimed the boots I had found, and put them on.</p>

About 6 o'clock on the morning of the 11th, I went with Pitney, and found Connor in a lumber room or warehouse, which could be entered from Mr. Statham's stable—I believe I got in the same way as the prisoner, through a broken window—he was crouched down, with his shoes off.</p>

My premises are close to Mr. Barber's cooper<lb></lb>age—about 3 o'clock on this morning, some noise disturbed me—I listened first in bed, and then opened the window, and remained there perhaps about fifteen minutes—I could see something like a face on the roof—it was not moving at all till the policeman came in from Gould-square—it then began to move, and did not know which way to go.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor, and had been with him about three months - I secreted these books of gold in his shop, and took them away without his knowledge: I took them on Monday evening, the 26th of June, to the prisoner, Mrs. Solomons (I had been there once before with a gold ring) - when I got to the shop I saw a boy there; I asked for Mrs. Solomons, and the prisoner came down stairs, preceded by another lady - I asked if they would buy the gold; they made no answer, but the other lady took the books of gold from me, and began rubbing it out of the books into the scale with her finger - Mrs. Solomons either asked the boy for a knife, or took a desert knife and scraped it into the scale - two young men then came to inquire about a brooch - they made some remark, and left the door open; Mrs. Solomons then called out,"Shut the door;" when they were gone the other lady asked if it was not half a crown a penny weight they gave for the gold - Mrs. Solomons made no answer, but sent the boy out for change; I do not know what I was to get for the gold - I was taken into custody at the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How old are you? A. About sixteen; I was at Mr. Wace's before I was turned over to my uncle, Mr. Davison - I had never stolen any thing before this; my uncle had not told me he had missed property before this; Mrs. Solomons' is a refiners shop - I had been there before, and sold some rags for Mr. Wace,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050109"></xptr>and gave him the money; I assisted in turning out these books of leaf gold - some of it did fall about; I had not turned any out before Mrs. Solomons came down - Mrs. Solomons took a knife or a spatula, and turned it into a bit of paper, and then put it into the scale; there was no price asked for it - if there is a wind, leaf gold will blow away; she desired the door to be shut - I did not hear the boy say that; I did not hear the prisoner say that Mr. Solomons must be sent for - when the boy came back with the change, she the officer was in the shop, and then the prioner said "Is Mr. Solomons coming;" I was then taken up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your master did not know you were going there? A. No.</p>

             (Police-constable C 71). I was on duty, and met Green and McLeod; I went to the prisoner's shop - I saw her and another woman there, and the witness; I asked how he got that gold - he said he had been sent with it by his master, or an errand boy had been sent for it, who had crumpled it up, and they could not use it, and his master sent him to sell it; Mrs. Solomons had a spoon or a knife scraping it out - it is not all out now - it was nearly nine o'clock at night.</p>

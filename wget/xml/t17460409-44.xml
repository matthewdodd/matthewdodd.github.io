               <p>Council. May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am Council in this Prosecution against the Defendant, who is now in Judgment before you for an Offence, we apprehend, he has has been guilty of against an Act of Parliament made in the Time of King William the Third for preventing the Growth of Popery: 'Tis not a Spirit of Persecution, but Self-preservation, that makes us enforce that Law at this time of Day. If our Ancestors thought it necessary, at that Time, to put a further Restriction upon the Attempts of designing artful Men, who endeavour to seduce and inveigle People away from the Religion in which they were brought up, I believe it will be the Judgment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174604090037"></xptr> of every one that observes what Times we are fallen into, that we ought to oppose the Designs of our cunning Adversaries, who are endeavouring to seduce the People from the pure Religion exercised in this Kingdom. The Indictment on which the Defendant stands accused is grounded on an Act of Parliament made in the 11th and 12th Years of his Majesty King William the Third, which has expresly prohibited the Exercise of the Popish Religion, in any Degree whatsoever. If the Protestants abroad should attempt the publick Exercise of their Religion, they would be try'd by Rage and Fury, not left to the Judgment of twelve Men, but to the Inquisition, &amp;c. But we permit all to come to a Trial fairly and upon Oath. This, Gentlemen, I thought proper to mention to you; because 'tis extremely necessary some Stop should be put to Men that endeavour to draw away People from the true Protestant Religion. 'Tis evident that the Defendant has endeavour'd to seduce People by celebrating one of the Sacraments, in baptizing a Child in the Popish Way. Gentlemen, it seems the present Defendant, Mr.

               <p>Slowman. My Lord, I believe that he is so. My Lord, about five or six Weeks before last Christmas I was, with some Friends I met, at the Portuguese Chapel in Warwick-Street, and I saw Mr. Monford there; three of them were dress'd all alike, and three Boys dress'd in a different Manner.</p>

               <p>Slowman. No.</p>

               <p>Court to the Council. Gentlemen, you must prove that he is a Popish Priest; the Witness says he only saw him in the Popish Chapel; by the same reason it may be said this Gentleman is so himself.</p>

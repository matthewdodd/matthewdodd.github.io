               <p>JOHN DUFFIELD. I am a saddler, and live in Long-lane, Aldersgate-street. The prisoner, who was a perfect stranger, came to my shop, on the 5th of May, to barter a saddle for some web halters, as he told me; I asked him if any one knew him, and he said they would know him at Dixon's repository - I offered to go there with him; he seemed to acquiesce in that - I sent for my hat, and accompanied him about half the way, when he stopped short, and said it would be useless to go there, as he feared they would not recognize him; I asked him his name, and where he resided - he said his name was John Brown, and he was staying at the Fountain inn, Clapton; I asked who he was staying there with, or what he had, and he told me he had brought a horse from Norwich, or from the neighbourhood of Norwich; I told him it looked very suspicious, on account of his saying he was known at Dixon's, and then refusing to go, and I did not feel myself justified in giving up the saddle, but I would go to Clapton, and, if it was all right, I would give him the web headed halters and the sovereign, which I had agreed to do for the saddle; before I had time to go he called again, and said I had not been; I said I had not had time- I then asked if he was known to any one else; he said Yes, he was known to the person who kept the Albemarle's Head, in St. John's-square; I said, "That is a neighbour of mine, we can soon go there;" he then said he would not go there, as they had had a fall out about a pint of beer - I said I would pay for that, and give him something for going there; he still refused to go, and I then questioned him as to how he had been possessed of the horse - he said he had brought it to town for a man of the name of Johnson, who resided at Norwich; he asked me for the money, and I said I did not feel satisfied at all about paying him the money - I then asked him what he meant to do with the halters; he said, "I thought if I came and asked you to purchase the saddle out and out, you would feel some suspicion in doing so;" I then asked him his name again, and he said

             -"Why, (said I) you told me in the morning your name was Brown, and now you have a wakened my suspicions so much, that I conceive you have come by this saddle improperly, and I shall call in an officer and give you in charge," which I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q.Did he not say he was called Dobbs very frequently, and Brown, by his friends in Norfolk? A. No - he said he left the horse at Clapton, and I found that to be correct; I sent there to stop the horse - I have ascertained that he came from Norfolk; when he brought the saddle, he looked out six web-headed halters, and asked what I would give him to boot, for the saddle - he told me in the evening that a person of the name of Johnson had given him the horse and saddle to bring to London - I had expressed my doubts the first time he came, when I found he prevaricated, and would not go to Dixon's - I told him in the evening I did not like the appearance of it; I had appointed to meet him at Clapton, but he came before I had gone out - I went to the landlord of the Albermarle's Head; I asked him first if he knew a person of the name of Brown - he did not give me a direct answer; I then asked him for the name of Dobbs, and he said he had known him twelve months.</p>
               <p>JOHN BUNCE. I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and have had the saddle ever since - this is it.</p>

This saddle is mine, and was taken from my premises - I missed it about a fortnight ago, as I usually ride with it; my servants could not give me any account of it, till I heard a horse had been stolen in my neighbourhood - the prisoner had been in my service as a boy; he served under his uncle, who worked for me as a bricklayer; he left me about two years ago - the person who lost the horse lives about two miles from me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know a person named Johnson? A. No; I am not much accustomed to be at Norwich-market - the prisoner lived with me four or five years; I always thought him honest, quiet, and a civil young man - he was with my wife in Devonshire, and from thence came to London; his uncle is named Brown, and he was brought up with him; this is a common saddle, but the edge of it is plush velvet - I say positively it is mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that Johnson, a horse dealer, had given him the saddle and horse to bring to town to sell.</p>

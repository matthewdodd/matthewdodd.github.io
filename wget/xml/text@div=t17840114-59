               <p>I was coming home on new year's night; between twelve and one o'clock; I met the prisoners opposite St. Margaret's churchyard, Westminster; I went there to a house to ask for a person that would have seen me home, and these women followed me out, and rather decoyed me home with them; and scarce had I got up stairs but they used me very unhandsomely; they threw me down and stripped me of my clothes, and took four shillings and six pence out of my breeches pocket, which was all the money I had in the world.</p>
               <p>How do you know you had the money in your pocket? - I am sensible I had it in my pocket, for I wrapped it up in a piece of paper, I felt it in my pocket, and held my hand upon it during the time they forced it from me; I was not drunk; I do not use myself much to drink; I am but a poor working man, and my abilities will not admit of it, I was not in liquor, I was sober.</p>
               <p>How long had you been drinking? - About an hour and an half.</p>
               <p>No more than that? - No, I do not think I had.</p>
               <p>Where had you been till eleven o'clock? - I had been to the sign of the Star and Garter, in Palace-yard, to see a person.</p>
               <p>Had not you been drinking there? - Yes, part of two or three pints of beer.</p>
               <p>Then you had been drinking more than an hour and an half? - I was sober then.</p>
               <p>You seem to lay a stress on the word then; had you been in liquor before that evening? - No, I had not been in liquor.</p>

               <p>Where did you find the coat? - On the chair, and the buckles were put down at the head of the bedstead, they said, the man had no money about him, and he said, he lost four shillings and six-pence, the man spoke more regularly to me than he does here.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You told me they threw you down and took the money out of your pocket, how came you to undress? - They pulled the things off me in a forcible manner.</p>

               <p>About half after eleven o'clock, this young woman and me went into the church-yard to have a pint of beer, and that man got up from company; there were two girls in the house, and he was very much in liquor, and he asked us to have something to drink, and he gave us two or three glasses one after another; he followed us out and asked us to take him home; he came home along with us as well as he could walk; we got a piece of candle of a watchman, and we came up stairs and he sat down; we asked him for something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140089"></xptr> to drink; he said, no, there was nobody up; we asked him what he would make us a present of; he said, he would not give us any thing; when we went into bed, we asked him what he would give us; he said, he would give it us in the morning; with that I up with my foot and I pushed him off the bed, and he directly said he was robbed; and we had not a halfpenny in the world, only sixpence this young woman had in her pocket; with that he called watch! my clothes were half off and half on, her clothes were all off; he pulled off his things, and flung his coat in one place and his waistcoat in another.</p>

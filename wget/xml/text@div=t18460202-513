                  </hi>, Esq. I am water bailiff of the City of London, and sub-conservator of the river Thames—I have been so upwards of twenty-one years—I know a landing-place and stairs called Paul's Wharf-stairs—it is an ancient and public landing-stairs, and plying-place for boats, wherries, and all sorts of vessels—on the 20th of Jan. I received some information respecting the state of those stairs, and some vessels in front of them—I went in consequence and examined the state of the stairs on the 21st—I felt it my duty to communicate what I had observed there to the Lord Mayor, and in consequence the Lord Mayor and I went on the same day in the morning, to visit the spot together—when we arrived there there were three barges, two of them were placed in and out, from the shore, and the third up and down the stream, so as to make a floating pier, which in my judgment created an obstruction to boats coming and going from the stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> While that was there could any wherry or skiff, or barge, approach and make fast off the stairs as conveniently as they could before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would depend upon which way they were coming—if they were coming from the lower side of the pier, that is the London bridge side, they would have to row round it, if they were coming from the upper side they would get in with tole<lb></lb>rable facility—with facility indeed I should say—the Lord Mayor examined the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020066"></xptr>
               <p>state of things there with me, and in consequence directed me to remove it—during the twenty-one years I have been water-bailiff I have never known such a floating pier off those stairs before—having received instructions from the Lord Mayor to remove it, I next morning proceeded to the spot in a steam-tug, with about forty hands altogether, five or six of them were policemen I think—on arriving off the stairs I gave my men orders to remove the two barges—I know the steamboat, <hi rend="italic">Waterman No.</hi> 5, she was there that morning—she was more outside of one of the barges, the inner one of the two that I have mentioned as lying in and out from the wharf—this inner one was then nearly filled with water, and the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steam-boat was lying outside of her—by the inner one I mean the one nearest to the wharf—I described two as lying in and out from the wharf, and the one nearest the wharf I call the inner—the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> was lying outside of that, (<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan</hi>,) that is not the position in which she was at the time—she was lying outside the barge nearest the stairs—she was further out in the river—there was no barge that I saw toward the mid stream—she was lying head and stern up and down the river—about full-length, her head up towards Black<lb></lb>friars—I should say it was about ten minutes past seven in the morning when I arrived off the stairs—my men removed one of the barges with<lb></lb>out opposition, without difficulty—when she had been removed she was brought off to be made fast to the tug, in order to take her away—the one on the westward side, the one nearest to Blackfriars-bridge was the one that was first removed—I ought to mention that the barges were not in the same position in which I have described them—previous to my coming there on the following morning they had been shifted from that position—the floating pier there was not the same as it had been the day before—this is a fair description, (<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan</hi>,) no doubt of it—this is the floating pier—that is one of the barges that is in the position in which it was in the morning, lying sunk, and that was in a different position—that accurately represents the position of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> 5 on that morning, with the exception that her head was up—that is the position in which she is de<lb></lb>scribed—the three barges on the day before were moored as if to make the letter T, one on each side and the other at the top; and when I came again, the second of the two barges, which I have described as lying in and out on the 2lst, I found removed to the upper side of the piles, as seen on the plan; and the third, forming, as it were, the crossbar of the T, was removed to the lower side—they had been taken entirely away for the purposes of a pier—they were removed, as I believe, to prevent my taking them—they were removed so as to be no obstruction in the morning—these are the two outer ones—the one lying up and down the river, and the outer<lb></lb>most of those which were lying in and out, had been removed away—nothing remained but the barge which was moored in and out nearest to the shore, and that was sunk—it was full of water, or nearly so, when I arrived there—all three of the barges were made fast by chains in the morning, in the positions to which they had been removed—they were made fast in those separate places—they were certainly not placed there for any purpose of business, and had no business to be lying there, made fast—I do not say that it was an improper position at all—there was one sunk and full of water—it might have been an accident—it was not proper, of course, to be full of water—I do not know how the sunken barge had been sunk, and got full of water—at the time we were tak<lb></lb>ing away the third barge there were several persons on board—the second barge I took away, which I described as having been taken away without difficulty, was lying on the upper side of the piles—the remaining one was lying on the other side—their original position was, one moored in and out nearest the shore,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020067"></xptr>
               <p>one in and out a straight line continuing that, and one across; and in the morning I found the two outer ones removed away, and moored not in any im<lb></lb>proper situation—it was the second one I moved away—I removed the second and third—the one lying on the upper side of the piles was removed without much difficulty—the third was lying on the lower side of the piles, and there there was a scuffle—I moved the one on the upper side first—I did not see anybody in her at that time—when she had been moved she was made fast to my steam-tug by chain and rope—I afterwards directed my people to remove the third barge, that is the one that formed the T end, the one lying to the east down the river—there were persons on board that barge—I do not know how many—it was not fairly daylight—I could see there were persons, but I could not undertake to say how many—there were persons on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman, No.</hi> 5—the defendant Kinchin was on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman, No.</hi> 5, at that time, I could not make him out, but he was on board—I do not know that I knew him by name before—I knew his person—I have seen him often—I knew him as acting as captain of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman, No.</hi> 5—I saw him on board her that morning—upon my people pro<lb></lb>ceeding to remove the third barge a scuffle took place between my people and the people on board the barge—I cannot describe what sort of a scuffle it was—I was not near enough to see—I was on board the tug—I could see there was a scuffle and that is all—my people succeeded in taking possession of this second barge, they brought it off to my tug—she was also made fast with ropes and chains to the steam tug—when these two barges had been made fast to my steam-tug, some of my people were on board both of them—having taken the two barges in tow, I proceeded to tow them away to some place of safety—I do not know what power my tug was—I should think I had got 300 yards with these two barges in tow, going eastward—it was my intention to take them to the Commercial Dock, which is below Lon<lb></lb>don Bridge—when the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>, boat <hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 5, came at us full speed, I should say, and cut the barges adrift from the tug boat—she ran in between me and the barges I had in tow, and cut them adrift—it was done with very great violence, so much so that I think the lives of all the parties on board the barges were in very great danger—the effect of the shock was that it tore part of the barge out, and they were separated—our steam-boat was somewhat damaged also—I had the two barges again made fast to my steam-tug—I cannot say exactly what position the <hi rend="italic">Waterman No.</hi> 5 took while this was being done—but as soon as ever we had made fast she was ready to come at us again—as soon as we had made fast the two barges again, she made a second attempt to cut them adrift—she did not succeed that time, we had made the two barges fast with a stronger chain—she got entangled with us and the barges—she got in between the stern of the tug and the barges—I am not able to say whether she set on her power—she certainly kept on her steam—she did not back to get clear of us—the effect of her hanging on us entangled in this way was to pre<lb></lb>vent us from taking our course down the river, and instead of that kept turn<lb></lb>ing us round and round in the river—I cannot say I entertained much appre<lb></lb>hension for the parties on board, at that time, but for those navigating the river—it was dangerous for those coming up and down at this time—we were sweeping from one side to the other—I did not feel any apprehension for myself, but for the parties navigating the river—me and my people did all we could to get clear of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman No.</hi> 5—we were not able to do so till we took posses<lb></lb>sion of the wheel—in consequence of not being able to clear I gave my people orders to board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> and take possession of her wheel—my people boarded the steam-boat—Kinchin was on board at that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020068"></xptr>
               <p>time—when?my people endeavoured to take possession of the steamer, his men resisted it—it had got light at this time—there was resistance offered—I saw it—the resistance was shoving them back, and when my watermen attempted to get possession of the wheel, they held on to prevent them from taking it—Kinchin did not personally resist—he was on the paddle-box—I did not observe whether or not he was giving orders and directions to his men to make that resistance—I do not know that any of his men had weapons in their hands—my people succeeded in getting possession of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>—we eventually got clear by having taken possession of the wheel—I know the defendant Dadd—I saw him while the struggle was taking place—he had an anchor, stock in his hand—having got clear, I pro<lb></lb>ceeded in my steam-tug, with the two barges in tow, towards London-bridge, leaving the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steam-boat behind—when we had got near London<lb></lb>bridge, I saw the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> coming after us again—a part of my men were left on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>, in possession of her wheel—none of my men were on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman No.</hi> 5, when she got near London-bridge, I had put some on board—they had got rid of them—I did not see how—I saw there were none of them on board—I do not know what had become of them—when she came towards us the third time, near London-bridge, she came at considerable speed, (I should not say at full speed,) that was very near to London-bridge—when she approached us, she ran in between the barges, and the steam-boat, as she had done twice before—we got through the bridge with our barges in tow—we were forced over towards the Custom-house, by her being foul of us—she kept foul of us, the effect of which was to force us off our course—the river is pretty crowded off the Custom-house stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it convenient for the public purposes that you should be driven off there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very dangerous—after we had been driven in this way off Custom-house stairs, the defendant Dadd came on board our tug, and asked me to let him have one of the barges—he did not say what for—I told him I would not give up either without the Lord Mayor's orders—the Commercial Dock is lower down the river—I did not take the barges there, because I considered I should be endangering the lives of the persons I employed, and the public navigation of the river, if I had proceeded any further—I therefore moored the barges off the Custom-house Quay, and agreed to go with Mr. Dadd to the Lord Mayor—I went on shore, leaving some of our people in charge of the tug and barges—I saw Paul's-wharf Stairs next day, Friday, the 23rd—they had then got a barge on the outside of the one which I represented as sunk outside the other two, and steamer <hi rend="italic">Waterman No.</hi> 5—the second barge was not there then—there was the outside barge, another barge, and the steamer <hi rend="italic">Waterman No.</hi> 5—they were made fast—they were on the ground, in fact, when the Lord Mayor saw them—they were not so placed on Friday as to constitute a floating pier—they did not project so far into the river—they projected into the river at tide time—there was a cross boat up and down the stream, and the sunk boat, but it was not then sunk—I merely speak of her as being the same—they would all be aground at that part of the river at low water, but would float with the tide in the posi<lb></lb>tion they were in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And though on the Friday they did not extend as far out in the river as on the Wednesday, did they form an obstruction to the landing and getting to and from those stairs on the Friday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not when I saw them, because they were aground—if the tide had lifted them, and they were afloat, they then would have been an obstruction.</p>

CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been water-bailiff, you say, twenty years, have you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I took a warrant from the Lord Mayor—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—there is what is called a Court of Conservancy, to find and present nuisances on the river—there is also a Navigation Com<lb></lb>mittee—presentments of the Court of Conservancy are not referred to them—there was a pier erected at Greenwich that was presented by the Court of Con<lb></lb>servancy—I do not recollect its being referred to the Navigation Committee—it is possible I was not there, or I should recollect it—I know there were some proceedings about it—I cannot say positively that it was not before the Navigation Committee, but if so, it was quite out of the ordinary course—when the Lord Mayor saw the two barges it was neither high nor low tide—I think it was about half—I should say, from the best of my recollection, that the inner part of the second barge must have been aground at that time—as the tide rises they float—I am speaking of the time when the Lord Mayor saw them the day before—the inner end of the second barge, I think, must have been on the ground—there is the Lord Mayor's warrant, that will state what he directed me to do—I started from below bridge with the steam-tug—I cannot tell you exactly where she came from—I went on board her from Paul's-wharf, with, I think, about forty men—some of them were dredger<lb></lb>men and watermen—there were no mudlarks or coalheavers—I did not per<lb></lb>sonally engage with them what they were to be paid—my assistant, Pearce, engaged with them—I did not see him do it—they were to be paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-piece for carrying the barges to the Commercial-dock—in order to cut them out we took crow-bars, chisels, and axes—I cannot name any one person who had those weapons—the police had not—when I went on board, Pearce, my deputy, had the command—I went on board soon after seven o'clock—I took five or six boats besides the tug, ready for the men to get on board—when I got on board I did not count the men, but I have stated about the number—I took some of the police force on board with me from Paul's-wharf—the second dummy was inside some other barges, in front of what is called Jeckon's-wharf—it was fastened to the other barges—I think it was in the same position as the other barges—it was properly moored at that time—I have already said I could not distinguish the number of men on board the barge where the struggle took place—I could not distinguish at all what took place—merely a scuffle—I think I sent four boats to take posses<lb></lb>sion—there they had their axes and crowbars to cut the chains, and get the boats out—one of my watermen, Moore, was in authority with those boats, so as to give notice of anything of the sort—I believe he is a witness—when the boats went to attack these dummies, I could see the men scrambling on board the barges, and the men on board the barges striving to push them away—I did not hear any cries—the motion of the steam-boat might have prevented me—I am rather deaf—my steam-tug was 150 feet from the second dummy she went to take possession of—I could see, but not distinctly, what was going on—I did not see any of my men throw some of the other men who were guarding that barge into other barges—I was looking, but I did not see it—it was about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour before my men succeeded in cutting out this second barge, and bringing it up to the steam-tug—I am not aware that the struggle lasted so long as that—we then attached both these barges that had been cut out to my steam-tug, with the chains of the barges—we also used the ropes of the barges—I do not know what was done in the scuffle—Mr. Dadd is a ship-carpenter, I believe—I do not know that he belongs to the Waterman Company—he was there on that occasion—he had an anchor-stock in his hand, to the best of my recollection—it was at the time of my men getting on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman, No.</hi> 5—in order</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020070"></xptr>
               <p>to stop the steamer, No. 5, I gave directions to my men to drop the anchor if they could—that was after we had got the barge away—taking the stock out of an anchor would prevent it holding, but the anchor I desired them to drop was perfect—when I found we could not get clear, I ordered my men to board, and at the same time gave directions to drop the anchor—I did not hear what they said when my people were put on board—from twelve to fifteen men, I should say, went to take possession of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steamer, No. 5—they forced their way up to the wheel, pushed the man away who was at the wheel, and took the wheel at first—there was no talking between the parties in going down the river—it was all done in silence—there was no con<lb></lb>versation addressed to me, as far as I know—I cannot say what passed between others—I neither heard them say, "Give us our dummies," either to myself or anybody else—I had orders to take possession of these barges—these dum<lb></lb>mies belonged to the Waterman's Company—they had been used the night be<lb></lb>fore at the pier—Mr. Dadd came on board us at the Custom-house—I did not request him to do so—I did not ask anybody to come—I agreed to leave the dummies at the Custom-house stairs, or near the Custom-house wharf, until an application had been made to the Lord Mayor—I thought it was the best thing to do under the circumstances—I and Mr. Dadd went to the Mansion-house—we did not see the Lord Mayor then—we saw him in the course of the morning—an application was made to the Lord Mayor that the barges might be returned to the Waterman's Company—Mr. Dadd and a gentleman made the application to get the barges restored—the Lord Mayor refused to do that—only myself and the two persons I have alluded to, attended on that morning—I made a complaint, not in the presence of those parties—I re<lb></lb>ported what I had done, and what had taken place, to the Lord Mayor, in his private room, before any application was made by Dadd—Mr. Dadd also saw him in his private room, with me—Dadd was called in after I had re<lb></lb>ported to the Lord Mayor—I do not understand that the Lord Mayor gave any judgment about it—he gave me no orders to restore the barges—he said he would not restore the barges—he told Mr. Dadd he would not restore the barges—he certainly did not deny that it was by his orders that the barges had been removed—I saw there were men on board the steamer, No. 5—John Moore and Pearce went on board the steam-vessel, No. 5, and forced their way on board—I am speaking of my own men—I do not remember any of the other names—I believe Moore was one of the men who took possession of the first dummy opposite Jeckon's wharf—I will give the names as well as I can—I cannot from my own knowledge give any of the names of the men who were engaged in the struggle for taking possession of the second barge—I am not aware of any further state<lb></lb>ment being made to the Lord Mayor, except my report of the morning what had taken place—I did not charge Dadd, or any of them, with the riot when he was present—I merely reported what had occurred—when this pier is out it is opposite a wharf called Needham's wharf—I did not lay informa<lb></lb>tions against the parties—under the waterman's bye-law there is a fine which the City of London can inflict for laying things in the river—I believe the fine is only 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I never laid an information—to the best of my recollec<lb></lb>tion, it was about eleven in the morning when the Lord Mayor came down—between that time and seven the next morning, when I attacked the barges I gave no notice, nor am I aware of any being given to the Waterman's Com<lb></lb>pany—I had not seen it used for a pier.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERGEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether it has been used as a pier since? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has—I think about eleven or twelve o'clock the next day I saw a pier there—it was not used as a pier in my presence—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020071"></xptr>
               <p>have seen it there almost daily since—I gave the men 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for assisting me—I gave them that sum because it was a very unpleasant duty—it would not be any extravagant pay for a boatman for a day's job—I took that num<lb></lb>ber of men to prevent opposition, and to overcome it if I met with it—I had given instructions to the police to be ready to meet me there on the morning in question—I apprehend these barges are called dummies, because they are not used in the ordinary way of barges—I know no other reason—they are used as a sort of floating causeway to and from the steam-boats—when they at<lb></lb>tempted to get on board the steamers I merely saw a resistance to what they were about to do—I think there was no other violence than was necessary in order to prevent them coming on board at that time—I did not see what took place during the scuffle in getting possession of the barge—I could distinguish what took place on board the steamer—when my men got on board, I saw they were resisted both in coming on board and in getting possession of the wheel—I did not see any weapons used—I took the dummies to the Com<lb></lb>mercial Dock, to put them into a place of safety—I stated that I would speak to the Lord Mayor before I gave up either of the boats—I thought it was the best thing to do under the circumstances—I thought I should peril life if I resisted—I reported to the Lord Mayor, merely as the person who had given me my orders, to say what had been done, and I gave him a general report of what had taken place—I produced my warrant to Mr. Dadd before landing at the Custom-house stairs—he did not ask for it—I have never been asked for any—I have been water-bailiff twenty years—I should presume I am well known to everybody who goes on the river—I have acted many times before this in removing piles and other things—the warrant is signed by the Lord Mayor—the barges were eventually left by me at the Custom-house—I do not of my own knowledge know what became of them after<lb></lb>wards—I saw them afterwards above bridge, up at the pier again—that was the day before yesterday—the pier I saw next day was not made of the same barges.

                  </hi>. I am one of the water-bailiff's assistants. On the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 22nd of Jan., I went down to the place where the pier was—I had the water-bailiff's boat there to assist, at Paul's wharf-stairs—I was not on board the steam-tug, but in the skiff—I had the boat there in attendance—I had gone in the water-bailiffs boat—that is quite well known in the river as the water-bailiffs boat—there is "Water-bailiff, City of London," written on it—I have been water-bailiff's man many years—that is the boat generally used by the water-bailiff—I got to Paul's wharf-stairs at seven in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I saw the water-bailiff, Mr. Saunders, come, and heard him give orders for the men to proceed in taking the obstruction away—to take the pier away, which consisted of barges—they are only common barges, but when standing in this way are called dummies—they were fastened together at that time, as well as secured to the ground by mooring-chains, regularly moored—they were fastened together to make a platform in the regular way, and there was one on the upper side to be secured with chains from the ground, moored with anchor and chains from the ground—they were fastened to one another as well as moored to the ground—the first chain was fast to the wharf, on shore, and the next one fast to the other barge, and then there was a breast-chain on each side to keep her steady, that they should not carry people overboard—there was a mooring on each side, on the stairs, to keep her in that position, that she should not give way, to jerk people overboard—the dummies were fastened to the ground towards the wharf, and there was a fastening on each side of the dummy, to the ground, to keep her steady, as the case might be.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020072"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The fastenings on each side, that you speak of, are they usual fasten<lb></lb>ings for barges, or are they only necessary for a thing called a dummy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At times—these <hi rend="italic">growed</hi> there by stealth—they were placed there—there were none there before—they are usual fastenings—common barges do not have fastenings on each side, generally—these fastenings are used for barges of the same kind, in another ordinary way—if three or four barges lay together, they must be fastened on each side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it usual for barges going to load and unload at wharfs, or to remain there some time, except used for the purposes of a pier or some such thing, to have fastenings athwart in this way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is—if there are several barges, they are always moored at each end, or they could not keep them steady at each end to unload—a barge is generally fastened in the way this dummy was—I could tell this was intended for a pier by boards lying on the top, as a platform or stage for passengers to walk along, a platform for per<lb></lb>sons to walk to and fro from one dummy to another—when the water bailiff gave instructions to remove the obstruction the first thing I saw done was the rope and chain cast off—I did not assist—I was in the boat—they were cast off by some of Mr. Saunders's men, to take away—they cast off one of the dummies which laid adjoining the wharf, above the pier—they succeeded in that—I next saw the tug get hold of her, to make her fast, to take her away—the other persons there obstructed them from doing it, and a piece of work was created by the two parties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what way did they obstruct them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Preventing them from taking the craft away—I did not see much force used—when they tried to remove the second, they flew over to it, and there was the same piece of work, and at that time I had orders to bring the police over—I took a boat full of police off to the steam-boat, to prevent the mischief that was likely to be done—I put them aboard the second dummy that was being cast off—they had not taken hold of the one I put them on board of, but they went on board with a view to quiet the piece of work, the riot that was breeding—when the police were on board, the other persons resisted the water bailiff's men, who were keeping the men belonging to the other party from using violence—I was not on board to see the violence that was used, but put the policemen on board to prevent mischief, and then I left them—I went back and brought some more—I did not see any violence used on board the dummies—I was not on board—I staid in the water bailiff's boat, with the view of taking care of her, and prevent myself being drowned by the boats and barges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How near were you to the dummy with this boat when the men strove to get out of the boat, and take possession of the dummy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in the boat, two or three yards from the dummy—I had not a boat's load—the water bailiff's men were aboard of the tug, not in the boat with me—I was alone in the water-bailiff's boat at the time—I went and fetched the policemen, and put them aboard my boat off the stairs—before I fetched the policemen I was really doing very little with my boat, for there was nothing to do, the action had begun before—I saw the action begin—I was there when a jangle took place with the parties—I do not know that there was ever a boat attacked the second dummy—it is out of my power to tell you whether the crews of the boats attacked the dummy—I do not think we had as many as thirty men—I did not count them—I could not swear there were twenty—I cannot swear how many axes and crow-bars and chisels there were in the hands of the men who tried to board the dummy—there were not a good many that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you see them cutting out the chains in the dummies? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could hear more noise than I saw—I was in the boat when the boarding</p>

               <p>party attempted to get on board the dummy—I was four hundred or five hundred yards off sometimes—when the first attack was made on the second dummy I was as far of again as I am from you—I could not see the dif<lb></lb>ferent parties—I did not see any boat loads of men, only the policemen I put on board—the other men were put from the tug—I did not see them disem<lb></lb>bark from the tug, when they took possession of the second dummy, and I did not carry them—I saw the struggle and heard it when I went to fetch the policemen—I acquainted you before that I did not see the men who had come from the steam-tug striking with their axes and crowbars and so on—I heard the chains rattling and casting off—I did not see the violence—I did not see the men with the crowbars and axes in their hands striking about—they had no crowbars then, to my knowledge—I saw none—I saw nothing of the kind that you are asking about—I saw no crowbars or axes—I had not seen any crowbars that morning—I cannot tell you within twenty men how many men were struggling and fighting to get on board that second dummy—I swear I did not see it—I mean to swear I could not, though only double the distance from you, see the number of men that were endeavouring to get on board and fighting with those who were defending it—I did not see the quantity of men, and do not know how they got on board, for I was not there, I was not in sight—I did not take two boats' load of men to that very dummy before I took the police—I did not take one—I had nothing to do with it—I cannot tell you how long they were about it—I did not hire any of the men—my men did not attack me by mistake, that I am aware of—I was not attacked—I belonged to the same army—I was in the boat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the water-bailiff's men. On Thurs<lb></lb>day morning, the 22nd of Jan., I went in a steam-tug to Paul's-wharf by di<lb></lb>rection of the water-bailiff—when I arrived there I saw a steam-boat and a barge—the barge was lying on the causeway, in and out, and the steam-boat <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>, No. 5, was lying outside of her—Kinchin had charge of her—I knew him by sight—I cannot say how many men he had with him on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>—I went into a Peter-boat, to take one of the barges away which was at the upper side of the causeway—it was a barge that I had seen out for a pier—it had no planks on the deck—it was an open barge for people to walk along to go into the steam-boats—there were no planks for people to walk across—they walked along the flooring of the barge—I had seen it erected out as a dummy before, but at that time it was moored, like any other barge, fast to another barge—it had no platform on it—there was another dummy at the lower side of the stairs—we took the first away, and afterwards went to take the second—I got knocked down as soon as I stepped into her—there might be twenty people on board that barge—there were a great many—I got a punch in the mouth, which knocked me down—I could not swear to the man who knocked me down—I got up, and was knocked down again—I cannot exactly say by whom—I might know the man if I was to see him—that is the man—(<hi rend="italic">pointing out Ireland</hi>)—I did not see either of the others in that barge to my knowledge—I saw Dadd in the steam-boat, and Kinchin—Ireland was in the dummy—we succeeded in fast<lb></lb>ening the two dummies to the tug-steamer, and she began to go on, when Kin<lb></lb>chin ordered his boat, and she ran head foremost into us—he came between the tug and the dummies, and seperated the chains that we had got fast—we afterwards got the barges fust to the tug again, and he ran in a second time—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020074"></xptr>
               <p>did not separate them then—I cannot say of what power the steam-tug is—she is a smaller boat than the other—the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> is a good deal bigger—I cannot say whether she is double the size—she is a more powerful boat—she came with violence against us—that was calculated to put people in danger—I expected she would have sunk us—after that, we bore the steam<lb></lb>boat off, got away again, and then Kinchin came at us again, and ran us round, and backwards and forwards over the water, got foul and fixed in on us, and ran us where he liked, over and over round, about in the river—that was dangerous—had the tide been going down hard, instead of being high<lb></lb>water, very likely we should have gone athwart the bridge, or somewhere else, and smashed all that was in her—Kinchin was on the paddle-box all this time—I expect he was giving directions—we look for the man on the paddle-box to give directions—he appeared to be giving directions—I stepped on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>, to try and clear the anchor, after he ran us round and round.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you want to clear the anchor for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only to get away from her, to get the barges down the river—I was merely going to lower it down a bit, so as to get the chains clear of it, so as he could not run us back<lb></lb>wards and forwards any longer—the chains of the barges in tow of the tug had got entangled with the anchor as he was running in between us—I did not succeed in clearing it—Dadd laid hold of a piece of iron, and threatened to knock me down with it if I touched the chain—I cannot say whether it was a part of the anchor I was going to lower, it was a piece of iron that he took off the deck of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> No. 5—I believe it was not part of the anchor that was hanging there—after she struck us the first time she backed her engines, and backed some distance from the burges, it might be five yards; she then came head foremost at us again at full speed—I should think she came as fast as I had ever seen her go—I did not notice whether her steam was blowing off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>before I stepped on board—we said nothing to them, or they to us, before I stepped on board—they tried to keep the boat off, so as we should not step in—they shoved it off with staves, and tried to keep it off with their hands—I cannot swear there was any staff used—I jumped forward, and jumped out of her as soon as she made one push, so I was the first man out of the barge, and the first that was knocked down—that was with a first, which hit me in the mouth—I did not hear the men in the dummy say, "Don't come here, or we must push you off"—I said nothing to them—I jumped on board as soon at I could, and then I was knocked down—I rose up, and endeavoured to get for<lb></lb>ward to get the chains undone—I struggled to get on—I pushed my way for<lb></lb>ward to get to the chains, to let her go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And it was in pushing your way forward that you was pushed down again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it came too heavy for a push—a man named Flynn got on board with me at the same time—I did not use any axe, crowbar, or chisel—I do not know whether any were taken—I took none—I saw some, but I did not use any, or take any—I do not know that the men in the boat had them—I saw one on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman's</hi> boat—I did not see any in our boat—I saw people on board the barge with choppers—I cannot say whose men they were, for as soon as ever the boats were got there I had no more to do with them—I was ashore.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the City police—by order of my superintendent I attended with twelve police-constables at Paul's-wharf, on Thursday morning, the 22nd of Jan.—I arrived there about ten minutes before seven o'clock, and met Mr. Saunders at the top of the stairs—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steamer, <hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 5, lying outside the piles by the causeway, athwart the pier and public stairs—I did not see Kinchin at that time—I did shortly afterwards on board—I knew him, and know that he commanded that vessel—shortly after I saw the steam-tug come under the arch of Southwark-bridge—an soon as I saw it, Kinchin gave orders for his vessel to go ahead—she was then laid right on the cross way in front of the stairs—a hawser was thrown from</p>

               <p>her, round the upper pile, to moor her to the stairs—I do not know the power of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman, No.</hi> 5—she is considerably larger than the steam<lb></lb>tug—I noticed at that time only about three or four men on board—there were several came out of the shed on the pier, and went on board the barges—that was just after the tug came through the centre arch of Southwark<lb></lb>bridge—I should say there were about twelve or fifteen, or something of that sort—I did not notice any persons go on board the Waterman, No. 5—I did not at that time notice whether the men who came out of the shed had any<lb></lb>thing in their hands—I did afterwards when the water-bailiffs' men were try<lb></lb>ing to get away the second barge from the wharf—I then saw Sinclair with a hatchet—he had it up in a striking attitude—he aimed it at one of my men in the barge—I called him by name while he was holding the hatchet, and said, "Sinclair, mind what you are about, I am here"—at that time one of my men had him by the tail of the coat—when the water-bailiff came up he asked me for four policemen—he went away with them in the boat from the stairs—how he disposed of them I cannot say—the water-bailiffs men eventually succeeded in removing the other barge—they proceeded to break away the chains for the purpose of removing the barges—they were resisted—I saw the barges got away, and both of them fastened to the steam-tug—the steam-boat then turned towards the wharf, and immediately after that went right in between the tug and the barges, and snapped them asunder—at that time there were ten policemen on board the barges, or dummies—they are barges planked over—I only speak of the one I saw taken away—I did not see the first taken away—the one on which the policemen stood was planked over, and had rails such as are placed on dummies to form temporary piers—it appeared to me that the parties were in danger after they were separated from the tug.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you succeed in getting to the head of the vessel, and getting possession of it, without any violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By standing round—we surrounded them—we stood round and kept them at bay—we were ordered to use no violence—I had a staff—I did not have it out—we took away the barge—the men in it used much violence—they came round and told us to get off, that as it was their property, or they would sink the b—y lot—as soon as I was struck and I managed to get on to the dummy, the next policeman that came up, Mackay caught hold of his legs and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> him down on to the dummy—I had recovered my breath at that time—I do not think our party used the least violence—I saw one or two with their staves out who got ill used—I did not see the men who went with me to take possession of the barge, use any violence—they got rid of the fifty men by standing round—they got off to this next place that was standing here, (<hi rend="italic">referring to plant</hi>) and some got on to the steamer—there was a block which they were all standing round, with their axes and crowbars—the most violence they used was while they were trying to keep us off.</p>

               <p>me on my back—I do not know the man that collared me—I got up again, and assisted the men that were assaulted, and we took the dummy away—Mr. Moore was lying on the floor of the dummy at the same time I was—we succeeded in taking possession of the dummy, and fastened it to the steam<lb></lb>tug—we then towed it a little way down the river, and the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steamer came alongside, and Kinchin said, "You had better get off; it is my pro<lb></lb>perty, and if you don't get off I will sink all the b——lot of you"—he then came against us with all the force I imagine he could do, cut the chain asun<lb></lb>der, and cut us adrift—the men succeeded in fastening the dummy to the tug again, and he came up again, not with so much violence I should say as the first time, but he got fixed, and turned us round and round in the river—some of us were then ordered by Mr. Pearce and Mr. Saunders to board the <hi rend="italic">Wa<lb></lb>terman</hi> steamer for the safety of our own lives—from what I saw our lives appeared to be in very great danger, I mean the first time when he cut us through—there was danger when we were going round and round—I and others then went on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>—I was collared and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> back again; I will not be sure who it was by, but I think it was Dadd—I hung on to the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> till one of the officers came and held me by my legs, and got me into the boat, and then I was collared by two or three persons on board, and I fell on the skylight of the cabin—Mackay was underneath me for one—he rolled off from the skylight on to the deck—I think Dadd was one of those parties, but I am not quite sure—when I got to the wheel I heard Kinchin give orders to run the steamer on to the Surray side ashore—there were five of us on board at that time—there were a good many coal-heavers working there, and Kinchin said to them, "Come on board, men, I will pay you well; money shall be no object, and throw the b——s over<lb></lb>board"—they would have come on board if we had not stood at the end of the steamer, and stopped them—they did make an attempt to come on board—I stood at the back of the boat with three or four brother officers, and prevented them—we were frightened on this, and obliged to leave the steamer—we got out on a barge that was moored on the Surrey side.</p>

I have never been examined anywhere before—I was not before the Lord Mayor or the Grand Jury—I went up to Mr. Pearson's—I first got on board the boat at Paul's-wharf, and went down the river to meet the steam<lb></lb>tug—Hutson was one of the party in the boat—Mr. Pearce was with us, to give us orders—we had received orders from our in<lb></lb>spector—Mr. Pearce gave directions as to where our boat was to go—we met the steam-tug on this side of Southwark-bridge—it was not overlight—it was between the two lights—it might be a little after seven o'clock—I went on board the steam-tug, and remained on board—I saw the first dummy taken away and attached to the tug—after that I got into the boat with Hutson again; perhaps there might be a dozen of us got into that boat, I cannot say, ten or a dozen—by that time it had become light enough to see what was going on on the second dummy—I can't say whether any persons were put on board the dummy—as we were going up nearly close to it I saw persons running in all directions, and I should say there might be about twenty—there were persons on board the dummy who said, "Keep off"—I was <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> back with a stick—they were standing on the dummy to prevent our getting on it—I cannot say whe<lb></lb>ther our boat was the first that got to it—I cannot say whether there were three or four other boats, or how many there were—there were parties got out of the tug into one more boat, but whether there were any more I cannot say—I did not see so many as four or five boats, I should think, start from the tug to go to the dummy—after I was shoved buck with the stick I rose again,</p>

               <p>and succeeded in getting on the dummy—I do not mean to say that I recog<lb></lb>nise the person who shoved me back with the stick—I can swear to Mackay being the person that took hold of my legs, because I had hold of his collar when I fell, and he caught me by the legs, and I caught hold of him as I was falling—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge—a minute or two be<lb></lb>fore, I had—he had got something in the shape of a handspike—he was endea<lb></lb>vouring to prevent me from getting in—he did not do anything to me, because I was shoved back in the boat, and when I got up again he had not the hand<lb></lb>spike in his hand—it was not him that pushed me with the stick—I saw him distinctly as I approached, with the handspike in his hand—I lost sight of him when I was pushed back—I had sight of him until I was pushed back—the instant I jumped up he seized me by the legs—Hutson and I were both sit<lb></lb>ting on one seat in the boat—he disembarked first—he did not succeed in getting on the dummy before I was struck—we both rose together—Moore was on the dummy, and Hutson was in front of the dummy by that time—there were several of us down on board, I suppose he went to some of their assistance in front of the dummy—after we were assaulted, I saw the men go to assist the men that were down, to keep the peace—as soon as they got on board the dummy they were knocked down—Moore was down at the same time I was—they resisted us all they could—they pushed us back again—they resisted us in every way they could—pushed us off—they used greater force than we did—they used the first violence—we used no violence—I was down, and when I got up again they were up at the head of the dummy—nearly all the men who had been protecting it were off—perhaps I might have been down two or three seconds—the struggle on the dummy did not last ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, but they got on the barge, and got back again on the dummy—they tried to get possession of it again, and to resist all they could—the water-bailiff's men finally got possession—we were only standing there—I assisted the water-bailiff's men in keeping the people off—I stood before them—I had not got my staff in my hand—they were pushed—there was a great scuffle between the parties—I certainly pushed them, not with any violence—it did not require me to use violence to prevent them from com<lb></lb>ing on—they resisted us very much when we first went to take possession of the dummy—we were obliged to use force to get them away—we lifted them off the dummy into the barges—I did not throw them into the barges—I took and put a man off the dummy into a barge—we took hold of them, and put them off from the dummy into the barge—I only did one myself—I lifted him on—I took him off and put him down into the barge—there were sides to it—it was an empty barge—he did not tumble down and fall on his back—he did not fall—the dummy might be three or four feet higher than the barge—I put him off into the barge—I went with him—he did not go gently and quietly, he was resisting—I do not know whether it required any particular strength to put him there—I did not strike him or anybody—I had not my staff out—he was the only person I touched—there were so many people there at the time that it is impossible for me to say whether I saw my brother con<lb></lb>stables lift other people into the barges—I did not see some of them tumble into barges on their backs, and my brother constables with them—nothing of that sort—I saw the men lifted off the dummy into the barges—there might be four or five—I cannot say who lifted them off—they might be some of the water-bailiff's people—I did not notice any one particularly—I did not see the people lifted up and thrown into the barges by the dredger-men who came from the tug—I did not see any of them tumble—they were all strug<lb></lb>gling with those engaged against them—that was the way in which we finally got possession of the dummy—I had never been concerned in anything of this</p>

I attended at Paul's-wharf, on Thursday, the 22nd of Jan., about seven o'clock, or from that to half-past seven, I saw the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steamer, No. 5, lying alongside the dummy—I was on the shore when I first saw her—I saw one of the barges which formed the pier removed—I then saw several men on the other dummy and come on to the dummy from the steam-boat, No. 5—when they were on the dummy I saw one had a handspike, and one had something else, I believe—I did not notice what it was—I saw Mackay, Sinclair, and Dadd—Mackay had the handspike in his hand—Sinclair had a hatchet—I saw Mackay strike at Hutson with the handspike, and hit him—he tried to prevent Hutson's getting on to the dummy a second time—he tried to strike him with the hand<lb></lb>spike—it was then that he hit him in the chest—he pushed him the second time—he might have had something in his hand—I did not see him strike him after he got on board—I saw Moore on the dummy, and saw him down, but I did not see who the scuffle was with—I afterwards assisted in removing the dummy which was taken in tow by the steam-tug—I was on the dummy at the time it was removed from Paul's-wharf—I went down the river in it some little way, and then went on board the steamer, No. 5, by the water<lb></lb>bailiffs orders—that was when we were out in the river, when the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> ran in on us and cut the barges from the tug—it then ran in again, and we were ordered to get on board to take possession of the steam-boat to prevent her coming forwards—I did not take possession of the wheel—a waterman, did—we kept them from the wheel—the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> was afterwards backed to the Surrey side of the river between Blackfriars and Southwark bridges—there were some coal-barges there—she was backed close along shore, so that</p>

               <p>any men might have jumped from the shore on to the steamboat—there were a good many men on the shore, and Kinchin asked them if they would come on board and throw these b—s overboard, and he would give them any money to do so—they were about to come on board, only we told them if they did they must put up with the consequences, and they directly said, "We will not run ourselves into trouble"—but I thought at one time several would have come on board—I continued with the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> till I was ordered by inspector Woodruff to come into the boat, which I did, and came to the tug.</p>

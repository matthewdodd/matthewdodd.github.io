                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mrs. Elizabeth Wilmot; she is a widow, and lives at Hackney. On Thursday, 19th Dec., about half-past three o'clock, I opened the street door, and saw five boys inside the garden gate, just at the foot of the steps of the house—there is a way by the side of the house, where there is a door that goes to the back kitchen—John Woolcombe was one of the boys—I do not recognise any one but him—I am sure of him—he spoke to me, and asked if a person named Wells lived there—I said, "No"—I then shut the door, and left them there—I did not see them go out of the garden—in about a quarter of an hour I missed a coal-scuttle that I had put the coals in, and left it by the side-door near the kitchen—the side-door was open—this is the scuttle, I have been in the habit of cleaning it, and can swear to it—this is the scoop, it was whole then, but it is now broken—they are my mistress's property.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at a factory, at Tottenham-road. On Thurs<lb></lb>day, 19th Dec, at twenty minutes past three o'clock, I saw the prisoners; I had not known them before, I am able to swear they are the persons—I only passed them—they were in Beauvoir-road, near St. Peter's Church—I went on to the factory, and about twenty minutes afterwards I was look<lb></lb>ing out of the window, and saw the same five altogether coming across the field—Joseph Woolcombe had a coal-scuttle—they were running, and went into two empty carcasses of houses near ourfactory—I, with Lyne and Wood, went out into the road—we saw all the prisoners except Joseph Woolcombe, coming from the carcasses—Thompson had the handle of the scoop in his hand, and Hooper had the other part of the scoop—I stopped Rose, and some boys who work for us stopped the other three—Rose said, "Pray, Sir, pray, Sir, don't take me; I have got a mother lying very ill"—the others said, "Pray don't take us, you may have the coal-scuttle"——the four were given into custody; Joseph Woolcombe was not taken then.</p>

I work at the same factory with Turner—on that day, about a quarter to four o'clock, I saw the five prisoners coming across the field; Joseph Woolcombe had something in his hand which turned out to be a coal-scuttle—they were running towards the carcasses—I came out, and we met the four coming out of the carcasses, but Joseph Woolcombe made his escape—Hooper and Thompson had the two parts of the scoop—they all begged for us to take the scuttle and let them go—one said he had a mother very ill who had four children—I did not see Joseph Woolcombe again till he was taken the next day, on another charge; I knew him again directly.</p>

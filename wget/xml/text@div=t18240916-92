            . I live in Little George-street, and am employed by the Imperial Gas Company, to light the lamps. On the 5th of July, I met the prisoner Gardner in Bedford-street, Bedford-square, with two pieces of pipe on his shoulder, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, and followed him into Dunbar's iron foundry, in Tottenham-court-road. I then went into Charlotte-street, where some pipes were lying, which I had seen in the course of the day twice, and found two of them were gone. In about twenty minutes, I came up the road, went into Francis-street, and saw him come out of Dunbar's foundry, which is three doors from Francis-street, in company with some other person, who soon went away to the corner of the street; the prisoner then picked up a piece of pipe lying at the corner of Francis-street, and carried it into the foundry - he staid about five minutes; he saw me when he came out, turned, and went up Francis-street. I followed him, he walked at a good pace, and then went up Gower-street, took to his heels, and ran away up the New-road.</p>

            Charlotte-street is a good way from Dunbar's - A. Yes. The pipes had been lying there; a piece was carried to Francis-street, which is but three doors from Dunbar's house.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. At that time the Imperial Gass Company were laying down pipes in the neighbourhood, and this piece you saw first in Charlotte-street, and then in Francis-street - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am superintendant of the Imperial Gas Company, at the Pancras station. Some of their pipes have a fillet, or ridge, and others have the Company's initials - I have seen many pipes of other Companies, but never saw any with the ridge but their's - we were laying down pipes about that neighbourhood. On Saturday, the 10th of July I went to Dunbar's premises, and saw this piece of pipe lying in the foundry, exposed - when the officer came I directed him to search; we found nine or ten more; the bed-pipe was partly concealed amidst a heap of old iron, in a part of the premises nearest the street. All the pieces that were found had the fillet, and four of them the initials; they were all new. An iron-founder must know them from old pipe. They cost the Company about 10 s. per cwt.; the weight of this bed-pipe is about 1 cwt. Doubar came up while we were making enquiries - I challenged him with receiving stolen goods - he said he had bought them, and would buy them again; he said he did not know the persons who brought them, but thought he should know them if he saw them, and that he gave 3 s. or 3 s. 6 d. per cwt.; I cannot tell which. I know this bed-pipe, because a connexion was making with the pipes in Russell-street, and the pipes were all cut before they went out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you tell whether these pipes had been at Charlotte-street - A. No - there is no mark upon it but the fillet. There are fillets on all our pipes. What I call being concealed was lying amongst other pipes, in a mass of old iron - they were piled regularly in with the others. When Dunhar spoke of having bought pipes and said he would again I particularly spoke of this one. He said he had bought quantities of pipe from other Companies - I said,</p>
               <p>"Have you not had bills of parcels of them;" he said, Yes - that they were broken pipes, and the perquities of the workmen. I think them worth about 10 s. per cwt. - old iron is worth about 2 s. 4 d. per cwt. Broken pipes are not the property of the workmen.</p>

            . I was one of the Company's labourers. On the 10th of July I went to Mr. Dunbar's foundry, and saw one of these pieces of pipe lying as you go into the store-room; and upon looking about I saw others in different places; I know them by either the fillets or initials.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160036"></xptr>I was talking to Mr. Dunhar, sen., and he said he had no such thing; the prisoner Dunbar then came up, and said,</p>
               <p>"What is all this row?" one of the men said,</p>
               <p>"These men have challenged us with receiving stolen goods;" he said he had bought them, and would buy them again.</p>
               <p>DUNBAR's Defence. This man brought some iron to sell, and I gave a fair price for it. I went into the counting-house, got the money, and he went away - I then took the iron from the scale, and put it into the stack; we had a great quantity of iron at that time.</p>
               <p>J - GOLD. I work in the foundry of Mr. Dunbar, sen., who is the prisoner's father; this young man is employed by his father. We melt about 18 cwt. of iron every day; it is principally old iron, brought from various places; we generally give 3 s. 6 d. per cwt. for it, and have on many occasions bought pipe from different Companies; we buy old iron of every description, and melt all we buy - we do not sell pipe at all, and have large piles of iron always ready for the furnace - we lay it one piece on the other, just to keep it up. I did not see this particular piece of pipe - I saw Mr. Dunbar weighing some pipe; the people were at work, and the gates were open; it was then about five o'clock, and we had not left work - we leave at six. The first witness came on the 10th; I was there: the iron was then on the heap, not a yard from the scale.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ADAMS. Q. Can either part of your scales be seen from the street - A. Yes, both parts can be seen, but they can see rather the most of the scale with the iron in it. New iron is all in pigs; the moment it is cast we call it old iron. We buy all iron brought by strangers; we never notice anybody's mark. I do not know that the Imperial Gas Company's pipes have any initials on them. I have seen the marks on pipes in the yards, but never knew the meaning of them; I have heard of such a Company, but I do not know where their station is - I have heard it was at Battle-bridge.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Suppose I had furnished my house with cast iron grates yesterday, and brought them to you to day, what would you buy them as - A. Old iron. Some manufacturers have initials on their iron, and some have not - we often buy iron with initials upon it; country makers have their name at length.</p>
               <p>T - STEVENSON. I am an Iron founder. The fair price for old iron is 3 s. 6 d. per cwt. or less, according to its quality - I know Dunbar, sen.; he is seventy-two years of age or more; I have known him thirty years in that same foundry; the gates are always open, and every person can see in during working hours. If this pipe had been brought to my foundry, I should have considered it old iron; it is mutilated and damaged in the cutting - I should have taken it in and weighed it; according to my judgment, they paid a full price for it - it has been made of inferior iron, and will not do for that purpose again. I should have bought long iron pipes like these of any dirty fellow that brought them, whom I did not know; if I gave a full price for it and in the face of day. I have bought great quantities of pipe from agents and other persons. I should have bought this piece of that man, because it is mutilated old iron.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. That pipe being broken would have been every where considered as old iron - A. Yes; I should have no objection to buy a single piece of such a man.</p>

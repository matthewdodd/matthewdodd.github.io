                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the morning of the 24th of October I was in Chad's-row, about half-past ten o'clock—the prosecutor came and said he had lost a copper between eleven o'clock the night be<lb></lb>fore, and seven o'clock that morning, and he had just got information that the party was breaking it up at a blacksmith's shop in Cumberland-row—</p>

               <p>I went there—I passed through the blacksmith's shop, and went to another little shop, where I found the prisoner shut in, breaking up the copper—I knocked at the door, and the prisoner stood still—a person there said, "<hi rend="italic">Bob,</hi> here is the policeman"—the prisoner then opened the door—I asked him how he came by the copper—he said his father bought it two or three days before, and he was going to sell it for his father.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> There were three other men there—I supposed the copper was my father's, as he is a smith. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There were not three men where he was—I have seen his father, who says he knows nothing at all about it.</p>

This copper was mine—it was fixed in my wash-house, at No. 25, Chad's-row—I saw it last Friday evening safe—my wife had been washing in it—I must bare lost it on Friday night, or early on Saturday morning—I accompanied the policeman to where the prisoner was found breaking up the copper—he left off on our entering the shop—it was begun to be broken up—my house and the house the prisoner was in come back to back—I heard him say he got it from his father four days before.</p>

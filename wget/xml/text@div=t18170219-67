I had a bundle under my arm, containing seven yards and a quarter of moreen, which I had been to buy for Mr. Dray, of Tavistock-place. I bought it with my own money. I was going home, towards Broad-street, St. Giles's. The prisoner rushed out from somewhere, and snatched the bundle from under my arm; he struck me on the arm, and pulled the bundle three times-it was on my left arm. My sister had hold of my right arm-it laid across my arm; I held it with my hand; he snatched at it three times - He struck the upper part of my left arm. He struck me as he was taking the bundle; it was the first time that he snatched that he struck me. He took the bundle from me at the third snatch. I fell upon my knees when he snatched it from me - I held it tight. I fell on my knees by the force of the snatch I held the bundle as tight as I could; he struck me with the side of his hand, not very hard. I caught hold of his coat; he got away, and ran up Hampshire Hog-yard; my sister and I ran after him. As he turned round, I had a full view of his face. I am sure that it was the prisoner; I saw him by the light of the shop-window, and a lamp over the corner of the place; I could see him distinctly, and I am quite positive that he is the man. I have such a recollection of him, as to he confident that he is the man - He got away.</p>

            . I was with my sister, and had hold of her right arm. I had been with her to buy the moreen. My sister screamed out as he hit her. He snatched the bundle from her after making three snatches, and ran down Hampshire Hog-yard. When he made the third snatch he got the bundle, and she fell on her knees; she caught hold of the prisoner by his coat, he gave a spring and run up the yard, we ran after him, but lost him-he got away with the bundle; when my sister screamed out, I turned round and saw him by the light of the shop. I saw his face distinctly and the rest of his person. I am sure that the prisoner is the man-it did not last many minutes; he did it in a minute or two. I saw his face when he made the third snatch; the light of the shop reflected on it-nineteen shillings were paid for the moreen. We paid two shillings and sixpence per yard for it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in High-street, St. Giles's, in company with Roberts, that evening; I saw the prisoner there, and another man with him, between seven and eight o'clock - I had seen him several times before that. I ordered him to go about his business, and not let me see him there any more; he said he would, and went off very quietly; he had a white coat on at that time. I and Roberts went to the watch-house, and at a little before twelve o'clock we had information of the robbery. On the Monday following, the prosecutrix's father came down to me; I went in search of the prisoner, but could not find him. On the Thursday following, I was going up High-street, and saw the prisoner, and another man, coming from Hampshire Hog-yard. He had an umbrella in his hand, walking. They both went into the coffee-shop. He gave the umbrella to the other man. I crossed over, and asked the man, where he got the umbrella; the prisoner came out. I asked him, what he had done with his white coat; he said, it was old, and that he had given it away. I told him, that he must go with me, and I secured him. I told him that I had information, and by the description which I had received, I thought it was him; he denied it.</p>

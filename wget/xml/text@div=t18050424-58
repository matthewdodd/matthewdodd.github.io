               <p>Q. Is the shop that you have there a part of your house? - A. No, Mr. Crosby is the landlord of the house, and he lets us a part of the shop; I sleep in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How is your entrance into the shop? - A. By a door out into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Crosby or his family enter by the same door? - A. No, the shop is separate from Mr. Crosby's house; it was once one shop, now it is parted into two; there is no door out of our shop into any part of his house; On Sunday night, the 31st of March, about three in the afternoon, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240048"></xptr>went out, and locked the door after me, and carried the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How is your shop-window? - A. There is one window in Pear-street, and another in Charles-street, Manchester-square, it is a corner shop; I did not return till about half past ten o'clock at night, and when I returned I took the key out of my pocket; I had that in one hand, and a candle and lantern in the other, and when I was stooping to put the key in the key-hole, I found the door a little open.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had left it locked? - A. Yes, and finding the door a little open, I directly looked behind, to see if there was any body there to knock me down; I did not see any body in the shop, the windows were all safe; afterwards I put the key into the key-hole, and the key went very free; I thought it had been done with a pick-lock key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing at that time? - A. I looked round, and saw there was above an hundred and fifty pounds worth of goods gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of goods? - A. Three shelves of gloves intirely stripped, and all the gloves in the window were gone, excepting some coarse tanned leather; they had taken all the articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had these articles in your shop when you left it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you inhabited this shop? - A. Six years, on the 1st of September last.</p>
               <p>Q. And slept in it all that time? - A. No, I have been ill part of the time; then my partner slept in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, after this, see any part of the property that you so lost, and when? - A. On Saturday last, at Messrs. Chrees and Lord's, wholesale glovers, in Newgate-street; I saw there fifteen doe-skins, and the butts of two doe-skins; that is all I have seen of any of the property that I have lost; we lost about forty buck and doe-skins together.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any means of knowing that the articles which you saw at Messrs. Chrees and Lord's, were your property? - A. Yes; one of the skins I had wrote upon, and two skins my partner had wrote upon.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do with those skins that you understood he had left? - A. I then sent to the house of Messrs. Croft and Newman, leather-sellers, in Bartholomew-close.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the skins brought back again? - A. They were, in less, I dare say, than a quarter of an hour, I felt them when they were brought back; Mr. Croft said he would call in ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call in the prisoner's absence? - A. The prisoner called in the afternoon, after Mr. Croft was gone; I then told him that I had sent the skins to the house of Croft and Newman, and that Mr. Croft had said the property was stolen; he replied, he was very sorry for it, he was sure that he came honestly by it, and that he had the skins of a respectable man, and a house-keeper in the neighbourhood, the master of the Swan public-house, in Skinner-street, and his name was Couling; he said he would go out, and fetch him to me. He then went out, as I expected, to fetch Mr. Couling, this was about three o'clock in the afternoon; he returned again, and told me that he could not meet with him; he left word, as I understood, that he would come again the next morning, and about twelve o'clock he came; I was in my accompting-house; I had understood that the house of Rolls and Clutterham had been robbed, and I had a letter written to them, to inform them that some skins were at my house, and requesting their attendance to identify them; Mr. Rolls came the next morning, and I inquired of him if he had lost any buck-skins, and if he had any marks by which he could identify these skins, if he saw them, and he described the marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there when Mr. Rolls came? - A. Mr. Rolls came first, and looked at the skins, and said he would swear to some of them; by this time Mr. Croft came, and then the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240049"></xptr>prisoner came; Mr. Rolls sent for a constable, and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. After you told the prisoner the goods were stolen, he came to you several times? - A. Yes; there was a hand-bill left at my house, saying that the shop had been broke open</p>
               <p>Q. It was publicly, and in open day, when he brought these skins to you, when several of your servants were in your house? - A. I believe it was about ten o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether he was not consistent in every part of the story he told you, in the course of this transaction he had with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- CROFT sworn. - On the 19th of April, I had fifteen skins sent to me - bucks and does, and two butts from Mr. Chrees, to be examined; I suppose there were ten of them that I would give fifteen shillings a skin for; there were several private marks on them, that breeches-makers do not know themselves; there were two marked with the letter M on the neck; I have no doubt but some of the skins cost the breeches-maker twenty-two or twenty-three shillings a-piece; I tied them up, and told Mr. Chrees's young man that I would be there in ten minutes, and he took the skins.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Chrees? - A. I did, and I saw Mr. Chrees and his partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there when the prisoner came on the next morning? - A. I was there before he came, and Rolls was there before me; when the prisoner came, I took upon me to ask him some questions respecting the skins; I asked him how he came by them, and he told me that he had them from Couling, at the Swan public-house; I asked him if we should send for Mr. Couling; he left it for us to do as we pleased; Freeman, the constable, was there, and he said we had better take Gegg to the counter, and the skins were left at Mr. Chrees' house till the constable returned, and then the constable had the charge of them; Mr. Freeman went and told Couling what charge had been given against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley Q. When you saw the prisoner, and asked him how he came by those skins, he told you he had them from Couling? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Couling taken into custody? - A. The constable and I went and told Couling, and Couling said he would come down.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take charge of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not let him go away? - A. I must say that I looked after him, I did not wish him to go away.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the name of the other man? - A. No, I do not.

               <p>Q. Then you knew the name of the prisoner? - A. Yes, Gegg was with me at the time at the bar; I told him, very well, I would take care of it, and on Thursday morning following, the other man then in company brought the parcel.</p>

No; he told me to take care of it, and give it to Gegg as soon as he called for it; I told him I would, and on the Friday morning, Gegg, the prisoner, called and asked if a parcel had been left for him; I told him, yes, and gave it to him.</p>

In the two pair of stairs front room; I generally keep the small parcel below stairs, but this being a large one, I took it up stairs; I have generally fifteen or twenty parcels left at my house in a week, being near an inn.</p>

               <p>Q. After you delivered it to the prisoner, did you see any thing more of the prisoner in the course of that day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The next day did you see any thing of him? - A. Yes, about the same time, I saw him the next day in my own tap-room; he asked me if that person was there that left the parcel for him; I told him, no, and that he would not be there; I saw no more of him till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. So that all you had to do with the parcel was to receive it from one man, and to keep it till the other man called for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240050"></xptr>Q. And that was on Friday morning, and it appeared to you to be leather in a green bag? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Your wife was assisting you? - A. My wife was not up; she is never up till a little before eleven, she sits up the last person of an evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Your servants were there, they might see the person as well as you? - A. They might, or might not, they were about their business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this that you went before the Magistrate? - A. The bundle was left with me on Thursday morning, and on Friday morning I delivered it, and on Saturday morning Mr. Croft and the constable informed me that they had stopped the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then on Monday you went before the Magistrate? - A. I attended all day on Saturday, and on Monday I went again.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you make any inquiry with your servants - did you bring any one of them before the Magistrates? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You attended as a witness against the prisoner? - A. I attended to give an account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to employ a solicitor to attend for you? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You, going to be a witness, employed an attorney? - A. When I heard the charge that was against me, I thought it necessary to have a gentleman of the profession; I was recommended by Mr. Kirby, who knew me well; he said that it was very necessary that I should have somebody with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any individual here to-day, which saw you give the bundle to the prisoner? - A. Not any body at all.</p>

               <p>Q. You said it was a large bundle, what was it covered with? - A. A green bag.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had not the curiosity to look into the bag to see what was in it? - A. I could see what was in it, because it was in such a state that it did not cover it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was leather, because the bag did not cover it - do you recollect that you said you thought it was leather, now you say you saw it plainly, because the bag did not completely cover it - you knew that this man was a porter to a linen-draper, in Queen-street, Cheapside? - A. I only know that he had lodgings in a street near Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think it an extraordinary thing, that a man should bring a bundle in a bag to be given to a man that was a servant to a merchant in the City? - A. No, because I am in the habit of receiving so many parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you are - did you put it in your bed-room? - A. No, in the front room, up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. The reason you tell us is, because it was a very large bundle, and not very well packed - the prisoner did not say when he was to call for it, nor the man that left it did not tell you when the man would call for it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was in your house every day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it up stairs, because you thought he would not call for it directly? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the prisoner had the parcel from you was it, when the prisoner told you that he suspected it was not come honestly by? - A. He asked me whether the person was there who left the parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that that parcel which he got of you was not come honestly by? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the house after he had been there? - A. I staid the whole of the day, I only went to market.</p>
               <p>Q. Directly after, or any time after he went out? - A. A short time after.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240051"></xptr>Q. Did you happen, after he was there, to take a small parcel out of the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out of the house, directly after the prisoner was there, did you not take a bundle out with you? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What day? - A. Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I suppose that if I was to ask you whether you said to the prisoner that, as he had mentioned your name, you would deny ever having given it to him? - A. I did not.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable, I was sent for to Mr. Chrees, in Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you find at Mr. Chrees's? - A. Mr. Chrees, Mr. Croft, and the prisoner, and the bundle was there.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was secured, we understand? - A. Yes; I produce the skins.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Rolls.) Look at these skins, and see whether there are any that you can identify? - A. This skin has my own hand-writing on it, which I made when I bought it, it is marked G and R. I have had this skin above two years; the other is my partner's hand-writing, and this white skin is a particular skin, it is watery in the inside; I know it by these water marks, there is a stamp with the letter L. I bought that skin of Mr. Law, he stamps them with that letter; here is another with my own mark, and here are likewise two butts; I cut a pair of breeches from them myself.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH - sworn. - I heard a noise in the shop the time this robbery was committed, about half past nine, on Sunday, the 31st of March; I rent the kitchen of Mr. Crosby, it is under the shop; I said to my husband, Mr. Rolls is going to-bed early to-night, it being rather an earlier hour than he usually went to-bed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Couling offered me some skins to sell for him; he asked me if I was a judge of skins, for he expected some in the course of a day or two; I told him I was not a judge of them myself, but I would take them to a gentleman that I thought was a judge; he told me the price would be six shillings a piece; I took them to Mr. Chrees, and that gentleman asked me what I expected profit on them, and I told him, a shilling a piece; I took a sample of them, and he desired me, if I could get the whole of them, to bring them, and he would send them to a gentleman that was a judge of them, and I took the whole of them; I called again afterwards to know what they said about them, and when I called, Mr. Chrees said, they were stopped; then I went to Mr. Couling's, but he was not at home; I went back again to Messrs. Chrees and Lord, and told them he was not at home, and likewise I called again on Mr. Couling, and then he was out; I went back again to Messrs. Chrees and Lord, and I left word I would call again; I called at Mr. Couling's on the next morning first; he said, you have not given my name, he said if I had, he would deny ever having them, and immediately he went up stairs, and took a bundle out with him, and said, if I came back again there, I should be transported.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a warehouseman, at No. 10, Queen-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever live as a servant with you? - A. Yes, as a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his character for honesty? - A. I had a good character with him, and in my own opinion he is as honest a man as any living.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, on the 31st of March, where the prisoner was in the evening? - A. Perfectly well; I went out to take a walk from my house, between five and six in the evening, and I returned about five minutes before eight; I had with me my two brothers, who live shopmen with Mr. Roberts, a grocer, in Fore-street; they are obliged to be home on a Sunday evening by nine o'clock, they supped with me; we supped at eight o'clock, on purpose to accommodate them; the prisoner waited at table, and removed the cloth also, and was in my house the whole of the evening, and never went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your reason for thinking so? - A. Because I saw him; soon after supper I went tobed myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - A. About ten o'clock; I have one of the gentlemen who dined that day and supped with me here; if he had not have borne a good character, I should not have took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him guilty of falsehoods? - A. No; I would take him again with pleasure.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time do you suppose the supper took up? - A. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no occasion to inquire for him, from the time of removing the cloth to the time you went to-bed? - A. Yes; I suppose about nine o'clock we wanted some hot water to make some brandy and water; then I saw him, and I saw him just before I went to-bed; I have every reason to believe that he slept in my house that night; I have asked my servants, and they say he did.</p>

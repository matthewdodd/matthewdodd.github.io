I immediately mentioned it to the prisoner and the other servant; in two days after that the prisoner went away; the prisoner went away before the family was up, leaving her clothes and wages. The other servant is gone home to her friends now. We had hand bills, offering ten guineas reward.</p>

On Friday the 5th of October I met the prisoner in Bishopgate-street, I laid hold of her arm, called a coach and put her in it, and brought her to my house. In the coach I asked her if she knew me; she said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been absent from the house while she was there - A. I had, I had only seen her once or twice.

               <p>Q. Did you see any article that was produced that you knew to be yours - A. Yes, a large blue muslin shawl. I found the shawl in Bishopgate-street, exactly opposite of where I took the coach; it was a silk shawl, I knew it belonged to me. I went with the officer to her lodgings in the City-road, the prisoner accompanied us. I there saw a gown of Mrs. Ballin's, and a pair of bracelets; she produced them herself, and some lace that she had taken the morning she absconded, and she said she had taken four children's caps that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else found upon her - A. A silk handkerchief of Mr. Ballin's was taken off her person, the fellow half of this handkerchief we found at the pawnbroker's.

            . I am an officer. On the 5th of October I was sent for by Mr. Ballin; I found the prisoner at his house, I called her of one side, and asked her a number of questions; she denied knowing any thing of the robbery. She said she had no lodgings since she left her master's place, Mr. Ballin's; she slept any where where she could. After some time a respectable gentlewoman knocked at the door and came into the room and asked Mr. Ballin if the woman that he took in the coach had robbed him. The prisoner was by the side of me, and within hearing. Mr. Ballin said she had; she said she thought so, she saw the prisoner through a handkerchief out of the coach-door, and she saw a coachman pick it up in Bishopgate-street, near the

               <p>Coombes. After the lady had said so, the prisoner then said, if I would go of one side she would tell me all about it. She said that she did rob her mistress, and that she had concealed the property in the cellar until she could get it away. She then told me that she had put her pocket-book into the pocket of the coach-door that her master had brought her in, which contained all the duplicates that she had robbed her master of. Then she told me where she lodged. Mr. Ballin and I immediately went after the coach, where she had left the pocket-book. We found the coach in the Minories. Mr. Ballin had taken the number of the coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ballin. I took the number of the coach; I am quite sure the coach I found in the Minories was the coach I brought the prisoner in; I found the key in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Coombes. Mr. Ballin opened the coach-door, stepped into the coach, and took the pocket-book out of the pocket of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look into the pocket-book and see the contents of it - A. When we came back to Mr. Ballin's we did; she then picked out the duplicates and told where the property was pawned. I then went to her lodgings, and this gown was hanging in her bed-room; it is one of Mrs. Ballin's gowns. In searching a trunk in her room we found some lace, and different things that she said she had taken from Mrs. Ballin, caps, and a pair of bracelet snaps. Then we went to Mr. Matthews's in Wheeler-street, the prisoner went with us there also.</p>

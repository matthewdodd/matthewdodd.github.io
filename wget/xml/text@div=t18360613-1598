On the 15th of April the prisoner came to house—he said he wanted two hides for Mr. Shand—I had dealt with his father—I left him have them, and he signed the book in Mr. Shand's name—he did not say he was Mr. Shand—I left him have the hides on the faith, and believing that he came from my customer. Mr. Shand.</p>

            . I live at 45, Checquer-alley, Whitecross-street. On the 5th of January, about twenty minutes to six, in the dusk of the evening, I was going through Bull-yard, Golden-lane; it leads into Aldersgate-street.

               <p>Q. Had you any other refreshment before - A. No, I had not. The two prisoners were in the taproom; they were sky larking with a young man, one of them flung a pint pot at his head, instead of the pot hitting him it hit me. I got up, and asked the prisoners what business they had to throw the pot at me. They then said, did not I like it. I said, no, I did not. They then came both of them and struck me. I did not offer to strike them, but as soon as I had drank up my beer, I went away. They followed me out of the public-house into Ball-court. They knocked me down there, and knocked my cap off my head, and this handkerchief was round my cap. My cap I picked up myself, and run away. I saw one of the prisoners pick up my handkerchief. That was

               <p>Q. Which was worth the most, the cap or the handkerchief - A. The cap was worth a shilling, the silk handkerchief cost me nine shillings. She picked up the handkerchief and cap, and separated the cap from the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her separate the one from the other - A. No. I picked up the cap in the street, and after I had lost the handkerchief I went to an officer. I told him what public-house I had been in. I went with the officer, and as soon as I came into the passage I met Oliphant; she knocked me down in the sight of the officer. Cox was not with her then. She tried to run away.</p>

            . I am a constable of the parish of St. Luke. Me and my brother officers were coming from Worship-street office; the prosecutrix came and told us, she was knocked down by two women, and robbed of a silk handkerchief. The prosecutrix appeared as if she had been drinking, but not much. She had her understanding. She seemed as if she had drank more than half a pint of porter. We went with her to the corner of Brackley-street, Golden-lane.

             was sitting there with a basket of sprats. The prosecutrix pointed her out, and said, that was one of them that run away with her handkerchief. Cox said she would not go until the other one was taken. We took Cox to the watchhouse. Oliphant was not taken untill the next day.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Luke's. When I saw the prosecutrix, she was rather intoxicated. Downes told me she had been knocked down, and robbed of an handkerchief. Downes was with me when I saw Oliphant, and as we were going by, Oliphant struck her on the face, without, Downs saying any thing to her. I went up to Oliphant; I said, you did not know that an officer was so near. I did not know that she was one of them that had done the robbery. I told her there would be a warrent for her in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after Oliphant struck Downes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130041"></xptr>that she charged her with the robbery - A. About an hour afterwards.</p>

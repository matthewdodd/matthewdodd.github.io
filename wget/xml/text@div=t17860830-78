               <p>What did he do? - He took my pockets that were underneath my head.</p>
               <p>What was in your pockets? - Nothing but my spectacles, one guinea, and two shillings, wrapped up in a paper; he took the guinea and the two shillings, and left the spectacles; when he had taken the money, he sat down again by my bedside; I heard the other men, and saw them go out of my room, and into my master's room.</p>
               <p>Had you any light at this time? - When they had done with my master, one of them came back and said, where is the tinder box? the prisoner never moved from my bedside; he never went to my master's room; I told him the tinder box was on the chimney place below; then one of them went down and struck a light; the prisoner staid with me; I was never left; then the man brought a light into my room; the man was not disguised at all; he was dressed in a white flannel waistcoat, with sleeves; the other man went away with his light; the prisoner still staid with me; I never was left; they came back to my room, and brought the light, and this man said we have done; and they came round to my bed's feet, and they all went away together; they went down stairs, and let themselves out at the front door; I take it altogether, first and last, I had the opportunity of observing this man seven or eight minutes; I took particular notice of him; my eye was never off him; and there was a great sash thrown up, that was never down; it was star-light, but no moon.</p>
               <p>Look round at the prisoner, and tell my Lord and the Jury, whether you are sure that is the man? - I am sure of it; I have no doubt of it; I had so much clear sight by the light of the candle, that I could not mistake; I described the man next morning to my master; I told him he was black complexion man, broadish face, and thickish body; I described his dress the next morning to my master; I saw the prisoner again at Mr. Wilmott's Office; the house was broke open on Wednesday, the 16th; I came to town on a Tuesday, to Mr. Wilmott's office, a fortnight after, and saw him, and knew him directly; he was sitting with the two other men that were taken with him; there were several other people in the room; nobody pointed him out to me; I picked him out from the rest; he had a blue coat on, and a striped waistcoat; I knew the face of him, and desired Mr. Wilmott to strip him into his flannel waistcoat, with sleeves.</p>
               <p>Did you know him then? - Yes, that was the very same dress he had on when he came and sat by my bedside, I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>Had you then, or have you now, any doubt of his person; is that the gentleman? - He is.</p>
               <p>Court. During this time, did he say any thing to you? - Only one word, he bid me lay still, I screamed.</p>
               <p>You were abed at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you jump out of bed at that alarm? - I was going to sit up, but they pushed me down.</p>
               <p>Did he permit you to turn and look about? - Yes, he never confined my head at all.</p>
               <p>This was a star-light night you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a tolerable clear night? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Could you see any thing by that light? - Not perfectly without a candle.</p>
               <p>Suppose the candle had not been brought, could you have sworn to him without that light? - No, I would not.</p>
               <p>Did you ever look at his face? - I could not keep my eye off from him; he never offered any violence.</p>
               <p>Did he say nothing to you? - He only said when I screamed, do not scream, for there is more at the ladder foot.</p>
               <p>I only give you this caution, that you are aware that this man's life may rest upon your evidence; after that, look at the man, and see if you are sure? - Very sure, I have no doubt about it.</p>

               <p>What time were you alarmed? - About two.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing you heard or saw? - The first thing I heard, was a noise and rumbling of some sort; then I heard the woman halloo out; there was nobody else in the house; we sleep in two rooms on the same floor; I got out of bed with intent to lock my door; two men rushed into it before I could get it locked; then I made for the bed again, and one of them tumbled atop of me, and I had a scuffle with him, and the other struck me twice on the head with a stick; then they tied my legs and hands; they tied me with one of their garters, and a piece of packthread; one of them said, let us get a light from below stairs; they took six silver tea spoons; one pair of silver tea tongs; a pair of stockings; a silk handkerchief, and a gown; they went out at the front door; and they left me tied as I thought, but then I dare not stir; they left this stick under the bed of Mrs. Griffin; as soon as they were gone, I got up.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - When I got a light, it was almost three; it was more than half past two when they went away.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing at the window of the woman's chamber? - A ladder; it came from Enfield; it is a mile, or rather better to Wynchmore-hill; only two men came into my room.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Griffin describe to you, who had been in her room? - One, she said, sat by her all the time; she gave me a particular description of him; I went to Enfield last Sunday morning; it was ten days after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Who did you find at Enfield? - I was drinking at a publick house with another man, and I saw the prisoner and another man talking in the street; he was then dressed in a little flannel waistcoat with sleeves, a white one; he was talking to a shoemaker; in consequence of that, I came up to London to Mr. Wilmott's, and got a warrant on suspicion; I went down with the officers, and took him into custody last Monday at Enfield; he had the same dress on; he put on a coat I believe, before he came out of Enfield; I brought him to Mr. Wilmott's office; she came on the Tuesday morning, and saw him in that dress; there were about a score in the room; she picked him out, and she said she would swear to him.</p>

               <p>Was he pointed out to her? - He was not; she said that is the man that robbed my master's house, but he was not in a coat, he was in a white waistcoat; then he pulled off his clothes, and stood in the white waistcoat; and the woman said, that she was still positive that he was the man, and remarked, that he had a round hat cocked up on the sides, and his hat corresponded, with that he was committed; I am constable of the parish.</p>

               <p>Then there are five of you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you found him with a hat, this hat was a round hat, turned up on each side? - Yes, I have seen many such.</p>
               <p>How many? - I dare say I have seen hundreds, and I have seen people in white waistcoats.</p>
               <p>Is it not a common dress for labouring and working men to wear? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did the man that tied you, continue with you? - One stood with me, but I do not know which.</p>

               <p>Had you seen nobody that had seen the prisoner before he went to town; had you been told he borrowed a coat? - Yes, since I came to town, I did not hear before I came there.</p>
               <p>Did you hear he had borrowed a coat before you had looked at him? - Yes, before I swore to him; I cannot tell who told me; they were talking about it? -</p>
               <p>How many men came into the room with light to you? - One, only one.</p>
               <p>Then during the whole of this time, did you see only two men? - When they first came in I saw three, but afterwards only two.</p>
               <p>Was the light that was brought to you at two different times, brought by the same person, or by two different persons? - By one person only.</p>
               <p>Did you see enough of that man to be able to swear to him? - No, I could not; it was only one man; it was the same man that brought the light both times; my master came into my room as soon as he was gone; and he went and called this man; he brought Arnold home with him.</p>
               <p>Did he bring any body else? - No.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, are you sure he brought nobody in the house that morning but Arnold? - Not all at once; he brought this Mr. Oliver, then Mr. Arnold; and he looked up and down the house to see if there was any body in the house; then he asked me if I could stay by myself, and I staid by myself till he went to Mr. Oliver's, and after that, Mr. Batchelor came up with him.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Oliver come? - No, not then; they found me in the house up by the fire place in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan. What time in the morning</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300111"></xptr>was it when these people came into the house? - A little after two, as near as I can guess; it was star-light.</p>
               <p>Did they bring a light when they came in first? - No.</p>
               <p>How did you know it was three? - I saw them, one stood with me.</p>
               <p>Did they all three come back again? - Not in my room, one came back to call the man that stood with me.</p>
               <p>What sort of light was brought in? - A pretty large candle.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - Threescore and three.</p>
               <p>Do you use spectacles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not you afraid? - Yes, I was, that made me look more at him.</p>
               <p>When you had your sight at the best, did you never find that when a light came suddenly upon you it confused you? - Yes.</p>

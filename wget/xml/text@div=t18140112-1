               <p>Q. On Wednesday, the 10th of November, did you see them all safe - A. It was on the Friday preceding the Wednesday, they were all safe then. I sent for them home on the 17th, only ten were brought home; two bay geldings were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the value of them - A. Seventy pounds both. On the 17th I learned two were missing; on the Tuesday following, I received some information from Cambridge of the two bay horses; on the Wednesday, I went to Cambridge; I found my horses; they were brought and delivered back to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these two geldings that were delivered to you at Cambridge the two geldings you missed - A. They were.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Froggett. I had the care of Mr. Wilkinson's horses in my master's field. On Tuesday I was in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the horses all safe then - A. I did not tell them then. I told them on Monday; they were safe then.</p>
               <p>Q. On Tuesday did any thing strike you as wrong - A. No. The gate was shut, a lashing stick was drawed through the staple, and nailed each side of the stick, the gate was fast; on Tuesday morning the horses appeared to be there; I did not count them. On Wednesday, first of all, I looked round the field to see whether the horses were there or not; the horses were all gone, and the gate was open.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear to you that the gate had been opened - A. The gate could not have been opened without the stick had been broken out; the stick had been fastened with a nail each side. I went all round the field; I could not trace how they got out any where, but at the gateway; it being wet and dirty, there were the marks of their feet at the gateway. I found ten horses in the Edgware-road, in a field about half a mile off; the two geldings I could not find; they were two of the twelve.</p>

I exchanged a horse of mine for the bay gelding, and I gave a one-pound note, and a shilling to boot; my man took the gelding home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he afterwards propose to you to buy another horse - A. I told him I could not buy it; I had got another, I would exchange with him for it. We exchanged for that, and I gave him five golden guineas, and another horse in exchange for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine these two bay geldings more particularly after you had exchanged - A. I did, after they were cleaned I found them much better horses than those I had exchanged them for; upon that I went in search of the prisoner; I found him at the White Horse, and the younger prisoner at the Bell.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them did you find first - A. The eldest. I found out the youngest at the Bell in Northampton-street; something a friend of mine said to me induced me to think there was another. When I saw the young one, I asked him whether he was waiting for a young man of the name of Loakes; he said he was. I then told him, I had exchanged some horses with him, and I thought they were stolen. The young one went with me to the White Horse, there we found the elder; I told the elder that I had strong suspicion the horses were stolen horses. He gave me the name of

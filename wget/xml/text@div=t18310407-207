On Saturday night, the 12th of February, I was coming to the shop, No. 1. - I was in a dark passage, and saw the prisoner and Gibson coming towards me; they came to my shop, held their coats over a piece of beef, and brought it away between them under their coats; Gibson had the beef at first, and gave it to the prisoner - I stopped them, and said, "What have you there?" they turned round, said nothing, but threw the beef down between them - I hallooed out, and a man picked it up; the prisoner was taken on Good Friday, which was six weeks after - I knew him before; I had a warrant to search his house, but he had left it - Gibson has been tried.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say you did not see him till Good Friday? A. I saw him once, but was too far off to get him; he laughed at me, and ran away out of Wylie's house - I had nobody to mind my shop while I followed him; I cannot swear I have not seen him three times at night in another dress - I might not know him - I saw him but once by day-light; I have known him four years; I very likely may have quarrelled with him - he was a witness for me here once, and said he could not swear to the man, though he had known him six years; this was about three years ago, when my shop was broken open - he has been impudent to me in the street.</p>

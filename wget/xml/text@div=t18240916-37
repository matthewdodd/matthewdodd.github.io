            . The prisoner never accounted to me for 6 s. 7 1/2 d. received from Mr. Page. We charged him with having received money which he had not accounted for on Monday the 22d of July; he said he had received different sums which we mentioned to him, and Mr. Page's was one of them. He never stated anything about it till we charged him with it, in consequence of Mr. Macauley's servant stating what she did.</p>

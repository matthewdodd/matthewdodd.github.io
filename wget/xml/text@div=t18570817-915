On 4th Aug., about a quarter past 12 o'clock at night, I was sitting on a step outside the Plough, at Stockwell—the prisoner came up by himself; he had another man with him, who kept-at a distance—the prisoner took hold of my watch guard, and took my watch out of my pocket—he knocked me down; I got up, and scuffled, and tried to get my watch away from him, and while this scuffling was going on he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> my watch away—the constable came up after the prisoner threw the watch away—the other man ran away—Dennis Flannigan picked up my watch—I had it again—I had had a drop of drink, but I knew what I was doing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at South Lambeth, and am a plasterer. I was coming past Stockwell Green about a quarter past 12 o'clock that night—I saw the prosecutor, the prisoner, and another man, standing just by the door of the Plough—all I could hear was something about gin—as I came along the road, the watch was thrown about two yards before me—I do not know who threw it—I picked it up—the prosecutor ran to me, and said, "That is my watch"—the other two men were there—I held the watch up, and said, "Does this belong to you?"—they said, "No"—I said to the prosecutor, "Then it must belong to you," and I gave it him—he said to the other men, "It must be one of you has done this"—I said, "Give him in charge"—the prosecutor called, "Police!"—one man ran away—the prisoner stopped till the policeman came up in two or three minutes—the prosecutor said, "I have a great mind to give you in charge for stealing my watch"—the prisoner said, "What do you mean by accusing me of stealing your watch?" and he struck him.</p>

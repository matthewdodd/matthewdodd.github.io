               <p>to meet him by appointment—we then went to Cowan's office to see what money could be procured, Cowan and the prisoner walking before me, apparently consulting—Cowan first gave me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—he then asked the prisoner how much money he had paid away that day—the prisoner apparently looked over his books, and said from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—Cowan then asked the prisoner how much money he had in hand—the prisoner said two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Bank of England notes—I got that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—Cowan then asked the prisoner to take a receipt stamp, and go to Mr. Something, I did not catch the name, and ask for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for Mr. Cowan—the prisoner came back in about ten minutes, and presented the gentleman's compliments to Mr. Cowan, and stating that he paid only once a month—the prisoner said, "You know, Mr. Cowan, these large houses will not make an entry of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I went again on Friday, the 15th August—I went purposely to get Cowan's receipt that the goods were held by him at his packers to my order—I asked him for it—I then had perfect confidence in his honesty—the prisoner was there, out and in—I would not swear that he was there at the time I asked Cowan for his receipt—Cowan said he was a business man and the proper way was to have the packer's receipt, to which I agreed—we then went into the large apartment, and I am certain the prisoner was then present—Cowan said, "We will go and get the receipt," meaning the packer's receipt—I then left the court by the right-hand and they by the left—I went back to the Waverley—they left together—about twenty minutes afterwards they came together to the Waverley—they both came into the smoking-room—I believe Cowan brought the receipt; whether it was in his hand or not I will not swear, but my impression is that he carried it in his hand at the time he came into the smoking-room—I went out of the smoking-room with Cowan into the coffee-room—the prisoner stayed in the smoking-room—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the receipt—he said it was the packer's receipt—it is dated 14th August (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "25, Jewry-street, Aldgate; received from Mr. James Walker, two bales of goods, which are at his disposal. Billengay and Co., paid carriage"—the words "paid carriage," are my writing—it is a mere memorandum—after I had received the receipt the prisoner and Cowan left together—I never saw them again until the prisoner was taken into custody—in the early part of September I went to the office in Union-court—I did not find either Cowan or the prisoner there—I did not go up stairs—there were a number of gentlemen in the lobby, or on the stairs, apparently creditors—I afterwards saw some of the goods at Mr. Venables'—on 4th September, I sent this telegram—"James Walker, Barnard Castle, to Henry Cowan; say prompt by telegram when you will be here or remittance may be expected; why not here, Saturday?"—the first visit on the 14th was near 10 o'clock—the second was between 1 and 2—on the 15th when I went to the office it might have been about 4 in the afternoon—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are part of the goods made by us—they are not part of those that were sent between 1st and 19th August—they are connected with a sale to Cowan on 5th June, through Mr. Thompson, the agent.</p>

               <p>time—I never saw his place of business—his dealings were in a small way—I simply saw him in our place of business, and knew him as a customer—a few days before 1st August he came to me about selling some goods—that was the first transaction of the kind I ever had with him—he said he wished to sell some woollen goods for a shipper, and he wished to know if I could purchase them—he said that the person wanted money to meet a payment that day and, therefore, he would sell the goods cheap—I asked him if the transaction was all right and who the person was—he said that everything was perfectly correct, that he was short of money, and that was the reason he was selling the goods—he said it was Mr. Cowan, of Union-court, Old Broad-street—I went with him to Union-court, Old Broad-street—I there saw Mr. Cowan and he showed me the goods—the prisoner was present—he introduced me to Mr. Cowan—I believe the prisoner assisted in showing me the goods—they were unpacked and in piles—I bought goods to the amount of 365<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I saw no invoice of the goods I purchased—I did not ask to see it—I did not inquire where they came from—I said to Mr. Cowan, "Do you generally deal in these goods?"—he said he did—"Because, "I said, "I should like to know that this transaction is all right"—he said, "It is perfectly correct; I am short of money, that is the only reason; I am selling the goods to meet a payment this day"—I asked if it was all right, because he wished to sell the goods for cash, and I did not know him before—I have the invoice (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it is for 365<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—it is an invoice from Cowan to me, subject to the discount of thirty-five per cent. the goods requiring that discount to make them of market value—I have since found that I can purchase goods of the Tees Woollen Company quite as cheap—I paid 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to Mr. Cowan on the delivery of the goods that afternoon, 1st August, and I subsequently paid 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on the 4th—the prisoner was present during some of the transaction—Cowan and I arranged the price—the prisoner was in the offices at the time, but I believe he was not within hearing at the time the arrangement was made—I paid the prisoner a commission of 2 1/2 per cent. on the nett price, minus the 35 1/2 per cent.—I paid him the commission because I understood it was the only payment he would receive—if I had thought he had been Cowan's clerk I should not have paid him the commission—I paid him because he introduced the trans<lb></lb>action—there was no receipt given for the commission—the goods were not all unpacked and in piles; they were on the first occasion; they were all un<lb></lb>packed—I saw the canvas about—a portion was not quite opened out and put in piles—on the 14th August I bought some other goods—the prisoner brought the patterns of those goods to me—I believe it was between 10 and 2 o'clock—I bought from the patterns—he did not tell me where the goods were—he simply showed me the patterns of the goods—it is customary for us to buy goods from patterns—he simply showed me the patterns and I purchased them—the patterns would tell me what the quantity was—any man knowing the business would know the quantity from the patterns—the patterns represent the quantity—he showed me the goods and asked me whether I could buy them—I made him an offer—he went to Mr. Cowan and Mr. Cowan accepted it, and brought the goods—I agreed to pay the same as the others, deducting 35 1/2 per cent.—I produce the invoice—the invoice price made out to me was 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I paid that less 35 per cent. and deducting 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the prisoner's commission of 2 1/2 per cent and paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on that day—Mr. Cowan came when the goods were delivered for the payment of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—he said he wished for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I am not positive whether the prisoner was with him when the money was paid, but I believe</p>

               <p>he was—the goods were delivered on the 14th—Mr. Cowan came for the money shortly after the goods were delivered—in fact, I saw Cowan before I saw the goods—the goods came within two hours after the prisoner had concluded the bargain with me—I don't know what they were delivered in—I saw them after they had been delivered in my warehouse—we have trusses constantly delivered—they were unpacked when I saw them opened out—I gave instructions to our young men to bring the goods for me to see—when I first saw the goods they were all unpacked—I do not know how the invoice price that was made out to me was arrived at—of course I valued them; it is not likely I should buy goods without putting a value upon them—Cowan quoted the price, and I said, "It is no use my looking at these goods at this price; these prices are perfectly ridiculous"—he said, "I will take you a discount off"—I said, "What discount?"—he said, "Twenty-five"—I said, "That won't do; I could not sell them at the price"—I was going to leave the goods—he persuaded me to buy them, as he wanted the money—I had not seen the invoice that came from the Tees Company in the first instance—I have not seen it now—I do not know how it is that the invoice corresponds with the other—I did not see it at the time; but previous to completing the first transaction I asked Cowan to give me satisfaction that everything was correct, and I wished to know that he regularly dealt in woollens—he said he did, and he went to his desk, pulled out two or three invoices, and said, "See there, I deal regularly in woollens; and for further reference I refer you to Messrs. Spielman, my bankers; they will give you every satisfaction as to my respectability"—I went there, and the answer was perfectly satisfactory—those were the only two parcels I bought of him—I paid a commission to the prisoner on a third parcel of goods—my brother bought them during my absence in the North—I did not pay that money to the prisoner—I did not agree with the prisoner about it—the third transaction was not with me—it was a similar transaction to the others—that was on 23d August—it was not a trans<lb></lb>action of mine, it was my brother's—I paid the prisoner the commission myself—I paid him the commission on the two amounts together, of the 14th and 23d—I find in our petty cash-book two amounts of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., each entered to him for commission—altogether I paid 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., commission to him—that was on the three parcels—when I went to Cowan's office, I do not recollect seeing any other woollen goods there except those I bought—he told me that he was an importer of French and German goods and optical instruments, and he exported British goods—I fancy I know the value of goods, and the market from which they come—I knew the description of goods that these were.</p>

               <p>price; it was a ridiculous price—I refused the goods at 30 per cent of, and was going to leave the office, and then he consented to take off 35—it was after that that the invoice was made out, after I left the office—it was made out at the original price that he asked me, and then the 35 per cent deducted—I believe it was made out by Cowan—I should say it was his writing—he presented the invoice when he applied for the money that day at my place—no invoice was made out while I was at his office; at least it was not handed to me then—Cowan came for the money one or two hours afterwards—the prisoner came into the shop—I don't know whether he went into the counting-house—I believe Cowan and I were alone in the counting-house—it was then that he presented the invoice—the 35 per cent. was taken off, and I paid him the money—I gave him a cheque and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in gold—on 14th October, the second transaction, the prisoner came with samples, in the same way as at first, and Cowan came with him and brought the goods—I feel almost certain that the prisoner was with him—Cowan came within one or two hours after the prisoner had been first; I can't say the exact time—Cowan came directly after the goods arrived—the first I knew of the arrival of the goods was when Cowan presented me the invoice—I am speaking of the second trans<lb></lb>action—he came and brought the invoice, and said he would accept the price—I don't know who brought the goods—I saw the prisoner afterwards in the shop—I saw Cowan first—I don't know whether the goods had arrived before Cowan came—the same thing happened as on the first day; he deducted the thirty-five per cent., and I paid him the money in the counting house; my brother was present—the prisoner was not there at the time I paid Cowan—I gave him a cheque—the two sums of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., paid to the prisoner for commission, were paid from the petty cash—I should think it was paid about the 5th or 6th August—the commission on the second transaction, I think, was paid about the 28th—the reference to the banker was quite satisfactory to me, and it appears that it was quite satisfactory to the Tees Woollen Company—in a transaction with a stranger, I should always make an inquiry—since this we have purchased goods of the Tees Woollen Com<lb></lb>pany, through their agent—I have bought precisely the same goods as those I bought of Cowan, and I bought them considerably under the price that Cowan asked me; they offered them at from twenty to forty per cent, less than Cowan asked me—I could have purchased precisely the same sort of goods at nearly the same price that I paid Cowan—I did purchase some at a less price than I paid Cowan—I purchased three pieces at the average of about twenty-five per cent; if I had cleared the lot they offered me, I be<lb></lb>lieve they would have averaged over thirty-five per cent less than they sold them to Cowan—those I bought of the Company averaged less than those I bought of Cowan, less than the price Cowan asked—that was ten per cent higher than the price I paid Cowan, but they offered me other goods as high as forty per cent. less than Cowan's price—the prices of these goods fluctuate according to the exigencies of the trade, and what suits one man's trade does not suit another—in one month they are frequently twenty per cent. cheaper—at the present time I could buy fancy goods like these at twenty-five per cent. less than I could two months ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Hoxton—I was for four months errand boy in the employment of Mr. Cowan—I know the prisoner—he was there every day I was there—I went there in May—I don't know what the prisoner used to do; there was business going on there—there were a good many goods delivered there—I recollect the prisoner telling me one day that he and Mr. Cowan were going to the packers; that was Mr. Southgate's, in London-wall.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there any other clerk there besides the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—a person named Fielder came the morning I left; that is about a month ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Robinson-road, Kingsland—I was in the service of Mr. Cowan—I went there on the Saturday morning before 1st September—on the Monday afterwards I recollect this telegram coming—I gave it to the prisoner—I wrote this letter in answer by the prisoner's instructions—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that Mr. Cowan, not having received any remittance from Paris, had left for that city, and might be expected back on Friday or Saturday next</hi>)—I did not see Mr. Cowan after I wrote that letter—I have not set eyes on him since—this letter was written on the Monday; the prisoner left on the Saturday afterwards—he said on the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and so on, other goods might arrive, and if so I was to ship them to Hamburg—on the Saturday he gave me the key of the office to give to the housekeeper—he did not return after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know of Mr. Cowan having left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he told me when he engaged me that he was going to Paris, and he might be five or eight days away, and I was to follow the instructions of the prisoner—that was on the Friday, the day before he left—I did not see him after</p>

               <p>1 o'clock on the Saturday—the prisoner continued to come to the office as usual till the Saturday following—I drew money of the prisoner in the week, intending to repay him when Mr. Cowan came back—I should rather think there was money due to me on the Saturday—I suppose Mr. Cowan owes me something now—the prisoner is a foreigner—I don't suppose he can write English very well—I think I am a good writer; I ought to be—I am now doing a little work occasionally.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was the largest balance at any time in his favour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think about 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—on 7th August the aggregate amount paid in by him was 544<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., between 10th July and 12th or 14th August.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City detective officer—I apprehended the prisoner in Aldgate on 12th September, about 8 in the morning—I asked him if his name was Schocke—he said, "Yes, it is"—I said, "Do you know a person of the name of Cowan?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "He has got an office at 12, Union-court, Old Broad-street?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I want to ask you about two bales or trusses of goods that were sent up on 14th August"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What has become of them?"—he said he supposed they were shipped in the regular way—I said, "How could they be shipped in the regular way, when they have been sold close by here?"—he said, "I did not sell them, and I know nothing at all about them"—I asked if he knew where Cowan was—he said he believed he was on the Con<lb></lb>tinent—I told him that I was an officer, and I held a warrant, and he must consider himself in my custody—I then took him to the station—he gave his address, and told me his room was the third-floor front-room—I went there, and the landlady showed me the room—I saw there a portmanteau, a carpet bag, and a hat box, all packed up ready to be taken away at a moment's notice—the portmanteau was in a canvas wrapper, strapped, and locked.</p>

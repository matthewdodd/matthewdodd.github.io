(The box and things produced by Willey.) The box was broke open, and concealed under the bed, and a guinea and a half taken out, and some silver; I asked the prosecutrix if she had the key, she gave me her keys, and one of them opened the box; they have been in my possession ever since; the bundle, with a gown and coat lay by the box under the bed, which I afterwards put into the box, and locked it up.</p>

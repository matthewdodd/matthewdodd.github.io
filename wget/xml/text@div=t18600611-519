                  </hi>. I am single and live at 47, York-street Beth<lb></lb>nal-green, with my parents—I have known Joseph Endell for four years—I was engaged to be married to him; a quarrel took place between us—the prisoner then made proposals to me and I kept company with him rather better than two months—after that time I made it up with <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> and agreed to be married to him—we had the bauns published in the Church—after I made it up with <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, the prisoner did not say anything to me about marrying him and not marrying <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> after the banns were published—I saw the prisoner after the banns were published—on the night of 12th April I went out with a friend of mine to <hi rend="italic">Joe's</hi> aunt's, Mr. Bacon, to tea—while there a young woman came to me—in consequence of what she said I went out—I found the prisoner there—he knocked at the street door just as I was going to open it—he said, "Come along, <hi rend="italic">duckey</hi>; we won't run away"—I said, "What do you want here; I don't want you coming after me, it is no good"—when we had nearly got up to the arch he had his hands in his hind pocket, and in consequence of what Ann had told me, I thought he had something in his hand—I ran underneath the arch and he caught me up and said, "Do you intend marrying <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>?" I said, "Yes, I do; so take yourself off,"—he then struck me on the head with a knife—when I last saw him he was at the side of me—I cannot say whether there was more than one blow; I only felt one—I fell in the road—I remember the witness dragging me up out of the road—we ran into a baker's shop—a doctor examined my head when I got home—I was taken to the doctor's assistant; the doctor was not at home—he examined me—my head bled a great deal—I have got things at home that are soaked—the blow was very violent—it was the blow that struck me down—I kept my bed a fortnight afterwards.</p>

I live at 75, Hare street, Bethnal-green, and am a butcher—on the afternoon of 12th April, about half-past 5 o'clock, I heard a screaming outside the shop—I went out and saw the last witnesses running and the prisoner after them—they ran into a baker's shop—he was stopped against the door—he had a small knife with him, something similar to this—he was following them, he was some yards off of them—I did not notice how he was holding the knife—I took it away from him—he was not running after them to take care of them—he was not very violent—the police constable then came up.</p>

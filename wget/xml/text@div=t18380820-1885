                  </hi>. I am servant to William Roe, who lodges in Norton-street. At the time this happened, the prisoner was servant in the house—I missed master's watch from his sitting-room, and also his pedometer—I told Mrs. Leaf of it, and she afterwards gave me the watch—I told the prisoner if she would produce the pedometer, I would not prosecute her about the watch, but she denied all knowledge of it—on the way to the station-house I asked her again, and she said she would tell the truth, that she took the pedometer to give to a woman to tell her fortune, on the Monday morning before, and she took the watch to give to the woman to give her back the pedometer, as she thought there would be more said about the Pedometer than the watch.</p>

               <p>no stranger had been into the house—I went to the prisoner and told her it must rest with somebody in the house—she denied all knowledge of it—I said, "I must have a policeman in," and she then said the watch was not out of Mr. Roe's room, and after he was gone out she would give it to me-when he went out, she took me up stairs, went into the closet, looked about, and said, "It is not here, if you will go down stairs I will give it to his servant"—I went down stairs with her, and she gave me the watch out of a hole in the kitchen stairs—I asked what she had done with the pedometer—she said she gave it to a woman who she did not know.</p>

On the 14th of June, at half-past two o'clock, this money was in a till in the bar - I saw it safe a minute before it was missed. The prisoner was a stranger to me, I saw him in the taproom about one o'clock as a customer - the bar fronts the taproom-door - the bar-door is left open in the daytime. While I was walking towards the kitchen I saw the prisoner in the bar - I had left nobody there. I saw him draw the till out, returned, and caught him at the bar-door. I seized his hand, and took two 1 l. notes, a shilling, and three sixpences - I charged him with taking it out of the till. He had left it half open; I had closed it and turned the key. He said nothing. I put him in the taproom and sent for an officer. I examined the till, and found just that sum deficient.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner. Gordon charged him with stealing this money from the till. He was turbulent at first, but when he found that I was an officer he went quietly with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking along Cheapside, out of work, and having a large family, I met a labourer. who took me to the house to set a stove - the prosecutor said he had the mortar and every thing ready. I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280021"></xptr>into the kitchen, after having three or four pots of beer, which rather affected me. I was cutting the bricks away to make it fit - the prosecutor said if I did not do my work like a tradesman he would not let me finish it. I got drunk, and what occurred I do not know.</p>

             re-examined. Two labourers brought him in, he was rather intoxicated, and did abuse me for not letting him set the stove. I had marked the two notes half an hour before - the shilling and three sixpences laid on the notes. I know the notes are mine, they are marked Hayes, and Need whom I took them of.</p>

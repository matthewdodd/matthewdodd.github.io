I am single, and live at 52, Anchor Street, Blue Anchor Road, Bermondsey—about 7.30 p.m. on 1st June, I was going over London Bridge, towards the Surrey side, with a lady friend—she is not here—I was walking near the kerb when I felt someone at my pocket, and I turned round and saw the prisoner—I seized him by his coat, when he put his foot in front of me and tripped me up—I got up and I put my hand in my pocket and missed my purse—he ran off; I ran after him, and he was caught opposite Fishmonger's Hall—my purse contained 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and two farthings—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a policeman came up.</p>

Stop thief"!—I saw the prisoner running away and I chased him, and caught him outside Fishmongers' Hall—we both fell in the road—a constable came up.</p>

At about 7.40 on this evening I was standing by Adelaide Place, London Bridge, I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running from the bridge, on the side of Fish<lb></lb>mongers' Hall, followed by Carter, who fell with the prisoner, I caught hold of him—he had a purse in his hand, and he got his trousers undone in front, here, and endeavoured to put the purse in there—I took it from his hand and the prosecutrix came up and gave him in charge—he was very violent and had to be carried to the station—he bit one of the constables in the arm; he was very violent—600 or 700 persons followed us to the station; his language was dreadful—he had been drinking, but knew perfectly well what he was about—after he got to the station he shammed drunkenness, and fell down in the dock—he said "I am glad you have got me here, I am tired of this; where I am going I shall <hi rend="italic">get</hi> a good bed to lie on, and plenty to eat"—I searched him and found another purse on him and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. loose in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Partridge. No. One of our servants knew him some years, I did not; he was a gentleman's servant out of place, and lodged in Warwick-street; I went to Justice Fielding's, and got a warrant, and found the shirts and other things in his room where he lodged; the shirts are marked

            . The prisoner lodged with me 3 weeks. On the 8th of Nov. he asked me to lend him a handkerchief; about 2 o'clock at noon, he said he should bring home a parcel of linen, which he had for a little money from a pawnbroker's; he was not gone above a quarter of an hour, before he brought it, with 8 shirts and 3 neckcloths; he opened them before me: he went to bed at night a little in liquor. There came two gentlemen's servants, and asked for him; I told him he was wanted, he got up; they came up to him, and charged him with stealing the things, and that he had better acknowledge it; he denied it: he was taken before Justice Cox; there he said that the wicket of the gate was open, and he got in that way, and took the shirts and other things.</p>

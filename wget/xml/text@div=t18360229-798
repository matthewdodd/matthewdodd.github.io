                  </hi>. I am boot-maker, and live in South street, I took the prisoner into my employ three weeks ago—he did not lodge there—he boarded—I missed a pair of shoes last Sunday morning and a waistcoat on Monday—the prisoner did not come to work on Monday morning—I went to find him—he was not at his lodging—I went again on Tuesday, and waited a quarter of an hour—he came home—I asked him why he did not come to work—he said he was coming—I got him home—I asked him what he had done with a pair of shoes taken off the shelf—he said he and not taken them—I asked where waistcoat was—he opened his coat and said, "Here is the waistcoat"—I told my son to get an officer—he said, "If you will not get an officer, I will make you any amends I can and do what I can"—he said he had lent the shoes to a young man, but did not know his name—I have never found them.</p>

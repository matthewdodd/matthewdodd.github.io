                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Lightly, and his partner, wine-merchants, in Fenchurch-street. On 16th Aug. an order was brought to our place of business, I believe by the prisoner—he was in our office about half an hour, as there was some delay in getting the wine—I have not the least doubt that he is the person—I recognised him immediately at the police station—the order is signed by Mr. Philip Nind, who keeps the Sablonaire Hotel—the prisoner said he brought it from Mr. Nind—I said Mr. Nind's name was not spelt right—he said, "I don't know anything about it; I believe it is the clerk's writing, I brought it from Mr. Nind"—the cham<lb></lb>pagne which was ordered, was given to him by our porter, six dozen.</p>

On 6th Sept., I was at home at my own residence No. 1, York-terrace, Commercial-road, which is about one mile and a half or two miles from Mark-lane—the prisoner came there at a quarter before two o'clock, and brought a cask of beer which he took into the cellar, and brought up an empty cask which he put on his truck—he was to take it back to Mark-lane—this took him about a quarter of an hour—he left my house about two—I generally dine at one, but on that day it was half-past one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sub-warder at the House of Detention—the prisoner was committed on a warrant to the House of Detention on a charge of assault—on the morning of Tuesday, 26th October, I went to the refractory cell where he had been placed; that is a cell used by persons who are guilty of insubordinate conduct—I went with Principal Warder Cape to take some clothes to that cell—the clothes are always taken out of the cells at night and given to the prisoner the first thing in the morning—the prisoner asked what the clothes were for and we told him to put on, and he said he would put no more b——clothes on in that place—Cape said "Very well, take the bed out Godfrey"—I went to take the bed out and he struck Cape in the mouth—I went to Cape's assistance, and the prisoner turned round on me and caught me by the whiskers and struck me several times over the face and we fell down—while I was trying to get my whiskers from his hand he bit me on the thumb—we went for the assistance of other officers and when we got back the prisoner had broken up the bed and smashed the window, and he swore he would break the head of the first man who entered the cell—he was secured and put under restraint—he had got a portion of the bed in his hand—I had to go under Dr. Smiles for the bite in my thumb—I suffered pain for about a fortnight or three weeks all up the arm.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am surgeon at the House of Detention<lb></lb>Godfrey did not complain to me for two or three days, he treated the matter lightly at first—there was a wound on the right thumb, which inflamed and became more painful, the pain extending up the arm—he has got well, but at one time the thumb was very bad indeed; he was under my care about a fortnight—he has gone on with his duty, although he has been suffering much—the prisoner was not suffering from <hi rend="italic">delerium tremens</hi>—I have no doubt he had been drinking before he came into the prison, but this was several days afterwards—his arm was put out, but that was not done in the prison—I understood he would not get into the van at the police-office and he was forced in, but I know nothing further about that.</p>

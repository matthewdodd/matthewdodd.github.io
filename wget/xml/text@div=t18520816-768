                  </hi>. I am the brother of George Dunmore, the younger. On Saturday morning, 15th July, 1849, about 5 o'clock, I went with him to Plumstead marshes, and all the way I was persuading him not to go to fight—when we got there, I found the prisoner, and Scotcher, and two others—there was a fight with my brother and Scotcher, which lasted about thirty-five minutes—the prisoner was acting as second—my brother had a fall, I believe, rather than a blow—he could not get up—I got a cart from Mr. Foster, and took him home to his parents—he lived till about 12 o'clock that morning.</p>

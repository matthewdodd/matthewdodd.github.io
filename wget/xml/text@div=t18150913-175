            . I know the prisoner well. As soon as we guessed he had got something from Fogram, I followed him through the crowd, going through the mob, he put whatever he had got into his breeches; as soon as he got outside of the mob, I laid hold of him: he then ducked his head; he put his hand into his breeches, and then threw down the pocket-book, and then all the papers flew about. I was obliged to beat him desperately before I could get him along. I took him to the Ram, and there the prosecutor owned the pocket-book. Here is the pocket-book.</p>

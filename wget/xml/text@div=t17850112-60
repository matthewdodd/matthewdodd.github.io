               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for the Prosecution. Had you previous to that conversation made any promises to her? - I did with a view she should discover her accomplices.</p>
               <p>Then did you do any thing in consequence of her information? - I made a discovery of some linen from that information, I found a sheet and a table cloth at a public house in the neighbourhood, the sign of the Pitt's head, the corner of Old-street-road; in consequence of her examination, I examined the box and I found a duplicate, I did not know what it was, she said, it was what the pawnbrokers used; I applied to a pawnbroker's in Fan's-alley, and found nothing.</p>
               <p>Have you at any time since found any of your property in any body's hands? - Yes, two spoons in the custody of a pawn-broker in Old-street, his name is Hoskins.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Council. These two spoons, found at Hoskins's in Old-street-street road, was in consequence of the confession of the prisoner? - One of of them was, I should not have found out where it was without the duplicate which I found in her pocket.</p>
               <p>The woman told you that one of the spoons was pawned at the pawn-brokers? - I went to search for a tea-spoon, and found a table-spoon.</p>
               <p>The confession was obtained under promises that you would excuse her? - No.</p>
               <p>Whether there had not been something from you to induce the woman to confess<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120087"></xptr> this? - I took a great deal of pains with her, I had a great respect for her, she did not tell me till after two spoons were taken from her by force.</p>
               <p>In consequence of your good opinion of her, did not she remain at large, and might have absconded for two or three days? - I had an exceeding good opinion of her.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. That is more than the value? - No.</p>

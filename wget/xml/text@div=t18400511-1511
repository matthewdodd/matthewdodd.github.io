                  </hi>. I am foreman to Richard Evans and another, market-gardeners at Wall-end, East Ham. On the 26th of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was going to Wall-end, and saw the watchman, who is the prisoner, coming up my master's yard—I advanced towards him, and he dropped something—I went up to him, and said, "Duffy, to-morrow being a busy day, come and make three-quarters of a day"—he said, "Very well"—he then said he had got a load of dung, if he brought it, would the master buy it"—I said, "Before you go on with that, what did you drop?"—he made no answer—I advanced and found it was a sack containing these cabbage-plants—they were in my master's sack, and I have no doubt that the plants were my master's—he used to work for half a day, or three-quarters of a day, and watch at night, which made his wages about 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I went to Mr. Waldon, one of the masters, and told him—he came out and questioned the prisoner about what he had got in the sack—he said he merely wanted a <hi rend="italic">mess,</hi> and he hoped he would forgive him, it being the first time—I told Mr. Evans, and the prisoner was taken.</p>

               <p>I live in James-street, Westminster. On the third of October, as I was going with another gentleman to Brentford, in my own coach, at about eight at night, we were stopped by two highwaymen, near <placeName id="t17781209-26-crimeloc164">Gunnersbury-lane</placeName>

One came up and begged the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090027"></xptr> coachman to stop without any words; he came to the door of the coach and demanded our money.</p>
               <p>The coach did stop immediately? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Had he any arms? - One had a pistol, which I saw very plain; the other, the man that stopped the coach, was on the opposie side.</p>
               <p>The one that came up and demanded your money had a pistol? - I did not observe his pistol; it is natural to suppose he had one; the one that came afterwards on my side had a pistol. The man who stopped the carriage demanded our money; I gave him my money, but he not having a sufficient booty, I gave him my watch; he turned to the moon, and seeing nothing but silver, he said, gentlemen, I beg to have more money, I had much rather return your watches; and he asked for our purses; this was the man that came up first; the other, who was behind, hearing him complain, asked him what he had got; he said, nothing but silver, upon which the other came up to the right-hand side of the coach, and said, upon my word, gentlemen, if you do not give more money I will shoot you. After that he threatened to shoot the coachman.</p>
               <p>Did you take sufficient notice of them to be able to swear to them? - No, I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Neither to their persons nor to their horses? - No.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay with you? - It might be about three minutes, I cannot pretend to say. My watch is in the hands of Dixon.</p>

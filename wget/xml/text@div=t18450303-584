                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Accountant-General's office, in the Court of Bankruptcy. On Wednesday night, the 19th of Feb., I was at Mr. Cantor's, No. 6, Houndsditch, in a room adjoining the shop—it is parted from the shop by glass—I was looking through the glass, and saw the prisoner and another lad enter the shop—I watched for about a minute, and saw the prisoner take up a bale of sponge—he was ia the act of handing it to a boy, who was outside, when I ran out and collared him—the prisoner had the bale of sponge in his arms, and was stooping with it between the door and the passage—I knocked the sponge out of his arm with my knee, and put my foot upon it—I secured him, sent for a police-man, and gave him into custody.</p>

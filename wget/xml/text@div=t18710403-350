                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Townsend, of 8, Vincent Row, Westminster—the prisoner is my son—my husband had an apoplectic fit, and could do no work on Valentine's Day, and the prisoner was working in his stead, over at the yard, not 100 yards from our house, where Mr. Lock is one master, and Mr. Ancell the other—he came in about 12 o'clock, or a little after, to dinner, and at a few minutes after 5 o'clock to tea, and he went out again before 6 o'clock, and returned about 9.30, or a few minuted more—he was in the house from 5 to 6 o'clock—other witnesses were here yesterday, one of them, Pitman, could not come to-day, because I could not afford to pay the witnesses.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. My son lives with me—he was doing an odd job at cab washing, for a man who has cut his hand—he was employed at Jackson's building firm, but was discharged at the time of the frost, and has only worked with his father since—I do not know what he was doing on the day he was taken—I did not go before the Magistrate—I first heard that my son was charged when he wrote to me from Horsemonger Land Gaol—I have not got the letter—I burned it—he went out on 13th Feb<lb></lb>ruary, at 8.30 or 9 o'clock, as near as I recollect—on the 14th, when he came in at 12.30, I gave him a valentine which had been sent him—on the 15th he was cutting chaff for Mr. Lock, and was in bed before 10 o'clock—he did not tell me in the letter the time that he was charged; the detec<lb></lb>tives told me that—Charles Pitman is the cab-master, who he was working for—he was here yesterday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not know whether Pitman was seen here yesterday, I was in the ladies' waiting-room all day—two valentines were sent to my son—he washed himself between 5 and 6 o'clock, and went out.</p>

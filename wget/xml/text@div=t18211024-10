Ware, Gardner, and the prisoner, lived in the same room, and the prisoner slept with me - I saw them safe on Tuesday morning, the 2d of October, at seven o'clock, when I went to my employ, the sovereigns were wrapped up with the note, in a piece of paper - I left my box locked, I returned at eight o'clock to breakfast, the prisoner was then up stairs, both the others were gone - I came home to dinner between twelve and one o'clock, and went up stairs, the prisoner was gone then. I went to unlock my box, and found it was broken open, and missed a shirt, two sovereigns, and the Bank note; I gave an alarm. At two o'clock in the morning the prisoner came home, I charged him with it, and took him into custody. I found the shirt in Watling-street.</p>

            . I am watch-house keeper of Blackfriars. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, at two o'clock in the morning, charged with this robbery, I searched him, and in his hat, I found a shirt, I asked what mark was on it, he said, G. R. it was C. S. the prosecutor did not claim it. I found a card, on him, which led me to Mr. Duncan's, Monmouth-street, and there I found a 1 l., note, which Marriott claimed, and mentioned the initials on it before he saw it. I searched the prisoner again, and in his braces, I found 1 l. 15 s. 6 d., in silver.</p>

            . I keep a clothes shop, in Monmouth-street. On the 2d of October at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in, and bought a pair of trowsers for 4 s. 6 d., he paid me in silver, he bought a pair of stockings, for 2 s., and gave me a 1 l. note, and I gave him 18 s. I had no other 1 l., note by me; about ten o'clock the next morning, Potter came with Marriott - I shewed him the note, the prosecutor said, if it was his, it had "H. Hood" on it. I found it so.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you no more than that? - No, we went home to my sister's place, we all returned there with her; she lived in <placeName id="t17931204-32-crimeloc178">Dyot street</placeName>

               <p>Q. When was it she said that? - She told him it was a lie, she had received but two, and he said she had received three; and says he, will you tell me it is a lie? and he struck her.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he strike her? - With his hands on her face, his hand was shut, he struck her right on the face with his fist, and called her a whore, and the went to the window and laid hold of the kettle and said, you soldier built thief,</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from the window where he called her a whore? - It might be a yard from the window, not farther. She said you soldier built thief, I am no whore; and immediately she went to this kettle and laid hold of it, and threw it at him, and it fell on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was you looking when the kettle fell? - I was looking at my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with your back to the prisoner, or side? - My side was to him; I saw him as well as her.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the kettle fell on the ground, where did it strike? - I don't know indeed whether it hit him or no; it was an empty tin kettle, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you tell whether it struck him or not? - I don't think it did strike him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts did it fall on the ground? how near to him? - It fell pretty near him.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me know how near it was to him when it fell? - Within four or five inches; and this woman that is out of doors, went to my sister and put one arm round her face, to save her head from being hit, for fear he was going to hit her any more.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was he at that time in the attitude of striking your sister at the moment? what was he doing at the moment the kettle fell? - He was standing close by her, about half a yard off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You told us that the went to the window about a yard off and that the kettle fell within two or three inches from him, had the come nearer to him from the window again? - No, she was much in the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time this young woman put her arm round your sister's neck what did he do? - He said there is your brother, why don't he take your part? what can he do? this was after she had her arm round her neck, in a minute's time while this young woman had her arm round the neck of my sister, she cried out, Jack! Jack! here is blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately before she cried out did you see her do any thing? - I see his arm go with a terrible rush, but I did not see the bayonet in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any bayonet about his person? - Yes, he had, it was in the belt, I see the motion of his arm but I did not see him draw the bayonet nor see the bayonet in his hand, but the young woman said, Jack! here is blood. I make no doubt if I had looked round after him I I might have seen the glimpse of his bayonet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it afterwards? - I did not, I was so much confused; I went immediately to my sister and I laid her on the side of the bed, the young woman fell a crying and I told her to run for a doctor, when she said here is blood, the prisoner said, blood indeed! I will go fetch a doc<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040081"></xptr>tor, and he quitted the apartment directly at the moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he went to? - I do not, but I believe he went home.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after he was gone? Nothing else, no further than the young woman went for a doctor and fetched one, but she was dead when the doctor came.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before your sister died? - Four minutes at the outside; I pulled her handkerchief on one side and there I perceived the wound on her left breast.</p>

The deceased and I sat in a chair almost together, the prisoner at the bar walked up and down the room twice, and then he says to the deceased, what is the reason you did not shew my brother the three letters? he says you gave him but two; f gave him two and two I kept, which an undoubted right I had to do because I paid for them; why, says he, I gave you three; you lie, says the to him; what says he, you whore will you give me the lie, and immediately he upped with his right hand or left, I will not be sure which, and he struck her a violent blow on the right side of her eye; with that he said, there is your brother Jack, why don't he take your part? with that she got up and the said, I am no whore; and the said, you soldier built thief and went to the tea kettle, and said, you shall not lick me, and immediately she went to throw the tea kettle and I went to her and she heaved it at him.</p>

I said that; he said, blood indeed! and I will fetch a doctor; and Mr. Hogan immediately came up to the assistance of me and my sister, and I just discerned the glimpse of the bayonet down by his right side but not to discern it perfect in his hand; on which Mr. Hogan and I led the deceased to the bed, and the prisoner went down stairs before ever we offered to lead her to the bed.</p>

             sworn</p>
               <p>I am a peace officer; I was employed to apprehend the prisoner, on the 31st of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; I found him in the house where he lodges.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing particular pass? - Nothing particularly passed; I said to him, Ned, come here, I want you, and he turned about, and he had this bayonet in the belt, and I drew it out; he said, you need not have drawn it, I should not have used it; no says I, it is no matter, will you go along with me? he said he would; says he, what is it for? why, says I, you are accused of murdering your sister; aye says he, a fatal day for me. That was all that passed,</p>
               <p>- OGLE sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the body after it was dead? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the wound you saw there was the cause of her death? - It was; on a particular examination of the body at the time of the Coroner's inquest was taken, I found the wound had entered into the cavity of the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what instrument it might be made by? - It had a triangular external appearance, very much like such a wound as might be made by a Bayonet.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did the wound incline? - On the upper part of the left breast it entered, and inclined downward towards the right side, so as to be a very short distance from the heart.</p>
               <p>Q. From the particular situation of the wound, in what manner must that blow be given? - It appeared to me on examination of the body, it must be given by the man's right hand, standing facing the woman, for it was at the upper part of the breast, inclining downwards towards the right side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came up on Wednesday night from St Stafford, I, and five more of my comrades, in order to see our wives and children; when we got into London, I went home to my wife and children, after I had sat about a quarter of an hour with my wife, I said, I will go up and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040084"></xptr>see my father and sister; accordingly, I went up to my father's place, I asked where my sister was? my father told me where my sister was, in Chelsea-place at work; I went there and told the person to tell her it was her brother the soldier; with that, she came out of the area and said, Ned, is it you? yes my dear, it is says I; I went in and discoursed with her some time, and when I left her I kissed her; I parted with her at that time and the told me the would come up again to me in the morning; I went home again to my father and told him I had seen her; I parted with him and went home to my wife and children; in the morning between eight and nine, my sister came up and breakfasted with me and my wife, after breakfast we had two or three drams together; I then asked her where my brother was at work? the said, the did not know, but if I went to my brother's pay table I might hear of him; says she, I must go home and get my father's dinner, I went up with her to her own place where the fetched out some cold meat to eat, afterwards she fetched a dram, and then another dram; I then kissed her and took my leave of her, and went up to my brother's; I told her it would be some time before I saw her again, very likely six or seven months; I went up towards Mary-le-bone, going through Mary le-bone, I met

            , the put her basket down and killed me and I her; I then went to my brother's pay table where I had a pint of beer; my brother came in between twelve and one, he was very glad to see me; him and I came away together; in our discourse he says to me, how many letters have you sent since you have been away? I told him I had sent five; he says, what a deceitful girl my sister must be not to deliver them to me, the is a very deceitful girl, and as you are here we will go up and have it out about the letters; I told him, no, I had took my leave of her, and I had to meet five of my comrades in order to go and join the regiment that night; however, by his persuasions I went up, when he says to his sister, Polly, how many letters have you had from Ned? she said, what is that to you? I said, you are a deceitful girl not to shew them to your brother; no, says she, I will not shew him, I will see you d-'d first, and some more words ensued; with that, she flew to the window and caught up the tea kettle and flung it over my left leg, which was always very tender; she then turned herself again to lay hold of something also, and swore she would cut me down if I did not quit the room; she then instantly stretched her hand across to my bayonet, I put my hand out to prevent it, and how it happened the Lord above knows, I don't know.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his corporal and two more who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Hogan. You was sometime with the prisoner before you saw your sister; had there been any conversation between you and him about the letters he had written while he was absent? - Yes, he asked me how many letters I received? I told him two, he said, he sent five.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were they sent to? - My sister gave me the two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you complain to him of not having the rest delivered to you? - I did not complain to him about them, he spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - His sister was a deceitful woman for not shewing them me, that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of you propose to talk to her about it how it happened? - We did not say a word to her about it, not then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether you did not say to your sister first, that the was a deceitful hussey? - I am on my oath I did not say it first.</p>

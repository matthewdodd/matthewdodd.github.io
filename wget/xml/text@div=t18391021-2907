                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Waddington, who keeps a beer-shop in Phillip-buildings, Wilsted-street, Somers-town. On the 20th of October, about ten o'clock at night, I was sitting in front of the bar, I looked through a window, and saw the prisoner at the till, and saw him take his hand out of the till—I went out, seized his hand, and called my husband—he resisted as much as he could, and said he had nothing hut 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. In his hand—my husband forced his hand open, and found the money—there were 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. shillings in the till before.</p>

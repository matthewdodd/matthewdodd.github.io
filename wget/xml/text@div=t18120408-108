               <p>WILLIAM STEVENS. I live at No. 27, Earl-street. On the 26th of March I was standing in my mother-in-law's shop, (Mrs. Calliot's shop), about five o'clock in the afternoon, a girl called out a woman has stolen a cake of bees-wax; I saw a woman go out, and pass the shop-window; I pursued her, and she finding somebody after her, ran into the passage of a house; I brought her from thence, and took the cake of bees wax from her, I looked in the shop and missed a cake of bees-wax.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A woman gave me this, I thought it was soap; I followed her into the passage, I thought she went in there.</p>

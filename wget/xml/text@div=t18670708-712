                  </hi> I am single, and live, at 3, Grove Cottages, Wandsworth Road—on 12th April, about a quarter to six in the evening, I came home and saw the back parlour door open, that is an empty room—I went up stairs and missed a watch, chain, a gold earring, and other articles—a pane of glass was broken, and any one could put their hand in and uncaps the win<lb></lb>dow—I found it open—it was closed when I left—this watch and chain are mine—these two petticoats were under my bed when I left—I occupy the whole house—I found the back kitchen unlocked and unbarred; it was locked and barred when I left—anybody could get up to the window from the outside—it is on the first floor, and when once in the house they could unbar the kitchen door and get out that way—these are not all the things I lost.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 6, Cheswood Street, Battersea Park—the prisoner occupied a room there—on 17th May his wife, Rebecca Mahonney, came home, her maiden name was Rebecca Holloway—I left her and went with my wife to Vauxhall Cross to purchase some tea-things, and saw Mr. and Mrs. Mahoney, Mr. Chick, and another man standing under Vauxhall Cross—the prisoner had a fresh chain attached to his waistcoat, which I had never seen him with before, he used to wear one of his wife's, which went round his neck.</p>

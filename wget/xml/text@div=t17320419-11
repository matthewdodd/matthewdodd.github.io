               <p>Daniel Perry. I went out to work about 6 in the Morning, and left Edward Favin in the House. About 9 I came home for some Tools, I met with a Man at my Gate, and stood talking with him for some time. When I went to open the Gate it was made fast within side; but the back Door was open, and so I got in, and found my House had been broke. I got some Neighbours to my Assistance, and we went in search after the Rogues from one Place to another, till we came to Grass-Farm-Wood, about 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, and there they were taken with several of the Goods upon them. Upon Phillips we found a pair of Buckskin Breeches, a pair of Stockings, a Shirt, a Hat, and a Wig that belong'd to

            ; and upon Hurst, a pair of Stockings, a Shirt, 3 pair of Gloves, and a Cloth Coat and Waistcoat that were mine.</p>
               <p>Phillips. I found the Goods in a Ditch.</p>
               <p>Edward Favin. I lodged at Daniel Perry's; he left me in the House when he went to work, and I staid but a few Minutes behind, and then I lock'd the Doors fast, and left the Key at his Daughter's in the Neighbourhood, where it us'd to be left. About 9 I heard that the House was broke open, and so I came home, and found that a Pane of Glass had been taken down, and the middle Part of the Window-Frame pull'd out, and so they got into the House. The Lock of my Chest was broke, and all my Cloaths taken away. We pursued the Prisoner up and down for 4 or 5 Miles, and at last took them in Grass-Farm-Wood, with Part of the Goods upon them.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they say how they came by them?</p>
               <p>Favin. I heard Hurst confess before the Justice, that he got into the House first, and then let in Phillips.</p>

            . As I was in Pursuit of the Prisoners, Phillips turn'd about and swore he wou'd shoot me if I came any farther; but I still follow'd them; and upon that he fir'd at me with this Pistol, and shot me in the Groin (with small Shot) 8 of the Shot lodg'd in my Belly, and after that, they beat me and bruis'd me about the Head, so that I have been under the Surgeon's Hands ever since, and am not yet quite recovered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Day, Watson, and others—we are wine-merchants, in Water-lane, Tower-street—we have a large business—our bottled stock was upwards of 300 pipes—the prisoner was in our service. On the 23rd of Dec. I was in Leadenhall-market, purchasing a Christmas-dinner for him and the rest of our servants—on that evening the prisoner was brought back to our premises by the policeman to whom I had pointed him out—he took three bottles of wine from his pockets, and the policeman had got another in his hand—I said, "This is very shameful conduct on your part"—he said, "It is the first time I have ever done such a thing, I hope you will forgive me"—I took the policeman and showed him the dinner I had been providing for nine of them.</p>

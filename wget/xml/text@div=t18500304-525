                  </hi>. I live at 62, Cornhill, and occupy the whole house and shop; it is in the parish of St. Peter's, Cornhill. On 13th Feb., about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in, and stated that she had come from a lady to pay a deposit on a ring which she described to me in the window—I took it out, and showed it to her—she took it into her hand, and immediately crouched down in front of the counter, and as I looked over I perceived her hands engaged under her clothes—I immediately went round, and asked her what she was about—she then stood up, and I said, "What have you done with the ring?"—she said she had not got it; and at that moment the policeman came in, and the ring was missing—she was taken into a room at the back of the shop with the policeman and my housekeeper, who made a partial search—they could make nothing of her, and the was then taken to the station—the ring has not been found—the selling price of it was five guineas; its value to me was about four pounds or four guineas.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 618). On the 13th of Feb. I was on duty in Cornhill—I saw the prisoner in Mr. Fryer's shop, and saw him hand her a ring, which she looked at for some minutes, and then drew back—I saw her lift her clothes and put the ring underneath—I then went in and laid hold of her, and said, "You have placed the ring underneath your clothes"—she said, "I have not got it"—I said, "Where have you put it? I saw you put it underneath your clothes"—she said, "I dropped it"—I looked round everywhere, and could see no ring—I then suggested that she should be taken into a back room and be searched by the housekeeper—she searched her as far as her boots and stockings—we took her to the station, where she was strictly searched by two female searchers, and no ring was found—pre<lb></lb>vious to taking her from the shop I found one of these pieces of rag in her hand, and the other dropped from her person under her clothes at the station—she said she did it to be imprisoned, and if transported so much the better.</p>

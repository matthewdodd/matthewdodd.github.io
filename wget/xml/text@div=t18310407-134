On the 26th of March I went into a public-house, with a basket containing the articles stated - I only called to take my supper beer home to my children; two women followed me into the house, and followed me out - I believe the prisoner was one; I took my beer, went out, and forgot my basket - I went back, and it was gone; I did not hear of it till the Tuesday following, and this was on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>MARY HILL. I live in Foster's-buildings. The prisoner's sister lodged with me upwards of two years - the prisoner came backwards and forwards to see her, and sometimes slept there; the prisoner came on the 27th of March, and said her husband had bought a pair of shoes and stockings for her girl, which were too short for her; she asked me to buy them - I said I did not want them, but took them; I gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>GEORGE COLLIER. I am a Police-constable. I went to the prisoner's sister on the Tuesday morning - I found the prisoner there, and asked her if she had been at the Plough on Saturday evening - she said she had not; I then asked if she knew any thing of a basket taken from there - she said No, but on searching the room I found this basket hanging on a nail; I showed it to the prosecutor's son, who said it was his father's - I opened it, and found a shoe and a strap; I then asked the prisoner what had become of the other pair of shoes - she said she knew nothing of them, that was all that was in the basket.</p>
               <p>JAMES GLIBBERY. I am a Police-officer. I asked the prisoner how she came by this basket - she said, "I found it outside the door;" I said, "There was some other property;" she said, "No, there was no other property," but after some time she said, "Well, I did take it, and sold the property to Mrs. Hill."</p>
               <p>WILLIAM RANGER. This is my basket, and these are the shoes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered in a written Defence, stating that she had found the basket outside the Plough public-house.</p>

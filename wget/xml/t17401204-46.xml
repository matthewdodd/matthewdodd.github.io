               <p>Challoner. On the 22d of Oct. I was going to my Lodgings, and met these two Women near  Catherine-Street End; they asked me to give them a Glass of Wine, so I carry'd them to the Swan Tavern in the Strand; we had two Pints of Wine among us; and after that I went with them to their Lodgings in <placeName id="t17401204-46-crimeloc230">Eagle-Court</placeName>

It was a dirty sort of a Room, and I did but just sit down, for I had not been there a Quarter of an Hour, but I perceiv'd Wood very busy about me; I put my Hand into my Pocket, and missed my Money. I am sure I had my Money when I went into the Room, for I felt it in my Pocket. When I found that I had lost my Money, I made a Noise, but Wood swore, she was a Woman of Credit, and had it not. I went away for that Night, and the next Morning, my Purse and part of my Money were brought me by a little Boy of Riley's. When they were before the Justice, they confessed that they had the Moidore, and the 3 l. 12 s. but said they knew nothing of the Guinea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. We never own'd that we had the Money, he was in Liquor, and was very free with us.</p>
               <p>Challoner. I was not; it was between 6 and 7 when I was with them, and by 7 I was at my own Lodging .</p>

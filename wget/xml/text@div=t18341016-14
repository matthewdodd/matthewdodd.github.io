On the 23rd of September, I was standing at my own door with some ladies, about ten or eleven o'clock in the forenoon - the prisoner came up to me, and delivered a letter to me - I asked him who the letter was for - he said it was for myself - this is the letter -(looking at it) - after the ladies had left me, I read it - I became very much alarmed at reading it, and told him I supposed his object was to extort money, and nothing else - I told him, if he would meet me in <placeName id="t18341016-14-crimeloc80">Fenchurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had you business there at that time? A. I was going to receive some money from Mr. Smith, a merchant, there- when the prisoner came to me at the door, I had only a few shillings in my pocket - when I gave him the sovereign, he said, "That is not enough; that will not do" - I told him I was perfectly aware his object was to make a property of me, and he wanted to get money from me, and nothing else, and I would meet him on the Friday following, and give him another sovereign - he said, very well, that would do - I think this was Tuesday, the 23rd - I met him at the same place on Friday, at three o'clock, and gave him another sovereign - after I gave it to him, he said that would do, that I should not see nor hear any more of him, as he was going in the country - I saw him again on the 1st of October - I had been to Mr. Richardson's, in the <placeName id="t18341016-14-crimeloc81">Minories</placeName>

               <p>Q. How was the room lighted?</p>
               <p>Jackson. There were dark lanthrons, while I was on the floor they desired me to inform them where the money was, and said it should be worse for me if I did not, I told them there was some money in the drawers in that room, they opened the drawers, but found nothing then they opened a box, in which they found thirty guineas and twenty-five pound in another, they took away things to the value of one hundred and fifty pounds in the whole, we lay there till about four o'clock, I cannot swear to their persons, the street door was bolted and bared, they undid the bolts and bars and went out at the door, I apprehend they got in at the side window, which was left open, I did not observe it the night before.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Pyle, who is Mr. Jackson's father-in-law, and has part of the house. I was last up in the house the night of the burglary; I fastened the door, the sash of the side window where they got in, was down and the shutters put to; I don't know whether they were fastened. I heard my master's door break open; I jumped out of bed, and called out to know what was the matter; I had not opened the door a minute before two fellows rushed in upon me: one clapped a pistol to me, and swore he would kill me if I spoke a word, and did not immediately get into bed. One of the men held a dark lanthorn in my face; there I lay in bed till they went out of the house; one of the men staid in the room all the time, which was almost two hours, they staid in the house from two, to four. I don't know the person that staid with me, I believe he had a piece of brown paper drawn down as low as over his eyes, the other man's face was black all over, or he had a crape on: he that held the lanthorn to my face, was such a made man as Tunks; they went out about four o'clock. The man that was in my room went on the the stairs, he d - d the other men, and bid them open the door; and then they all went away. When I came down, I found the window and door open, and I found this dark lanthorn in Mr. Jackson's room, (producing it.)</p>

She gave me a good deal of ill language, and said, she would have the box. She went away, and brought the two prisoners, Tunks and Hines and another man, and said, she had brought a constable for the box. I asked, which was the constable? She said, Tunks was; I said, he was the man that brought the box; and I set my back against the closet door where it was. One of them swore d - n her bang her; I was afraid and went to go out, one of the men stopped me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260034"></xptr> at the door and Braband put her hands over my mouth, Tunks put his hand over her's and held me till I was black in the face, then Tunks took up the box and ran away with it. I struggled and got from them to the door and cried stop thief and alarmed the neighbourhood, and he was brought back with the box; one Mrs. Williams, who lives in the house with me, took up the box and weighed it in her hand and said there was something valuable in the box, it was very heavy, Hines said, I suppose you have seen what it is, there is plate in it marked J. B. E. I went for a constable and gave charge of them to the constable, but he would not take him, still I would not let them have the box, then they went away, I sent for my husband from his work, my husband is a taylor, and told him what had happened and he went and gave information of it at Sir John Fielding's and then there came three of Sir John Fielding's men, with my husband and broke the box open in my room, and they found some plate, pistols, dark lanthron and flask; I did not know any thing of the prisoners till the woman came to take the lodging.</p>

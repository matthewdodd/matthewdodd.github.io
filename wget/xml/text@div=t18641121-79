                  </hi>. I reside in the Manor-road, Deptford—I have cause to remember Saturday night, 15th October—I was going through South wark-square, about a quarter to 8, on my way to the train, when I felt my neck encircled by the hands and arms of some one whom I never had the pleasure to see—I suffered a good deal of pain from being pressed so much—I tried to call out, but could not—I could see the persons walking to and fro in Southwark-bridge-road; there was plenty of light there, but where I was it was all dark, to the great discredit of the Board of Works—the railway works there have cut the square all out of shape—I lost my watch and chain, but I did not feel them taken; it was done very cleverly—I really do not know when I had last seen my watch safe—I suppose I had seen it since the morning, but I forget—there are so many clocks now that one does not look at one's watch so often—I know I had it—I rather think I must have been insensible towards the last, for they threw me down and I did not feel the fall—I did not see either of the prisoners—I could see nothing, it was too dark—all I saw was one man standing quite still in the middle of the road, looking at the operation.</p>

You are going to shove something against me now"—I said, "No, I am not; there is a man at the station who says you sold it to him"—I took him to the station and showed him the watch—he said he knew nothing at all about it, he had never seen it—I then fetched Linscott from the cell—Cochlin was placed between seven other men, and Linscott identified him as the man he bought the watch of—Cochlin denied it—next morning, before the Magistrate Cochlin said, "Yes, I sold him the watch; I bought it of a man in the <hi rend="italic">Cut.</hi> I gave three shillings for it on the Sunday morning, and I sold it to him on the Sunday afternoon"—I asked who the man was, and he could <hi rend="italic">give</hi> me no account whatever of him.</p>

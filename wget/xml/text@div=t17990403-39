             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a messenger on the debtor's side of Newgate: On Thursday, the 21st of February last, I was going of an errand to Barbican, and just as I was coming out of the prison, Mr. Walker, the prisoner at the bar, called to me; I had known him when he was in prison in January, 1798; he went a little way with me, and then asked me if I knew the banking-house of Prescott and Co.; I said, yes; then he said, I was the very man he wished to see, he had got a draft of Sir

            's, which he wanted to take up, and if you are going that way, says he, I will be glad if you will take it up for me; says he, the reason I do not like to go there is, because there is a little account between them and me; I think he said between five and six pounds, and if I should go with it, they may recollect me, and may want to take it out of this, and that won't do; I was going to Doctors' Commons, and he was to wait for me at the Cock eating-house till I came to him; when I came to the Cock he was not there; the waiter said, a little man had been looking for me; he came in and gave me the draft; I just opened it and looked at the sum; it was 65l. 10s. and Mr. Colvill paid me a 40l. note, 20l. in smaller notes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030021"></xptr>there might be, I think, three 2l. notes, and the rest 1l. notes, four half-guineas, nine seven-shilling pieces, and two half-crowns; I then returned to the Cock to the prisoner, and he was not there; when he came he would not take it there, because, he said, there were a great many swindlers always about there, and he should get robbed of it; he asked me which way I was going, I told him, to Barbican; he said it was all in his way home to dinner; then we went to the Nag's-head, in Aldersgate-street, we went in together, he called for some rum and water, and there I paid him the money; it was in a private room; he said, he knew that house, and I gave him the notes and money that I had received; he paid for the liquor, and gave me one shilling, and I went away; I saw no more of him till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by taking up the bill? - A. I went to take up the money for the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass upon your looking at the bill? - A. I made two observations upon it; Walker told me he lived at Mr. Austin's, a japanner's, in Cold-bath-fields, and when I saw the note, I said, it was very odd what Mr. Trevannion, the member for Dover, should want with japanned goods to such an amount; his answer was, that he laid out a great deal of money with him in the year; he could not tell whether it was for exportation or presents; the other observation I made was, this is all written upon paper, meaning there was none of it engraved, and he said, that is always the way he draws them.</p>

             sworn. - On Thursday, the 21st of February, the last witness came to me at Messrs. Prescott's, between twelve and one o'clock, and presented this draft for payment, (producing it); he said he wished to have it in small notes and cash; the amount is 65l. 10s. I paid him a 40l. note, 20l. in small notes, and the remainder in cash; I do not recollect what the cash was.</p>
               <p>Q. You had information afterwards, I believe, that the forty pound note was stopped at the Bank? - A. Yes. In consequence of that, I went to the Secretary's office at the Bank, on Saturday the 23d, there I saw the prisoner; I asked him from whom he had the forty pound Bank note; he said he had it from Mr. Windus, who lived in Newgate-street; he said he knew that Windus had received it for a draft, which Messrs. Prescott's had paid a few days before; I told him I wished to see Windus, as I had paid the draft, and there was some mistake in it. Walker and I then left the Bank, and went to Newgate-street; and, in going along, he went into a silversmith's shop, and asked if they had any thing to do; the master of the shop said he had nothing for him to do then; Walker then wished me to remain there while he brought Windus to me, but I refused to let him go; then we went across Newgate-street, down a lane that led to Fleet-market; he went into a public-house, and enquired if Windus was there; a person there replied, he had been gone about half an hour; the prisoner then came out again, and went into another public-house, and made enquiry for Windus; but they did not know him; then he took me into a gin-shop in Newgate-street, and enquired for Windus, but they did not know him; then Walker said, I will go no farther with you, for it is no concern of mine. I then went into the first public-house I came to with him, and asked the publican if he knew Windus; the publican replied, that Walker knew very well where to find Mr. Windus; then I begged of the publican to tell me where I might find Mr. Windus, as Walker would not; and then he told me to go to Newgate, on the debtors' side, and I should hear of him; one of the turnkeys told me he was gone to Guildhall, and would return in about half an hour; then Walker, myself, and another man went all to Guildhall together; I then left Walker in custody of an officer at Messrs. Prescott's, and I went to Guildhall to find Windus; I did not find him there; I then went to Newgate, and found Windus, and then he went with me to Messers. Prescott's office, where Walker and the constable were. As soon as Windus entered the room, he said, Mr. Walker, how could you send me with this draft - you know it would have been a very serious piece of business to me, if you had not been found; Walker made no answer; we then went before the Lord-Mayor, and the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the bar before that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been at Messers. Prescott's? - A. About thirteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any person of the name of

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What are you? - A. I am a cook by trade; I go to sea now, I came home in the Marquis of Lansdowne.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you work as cook before you went to sea? - A. At several gentlemen's houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, I think I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you on the 20th of February last? - A. I was passing along Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing draw your attention, as you were going along Newgate-street? - A. I saw the prisoner at the bar pick up a note much about lvy-lane, or between that and Warwick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity to look at it? - A. Yes; and I saw, as he held it in his left hand, that there was 65l. 10s. at the top, and at the bottom, on the left hand side, there was Messrs. Prescott and Company, bankers, in London.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to look at it? - A. Because something of a curiosity led me; I asked whether it was a Bank note; it was not a banker's check, it was only on common paper, and it was all written.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after that? - A. Nothing passed. I went then about my business, I was going to Hazard's lottery-office to enquire about a share of a ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it that you were found out as a witness? - A. I saw an advertisement in the papers to enquire at No. 13, Bateman's-buildings; it mentions for a gentleman, who had seen another pick up a draft; in consequence of that, I applied there; I then gave an account who I was, and where they might find me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Where do you live? - A. No. 6, Temple-street, Whitefriars.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were going to Hazard's in Cornhill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you make Newgate-street in your way from Whitefriars? - A. I generally do go that way.</p>
               <p>Q. As the nearest? - A. Not as the nearest.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. I never saw him before; I only observed his picking up the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. You were at some little distance? - A. Yes; and then I went up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Thinking it might be a Bank note, or something valuable, to claim a part of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On seeing it to be a banker's check, how came you not to claim your share of it? - A. I did not take it to be a banker's check, I did not take it to be any thing of consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you have told us, you saw Messrs. Prescott and Co. bankers, London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And your object in going to look at it was, to take half if it was valuable, and finding it was a draft for 65l. 10s. how came you to give up your share? - A. I did not ask it, as he had it in his hand, I looked over his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are sure it was directed to Messrs. Prescott and Company, <rs id="t17990403-39-viclabel231" type="occupation">banker</rs>

               <p>Q. Now this is not so; it is Messrs. Prescott, Grote, and Company, London; not a word about bankers? - A. I knew they were bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know it was a draft upon a banker? - A. I did not know but it might be a note not worth any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you happened to see something in the paper about it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw it in the paper - last week was it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were looking in the paper to see what had become of your ticket? - A. No, not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live at that time? - A. No. 6, Temple-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the paper? - A. I see it generally in George-yard, Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that where the prisoner uses? - A. I never saw the prisoner in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. And who did you apply to when you saw it in the paper? - A. To No. 13, Bateman's-buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purport of the advertisement? - A. If that person would apply to No. 13, Bateman's-buildings, they would save a poor industrious man and family, I don't recollect the words.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030023"></xptr>Q. By what means were you to save them? - A. By appearing.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it say about it? - A. I cannot say how the words run, but it is about a person seeing this draft picked up in Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the paper about you? - A. Yes. (Produces it).</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. Q. How came you by that paper that you now have? - A. I bought it last week, at the Royal-Exchange; last Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you to buy it? - A. It was from curiosity to see more particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was last Friday only that you wanted to satisfy yourself about the ticket? - A. Yes.</p>

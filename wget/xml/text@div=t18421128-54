On the 18th of Nov., at twenty minutes past ten at night, I stopped the prisoner in Crawford-street—she was in company with another female when I first taw her, hut the other walked in front of her, and turned down another street—the prisoner had this cheese under her shawl—I asked where she got it—she said a woman employed her to carry it to the New-road, and promised to give her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but she was coming as from the New-road, and going towards Bryanston-square.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, ana live in Edgeware-road. On the 18th of Nov., a young woman came into my shop for two rashers of bacon which I cut—a woman older than the prisoner came in for some cheese, and kept me at the hack of the shop some time, at last she said the cheese did not suit her, and went away—while attending to her, the young woman went out, and left the money for the bacon on the counter—I believe the prisoner is the young woman—I had seen her about my shop for two or three hours that evening—a Stilton cheese was just where she stood, which I missed, and I believe this to be it—here is a tin tack in it which had fastened the ticket on it—I saw two rashers of bacon at the office, which were such as I cut for the young woman.</p>

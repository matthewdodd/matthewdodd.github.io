                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. John King and others printers, of No. 63, Queen-street, Cheapside. On 12th July, between 11 and 12 o'clock, Mr. King called me into the counting house—I found the prisoner there—Mr. King asked him what he had come for, he said that he had called for an account—Mr. King asked him from whom, he said, "From the <hi rend="italic">Civil Service Gazette</hi>"—by Mr. King's direction I sent for a policeman—Mr. King stepped into a little closet to wash his hands, I then saw the prisoner take a little red book from his pocket, tear out some leaves, and tear them up into very small pieces, part he put into his pocket, and a few he threw on the ground—Mr. King asked him repeatedly for his name and address, but he refused to give it—he begged hard to be let go, said that it was all a mistake, and he would take care that it did not occur again—there was an account due to the <hi rend="italic">Civil Service Gazette</hi> from Mr. King—he is a printer, not an advertising agent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I asked him for an account of advertisements in the paper. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No—he assured Mr. King that it was entirely a mistake—I heard nothing about advertisements till we were at the Mansion House.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, of No. 63, Queen-street, Cheap<lb></lb>side. I have one partner—I am part proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Civil Service Gazette</hi>, and employ the paper as a medium of advertising—on Saturday, 12th July, the defendant came, and said that he had called for an account from the <hi rend="italic">Civil Service Gazette</hi>, for advertising; in just the same way as collectors ordinarily call for accounts—I put the question to him, and he said, "An account for advertising"—I was sure from my connection with the paper that he was not employed there—I called Kinlock, and in his presence the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185608180057"></xptr>
               <p>repeated that he had called for the account, and that it was quite right—when he saw some little hesitation in my manner, he pulled out a little memorandum book, as collectors usually do, who come in the ordinary course; he had a list of names in his hand which he afterwards tore up, and which I subsequently put together, and discovered that it contained the names of various advertisers in the paper—there was an account of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from me, and an account of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which, if I had not been connected with the paper, I should have paid in due course—I sent for an officer, and while he was being fetched, the prisoner begged to be forgiven, and said that he was a respectable young man, and it would be his ruin if he was taken up.</p>

I am employed as a detec<lb></lb>tive—I was sent for, and Mr. King gave the prisoner into my custody—the prisoner said that he hoped he would not be harsh with him, and give him in charge, as it would be very serious with him—Mr. King said, "If you will satisfy me who you are, and that you have not been going on long with this game, I will forgive you,"but the prisoner would not satisfy him—I took him to the station, and found this memorandum book in his pocket, with most of the leaves torn out, and a quantity of paper torn up, and some more was picked up in Mr. King's warehouse—they are very small, but here is one with the name of one of the advertisers in the paper—there were two receipt stamps in the book—he gave his address, No. 12, Baker-street, Manchester-square—I went there, but he was not known—I only went to one Baker-street.</p>

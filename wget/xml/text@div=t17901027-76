On Wednesday, the 22d of September, I was in the shop about four o'clock in the afternoon: the prisoner came into the shop, and desired to be shewn some plain muslins; she sat down in the front shop, near the partition that divides the front and the back shop:

            , our apprentice, shewed her some plain muslins; soon after she came in, came in two other women, desiring to be shewn some purple and white callico; I ordered a bell to be rang for some person to come down and shew them; a sister of mine came down, who is not used to the shop; I ordered her to shew them ladies some purple and white callicoes, and I would tell her the price; the women answered they were not in a hurry: our young man of the name of Bonum, desired them to walk into the back shop, and took them from my sister; very soon after I was going into the back shop to get change for a bank note, having done with the customers I had been engaged with; I went to a desk at the end of the back-shop, and I saw the prisoner walking gently up to the end of the back shop, on the left hand side; she turned up a wrapper in which there were several quantities of clear-starched muslins, and muslins not starched; she put her hand between the fold of one of them that was not starched; she then turned round and looked about her; I was about two yards from the counter and from the prisoner, and elevated about three feet from the ground; I passed her to the desk; she then turned round and

             the muslin with her right hand off the counter, which she had before looked at; she turned quickly round, and walked as fast as she could down the shop; I saw the muslin hang by her side at the distance of two yards from the place where she took it; I ran after her as quick as I could; but in getting down from the desk, I lost sight of her for a moment; I overtook her in the front shop, near the place where she first sat; I took her by the arm, and I said, give me the muslin that you have just now stolen; she said, muslin! I do not know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270103"></xptr>what you mean, and immediately began unpinning her clothes in the shop; just at the time that she began to unpin her clothes, two women that were in the back shop, and the only persons that were in the back shop, attempted to get between me and her; I said, she could not be so indecent as to strip in the shop; when these women attempted to get between me and her, I took one of them by the arm, and said, these women belong to you; I did not hear the answer; and at that moment the prisoner got up to walk up stairs to be searched, for she had sat down on the stool she had before been sitting on; I ran down, and returned up stairs; I left her in the company of two ladies and my own servant; I left her a very few minutes; I returned, and nothing having been found, I searched her myself, and did not find any thing: the prisoner then desired to be left alone with me in the back shop, and she was; she then proposed paying for the muslins that were lost! for Mr. Champney had searched, and missed two pieces, which he said he had seen half an hour before; she then said, madam, I am willing to pay you for the muslins, which the gentleman says come to fourteen pounds, or any other recompence; I said, I wanted no recompence, I wanted my muslins; she said she did not know where they were; I said, then you are willing to deposit the value of the money, which appears to be fourteen pounds, which shall be returned to you tomorrow, if the muslins are returned, and no questions asked; she said, I will if I can, but I do not know; I then said, I must consult Mr. Champney; and in the presence of the prisoner, he positively refused accepting any compromise; Mr. Champney went out, and returned, and said there was no alternative, he must take her to the Compter; she then took out a watch which appeared like gold, and I think she said was gold, and said to us both, I will leave this also, if you will let me go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You will recollect this person at the bar is of the same sex with yourself, and her life is the consequence of this enquiry? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Besides that, she meets this charge boldly, and comes in to take her trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was on the Wednesday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have already told me that your shop was full of customers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had brought down a sister not used to serve in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your customers that you had served, were waiting for your change? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At that time, likewise, you had a great deal of business? - Mr. Champney had four customers, and I had three.</p>
               <p>You was willing to get this change as expeditiously as possible? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>You was in the back shop, and in a visible situation? - Not visible.</p>
               <p>This person might have seen you go there? - I do not know that; I passed on one side of the counter; she was on the other side, and was sitting; I passed by her side; I had a bill to make at the desk; I had been selling some articles; I had then to unlock a desk to take out some money, and to reckon the change.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the prisoner with a large handkerchief in her hand at that time? - I do not recollect; I am very sure she had not, because I saw both her hands; I saw one hand turn up the wrapper, and the other was under the muslin.</p>
               <p>Did not you see a cambrick handkerchief in her hand at that time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You will not swear there was not? - I will not.</p>
               <p>You overtook this lady near the partition, when you came up to her? - Yes; she had not passed any other people, but the two women that were in the back shop.</p>
               <p>When you saw these two women, did you openly say, that any person might hear you, you must be concerned? - I said it as loud as I do now; there were a good many customers in the shop.</p>
               <p>These two persons were gone, though you had given your public intimation of your opinion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The lady immediately expressed a great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270104"></xptr>deal of surprize at the charge? - She said, muslins! I do not know what you mean, and sat down on the stool.</p>
               <p>How many persons have you serving in your shop? - Mr. Champney, myself, a young man, a porter, and an apprentice; the porter never serves, but he was in the shop: it is probable all these people had been in the shop; I do not recollect whether I served or not.</p>
               <p>The lady was then taken up stairs, and thoroughly searched, and nothing found upon her? - She was.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner say, very possibly you have lost them, or have disposed of them, not knowing it; I will leave the value of the muslins with you, and if you do find them you shall return me the money? - No such words.</p>
               <p>Now I tell you that Mr. Dunn is here, who heard it, and I shall certainly call him? - You are very right to call any body; there was no creature in the back shop, nor did I at that time know that any creature was near.</p>
               <p>Your servant was listening, and heard every word? - What she said was said in the way I first stated it.</p>
               <p>Was it proposed that fourteen pounds should be left, supposing you had mislaid the muslins? - I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Nay, this is a very important part of the conversation; will you swear that did not pass between you and the prisoner in any part of the conversation? - I will swear it.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell me that you said, then you are willing to deposit the value of the muslins? - I did, in answer to what she had before observed; it was merely repeating what she said; she said, I will give you the money; and the gentleman said, they cost fourteen pounds; in answer to that I said, then you are willing to deposit the value of the muslins, which shall be returned to you to-morrow, if the muslins are sent back, and no questions asked: there was never any idea of the muslins being mislaid, because I was positive as to their being seen.</p>
               <p>There was never any consent on your part to take this fourteen pounds? - Not on my part, any further than as she said; I said, then I must consult Mr. Champney.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you, whether fourteen guineas were not actually received from the prisoner, and fourteen shillings returned in change, as the residue above the fourteen pounds? - There was not: I will explain that: Mr. Hodson, a neighbour of ours, a wholesale linen draper, was sent for; Mr. Champney had about two days before bought these very muslins of him: he understood the loss was fourteen pounds; and he said, he thought there could be no harm in his taking the money, supposing she returned the muslins, or gave up the parties concerned; she took out her purse and laid down fourteen guineas; she said, the gentleman says the muslins come to only fourteen pounds, therefore I must have change; Mr. Hodson asked me to give her change; I said, no; I will not; I have nothing to do with this good lady; he gave me a guinea, and I gave him the full change; the whole of the money lay on the counter; it was never taken up by any person; then Mr. Champney returned immediately, and said, there was no alternative, he must take her to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Has not your husband told you, that he went out to ask advice on that business? - I do not recollect that he has told me.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell the magistrate so? - He returned and said, there was no alternative.</p>
               <p>What did he go out for? - I do not know; I suppose to ask advice: I asked him if he had seen any person on the business? he said, no; he, himself, said, he could do nothing; and, I believe, before the observation, he said, my dear, I can do nothing in the business, for it is compounding felony.</p>
               <p>How long after you had given the information before the magistrate was it that the person at the bar was bailed? - I believe it was that day week.</p>
               <p>You say, she came in before the other persons? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday, the 22d of September last, I lost two pieces of muslin, each piece containing twenty yards; one cost me six pounds, the other eight pounds; they were in a wrapper with some other muslins, laying in the left hand corner of the shop: about three in the afternoon I had occasion to take a piece from that wrapper, not having any of that sort of muslin in the cut wrapper, I took a piece from there, and that was the piece which cost me eight pounds; I left in the wrapper the piece cost six pounds, with the other muslins, and threw the wrapper over them; I looked at each piece at time; I took the piece of eight pounds out to the opposite counter; I shewed it to some ladies; it was not approved, and I left it on the opposite counter; the piece of six pounds I left in the wrapper covered over; every customer that was in the shop at the time we missed the muslin, except two, continued in the shop; except the two women that were in the back shop, that Mrs. Champney had suspicions of.</p>
               <p>Was you present at time Mrs. Robinson was examined at Guildhall? - I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was that examination taken in writing? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>What passed? - On being charged in my shop with having taken a piece of muslin, she denied it: on being examined, no muslins were found upon her; when she came down stairs, she requested to be left alone with Mrs. Champney, which I objected to: the prisoner offered to pay me for the muslin in the back shop; I refused; she afterwards offered to give me the value of the muslins and a watch, to let her go; this I refused, and took her to the counter: at Guildhall she said, she walked up to the further end of shop, where we charged her with taking the muslins, and that she took a white handkerchief out of her pocket, in her hand, which she said, she supposed Mrs. Champney had mistaken for a piece of muslin: she said, she saw on the counter some pretty patterns of purple and white cotton.</p>
               <p>What stock had you on the counter at that time? - There was the wrapper containing the muslins, there was a large piece of printed cotton, and printed callicoes.</p>


               <p>Were those callicoes folded the right or wrong side outwards? - The wrong side outwards.</p>
               <p>Were there any patterns of purple and white on that counter? - No, there were not.</p>
               <p>At the time you took her did she give you her purse? - At the time she was charged, before I took her took her to the Compter, she did: she said, her name was Robinson, No. 5, Corporation-row.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her say any thing about her address afterwards, or her name? - As to her name, I did not; but at Guildhall, on her examination, when she was admitted to bail by Alderman Watson, she said, she was a married woman, and lived in Bowling-green-lane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If I understand you right, the muslins contained in the wrapper had been brought into your stock a few days before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So recently that you had not had opportunity to put your shop mark on? - I had not done it.</p>
               <p>It was at the commencement of the mourning for the late Duke of Cumberland. One of the pieces that you lost, you had yourself removed from that wrapper to another counter? - I had.</p>
               <p>Therefore the piece which the present indictment supposes this woman to have stolen, must have been taken one from the wrapper and the other from some other part of the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you within hearing of what Mrs. Champney said to this woman at first? - I think I was: upon that this woman sat herself down on a seat where she was.</p>
               <p>She was proceeding to open her clothes in a way that your wife thought not so proper? - She was.</p>
               <p>While she was up stairs the two other persons went away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said,</p>
               <p>"she offered to pay me for the muslins that I had lost, which I refused,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270106"></xptr>and took her to the Compter?" - No; she offered to pay me for the muslins that I had lost: she was some little time in the shop; during that period I wanted to find the two women that we thought were connected with her.</p>
               <p>Then you went out of the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might you be gone? - Not ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Mr. Hodson, your neighbour? - No; I had gone in there before.</p>
               <p>Did you desire him to come to your house? - I think I did: when I went out I went to Mr. Medcalfe, an attorney, on Dowgate-hill.</p>
               <p>We know him as a very respectable and a very able man. Did you mention to your lady when you returned, that you had been at Mr. Medcalfe's? - I do not think I did till afterwards.</p>
               <p>You mentioned that you had been, and the conversation that passed between you? - He was not at home.</p>
               <p>What did you go to Dowgate-hill for? - I had some time ago been unfortunate, and went to consult Mr. Medcalfe what was best to do in the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Did not you go to him to know whether you could safely accept the proposal of fourteen pounds? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Positively.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what you said when you came back? - I believe I said Mr. Medcalfe was not at home: I consulted nobody else.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, I am advised that there is no alternative; it must not be taken; you must go to the Compter? - I believe I might say to the prisoner, that there was no alternative, and that I was so advised.</p>
               <p>What was the other alternative that was expected? - Giving up the two women that were suspected.</p>
               <p>Was not it this, to take what perhaps there is no great moral guilt in doing, to take the price of your goods and let her go, or to take the money? - The object was to take the other two women; for had I been inclined to take the money I might.</p>
               <p>Did you expect to find the other two women were to be found at the office? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you see fourteen guineas laying on the counter? - I was no nearer the counter than I am to you.</p>
               <p>Did you recollect how the guineas came there? - I understood that it was some money which the prisoner wanted to pay.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner say, that as to producing your muslin, that was a thing she could not undertake for, but the price of them you was welcome to take? - She wanted to pay for the muslins to go about her business.</p>
               <p>Was not it put to her, that if she sent back the muslins, she should have her money? - Not by me.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that it was stated to the prisoner, that if the next day she would bring the two pieces of muslin no question would be asked of the person bringing them, and she should have back the fourteen guineas? - I know it from information; I knew that when she offered to pay for the muslin: Mr. Hodson upon my refusing to take the money, had a great wish to retain the money till the muslins could be produced, or the other women given up; and in that sort of way I was informed that proposal had been made.</p>
               <p>Was not the answer of the prisoner to that proposition, that she could not undertake to bring back your muslins, but that the money you were welcome to, for she desired to go about her business? - She wished to give me the money and watch to lei her go; she said, she did not know that she could bring the muslins.</p>
               <p>The woman was since admitted to bail by a worthy magistrate, and here she comes to take her trial? - Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner about ten years; I always understood she bore a very good character; I saw her the morning she went to Mr. Champney's shop; I went with her.</p>
               <p>Had she any woman in company with her? - Nobody but her and myself; I went with her to the door.</p>
               <p>(Cross examined.)</p>
               <p>Have you been intimate with her lately, to call upon her, and see her frequently? - No, Sir; I cannot say I have.</p>
               <p>Where has she lived lately? - The last place she lived before this was, I think, in Leather-lane; the last place I think they call Clerkenwell-close.</p>
               <p>How lately is it that you have seen much of her and been intimate with her? - Why, Sir, the little intimacy I had is not with her, but her husband.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Both husband and wife have lived together as reputable people? - Yes; and they have dealt at my house in the country.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called six other witnesses, who all gave her a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Champney. What is the distance between the two counters where those two pieces of muslin were? - The width of the shop between the counters is about two yards, as I suppose, where I left the muslins, was four or five yards from each other.</p>
               <p>And they were on two counters? - Yes.</p>

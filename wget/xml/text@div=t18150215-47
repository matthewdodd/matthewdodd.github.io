On Tuesday evening, the 1st of February, the prisoner came in, and asked for a lodging, he slept in the same room with me that night; I got up about seven o'clock, I left him in bed; he was seen to go out of the house about half after nine o'clock; the house-keeper asked me if I had any thing laying about the room, as the prisoner had gone out with a bigger bundle then he came in with on the over night. I went up stairs to see; I found my things gone, and the box open. I saw the prisoner, and pursued him in the fields at the back of the house; as soon as he saw me he stooped down underneath of the edge, and where I saw him stoop I went, and found some of my clothes. The prisoner was stopped, and brought back to the house. I then saw a pair of worsted stockings in his possession of mine. I had fifteen farthings in my box, ten were found upon him. These are the stockings and handkerchiefs; they are mine, and one of the farthings I believe to be mine, I had such a farthing as that.</p>

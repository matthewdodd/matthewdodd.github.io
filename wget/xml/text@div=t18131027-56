On the 21st of October, about three o'clock, I was in my shop then by myself; these two children came in, the biggest of the two asked for half an ounce of whitey-brown thread, and when I was getting it, he told me it was to make shirts with; I sent him back to ask his mother what kind of linen it was, that I might know what thread send; they both went out, and went down the steps only, they went no further; I saw that very plain. They came in again; the boy said he must have that thread; I then served him, and told him if he had that thread he must keep it; he paid me two-pence for it. They went away, and directly they were gone away I missed the velveteen. It was a remnant of blue cotton velveteen; it was rolled up. I called my daughter down, described the children to her, and sent her out to look after them; she could not find them. On the next morning I had private information, and Donaldson, the constable, went with me to No. 10, Vine-street; we went up into the one pair of stairs, we went in, and the two children and their parents were at dinner. I knew the children; the father said he had beat his children for bringing the velveteen home. There was nothing found there. I was at Bow-street office when the velveteen was produced; I know the velveteen; there were no marks to it that I can swear to it.</p>

            . On Friday, the 22nd of last month, Mrs. Butler and I went to No. 10, Vine-street. As soon as I went into the room I saw the two poor children, the elder prisoner, who is their father, and the mother also; they were all at dinner. I asked them where is the velveteen; the boys mother said to the father, if you know any thing about it, for God's sake tell, for the sake of the children. The father said he had pawned it in Brydies-street; he said one of his little boys brought it home, and said they found it; he said he had beaten the boy that brought it home and said he found it. I went to the pawnbroker; he produced the velveteen at the office. This is the velveteen.</p>

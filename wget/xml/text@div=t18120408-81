            , we live at the York Hospital, Chelsea. I did not miss the jacket and breeches, until they were brought me by Benson; they were taken out of the store that we keep locked up. They were brought to me on the 13th of March, when they were taken I cannot say, they are my husband's regimentals.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before - A. Yes, in the hospital, he never came to our house, he had been in the hospital for five or six months.</p>
               <p>AMBROSE BENSON. I am a patrol. On the 13th of March, about three o'clock, I met the prisoner with these things under his arm. I asked him what he had under his arm, he said some clothes to sell. I took him to the watchhouse, the cloathes were claimed the next morning by serjeant Lamb's wife.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know it is my husband's jacket, I made it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought the things of a man in the street, he said he was going on garrison duty at Guernsey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am niece to John Graham, who keeps the Middle<lb></lb>ton Arms, Portland-place, Islington—the prisoner was his potman—my uncle used to issue a number of tin tickets to the foreman of some works going on near there, for the purpose of their being delivered by him to the men, who pre<lb></lb>sented them, and had what beer these tickets represented—it was the pri<lb></lb>soner's</p>

               <p>duty to take out beer when it was ordered—if he took out half-a-dozen pints, and brought back tickets representing half-a-dozen pints, they would clear him; and supposing these tickets were given to the foreman of the works, he would have paid the amount to my uncle—the prisoner was in the habit of bringing these tickets, and I have given him money for them, when he has said that he paid for the beer, and received the tickets—on the 13th Feb., about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock at night, I placed some marked tickets in a drawer, where they are usually kept—the door was locked at night—the prisoner could get in when I came down in the morning—he could not get to the drawer before I came down—I went to the drawer immediately I came down, at twenty minutes past seven, and, missed nine tickets—if the prisoner got in at all, he must have got in by a false key—the key of the bar-parlour would open the bar, but we were not aware of that till afterwards—the bar-parlour door was open—the policeman came, by arrangement, searched the prisoner, and found these nine tiekets in his waistcoat-pocket.</p>

            , a shipmate of mine, came to see me, I left my house about ten o'clock, and went with him to a public-house at the top of Butcher-row - We had been to one public-house before that; that was the last we were at, we only had a pot of beer, and remained there until about half-past eleven o'clock. When we got out of the house Ford stopped for a necessary purpose, I missed him, and went into the Sampson and Lion, public-house, to look for him, but he was not there. I called for a pint of beer, the prisoner, Perkins, who was there, laid down three pence, and said make it a pot; I took it up, and gave sixpence-the other two prisoners were with him. I joined them in drinking the pot of beer, they asked me, I did not know them before; I was about half an hour talking to them-there were several other persons in the house. I was perfectly sober. There was a candle over the box where we sat. I never saw the prisoners before. Elmhurst, in particular, conversed with me. When the beer was drank, Perkins said, let us have another; I said it was time to go home; he said he would go with me. When we got out of the door he took hold of my left arm, the other two followed; he said we will go and have a girl - I said I had only got three pence. As we went on I said, we have got too far - He said come a little further. When I got to <placeName id="t18180401-5-crimeloc25">Tower-hill</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18180401-5-crimeloc25" type="placeName" value="Tower-hill"></interp>

One of them put his hand to my mouth to prevent my calling out, but I pushed his hand away, and called out murder, a second time. There were several lights but no watchmen. Twelve shillings and two sixpences were taken from my pocket, and my hat was also taken from me. I was very ill used, and received a blow on my left arm. I am sure I had all the money in my pocket when I left the public-house - I felt it in my pocket. I told the prisoners I had only three pence, because I did not wish any person to know what I had about me. Perkins had hold of my arm, and the other two were near enough to hear me say I had only got three pence; I do not know whether they heard me ask if they were in company - They went away. I was stunned with the blow I had received. The patrol came up, we went after them, and saw Singer in the public-house, standing against a box, about a quarter of a mile from the place where I was robbed-it was about a quarter of an hour after; he stood against the box, and Perkins stood by the fire; I pointed them out to the patrol, and told him that Singer was the man who knocked me down-there were several other persons in the house at the time, but I did not see the other prisoner there. I am sure they are the men, I knew them again immediately I saw them. I never saw my hat after. When I saw the prisoners at the public-house they had hats on, but not mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I left my house about ten o'clock. I stopped at a public-house, and stopped at three public-houses before we got to the Lion. I had a glass of gin at two of the houses, and a glass of gin and water at the other, and had a pot of beer between four of us, and a pot at the last house. I got to the Sampson and Lion about twelve o'clock, I had changed a 1l. note at a public-house before I got there, and another 1l. note at the first public-house. I had spent 2s.6d.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you change the second note - A. To shew my shipmates that I had plenty of money. I had 1l. 13s. in silver, when I left the Sampson and Lion; I had seventeen shillings in my fob, and thirteen shillings in my other pocket, which, with 2s.6d. spent, and sixpence for the beer, made up 33s.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any person calling upon you the next morning - A. A person offered me the money to make it up; he said I should not get my expences, and that I should sell the men for the blood-money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How soon did you miss your money - A. As soon as I got to the watch-house, I found my pocket turned out and the money gone. I called out murder, and Burt, the patrol, came up.</p>

            . I am a patrol. About twelve o'clock I was going round my beat, and heard the cry of murder; three men passed me, walking, one was foremost, and the other two were following about forty yards from him - They were about 100 yards from where the cry was. I asked them what the cry of murder was on the hill? they said they were only having a lark among themselves, and one of them had called murder. I went up to the prosecutor, and found him just got off the ground, one side of him was all over dirt; he said he had been knocked down and robbed of his hat, but said nothing about his money; he said he should know the men again. I told him three men had just passed me. We went down East Smithfield, to the Sampson and Lion, and found Perkins and Singer there - He said they were the men; I and the watchman secured them and took them to the watch-house - They were not drinking, they were standing up. Several persons were drinking there; the prosecutor knew them immediately, and looked round for the other, but could not see him. I searched the prisoners, but found nothing on them. When the prosecutor got to the watch-house he found his pocket turned out, and missed his money - He had no hat on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw no woman standing near the prosecutor; he did not know that he had lost his money until he got to the watch-house. Perkins went quietly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181804010005"></xptr>with me. Nothing was found on them. The other prisoner was taken the next day.</p>

I was calling a quarter past twelve o'clock, when the patrol called me to his assistance; I went to the Sampson and Lion with him, and saw the prosecutor without his hat - He was all over mud on one side; the right side of his face was swelled near his eye, apparently with a blow - He said he had been knocked down and robbed, and the prisoners were the men. I collared Singer, he resisted, and said he would not be collared, and twisted out of my hand, but I caught him again. We searched them at the watch-house, but found nothing on them; we did not search them before.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Botolph, Aldgate. I took Perkins and Singer to the watch-house on Thursday night, the 26th of February, about half-past twelve o'clock. The prosecutor described the other man to me, I knew him, and apprehended him on board the Apollo ship in the London Docks; I saw him on deck, and told him I wanted him; he took me below, and asked what for? I told him he knew what it was for; he then said,"Is it about last night? I never did so before-have you got the others in custody?" I said I had. He then said he would tell the truth, "that the tallest man knocked him down, and he went away and left them-that it was not him." I took him from the description I received. Perkins said he had hold of the prosecutor's arm, and two men came and knocked him down. I asked why he did not take them? he said he did not know it was any harm.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA COLLEDGE re-examined. Singer knocked me down. I did not see Elmhurst do any thing, he was with the others. Perkins had hold of my arm, I do not know whether he struck me, but it must have been more than one person that struck me. I was very much hurt.</p>
               <p>PERKINS'S Defence. I spent the night at my sister's, and met the prosecutor, intoxicated - He asked me where I was going; we went into the Sampson and Lion, he called for a pot of beer; I walked out with him, he turned round and asked if the other two were in company, I knew nothing of them-one of them ran up and knocked him down. I returned to the public-house.</p>

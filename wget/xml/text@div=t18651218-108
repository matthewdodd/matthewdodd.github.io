               <p>Butler then said, "Go on Saturday morning at a quarter-past 8,"and I went and took them, and that gentleman (Mr. Beaumar) saw me take them—I waited about till half-post 9, and then took them to Butler's house—I opened the parcel, and was looking at the stockings, when Butler's sister asked me to give her a pair, and I gave her a pair—about 11, Butler came home, and said, "They suspect you"—I said, "I dare say they do, the gentleman saw me take them out; I wish I had never taken them"—he undid the samples, and said, "We shall get about 61. for these"—we took them out, about ten minutes to 1, and waited down the court till Peterson came out—Peterson said. "Go and take the things, and meet me in White-cross-street, while I go to <hi rend="italic">Cockie</hi> Robins' and see—he came back, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Cockie</hi> Robins can't buy them"—Butler then said to Peterson, "You go and ask at the other place in Golden-lane"—there is another who buys stolen property, I don't know his name—Peterson went in and asked, and the man said he would buy them——me and Butler waited at the baths, in Golden-lane, and a little girl came to me, and asked me if I belonged to the things—I said, "Yes," and she told me to bring them to the shop—I took the things into the parlour where Peterson was, with the man and his wife and the little child—the man asked me where I had got them, and I told him how I had got them—Peterson said, "I want 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this lot"—he said, "I can't give it; "and so they made a bargain—Peterson said, "I want 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pair for the kid gloves, "and the man said he could only give 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he asked 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for the shawls, and the man gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he asked half a sovereign for a lot of hosiery, and the man gave him a crown—he asked half a crown each for the shirts, and the man gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for some stockings; altogether it came to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Peterson gave me a sovereign, and Butler a sovereign, and kept the rest himself—altogether I have had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10s. of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money, from first to last—I have seen Peterson and Butler together frequently—on that Saturday night I went to the Britannia Theatre with Butler—I did not see Peterson that night—the man we sold Mr. Garbett's samples to, is called <hi rend="italic">Cockie</hi> Ryan—there is another man named <hi rend="italic">Cockie</hi> Robins.</p>

               <p>—my mother told me on Monday to plead guilty and be a good boy—I took the samples, I dare say, about five weeks after I took the jacket—Betts took all the other things except the Cardigan jacket and Mr. Garbett's samples—I took the Cardigan jacket about five weeks before the 25th—the time that Betts told me that it was a good chance to steal, was after the time when he took the jacket up, and threw it down again.</p>

I accompanied York to Memel-street on 2d November, and was also with him at 13 Baltic-street—I saw Peterson wearing this shirt—I asked him where he got it—he told me he bought it in Petticoat-lane on Sunday week—I asked him what he gave for it; he said, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was present at the station-house when the inspector asked him where he got the shirt, and he then said he bought it in Petticoat-lane of a man who sold braces, and he gave 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I recognise this shirt—I missed about fifteen or sixteen similar to this on Wednesday, 22d November, of various patterns—they were done up in a parcel—I dare say Foster, Porter's have stockings like this in their stock—I went to the house in Memel-street, I knocked at the door, Betts opened it—I asked him if he knew where the goods were that were taken from the warehouse on Saturday morning—he</p>

               <p>told me he knew nothing about it—his mother then came up and wanted to know what was the matter—I told her that her son had taken some goods from our warehouse on Saturday, and she burst out crying—she then asked us to look over the house to see if any of the goods were there, and Mr. Garbett, who was with me, went with Mrs. Betts, while I took the boy into the parlour—I pressed him to tell me, and said it was no use denying that he had taken the things out of the warehouse, as he was seen to do it—he then burst out crying, and told me that he had been persuaded by Butler to go into the warehouse and take the parcels out—I then asked him if he knew who took the shirts on Wednesday, and he told me it was Butler who took them, and that Peterson sold them in Golden-lane for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me he waited outside till they came out, and they had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and they went to the Britannia theatre, and spent the money within a few shillings, and the remainder he gave to his mother—that is the substance of what he told me.</p>

I am a traveller in the prosecutors' employ—on Satur<lb></lb>day, 25th November, I missed a parcel of samples, consisting of hosiery, gloves, shirts, shawls, and some fancy wool goods—I think I missed about a dozen or a 1/2 dozen and a half, woollen shirts—I cannot tell the exact value of them—I had only had them that morning—these goods altogether were worth from 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had stockings similar to this pair in quality and description.</p>

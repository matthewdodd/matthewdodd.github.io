On 20th February, I went to a beer-shop in Tate-street, Spitalfields, at 1 o'clock in the night, with two police-sergeants—we found the prisoner in the tap room—I called him into the bar, told him I was a police officer and had a charge against him for receiving a watch, well knowing it to be stolen—he said, "It was not me—I have not had a watch in my possession for a long time"—I said, "On or about 26th January"—he said, "No"—I said, "I refer to one you pledged at Mr. Jones', in Church-street"—he said, "I never pledged a watch there in my life"—I said, "I have a charge against you for receiving one, and you must go to the station"—he said, "Very well," and walked towards the door—I took hold of him and he leaped from the steps of the door into the street—I took hold of him again, and he tripped us all three up on the pavement, one after the other, as fast as we could get up—he called out others from the beer-shop and made a most desperate resistance—he was assisted by quite 200 thieves—as we took him to the station he did all he could to get away; but with the assistance of other constables we got him to the station—the inspector asked him what he had to say—he said, "I did pledge the watch at Jones's, it was given to me by a man to pledge who came to lodge at our house; he promised me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the duplicate for my trouble if I pledged it for as much as I could."</p>

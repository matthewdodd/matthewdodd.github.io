                  </hi>(<hi rend="italic">police-Constable K</hi>154.) On Saturday, the 21st of De<lb></lb>cember, I saw the prisoner near the prosecutors' rope-walk, near Love<lb></lb>lane, Shadwell, with this rope-yarn—I asked what she had got—she said, "My work"—I asked what work—she said, "Yarn for knotting"—I asked whether this was knotted—she said no, but her brother had gone home with some that was knotted, and this was the remainder of it, with which she was to follow him and take home, or else they should not get paid for it, as it was Saturday night—I took her to the station-house—she said she lived in Commercial-road, afterwards she said in Cannon-street<lb></lb>road, then in Chapman-street, and then in Dock-street—I found, at last, she lived at No. 27, Dock-street—I went with her to look for the place where she said she was to take the yarn to, but she could not tell where it was, and we went to look for her brother, but could not find him.</p>

                  </hi>I am foreman to John Louch and his brother, rope<lb></lb>makers. They have a rope-walk which runs from Love-lane to King David-lane, Shadwell. On the 21st of December I saw the prisoner and the policeman at the side of my masters' premises, at the time he was exa<lb></lb>mining the bundle—I afterwards examined it at the station-house, and found it corresponded with a haul of yarn on our premises, which was cut—we have seven other pieces similar to this—it is a peculiar quality—it is what we term inferior yarn—there are 218 threads in the haul I found cut, and the same number in that found on the prisoner—I am quite sure it is a portion of that haul—three of the prisoner's brothers were employed on the premises, and she herself bad been occasionally, but had been discharged two or three weeks—she bad no opportunity of taking this while she worked there—she had no communication with the part where it is kept, neither do I think she could have cut this herself—it would be very difficult for a female to cut—I think some one else must have cut it, and given it to her to carry—she was stopped close to the premises, and about fifty or sixty yards from where this yarn was kept—a person might stand inside, and give it to her outside to take away—our people leave off work at five o'clock at this time of year—she was stopped at half-past eight o'clock.</p>

On Monday night, the 28th of April, I went to bed a little before eleven o'clock - I was the last person up; I heard a little noise, I think about two hours after I had gone to bed: my children slept in the cottage with me that night: my husband is a gardener - he lives and always sleeps at his master's house, but I live in this house and my husband pays the rent; I got up about five o'clock next morning, and missed my clothes which I had washed the day before - I also missed three silver tea-spoons and two odd cotton stockings, the fellows to which I have here: I had fastened the windows and shutters when I went to bed, and when I came down, the ground-floor window was open - they had broken a pane of glass to open the hasp - anybody could then get in and take the things; the window opens into the kitchen; I missed a great many more things which have not been found - a metal tea-pot was taken from the cupboard, three silver spoons, two mahogany tea caddies, and several articles.</p>

            . I am a hardwareman, and live in Great Tothill-street. On Tuesday, the 29th of April, at nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner Dormer came to me with the three tea-spoons produced - they were broken at that time - I gave him 5s. for them; I asked whose they were; he said he worked at a dust-hill, and found them in the dust; I asked why he broke them; he said they were cracked, and he thought he might as well break them; I took his address, which I gave to Pace, with the same spoons as he brought.</p>

            . I am constable of Fulham. I, in company with Sanders, apprehended the prisoners together, at the Star public-house, North-end, Fulham, on Tuesday afternoon, the 29th of April, about three or four o'clock, I took two odd stockings which I now produce, off Carter's legs - I asked where he got them; he said he bought them, and had paid for them, and had washed them out himself - that he had had them in his possession three or five weeks, I am not certain which, but am sure it was three weeks at least; he did not say of whom he bought them. When I apprehended Dormer I told him I wanted him about the spoons - he said he knew nothing about them, and I did not question him further.</p>
               <p>CICELY SAYERS. These are my husband's spoons - they have our initials on them, E.C.S.; they are what were missing: I had seen these two stockings at seven o'clock the evening before, and washed them; here are the fellows; I know them by my own work on them -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290010"></xptr>they were marked, but the marks have been cut off those that were stolen; it remains on the fellows - they belong to my son, who is nineteen years old; he does not live at home; I had them to wash for him; they are worth 6d., and the tea-spoons 7s.</p>
               <p>CARTER'S Defence. She is a false-swearing woman; she did not see the stockings for two days after the robbery. I think it is hard she should be allowed to swear to them.</p>
               <p>DORMER'S Defence. On Tuesday morning I was going to look for work, and between the Five Fields and the Bag of Nails public-house, I picked up the spoons, wrapped in paper, and a piece of rag; I asked several people who came by if they were silver; they said they were, and I sold them. I gave Brooks my own name.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BROOKS re-examined. I think I had seen Dormer before; I asked his name, and he said Thomas Dormer; I asked his address, and he said, "Mr. Brooks, you know me - I live at No. 5, Perkins'-rents, next door to a customer of your's;" I do not know whether he did live there; I put that address down in a book, in his presence, with the weight of the spoons, which was 1 oz. 1 dwt.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PACE re-examined. Brooks gave me the address which Dormer had given; I went there - it is a house of ill-fame; I could find no such person, nor hear of any such name; I searched every room in the house.</p>

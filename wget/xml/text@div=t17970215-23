               <p>Q. Do you keep a house? - A. Yes; at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these goods stolen from your house at Lambeth? - A. No; from a house joining the <placeName id="t17970215-23-crimeloc118">Bell-Savage yard, Ludgate-hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were they your own property? - A. Yes; I furnished the lodgings myself; I let the first-floor to a gentleman of the name of Hubbard, who is here; he has had part of it ever since last February, the other part he had in June last; I only let him the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any apartments then? - A. Yes; the attic and the second floor; the prisoner occupied one of the rooms in the attic, under me, as tenant; soon after Mr. Hubbard had the first floor, he left the apartments.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner been there? - A. Two years next March; she was there before Mr. Hubbard, and remained there till she was taken up; when Mr. Hubbard quitted the apartments, he did not give me possession of them; he gave this woman possession; I began to grow uneasy, when I could not get possession of my apartments; I applied to Mr. Hubbard, after a considerable time had elapsed; Mr. Hubbard came, and forced possession, by breaking the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the key at this time? - A. The prisoner; I never had the key; when the door was forced, the property mentioned in the indictment was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the door was forced? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the property ever been recovered? - A. No; I have seen some of it at the pawnbrokers', who are here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Whereabout in Ludgate hill is this house? - A. The front of the house is in the Bell-Savage-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You let this out in lodgings to different persons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a house at Lambeth, for your family? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You occasionally slept at this place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you slept was where the prisoner slept? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The door was opposite? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she an apartment of you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she had liberty to go out and in when she pleased? - A. Not in my apartments.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, she had not the liberty to do any thing in the different apartments in that house? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife lived at Lambeth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This woman lived at Ludgate-hill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pay any rent for that room? - A. Yes, a small part; but she was a great deal in arrears.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me she had not the liberty to go into the different apartments of that house? - A. I mean to say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had she not a right to go about as she pleased, and had she not an order from you to do so? - A. She had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived there? - A. She had been there almost two years.</p>

               <p>Q. She was there before Mr. Hubbard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And had access to the different apartments, before he came there? - A. She had one room for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150042"></xptr>some time on the second floor, but she gave it up when I found another tenant.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you mean to state - how many apartments had she before Mr. Hubbard came there? - A. Only one when he came.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that, she had liberty to go in and out where she pleased? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me now, she had not the liberty to go in and out your own room? - A. She may have been in and out.</p>
               <p>I thought so. - Q. Then you mean to say you did not give her the disposing of your property? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. She was in these premises as a lodger? - A. Yes; as a lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. You kept this room for her use when you thought it convenient to sleep in town? - A. I kept it for my own use.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to sleep there now and then? - A. Yes; I did last night.</p>
               <p>Q. You still keep a house for your family, at Lambeth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss this property? - A. I cannot tell when I first missed it; I missed it when my doors were forced open.</p>
               <p>Q. This woman was in possession before this? - A. Not by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the other liberties she was permitted to take, she was not permitted to dispose of any of your property? - A. I don't know what you mean.</p>

             sworn. - I took possession of these apartments of Mr. Whittal, about February last, one of the rooms, and about the beginning of June, another of the rooms; Mr. Whittal recommended the prisoner at the bar to me, as an honest, sober, industrious woman, who would look after the rooms, keep them clean, light my fire, get my breakfast, and so on; he said she was needy, but she was honest: the latter end of June last, I had no occasion for the rooms, and I delivered to her the keys of the rooms, and desired her to give up the possession to Mr. Whittal; a few days after I had left the possession of the rooms, Mr. Whittal called at my chambers, wondering he had not the possession given up to him, and the keys; I told him I had no further occasion for the rooms, and had left them with Mrs. Morris; she had been with me, and said she had a quantity of smuggled goods in, and thought Mr. Whittal would be displeased, and wished me to let her have possession for a few days, in order that she might get rid of the goods; to which I consented; Mr. Whittal called repeatedly after that, and wished to have some possession, and intimated that he was afraid some part of the property might be made off with; after some time, I desired the keys of her; she amused us both for about six months in this way; I then said, at last, I would go with him, and force the doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you demand possession of her? - A. Yes; she continually amused me, and said these smugglers would pay the rent, and it would be no inconvenience to me or him; I went with Mr. Whittal and a Mr. Vincent, and another person; and we forced the doors; Mrs. Morris was not at home at the time; I wished she had; on entering the rooms, we missed the principal parts of the furniture in the room, almost every thing; after this she was taken up, and had before the Magistrate at Guildhall; I obtained possession of the duplicates of all this property, and compared them with the furniture that should have been in the rooms; I considered it was the distress of this poor creature that drove her to it, and went to all the pawnbrokers to get the property, that she might not be brought here; they would not consent, consequently we were obliged to go on with this prosecution; she was committed; the pawnbrokers are here with part of the property, which Mr. Whittal can identity.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You thought this woman an honest woman? - A. During the time I had been backwards and forwards, I thought her so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you take these as ready furnished lodgings? - A. Yes; all the furniture in the indictment was in the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. This poor woman, after you left the premises, said some goods were there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not tell you the nature of the property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The room door, where Whittal slept was opposite to this woman's door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She had authority to stay there by him? - A. Yes; she hired a room of him.</p>
               <p>Q. She had possession of these rooms, to take care of them? - A. She had them from me, to deliver up to Mr. Whittal.</p>
               <p>Q. You considered her as honest? - A. I always thought so; I could not give credit to the intimation of Mr. Whittal; and I have one thing to say of her, I have given her a thirty pound note at one time, to take care of, and a twenty pound at another; and she never wronged me of a farthing.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. All this furniture was let to you with the lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. I wish it to be understood why I put an end to this indictment; the fact is, this gentleman was not in possession of the room, nor had he delivered it up to the owner; if he had, I think she might have been charged with the felony; in this case, he was in possession of the rooms as well as the furniture; then he himself gives up that possession to another person; which appears to me to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150043"></xptr>be so much under her controul, that she cannot be charged with the felony; as it was taken with the room, and delivered up with the room, she had a full power of the room.</p>

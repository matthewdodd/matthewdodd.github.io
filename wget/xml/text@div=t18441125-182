                  </hi>, I am a surgeon, and live at 38, Stamford-street, Lambeth. I knew Mrs. Brenton, the deceased—I was called to attend her about the 17th of Aug., and I attended her in the delivery of female child on the 20th of Aug.—she left her bed after that at about the ordinary period—she had a very good time—it was quite a natural labour—I believe it was not her first child, but I never attended her before—after leaving her bed she was attacked with rheumatism—I think she left her bed about the third week, or probably rather before—I do not know how long after leaving her bed she returned to it—I think several days, but I was not there all the time—I merely called in occasionally to see how she was, after being attacked with rheumatism—my attendance then recommenced—she was then keeping her bed—I left town on the 25th of Sept. I think, and left the case in charge of Mr. Saunders—I returned on the 10th of Oct., and on that evening I saw the deceased with her father, whom I was then introduced to, and Mr. Saunders—she was then in a state of almost insensibility—she was paralyzed in the right arm, and the left leg appeared paralyzed—she had spasms of the muscles of the jaw, producing what is commonly called locked-jaw—she had a very low feeble pulse—she could only be aroused to answer a question or two, not a sequence of questions—I was shown a wound which was then sloughing on her back—it was about two inches long and one wide—it was a slough in the centre with a red margin, and shading off to the natural colour of the skin—it was on the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi>, over the lower bone of the back, not quite the lowest—Mr. Brenton returned with roe to my house for medicine, and he said, seeing I was returned, and being his wife's medical attendant, he thought it right to state to me what had occurred on that particular even<lb></lb>ing in question, that he was desirous of having intercourse with his wife, which she resisted, and thinking it arose from ill temper, or words to that effect, he had persisted, and was exceedingly sorry for the results—I think he remarked that he thought it rather extraordinary the bruise on the back</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250211"></xptr>
               <p>had not been discovered by the medical men on their first attendance after the 3rd—I am not certain whether it was at that period, or on any future occasion, that that occurred—Mrs. Brenton died on the 19th of Oct.—I was not present at her death—she was dead when I called that day—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the morning of the inquest, the Monday following, and the day previous—it occupied many hours—we took a portion one day, and a portion the next—Mr. Saunders was pre<lb></lb>sent with me on the first day, and Mr. Fisher, Mr. Saunders, and myself on the second day, the day of the inquest—the father of the deceased was not present—I believe he was in the house a portion of the time, but not in the room—(<hi rend="italic">referring to his minutes</hi>)—I first opened' the skull—on removing the skull, I saw nothing of any importance on the outer surface of the brain—there was an effusion of about two ounces and a half of serum in the arachnoid sac, which is one of the cavities of the brain—that was more than the ordinary quantity—there were no external marks of injury on the head—the vessels of the brain were in a turgid state, more particularly on the left side, where there was a slight degree of adhesion of the membranes of the brain—there was about two drachms of serum in the ventricle—that was not material—that was all I saw the first day—on the second day's examination, I saw external marks of sloughing over the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi>, which I have spoken of as having seen when she was alive—the vessels of the spinal cord, or the marrow, were congested, having patches of red on the top—there were coagula of blood at different portions of the spine, that extended, in different places, from the last dorsal to the cervical ver<lb></lb>tebree, that is, from the bone of the back to the bone of the neck—then were two dark marks under each knee—the spinal marrow was in a state of inflammation—the symptoms I have mentioned would indicate that inflam<lb></lb>mation, mation, and others, which showed themselves previously to death, tender<lb></lb>ness ness progressing up the spine, and pain, evidenced by flinching on pres<lb></lb>sure, up the spine externally—I first discovered that tenderness at the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi>, and some portion of the <hi rend="italic">os nominata</hi>, the bones which form the inside of the hip, or the smaller bones of the pelvis—it extended then up to the first dorsal bone of the back—on further examination I found that it extended further up the dorsal—the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi> bone was exceedingly tender, so that she could not bear pressure on it, and flinched whenever it was touched—inflammation was the cause of that tenderness—the bone was also enlarged—I attribute that, also, to the inflammation—after death I found that the surface of the bone, immediately under the slough, was dark, as if it had lost its vitality, as if it had been mortified during life—there was a degree of <hi rend="italic">cares</hi>, or softening of the bone immediately under it—that state of the bone was decidedly connected with the wound that I had observed externally—they acknowledged the same cause—I attribute the death to inflammation, or irritation of the spinal cord—I presume when it extended as far as the origin of the phrenic nerve, the nerve by which we breathe that that was the immediate cause of death—there had evidently been pressure on the spinal marrow from the coagula which was formed there—when the phrenic nerve is affected, life will very soon become extinct—if the phrenic nerve was paralyzed it would cease to act on the diaphragm, and then the diaphragm losing its power, instant death would happen—I suppose that was the cause of death.</p>

               <p>was the first time I had ever seen her—I think she was of a delicate con<lb></lb>stitution—on my return to town she was labouring under a shock of the nervous system—the system generally had received a shock—I do not think such a state would exist if a person died from an attack of apoplexy—I should say locked jaw is certainly not very often produced by an at<lb></lb>tack of apoplexy—apoplexy may be accompanied by paralysis of the arm—apoplexy produces a depression, a loss of power of the nervous system—I think I never attended a person who died from concussion of the brain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you tell what would be the difference between a person dying from apoplexy and from concussion of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think, if I attended from an early period, I could, no doubt, form an opinion—the appearances of the deceased's head did not indicate sufficient symptoms of apoplexy—the great mischief here was in the spine, and my previous knowledge of the case made me suppose so the more—I saw nothing in the head to produce apoplexy—when I observed the wound on the spine I did not attribute it to the effect of disease—not at any time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurse—I attended Mrs. Brenton from the 19th of Aug. up to the time of her death—I remember the night of the 3rd of Oct.—I left Mrs. Brenton at eleven o'clock that night—I left Mr. Brenton in the bedroom with her—I went into the front parlour—they were in the back parlour—I slept in the front parlour that night—after I had been there ten minutes I heard Mrs. Brenton say, "You may pinch me, or take pieces out of me, but I will die before I will give in to you"—I heard a scuffling first of all, and that expression directly, at the tame time—the scuffling continued about an hour, from eleven till twelve—I did not hear Mr. Brenton say anything—I heard no other remark from Mrs. Brenton in that hour—they were quiet for a little while, and then I heard them begin again—that was about a quarter after twelve—I heard her call him, "You wretch," and "a beast"—she said, if she had had Cobley, he would not hare used her in that way—I heard nothing else—that was the last I heard—I heard no sounds or any groaning, that I swear—I have never stated so—the baby, six weeks old, was in the room—it was crying in the course of the night, two or three times, and I heard Mr. Brenton speak to it, and hushing it—he was crying "Hush"—about half-past six or seven in the morning I knocked at their door—Mr. Brenton told me to come in—I leant over and took the baby out of the bed—Mr. Brenton was in bed at the time—I saw Mrs. Brenton—I asked her what was the matter, but received no answer—she was in an insensible state, but I had seen her so several times—after this I left the room, and went into the front room with the, child—I prepared the breakfast at eight o'clock, and took it in—Mrs. Brenton did not get up to eat any—she was not well enough to take any—Mr. Brenton got up about a quarter to eight, and went into the front parlour, and took breakfast at the same table with me—I did not put any question to him about Mrs. Brenton—I did not say a word to him about what I had heard—I am married—I attended Mrs. Brenton all this time—she was in a very weak, debilitated state, and had been so during the eighteen months I had at<lb></lb>tended her—Mr. Brenton went out about nine that morning—I told Mrs. Baker, the landlady, what had taken place, as soon as he had gone out—it might be twenty minutes after he was gone, I cannot say exactly—Mrs. Baker did not send for a medical man on seeing her—she did not do any<lb></lb>thing—we had a medical man, who always came, every day, about twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>or twice in that time, but not more—he then went away again, and re<lb></lb>turned in a fortnight—he then slept with Mrs. Brenton—this happened within a day or two after the six weeks—the first night he came home after the month, she wished me to go home and sleep, because Mr. Brenton was coming to sleep with her—I did not sleep in the parlour that time—there are very thin folding-doors between the parlours—she was always ailing—at the time Mr. Brenton came home at the end of the month I asked her whether she was in a fit state for him to sleep with her, and she said the was as well as she ever was in her life—I went to her mother's to sleep for three nights before this happened, as she wished me—the first and only night I slept in the front parlour, when Mr. Brenton was sleeping in the back parlour with his wife, was the night this happened—he had been home some nights before, sleeping with her, and I was away from the par<lb></lb>lour lour on those nights, because Mrs. Brenton desired me—she told me her hus<lb></lb>band was coming to sleep with her, as she had said before—I did not speak to her about her weak state then—I thought there was no, occasion—she got the black eye by tumbling down when intoxicated—she got so very often during the whole time I knew her, except when she was confined—I do not suppose she ever went a day without having six or seven quarterns unknown to her husband, end when I would not fetch it, she would send her little girl, nine years old, and when she was not at home she would send the potboy—that was not while she was at Mrs. Baker's—she had not been at Mrs. Baker's above three weeks before she was confined—she did not get drunk while she was at Mrs. Baker's—she left it off when she was confined—there was nothing in the scuffling I heard which induced me to suppose any violence was used—it was nothing more than might take place between husband and wife—I did not like to interpose as I was not called—had I heard any blow given, or anything of that kind, I should have gone in directly, but I did not—the first place at which she was liv<lb></lb>ing, where she used to get drunk, was at No. 18, Woodbridge-street, Clerkenwell, and the next was No. 24, Windsor-terrace, City-road.</p>

               <p>in the evening—I was there at eight o'clock—I understood he was coming to see her that night—she was treated for concussion of the brain that night—this was on Friday—nothing particular occurred until the fol<lb></lb>lowing Monday but a progress of the diseased action—I saw her twice every day during the whole of her illness—on Monday I found that there was a morbid action of the bladder and rectum, a paralysis of the two muscles which contain the matter of those parts; and on seeing her endea<lb></lb>vouring to move her leg, I found there was a particular contraction of the left leg, so that she could not turn it over—it was a morbid action—I could not account on the first day for the locked jaw, because that arises from a different cause to concussion of the brain; but when I saw that same action of the leg, I then concluded that there was something the matter with the back—I mentioned that, and I heard the prisoner, on hearing me do so, desire the nurse to tell me that she had a sloughing in the back—I then had her turned over, and examined the back, and there I saw a morbid action about the size of a crown-piece, or not so large pro<lb></lb>bably, perhaps about as large as half-a-crown—there was a vesicle, and the morbid action of sloughing was going on—from the appearance of the parts, and knowing that the locked jaw, in all probability, arose from some injury of a remote nerve, I concluded at once that a blow had been in<lb></lb>flicted on that part, the left leg and thigh being in the same morbid state as the locked jaw; and I beg to observe, that a paralysis of the bladder and rectum always accompanies an injury to the spinal marrow at that part of the back—it was on the lower part of the back, on the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi>—that is a part of the <hi rend="italic">lumbar</hi> region—a concussion cannot take place without a blow—I have seen many concussions of the spine, but I never saw one without a blow—the very term itself signifies that—it is a shock—a concussion necessarily implies external force.</p>

I attended Mrs. Brenton, in place of Mr. Laver, when he was out of town—I saw her on the 3rd of Oct.—she was better on that day, and I recommended her to leave her bed—I do not re<lb></lb>collect whether she expressed any intention of doing so—she made no complaint to me on that day of any bruise or wound on her person—I called professionally, about one o'clock, on the 4th of Oct.—she was then lying in bed, in a state of insensibility—I had been partly informed by the landlady that there was a probability of her having taken laudanum—Mr.</p>

               <p>Brenton was not at home, and the nurse was not there—I had not sufficient information, in a medical way, as to what had occurred to bring Mrs. Brenton into that state, for me to act upon—I called again about seven or eight o'clock in the evening—I then met Mr. Houston—we did not exa<lb></lb>mine her body then—she was very pale, in a state of collapse, the pulse rather small, and the pupils of the eyes not acting—there were symptoms of some shock to the nervous system, and upon that I acted—I saw her again early next morning (Saturday)—I saw her on the Monday—the wound was not pointed out to me till the Tuesday—it was a dark, disco<lb></lb>loured surface of skin, with a vesicle or blister upon it, but not a decided wound—I attended the case for seven or eight days altogether—I saw her occasionally after Mr. Laver's return, but not regularly—the wound was on the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi>—there was tenderness of the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi>, the result of inflammation, and a redness from the wound—it appeared a wound of recent origin—I should have thought it had existed two, three, or four days, possibly, pre<lb></lb>vious to the Tuesday, but it is uncertain to fix a time—the inflammation gradually extended up the spine—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exa<lb></lb>mination—the spine was then opened—we found symptoms of previous inflammation, and there was blood extravasated on the <hi rend="italic">dorsal</hi> vertebree more than elsewhere, in fact, there almost alone, principally there, and up<lb></lb>wards towards the neck—there was congestion—the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi> bone was rather soft—I attributed that softness to the inflammation consequent on the ex<lb></lb>ternal sore—the inflammation of the spine might have arisen from a blow to that part, or, in fact, to any part of the spine, or its course—Mrs. Brenton was a woman of very feeble constitution, which would decidedly make a blow take the greater effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, looking to the state in which the spinal marrow was, and look<lb></lb>ing at the whole case before and after death, are yoa of opinion that a blow had been struck on the <hi rend="italic">sacrum? A</hi>. I am of opinion that there was a certain shock to the nervous system—how produced I am not fully pre<lb></lb>pared to say—looking at the state of Mrs. Brenton's health on the 3rd of Oct., I think some severe struggle or conflict might produce those appear<lb></lb>ances—it must be a shock, a very severe injury to the head or spine—it must be a very severe conflict—striking and beating would concuss the spine, in her weak state especially.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HAKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She had never complained to you of any fall, had she? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She had not—there were blue marks under the ham of the thigh, as if of bruises.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Small marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they appeared the result of pinches—they were under the thigh, towards the knee—I saw the bed she was lying on, but did not notice it—having connection in her debilitated state might produce <hi rend="italic">hysteria</hi>—it might have some effect on the nervous system—I do not say that the death re<lb></lb>sulted from the bruise on the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi>—I do not know from what, but a general shock to the nervous system—I cannot form any opinion that it resulted from the bruise—I saw the body examined—there was no other bruise that could have caused the death—if it was occasioned by anything but the bruise, it must have been by some general nervous derangement—I do not know how to account for it—there might have been some shock to the system which did not leave any external trace—I cannot tell what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250217"></xptr>
               <p>it might have resulted from—I have a doubt at this moment—I cannot speak positively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HAKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any appearance of <hi rend="italic">hysteria</hi> on the 4th, when you saw Mrs. Brenton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At first, perhaps, one might feel inclined to think so; but in a very short time my opinion was formed that it was not <hi rend="italic">hysteria</hi>, decidedly not, from what I saw subsequently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you examine the viscera of the stomach? I did, it was healthy—she was a person of very weak constitution—she was of a rheumatic habit, and of a delicate habit altogether—the liver appeared to. lerably healthy—there was nothing about it to excite attention—there was nothing at all in her appearance to indicate a person in the habit of drink<lb></lb>ing—I ing—I did not notice it—I examined her principally with a view to ascer<lb></lb>tain the cause of death with relation to the wound, and the stomach.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I attended this case the greater part of the time from the 7th Oct., and was present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination the last day—I first saw the bruise on Mrs. Brenton's back on the second day of my seeing her, on the 8th—in my opinion it might have existed about three or four days, or it might have existed longer—I am of opinion that it was caused by violence—I have seen many wounds—I form that opinion from the symptoms combined, from the appearances previous to death and afterwards—I recollect the Saturday on which she died—she stated to me on that day that she believed she would not recover, I was questioning her—I wished to ascertain the state of her mind—her father was present—we were to meet with Mr. Laver, who did not keep his appointment—I was alone with her part of the time, and her father was with me a portion of the time—at the time she made a statement to me I was alone with her—I wished to ascertain her state with respect to her sanity, and to know whether she was sensible enough to answer my ques<lb></lb>tions, to ascertain in what state her health was—I asked her questions about her state of health—I asked her where she was in pain—she said, "In my back"—her father put the next question.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell us what took place when you were alone with her. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked her no more questions then when I was alone with her—after that I was again alone with her, and I asked her if she thought she should recover—she shook her head and began to cry, and said, "No"—I had asked her several questions before that—I asked where</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250218"></xptr>
               <p>she was in pain—she "In my back"—her father immediately came✗ in and said, "Who did it?"—nothing more took place when I was alone✗ with her the second time—nothing was said after I asked her if she thought she should recover—nothing else was said when I was alone with her, only with her father—something else was said before she shook her head and said "No," but after that, nothing was said either to me alone, or to myself and her father—I never heard her speak after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was that saying "No" after anything that she said in her father's presence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not a minute—he asked her something, to which she replied—he then went out, leaving her alone with me, and then I asked her if she thought she should recover—that is a very usual ques<lb></lb>tion for me to put to my patients, particularly when we find them in a state of insensibility, or collapse—we wish to know the state of the mind, whether they are sensible to answer any questions—I asked her that question to ascertain the state of her mind, and when she said "No" and cried, that satisfied me of the state of her mind, and I asked her no more questions—it is my common practice to put that question to persons in a weak state—I do not know whether it is of service to the patients, or whether it tends <hi rend="italic">to</hi> keep up their spirits—I asked her that question to ascertain the state of her mind, to know whether she was sensible or not, in answering the questions I had put to her before with regard to the state of her health.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HAKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You saw she was dying at that time, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—my opinion was that she would not recover.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask her whether she had slept well, about her pain, and several other questions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she answered some of those questions reasonably, and some she did not—I asked her where she was in pain three times over—the answer that she gave me once was, "I don't know," and the next time, "In my back"—she answered my questions so that I was in doubt as to the state of her mind—I had some doubts as to whether she was in a sound state of mind or not, and I have some doubts at the present time—I asked the last question to ascertain whether she was in a sound state of mind—she answered, "No," and cried—that answer still left me in doubt, and I cannot now tell whether she was in a sound state of mind or not—I do not know that that question more than any other had a tendency to show whether she was of sound mind or not—I did not think it an unkind or cruel question to put—perhaps it might have been, upon second consideration—I commonly speak cheerfully to my patients, but it is a very frequent question, "Well, do you think you shall recover?"—it depends upon how you express it—I do not think it shows that you think them in danger—I do not know how long this was before she died—Mr. Baker was not present at the time—I think she did expect to die, but I doubt whether she was in a sound state of mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I superintend the business of my brother, Tho<lb></lb>mas Brooks and another, linen-drapers, High-street, Borough; the prisoner was in their service. On the 7th of October I told him we had reason to suspect he had robbed the firm—he said he had not taken anything belonging to us—I and my brother went with him, and searched his drawers, which were by the door of his room—they are for the use of the young men—they were unlocked then—we found in the drawer his clothes, and amongst them a satin stock, which appeared to have been worn—he then wished us to ter<lb></lb>minate the search, by pushing in the drawer—my brother said, "No, not yet, we must look in your pockets"—we found these four cambric handker chiefs in his coat-pocket—my brother asked if it was his coat, and he said, "Yes"—I know these handkerchiefs, by their having the mark of the firm upon them, and the stock by the private mark—we sent for an officer, and gave him in charge—he might have said something, but I do not recollect it—he was not entitled to purchase things, without having them entered in the book—the books are not here—there is no entry of these—I know they had only been in our stock a week—other persons sell besides me, but they are not here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> On the Saturday before you asked me to go on an errand for you. I asked you to get me some handkerchiefs, and you got me three dozen. I took them on the Sunday, and on the Monday I brought them back, and paid you 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for half a dozen of them. I said I wanted a dozen very good ones, and I told you on Monday they were not good enough. I wanted to go on a week-day, and you said, "Would it not do on Sunday?" I said,"Yes." On the Saturday these things came in; I took four, put them in paper, and put them into my pocket. I believe I told the person to enter them. You knew that the people were friends, and I have had goods before, and paid you. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That was a fortnight before, when he took some handkerchiefs to show to a customer—he had them entered on a memorandum—he brought nine of them back, and the money for the others.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could he ever receive goods without their being entered in a book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—we should give any man in charge if he took them out without—he could not receive them to take out to show a customer without their being entered, because we do not allow it—those that he says he had to show, he had on memorandum, and I knew of it—I believe they were en<lb></lb>tered—I did not see them entered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Have I not been entrusted to fetch goods from the City, to take to customers, without any entry? did I not fetch a lot of carpets, and take them to Captain Hudson, and other customers? I believe I told them to enter these handkerchiefs down. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I have asked every young man in the establishment, and they say you did not; he was never entrusted to go out with goods from the shop to show, without their being entered—we have three shops—he was only in one shop—if he had teen trusted by any other person in the shop, it would have come to my knowledge—we have only about five young men there.</p>

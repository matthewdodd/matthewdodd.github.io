               <p>Q. How long have you had it? - A. That I cannot say, for I have a great number of goods.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you ascertain this to be your property? - A. I have the greatest reason in the world to believe it to be my property; it was taken from a large press in the warehouse.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Mr. Winter, the father, makes no long residence in town, does he? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This bed is only reserved for him, as it would be for any intimate friend? - A. No; the house is Mr. Winter the father's own property.</p>
               <p>Q. And the son allows him rent for it? - A. I suppose so; I don't know how that is managed between the father and son; while I resided in it, I paid rent to Mr. Winter, the father, as the landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you believe the son pays rent to the father, as the landlord? - A. I cannot say as to that; on my leaving the house, he placed his son in the house; Mr.

               <p>Court. Q. You understand that old Mr. Winter pays the servants, and the son resides there always? - A. He does.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither of the Mr. Winters are here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On your own knowledge, you cannot give us any account whether the son is tenant to the father, or they are joint tenants? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. In the wrapper two pieces were found, that he was actually to take away? - A. Yes; he had two pieces to return that we did not approve of.</p>
               <p>Q. This, as you thought, dropped out of his wrapper? - A. I am sure it dropped out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, instead of the two pieces, three pieces must have been given him? - A. I cannot speak to that, my clerk can.</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. Winter, Shee and Winter; on the 13th of January, between three and five in the afternoon, the prisoner came from his master, Mr. Nelson, in Lawrence-lane, with two pieces of cloth for Mr. Shee and Winter; when he came in with the first load, I followed him into the back warehouse, where he leaves the cloth, and came out with him again; he then returned with a second load, with which I also followed him into the warehouse, and after having given him instructions to take two parcels of cloth back into the city, to return them to the factors they belonged to, I left him alone in the warehouse, and went into the counting-house, to write a receipt for these goods; we had before had some losses; I turned round to watch him, but in the position he stood; I could not see his body; there was a small room between the counting-house and warehouse; while I watched him, I saw the hand or hands of a man lift a piece of cloth out of the press; he then came through, with his wrapper wrapped up, and signed the receipt, and was going his way out; I then went up one pair of stairs to Mr. Shee, and he came down and laid hold of the prisoner, and brought him to the counting-house, where his wrapper was opened, in which there was nothing found but the two parcels I had delivered to him; we then looked back a few paces, and saw this piece of cloth on the ground; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the passage where Mr. Shee had been? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the colour? - A. Brown; this is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150025"></xptr>the cloth we picked up; I cannot swear it is the property of Messrs. Shee and Winter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss such a piece of cloth? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, that such a remnant as this was in the room where you saw him? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the colour of the cloth he lifted out of the press? - A. No; I cannot swear what the colour of the cloth was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all the cloth in that press your master's property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the value of it be? - A. Three pounds eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have some persons to speak to my character.(The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a very good character, one of whom was his master, who offered to take him into his service again.) <rs id="t17970215-8-verdict41" type="verdictDescription">

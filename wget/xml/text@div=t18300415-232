On the 19th of March I came home at seven o'clock in the evening, but did not hear this property was lost till the day after - I gave information, and went to Mrs. Lloyd's, who <rs id="t18300415-232-deflabel1287" type="occupation">keeps an old iron shop</rs>

"It is (said I) and you ought to be ashamed of yourself for not letting me have it" - we found the shawl on Harvey's shoulders, when we first took her; she said, "Dont make a fuss, and I will tell you where the kettle is; it is at old mother Lloyd's" - and we went there.</p>

            . I was in Lloyd's shop. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150113"></xptr>Friday, the 19th of March, Harvey came in soon after twelve o'clock, with a kettle under her apron, which I believe to be this; she requested Lloyd to buy it - she said she would do no such thing; she was there ten minutes urging her to buy it - she said, "It is my own kettle, I have had it eight years - I bought it in East-street;" Lloyd said, "Keep it eight years longer" - she said,"For God's sake buy it, I have the broker in my house, and want 10s.; I have 6s. 6d., and if you will let me have 3s. 6d., I will leave the kettle - and come and fetch it again in a day or two;" I was there again on the Monday, when Harvey came and brought a box of different things - part of it was wearing-apparel, belonging to a man; some boots and some working-tools - she said, "I have brought these, won't you buy these;" Lloyd said,"No, I won't have any thing to do with you, or your things, put them in your box" - she put them in, and went away, saying, she would come for her kettle the next day.</p>

            . I was ordered to go to Lloyd's, which I did, and directed her to come to our office; I went again and she was getting ready to come - she said,"D-nation seize the woman;" I said, "What did you give for the kettle?" she said, "I did not buy it, I only lent 3s. 6d. on it."</p>

               <p>MRS. PHIPPS re-examined. Q. Did she mention such a thing to you? A. No, it is not true - I do not know that she noticed it at all.</p>

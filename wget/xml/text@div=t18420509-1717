                  </hi>. I am a haberdasher—the prisoner was my servant of all-work, and had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year. On Sunday, the 24th of April I missed some things, which made me look to see if any thing else was gone, and I missed a sheet—I told her I would not be satisfied till I had got the sheet—in consequence of what she said to me I found the shirt, sheet, and two handkerchiefs at Mr. Turner's, a pawnbroker, in Walworth-road—I went there in consequence of seeing the duplicate in her hand—she said she had pawned the sheet—she was not willing for me to get it out, she wished to get it out herself—I said, "You have no money to get it out"—she said she would pawn some of her own things to get it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to know she had the duplicate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We said no<lb></lb>thing about the sheet till Monday morning—I then pressed her to tell me where it was—she said she knew nothing about it—I said nobody had ac<lb></lb>cess to it but herself—then she said she had pawned it, and produced the duplicate—she said there was only the sheet and her own shawl—I went to Turner's, and found the articles—I had seen the shirt safe about a fort<lb></lb>before—the handkerchiefs were in the back-warehouse—I knew the papers they were in were there, but I did not look into them—the police<lb></lb>man found a pair of gloves, which I kept in the same chest of drawers up stairs with the shirt—the drawer was found broken open on the Sunday night—I had seen it safe that afternoon—I always kept it locked—I do not think I had opened it that day—I gave her into custody on the 25th of April.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Turner, a pawn<lb></lb>broker.

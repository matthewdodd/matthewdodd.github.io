                  </hi>. I belong to the medical profession, and live in London-street, Fitzroy-square. On the 16th of February, between ten and twelve o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for two penny worth of <hi rend="italic">Jubes</hi>—I conversed with him a little on the nature of his disease—he gave me a half-crown—I returned him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—as soon as he went away, I looked at the half-crown, and found it was base coin—I wrapped it in paper, and put it away to see if he would come again, or if I should see him in the street—on the 22nd of March, he came and asked for a penny worth of poppy-heads—I said, "There is none in the shop"—he said, "You have some Epsom-salts, give me a penny worth"—I gave it him—he put down a shilling—I looked at it, and saw it was bad—I said, "My boy, you are here again with a bad shilling"—as soon as I said that, he <hi rend="italic">bolted off</hi>—I pursued, crying "Stop thief"—and he was taken—I gave the money to the policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The policeman marked the half-crown himself on the night he gave him the shilling—I did not give him the half-crown at all—I was at work that day.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant E</hi> 4.) I heard the cry of "Stop thief "—I took the prisoner back to the shop, and got a shilling and half-a-crown, which the prosecutor said he had taken from him on the 16th.</p>

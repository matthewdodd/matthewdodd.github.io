                  </hi>. I am surgeon at University College Hospital. Between one and two o'clock in the morning of the 20th of Aug. I saw Bridget Fleming at the hospital, with a wound behind her left ear, about three-fourths of an inch in length—it did not reach the bone, but appeared as though some instrument had been pushed under the skin—I thought that a common dinner-knife, which was shown to me, was the most likely instru<lb></lb>ment to have effected it—I have seen her since, and some bruises appeared near the wound, which would make it less likely than I at first supposed—the wound was somewhat of a crescent shape, and there was a slight wound on the margin of the ear, which seemed a continuation of the other wound, as if the ear had been pressed against the head at the time the wound wasinflicted—the wounds were not dangerous—I only saw her once after<lb></lb>wards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper, at No. 2, Tottenham-place, Tottenham Court-road. I heard a cry of "Murder" proceeding from the kitchen where the prisoner lives, about half-past twelve o'clock, that night—I had before that heard the prisoner and his wife having a few words—I heard cries more than once, but I did not take notice, as they were often quarrelling—I saw the street door open, and shut it—I saw the woman come with the officer, and the prisoner was taken to the station.</p>

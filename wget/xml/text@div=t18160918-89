               <p>MICHAEL M' CANNY. I lost my watch on the 13th of July last; it was a silver watch. It was taken from my house in <placeName id="t18160918-89-crimeloc472">Bath-place, New-road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18160918-89-crimeloc472" type="placeName" value="Bath-place, New-road"></interp>

               <p>MRS. M'CANNY. I had seen the watch before I went out with the prisoner, on the 13th. I was in care of the house. It was on the dresser shelf. I saw it about eight in the evening of the 13th of July. The prisoner was in the house during the greater part of the day; she called on a visit, and I gave her leave to do her work in the house. She came about ten or eleven in the morning, and she nursed my child during that day. She left the house with me about eight in the evening. As she went out with me, I saw the watch. I went into Brook-street, which is in the New-road; I was gone about twenty minutes. I pa ted with the prisoner soon after I went out, and after my return, I missed my watch about ten o'clock</p>
               <p>THOMAS DOBBINS. I am a labouring-man; I lodged in this house. I know the prisoner. I recollect Mrs. M'Canny going out to get change for a note; I saw both her and the prisoner go out together. In about ten minutes the prisoner came back, and knocked at the door, and said she had forgotten a key, and wanted to go down stairs; she went down, but was not down above a minute or two. When she came up, I did not perceive that she had any thing about her. I stopped until she came back again, and then she went away. That is all I know. She bid me good night at the door, and went away. Nobody else came into the house after the prosecutrix went out but the prisoner.</p>

            . I-had known the prisoner about a fortnight when she called at my lodgings, and gave me the duplicate of a watch; it was about the middle of July, and it was a watch pawned at Cameron's. She stated to me that she had bought it of a woman, and had given ten shillings for it; I redeemed the watch, and paid fifteen shillings for it. I pawned it at Mr. Dry's, in Blandford-street, and I lost the duplicate, and when we went to his house for it, it had been redeemed.</p>
               <p>DAVID Cameron. I wrote upon the duplicate; I recollect the name of the maker of the watch; it was Parkinson</p>
               <p>Michael M'Canny. On my watch the maker's name was Parkinson.</p>

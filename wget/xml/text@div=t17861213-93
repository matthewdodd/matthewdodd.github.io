               <p>How could you see the knife if the candle was put out? - Why, it was remarkable moonlight, not only so, I particularly noticed the girl as I was going down stairs, for I had a dread on my spirit on being in such a place; I noticed her particularly before the candle was put out, and when the candle was put out, there was no light but the light of the moon.</p>

Bentley was at the bottom of the stairs when the other lighted me down, and she took hold of my gown; I saw her at the bottom as I was coming down; as soon as the other put out the candle they both began to strip me; one had hold of one gown sleeve, and the other the other; when they began to strip me they threw the door wide open; and I began to scream out murder; then they shut to the door again; Whitehead opened and shut the door.</p>

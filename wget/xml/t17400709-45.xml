               <p>Ann Beaver was called; and the Counsel for the Defendant objected against her being sworn; but it being the Opinion of the Court, that if she proved the Note to be false or forged, she was liable to pay, and therefore must be allowed to be a good Witness to prove the Note a forg'd Note, tho' she could not be a legal Witness to prove it a good one.</p>

I was indebted to them 24 l.18 s. and more, for Spirits I had had of them; and on the 8th of May, the Prisoner, who was their Clerk, came to me and desired to know if I wanted any Spirits. I told him yes, but I desired Mr Wilks to come and take the Money for that Tun I had had. He told me Mr Wilks was not well, and Mr Bush was out of Town. I said, if either of them would come, I would pay the Money; but I refused to pay him, without an Order from Mr Wilks. On Saturday he came again, and said Mr Wilks was gone out to take an airing in a Coach, and could not come so far as my House. On Wednesday the 14th of May he came again, and said he had brought an Order from Mr. Wilks ; he delivered me this Order; I paid him the Money, and he gave me a Receipt in my Pocket-Book. The Order was read, and it being in such general Terms, as to require the Aid of Parol Evidence to explain it and being without Direction to any particular Person; and no mention made therein of what was to be paid, it was too uncertain , and general, to come within the Penal Statute of the VIIth of his present Majesty, The Jury therefore <rs id="t17400709-45-verdict232" type="verdictDescription">

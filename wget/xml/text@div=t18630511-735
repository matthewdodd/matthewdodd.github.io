I occupy the house 69, Gower-street, St. Giles-in-the-fields—on the morning of 4th April, about 3 o'clock, or it might be a little later, I was aroused by hearing a noise of some kind about the house—I got up, and happened to make a noise with the table—I heard the street-door slam; I awoke Mrs. Edmonds, and we both went down stains—not observing anything I went up stairs, and went to bed again—about 4 o'clock I was again aroused by the police—this writing-desk, plume of feathers, hat, and album, belong to Alfred Riddles, a lodger in the house.</p>

On the morning of 4th April, I was on duty in Chenies-street, Tottenham-court-road—about 4 o'clock I saw the prisoner Sonnet in Chenies-street, and about five or six minutes afterwards, or it might have been seven or eight, minutes, I saw him again in Stone-street—seeing him a second time, I had a suspicion that there was something wrong, upon which I went sharp round my beat to meet him again—on coming into Gower-street, where I thought to meet him, I could not see him—I stood at the corner of Gower-street for a moment, and then proceeded along Gower-street, and I saw Sonnet step from the door of No. 69—he was followed by Eagin and another man; they came out of the house, and slammed the door after them—I sprang my rattle, and followed them to the corner of Gower-street and Stone-street—they all three ran up Stone-street, and turned down a mews in Stone-street—I sprang my rattle, and ran back again down Gower-street into Cherries-street to the other end of the mews—the mews runs from Stone-street into Chenies-street—I met Eagin coming out of the mews into Chenies-street—I took hold of him, and told him I should take him into custody—he asked what for—I said for having seen him come out of a house in Gower-street—he said, "Don't use any violence; I will go with you quietly; I have not done anything I care about"—I did not use any violence to him, I declined to do so—he went some distance with me quietly—on coming into Gower-street, he struck me a violent blow on my cheek—I had hold of him at the time by the collar with my left hand—I did not see what it was he struck me with the first time—I then struck him a blow with my rattle, which I had in my hand, and in the struggle my hat fell off—he struck me again; I closed in with him, and we struggled for some time in the street—he tried several times to throw me, and ultimately I went to the ground-Waite was the first constable that came to my assistance—I was taken to the hospital—Eagin made his escape from me, after dealing me two blows on the head; he ran up Gower-street—I was very much hurt, I am suffering from the injuries very much now—</p>

               <p>after my wounds were dressed at the hospital, I was taken back to the station—I revived, and felt a good deal better then than I do now—I saw Eagin at the station, and I said he was the man that had ill-used me as soon as I went in—I afterwards went with Baskforth to Broad-street, St. Giles, about 10 o'clock that same morning—I there saw Sonnet—I pointed him out to Bashforth, but I could not speak loud enough for him to hear—he had to come to me, and as soon as Sonnet saw me point him out to Baskforth, he ran away—he was followed by Bashforth, but made his escape.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 48). I had a description given to me of Sonnet—I went in search of him, and apprehended him on the night of 15th April, between 11 and twelve o'clock, in Drury-lane—I told him I wanted him for being concerned with another man in custody for committing a burglary, and assaulting a police constable, in Gower-street—he said, "All right, I'll go; give me flair play"—I took him to George-street station, and Baker was sent for—we put Sonnet with several other men, and Baker picked him out, and said, "That is one of the men that I wanted."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, E</hi> 106). On the morning of 4th April, I was on duty in Doughty-street, in plain clothes, standing under a gas-light; that is better than a quarter of a mile from Gower-street, nearly half a mile—I saw the two prisoners in company with another man, as near as I can say about half-past 3; they were going in the direction of Russell-square, which would take them to Gower-street—I followed them, and lost sight of them; I was about fifty yards behind them, and when they got to the inclosure of Russell-square it was very dark, and I could not see which way they went—I had also seen those same three men together on the Thursday morning, the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I think, in Russell-square, between 5 and 6.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, E</hi> 61). On the morning of 4th April, I was on duty in Gray's-inn-lane in plain clothes, about half-past 3, and saw the two prisoners with another man in Gray's-inn-lane—I followed them into Guildford-street; I there met Blissett and spoke to him, and we followed them to Russell-square, where we lost sight of them—I had seen the same three men two or three mornings previously in Holborn.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you with Blissett When you lost sight of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was not very foggy; there was a little fog; it got thicker by Russell-square, when we lost them by the inclosure—that could not have been more than seven or eight minutes from the time I first saw them.</p>

Q.</hi> Where did you first see us on the 4th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Gray's-inn-lane, just by Henry-street, not quite so far down as King's-road, it is parallel with Doughty-street—I should say you had on a blue cap, a round deer-stalker, and a dark brown coat—the other man was taller than either of you, with a brown coat—I was closer to you than I am now when I first saw you—you were going towards Guildford-street; you passed close to me; I met yon, and then turned back after you—Blissett was in Guild<lb></lb>ford-street, close by Doughty-street, when I first saw him—there is a lamp there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Eagan's Defense.</hi> I wish to state how this happened. At a quarter-past 4, I was in Tottenham-court-road, at a coffee stall; I spoke to them at the police-station about it, and the policeman would not allow the man to come; I was proceeding down Chenies street, and turned into Chenies<lb></lb>mews, to answer the calls of nature; I was coming out, and saw two men running; one of them followed me and took me; I am charged with</p>

               <p>burglary, and likewise assaulting the constable; I was never in this man's company before—Baker says he never saw me before he saw me coming out of the house; he cannot give a description of the man who has got away; he was the nearest to him, and I was the furthest off; the policeman ought to be here who spoke of the life-preserver; one constable states he took it out of my hand, and the other constable says he picked it up.</p>

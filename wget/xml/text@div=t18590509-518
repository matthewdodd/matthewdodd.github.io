                  </hi>. I now come out of the gaol of New-gate—I pleaded guilty at the last session to indictments for forgery—I first became acquainted with Wagner in May or, June, 1857—I was then in poor circumstances—I wanted to borrow some money—my first introduc<lb></lb>tion to Wagner was for the purpose of discounting a bill—I know a man named Kerp—No. 10, York-buildings, Adelphi, was taken as an office—Wagner took the house—Bateman joined him about July or August last year—the name of "Bateman and Co." was on a plate on the door, and "Bateman and Co., Law, Parliamentary, and General Stationers" in the win<lb></lb>dows of the front room, with the word Agents" at the bottom—Bateman married Wagner's wife's sister—Kerp lived at Mrs. Skelton's, in John-street, Fitzroy-square—I hare repeatedly been there with Wagner—I don't recollect Bateman ever going with me or Wagner—I have not seen him there—I have been with Wagner for the purpose of getting certain docu<lb></lb>ments from Kerp, and on one occasion for the purpose of taking certain papers out of a slop-pail, which had a false bottom that unscrewed, and where papers were kept for the purposes of forgery—an arrangement was also made for concealing papers, at York-buildings, in the rolling-pin—I know this 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that was the proceeds of the forgery of Mr. Aitkin's cheque for 375<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Wagner gave that note to me to take to the Bank of England for the purpose of getting changed—I went into the bank, and came out without changing it, and gave it to Wagner—he then gave it to Bateman, who went in and procured the change—he got some gold and a certain number of notes, which Wagner gave to me, and I changed them at Spielman's—I got there a 1,000 franc note—I gave it to Wagner, and he gave it to Bateman, who went with it to Smart's—I re<lb></lb>member his coming back from Smart's and saying he had a cheque from Mr. Smart for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Bateman took a copy of this cheque on tracing paper, and then he took the real cheque to Drummonds' and procured the money for it—Wagner procured from Humphreys a blank form of cheque on Drummonds—it had no stamp on it; and a conversation took place between Wagner, myself, and Bateman, as to how the stamp was to be accomplished; and Humphreys was to be applied to for the pur<lb></lb>pose of making a die—I believe Humphreys promised to do it speedily—Home delay took place, and Wagner, not liking it to remain any longer, it was arranged that Bateman and myself should try if we could make a die—Bateman commenced by purchasing some plaster of Paris, and it was at last accomplished—the plaster one was afterwards broken up, and one was made in metal, and with that we impressed the stamp upon the blank cheque that was brought by Humphreys—that blank cheque was then filled</p>

               <p>up by Bateman, in my presence, for the sum of 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Bateman said that Jones, a friend of his, knew a man of the name of Bramwell who would present the cheque—he said that Bramwell was taking care of an empty house in the neighbourhood of Soho—Jones went to consult Bramwell, and came back and told Wagner, Bateman, and myself the nature of the correspondence he had had with him—it appeared that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be left as a deposit by whoever took the house; and if somebody would come to the house and pretend to pay the money, and protect him, by writing letters to that effect, he would present the cheque—that was the arrangement made in the presence of Bateman, myself, and Wagner—these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were written by Bateman—I posted one of them I believe—it was arranged that the cheque should be presented on 21st January—it is dated the 20th—Jones went to Bramwell to ascertain whether the two letters had arrived safely, and came and reported that they had, and in the evening of the 20th the cheque was given to Jones for the purpose of giving to Bramwell—it was not inclosed in the letter—(<hi rend="italic">The two letters were here ready as in the former case</hi>)—On the following morning I went to York-buildings—Wagner and Bateman were both out—they came in about 12 o'clock, I think—Jones had been in just before—Jones told me in Wagner and Bateman's presence that there had been some mistake at the banker's, the money had not been paid; and that a clerk had gone with Bramwell up to his house—Wagner, Bateman, and I consulted, and Wagner came to the conclusion that it was a falsehood of Jones's, that the money had been received, and that Jones and Bramwell had got it, and had cheated them—Wagner suggested that Bateman and himself should go to the house, and they left for the purpose of seeing whether there was an officer there or not—they returned in about two hours, and Bateman then told me that he had been over the house, and he had seen a man he pre<lb></lb>sumed to be an officer, who was smoking a pipe; and he laughed, and said, "Well, officer or not, I have lighted my cigar from his pipe"—he was smoking at the time—I know a female named Fairbairn—I don't recollect whether she went out that morning with Bateman—Wagner and Bateman left together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bateman. Q.</hi> You perfectly understand the nature of an oath? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I presume I do—I have sworn that I acted as clerk at your place—I had a commission upon every business that was done there; that was the under<lb></lb>standing that Wagner made with me, before you came from Holyhead, that you should start a law-stationery business; and upon my having a commis<lb></lb>sion upon all business done there, I was to act as clerk, and carry on my own business as well as a money agent and commission agent—from October I was there regularly daily, from morning till evening—the business carried on was principally money agency; discounting bills was the principal, except a little law stationery that you did—it was a general money agency; discounting bills, and raising money on different loans—I did all the money agency business in general; you also attended to it, certainly; the law sta<lb></lb>tionery part was your own business, but there was very little of that carried on—your time was employed in legitimate business—you did the out-door work; I did the in-door—there was enough legitimate business for us both at times—I don't think I received a great deal as my share of the legitimate business; a good deal of time was occupied in attempts to carry out busi<lb></lb>ness that was not done—I don't think my commission, from the time I joined in October, amounted to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the outside; decidedly not more—have on a pair of plaid trousers which I had of you; and I bought a coat</p>

               <p>of you which I have not paid you for; I had those clothes because they were two small for you, and they happened to fit me; I bought the coat of you only a few days before I was taken, or you would have been paid for it, no doubt—I believe I had quite as good a suit of my own; of course I had it to look respectable in—the first time I saw you was a very few weeks after Mrs. Wagner's death, which was last May—I saw you in York-build<lb></lb>ings in the early part of June—you were repeatedly up from Holyhead—I was not first introduced to you concerning a loan which Mr. Gilbert was negociating for—I introduced such a matter to you; I believe I answered an advertisement—I don't think that was the first occasion upon which we had a conversation—I had a conversation with Wagner and you together as to what you were about to do presently, in York-buildings soon after it was arranged that you and I were to commence operations together, I did what I have been in the habit of doing, answered advertisements in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> of persons asking for money—Mr. Gilbert advertised for a loan, in some initial; I gave you the letter, and you carried it on I believe, for him—I believe that was our first transaction—you and Wagner gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that—I don't know what you realised; you told me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What has been your occupation for the last five or six years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since I left Bury-street, St. James's, I have carried on, as you are aware, a money-agency business solely—this is the first time the police have had me in custody; I swear that positively—I have been engaged in transactions in hops with a gentleman in the Borough, named Jones; that is within the last two years—I have known Mr. Jones five or six years—that was partly money-agency business—that was not the Mr. Jones I have been speaking of—I swear that I took part in the manufacture of a die, or stamp, in York-buildings; it was with you in the front kitchen; you and Wagner were down there with your coats off, and your shirt sleeves turned up, manufac<lb></lb>turing this die; you had left me in the front office; and after you had been there about three hours, I went to see what you were about, and you were in the act of holding a ladle on the fire, with melted metal in it—you had made two or three impressions, and were in the act of making another; you had not succeeded in getting an even surface, and I suggested some improve<lb></lb>ment; you acted on my suggestion, and an even surface was obtained, and I remained and assisted in carrying it out—I merely suggested an improve<lb></lb>ment upon the plan that you and Wagner were carrying out—I could not identify the 1000 franc note of which I have spoken; I did not see you change it, or see Mr. Smart pay you a cheque—I believe I can imitate handwriting very well, as I have proved—I never tried to imitate yours; I dare say I could—I believe I could copy anybody's handwriting—I swear that I have never attempted to imitate yours in any cheque—I dare say I could make copies like the two letters that I say are in your handwriting, if I were to try—I have written answers to advertisements connected with forgery, in my own handwriting; not in a disguised hand—I have written letters in connexion with forgeries that I have had to do with with Wagner; in answering those I do not know that I have particularly tried to disguise my writing; I had no particular reason for so doing; I might or I might not—I don't consider it a forgery to answer advertisements; it was relating to forgery, with yourself and Wagner—you perfectly well know the nature of the transaction—when it was decided upon committing any forgery, and an advertisement was put in, I was the person to answer the advertise<lb></lb>ments, and to write them—I have written letters in connexion with forgeries with yourself and Wagner; I never had anything to do with forgery until</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090132"></xptr>
               <p>I knew Wagner—I have decidedly written letters in connexion with your forgeries; forgeries that I have been connected with with you and Wagner—perhaps I have attempted to disguise my hand; I don't know that I have, particularly—I have committed no forgeries, except that one of Mr. Chambers,—you know, as well as I do, that I have been connected with forgeries—since 1857 I have written letters of the description I have named; I should say there have been from fifteen to twenty forgeries committed, and possibly I have written as many letters, in connexion with forgeries that I have been connected with with you and Wagner; all of which have taken place since 1857—I wrote to a Dr. Jones, of Albany-street, Regent's-park—you know the object of my writing; I wrote for the purpose of ascertaining whether he would become surety for Mr. Croker; I had no other object at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever obtain any signatures from persons by writing to them, for the purpose of committing forgeries upon them afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe there have been several suggestions of that sort—I had the correspondence in York-buildings; consequently I wrote all the letters, with the sanction of yourself and Wagner—I have written letters for the purpose of getting the signatures of gentlemen, with the intention of committing a forgery upon them afterwards—I am forty-eight years of age; you told me you were twenty-six—I say I have written several letters of that description, with the know<lb></lb>ledge and consent of yourself and Wagner—I forged a cheque of Mr. Chambers for 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I wrote it myself—I never forged any other document besides a cheque—not a bill of exchange, or anything of that kind—I have knowingly sent a person to a bankers with a forged cheque; you know I have done so; I have done so in the business at York-buildings, certainly; all the business in which I have been engaged connected with forgeries has been with your<lb></lb>self and Wagner—possibly I may have sent half a dozen persons to the bankers with forged cheques; when I say I, I include you—sometimes the money was obtained, sometimes not—the proceeds of the forgeries that were successful came through your fingers or Wagner's; they came into my hands in the shape of bank notes—sometimes I have changed those notes into gold; I think you are better able than I to judge how often—possibly I have done it three or four times; I should think I have been to the Bank of England three or four times to do it, and I have been with you to the money changers in the city—perhaps to four or five money changers, or possibly to half-a-dozen—you can put it down, in round numbers, a dozen times, if you like; we have been both together in changing those notes—I did not write my own name of Chandler upon them—those notes were given to me in York-buildings by you and Wagner, and in your presence and his I have sat down at the table in the back-room, and opened the Law List carelessly, and the first name I have hit upon I have put on the back of the notes in your presence—I have written many names on the backs of notes; you are aware of that—I had done so frequently with Wagner, before I became acquainted with you, while you were at Holyhead—I once took apartments in Beaumont-street, High-street, in the early part of 1858, I think; I hardly know in what month—I cannot recollect in what name—it was Wagner's suggestion that I should take apartments there, for the purpose of sending a man from that house with a forged cheque—the forgery was committed then by Kerp—from 1857, there have been con<lb></lb>stantly things of that sort done, before I knew you—I took the apartments for the purpose of carrying out a forgery that had been committed—I did not frequent Doctor's Commons whilst living there—the arrangement with</p>

               <p>Wagner in taking those apartments was, that Wagner was to send a ticket-porter to me, at that house in Beaumont-street, with a letter, in which there should he a forged cheque, and I was to send the ticket-porter with the forged cheque to the bankers—I did send it—I did not pretend that I had received it from Dr. Lushington—I believe the man that gave the letter to the ticket-porter in Doctor's Commons told him that it was from Dr. Lush<lb></lb>ington; and the man came to me as if he had brought the letter from Dr. Lushington—Wagner told me he had arranged it in that manner; that the porter was to fancy he brought it from Dr. Lushington, and he would the more readily go with the cheque—we were not successful in that forgery—I don't thing you knew me then; I don't think you were in London at the time—you had nothing to do with that—that forgery was upon the branch Bank of England, in Saville-row—I believe I have been concerned with Wagner in two other forgeries on the same bank—I think one was a cheque for 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I won't swear positively that those were the amounts, but somewhere about that—you had nothing to do with those—I never lived in Manchester-street, or the neighbourhood of Man<lb></lb>chester-square—I never took apartments there—I put the name of "White-head, Manchester-street, Manchester-square" on the back of a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which had been obtained through one of Wagner's forgeries that has not been mentioned which I was connected with—I think the amount of that forgery was 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe it was within the last twelve months—it was not since I have known you—I know a jeweller of the name of Hawley; at least, I don't know him personally, I know there is such a man—I never com<lb></lb>mitted a forgery upon him; I was connected with it—that was the one for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to which I have alluded—I know Mr. Lewin, of Southampton-street—I never forged upon him—I gave Wagner some information with regard to Mr. Lewin; and Wagner, without my knowledge, committed a forgery, and sent it to the bank—I knew nothing at all about it until it was all over—I know that Wagner committed it, simply by his coming to my house at Battersea, and telling me that the thing had been done; that the money had been obtained, but that the man, in going to the Bank of England, had foolishly lost the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I supplied the information upon that forgery—of course it was understood between Wagner and myself that I was to have part of everything I had to do with—I don't recollect the date of that, I dare say Mr. Mullens knows—it is within the last two years; before I knew you—I had an uncle of the name of Whitehead—I was in his employ for eleven years—I left him in 1840—he had property nearly all over London—he had some low houses in a court at Westminster, that you have heard me speak about—I collected all his rents at the time I was with him—a man swindled him out of the rent of those houses, and out of the houses themselves, and pulled them down, and sold the materials—it is twenty years ago—my uncle built the houses up again—I was not concerned in that transaction in any shape—my uncle used to bank with Cocks and Biddulph—he banked there these forty years—I did not, while in his employ, forge, or attempt to forge, upon him—there was one attempt; some man committed a forgery upon him for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and got the money—that was before I went to my uncle; in fact, it must have been when I was a boy, not fifteen—since I left him, I have been concerned, with you, in attempt<lb></lb>ing to forge upon him—you recollect the amount better than I do—the cheque was written in your office—I believe it was for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the cheque was taken out of your book for the purpose—I have never heard that my uncle has bought up one or more forged Bank of England notes, that it was stated I</p>

               <p>Conduit street, and it was to have been done—Wagner and I had a quarrel about it—Wagner fancied that he was entitled to more than he ought to have had, and he went to this friend of mine in Conduit-street, and pre<lb></lb>vented the bill being done; and the bill was then given back to Captain Cockburn, by my friend in Conduit-street, by my consent—I never kept or dishonestly appropriated the proceeds of a bill of exchange—I have kept my commission upon all bills that I have had to do with—I never kept the whole amount—I never stole a watch while I was in the House of Detention, in the name of William Chambers—I was called down in mistake for a George Chambers who was there for stealing a watch—I mentioned that fact to Miss Fairbairn, and, I suppose, she conveyed the information to Wagner, which enables you to ask me the question—I know a man named Morton—I never stole a watch from Mrs. Morton while Morton was in custody—I swear that—I never obtained goods by false pretences, and never was concerned in doing so with Van Gelder, Wagner, or anybody—I have a wife and seven children—I never communicated to my wife the fact that I had been committing forgeries; she never knew anything at all about it; most distinctly not—I know that Funnell, the officer, has stated, that when I was apprehended I said to my wife, "These men are taking me into cus<lb></lb>tody for forgery," and that my wife then said, "I thought you had left off forgery;" instead of which, what she said was, "Surely you are not in cus<lb></lb>tody for forgery"—Funnell has made a mistake, I don't suppose he meant it—one of my children is a little lame; he is 16—he is apprenticed to a wood-engraver—he has hardly had time to be clever yet; he has only been a few months at it—he is clever for the time he has been at it—I swear most distinctly that I never employed that son in the attempt to engrave or sink a die or stamp; but allow me to explain; you drew on a piece of wood a penny stamp, and hearing that my son was an engraver you said, "I think you might get your son to engrave this," and at the request of Wagner and yourself I consented to ask him to do it, but upon reflection I did not ask him—I put the thing in my pocket, and put it behind the fire—it is a great consideration with me to be restored to my wife and family—I have given my evidence both in the hope to receive a mitigation of my sentence, and from a motive of justice, and for the reason I explained yes<lb></lb>terday, that I understood from Miss Fairbairn, at least, from a conversation I had with her, I felt convinced that Wagner was going to turn evidence against me, if he could, and I made up my mind to turn evidence against him—I am not aware of one penny having been given to any member of my family by any person connected with this prosecution; neither do I believe a penny has been given—I have not stated to my fellow prisoners in the gaol that I expected to get twelve months, and afterwards to be set up in business—Mr. Humphreys appeared for me at my examination at the police-court—I instructed him to tell the magistrate that I had a satisfac<lb></lb>tory answer to make to every charge that might be brought against me—since my apprehension I have never sent messages to you demanding money—I have haft messages from you, at the House of Detention, brought by Miss Fairbairn—I saw you when you came back from Drummond's, and you said you had got the money for the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque; I saw you start from York-buildings with the cheque, and I remained there till you came back—I did not see you enter Drummond's bank, nor did I see you go to Mr. Smart's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bill-broker, and live at 44, Southampton-build<lb></lb>ings; I have seen you on matters of business—you have introduced business to me, and have on several occasions solicited to have transactions with me in business—I always found you very anxious to do business with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I have introduced that business to you which you found acceptable, and which you have done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been swindled out of my money, and you have tried to swindle me out of more—as you have called me, I will refresh your memory—you introduced Mr. Landseer to me, a nephew of the great artist; he sent a letter to you entreating forbearance, and enclosing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and you came to my office next morning in your ordinary swagger<lb></lb>ing way, with a cigar in your mouth, and took your seat on a desk in the most familiar manner, and said, "Sir, I have got a pound for you"—I refused to take it; and it was only because I held language of a very threat<lb></lb>ening nature that you felt so ashamed, that you were obliged to restore the money—you told me, at first, that I had better take the pound, or you would advise him to go through the Insolvent Court, and avoid payment altogether—I discounted a bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it; I forget for how long a period, most likely it was a three months bill—you were the agent for the gentleman—I would not entertain it till you brought Mr. Landseer—I would not treat with you at all—I never liked your appearance—you have called me here under subpoena, and I have been waiting here lour days; it is the greatest injury to me, and you have made me no compensation.</p>

               <p>When Mrs. Lion had seen her take the lace, did she bring her into the shop? - No; the woman was in the shop; Mrs. Lion told me she had taken a card of lace; I turned her cloak over her shoulder, and took it from her.</p>
               <p>How much did you take from her? - That piece she had under her arm; then I went after her into the street, about forty yards, and brought her back again into the shop, and when I brought her back I took her into the back room, and I searched her pocket, and there was another piece in her pocket, besides what she had bought.</p>
               <p>Did you find what she had bought also in her pocket? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>How much might they contain? - About sixty or seventy yards.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I suppose you live with Mr. Simpson? - Yes, Sir; I was the person that served her with the two yards of lace, a narrow edging about eight-pence a yard; it was between six and seven in the evening, there were no other customers in the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050070"></xptr>How long might she stay in the shop? - Not more than a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Were there any other lace laying about at the time? - There was a whole book of lace, that I was shewing her of the black edging.</p>
               <p>While you were shewing her this black lace was you called to any other customers to go away from her? - I did not leave her a moment.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take any thing? - No, Sir; I did not.</p>
               <p>Was that lace in your master's shop? - (the lace produced in court.) Yes; I am certain it is the lace; I saw one card taken from under her cloak, and the second time she was brought in, I saw the other taken out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>(The Prosecutor deposes to the lace being his that was produced, that there were his marks upon them.)</p>
               <p>Are those the very same pieces you took from the prisoner? - The very same.</p>
               <p>Mrs. LION sworn.</p>
               <p>Upon the 13th of November I was standing up from the rain, about six in the evening, at Mr. Pritchett's door, there was a woman in the shop I saw put a piece of lace under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Were there candles in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the prisoner? - Yes; I saw her put one of the cards of lace under her cloak; I saw Mr. Pritchett upon the other side of the shop, I went immediately and acquainted him with it; the young woman that was serving her was behind the counter, and the woman set upon a seat by her, and the box of lace was before her; I went in and told Mr. Pritchett, and he went immediately to the woman and found the piece of lace under her cloak that I mentioned; Mr. Pritchett took the lace from her, and pushed her out of the shop, and then some time after the girl said, perhaps she might have some more about her, he went and fetched her in again, and brought her into the parlour, and found the other piece in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Was you by then? - Yes; I was by at the same time.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord, the witness Lion has been several times convicted of the crime I am charged with; she appeared against the coiner; her husband, or man she cohabited with is in Clerkenwell Bridewell; I met her as I was coming along, she called me by the name of Goodiff, said she knew one Mr. Pritchett, a very easy man; she gave me two shillings, bid me go into the shop, and said I could get a trifle of money to go into the hospital with; I told her I would have n othing to do with it; I went from her, and went into the sign of the Bull and Pound, and had a pennyworth of beer there; I went and bought two yards of lace, and never stole any.</p>
               <p>To Lion. Is this true this woman says? - Ask Mr. Pritchett; she never said I put her upon it there.</p>
               <p>Pritchett. I don't know that she did.</p>

            . Do you know any thing of it? - She mentioned it before the justice, that if she had sold the lace at five farthings a yard she never would have said any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner is indicted for privately stealing in the shop of Mr. Pritchett, about ninety yards of black lace, value twenty shillings. Stealing privately in a shop to the value of five shillings is a capital felony, but you can't convict her of stealing privately, because she was detected by the witness Lion, and therefore does not come within the words of the act; all you can do, if you find her guilty, is to find her guilty of the felony only.</p>

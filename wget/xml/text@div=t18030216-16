               <p>SOLOMON JACOBS sworn. - I am a dealer in oils and pickles: About a fortnight last Friday, I met Mrs. Davis, the prisoner, by the Mansion-house; the asked me if I would do her a favour; she said, she had a few nutmegs by her, if I would fell them for her; I said, if she would bring them, I would, and asked her what I might take for them; she said, six shillings. When I had been home about a quarter of an hour, a young woman brought the nutmegs, and said, Mrs. Davis had sent them to me to fell; I don't know who the young woman was, I had not seen her before. I went to Mrs. Davis, who keeps a chandler's shop, the corner of Wentworth street, and asked her if the nutmegs would suit her; she said, no, there were too many for her; a young woman in the shop said, if I would go to Mr. Worms, he would buy them; accordingly I went to Mr. Worms, and asked him to buy them; he asked the price, and I told him, six shillings; he said, they were his, he had been robbed of them; I told him, I would fetch the woman I had them of; he said, no, he would send for an officer, and give charge of me; in the mean time, I went away and fetched Mrs. Davis; I told her the man said he had lost some nutmegs, and desired her to go and satisfy him that I had them of her; she went immediately with me, and when we came, there was an officer in the shop.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN TROTT sworn. - I am an officer: On the 28th of January, I apprehended the prisoner and the last witness; just as I got to Mr. Worms, he was leading her by the arm down the street, she was crying; I took her into the back-room, and searched her, and found three handkerchiefs and a nutmeg upon her; she said, she kept that for her own use; she said, the last witness agreed to give her six shillings for the nutmegs, but not having the money, went to get it; she said, a boy gave them to her, but would give no account who the boy was; she was committed for examination; when she came up again, Worms found a nutmeg with a pin in it, he said, he knew that nutmeg.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Salisbury-street, Lisson-grove. On Satur<lb></lb>day, 2nd Feb., I gave my wife, between ten and eleven o'clock in the fore-noon, three half-crowns, seven shillings, twenty-three sixpences, twelve groats, and three shillings and three-halfpence in copper; the prisoner was in the room—I then left home.</p>

                  </hi>. On 2nd Feb. my husband gave me this money—I put the silver in a paper, and put that and the halfpence in a little basket—I put the basket in a box—I locked the box, and put the key into my pocket about eleven o'clock—the prisoner was present, and saw what I did—she had dinner with me, and remained with me till about four, when I went out, and asked her to take care of my three children while I was gone—I left the box between the cupboard and the sofa—I came back in about quarter of an hour—the prisoner was gone, and I saw two pieces of wood which had been broken off the top of the box—the box was still locked, and the key was in my pocket, but the hole at top was large enough to put both my hands in—I turned over one or two things, and found the money was gone—I did not see the prisoner again till 8th of Feb.—I had a shawl in the room, and when I was going out I had a very dirty dress on; the prisoner had a black shawl there, and she said if I put on her shawl my dress would not look so bad, as mine was a light shawl—I put on her shawl, and threw mine on the bedstead—it was worth about six shillings; hers was not worth more than sixpence—when I came back the shawl was gone—the prisoner had been with me eight days; she was in distress, and I gave her such as I had.</p>

On 8th Feb., I took the prisoner at the Great Western Railway—I told her it was for what she had done at Lisson-grove—she said she had done nothing there—as we went to the station, she said she knew what I took her for, but she did not care; perhaps other persons would take better care of her than she did herself—when at the station, she said she had the shawl, but the money she knew nothing about.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the house, 57, Salisbury-street, where the prosecutor and his wife live. I remember Mrs. Thomas going out on 2nd Feb., and shortly after she was gone, the prisoner came and asked me which way Mrs. Thomas had gone—I said she had turned to the right—the prisoner went out and turned to the left—she had Mrs. Thomas's shawl on.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT MACDONALD</hi>. I now live in Bedford-square, Commercial-road. In April and May last I was carrying on business as a tobacconist in Lower Chapman-street, St. George's—the prisoner was in my service as a traveller from about the end of Dec.—it was his duty to go about and obtain orders for me—he was to be paid so much commission for the weight of thft goods furnished, and if he sold above the price I charged, he got that—if he re<lb></lb>ceived</p>

               <p>any money in town, he ought to pay it the same night, and if in the country, the first time he came to town—my attention has been called to Mr. Coulthorp's account—the prisoner never accounted to me for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., re<lb></lb>ceived from Mr. Coulthorp, on the 21st of April, nor for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid by Mr. Hartican on the 26th of April, or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Gates, on the 23rd of May—he continued in my service till the 23rd of May—he gave no notice of leaving—in consequence of discoveries 1 made, I applied for a warrant—on the 23rd of Dec. I was walking with a friend, named Cross, in Bishop'sgate-street, and met the prisoner—I said, "I want you"—he said, "For God's take, Mr. Macdonald, don't give me in charge, I will meet you any where to<lb></lb>morrow, and will pay you all the money 1 have robbed you of"—I said I would not put any faith in his promises—he walked to the Mansion-house, and I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Oxford market. Hobbs was my potman. On Saturday night, 26th Oct., I saw my wife mark eighteen pence, and put them into the till in the bar—I was called next morning at twenty minutes past six o'clock, examined the till, and it was quite safe—about twenty minutes or half-past seven I missed six penny pieces—Smith and Hester lodged in the house—this key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not mine—I be<lb></lb>lieve the cigars are mine—these six peace are some of those that were in the till.</p>

On 27th Oct., about twenty minutes past six o'clock, I went with Smith to these premises, and was let in by Mr. Minchin—we hid ourselves in a little room looking into the private bar, from where we had a view of the staircase—I saw the three prisoners come down-stairs; Hobbs went into the bar, and Hester said something to him—he drew a pot of ale and took it towards where Hester was—I could not see Hester—we heard the bar-door unlocked by a key, but we had not a view of the door—I heard Hester say something to Hobbs, and Hobbs said, "What the b——hell more would you have"—I saw Hobbs put something into his pocket which appeared to be screws of tobacco—he then went to another part of the bar, and I heard something like copper money rattle—he then went towards the tap-room—we fol<lb></lb>lowed him (Hester was there before)—I took hold of Hobbs, and Smith took out of his pocket a bottle of ginger-beer, and I took six screws of tobacco, and twelve pence, six of which were marked—seeing one of the pieces was marked, he fell down as if shot, and laid perhaps a minute—I afterwards searched his box, and found two other screws of tobacco, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel Henry Strachan, a bookbinder, in Tyler's-court, Carnaby-market. On the 1st of August, I was sitting in the parlour adjoining the shop—the prisoner Connor came in and asked if I had a Roman Catholic Prayer-book I said I had not got one to give her—she advanced into the shop further, and then told me any other book would do—I asked her if she meant a Protestant Prayer-book—she said that would do—she then came into the parlour, I told her to walk out—she I did not understand her, that she had borrowed a box of linen of a lady and had lost the book, and wanted another—I said I had none to give her—she asked if she should call next day—I told her not to trouble herself to call, for I had none for her—she then turned round, swept her hand across the table in the room and went out—the moment she was gone out I missed from the table a black silk dress—I could not leave the shop, and rang the bell for my husband to come down and go after her: she</p>

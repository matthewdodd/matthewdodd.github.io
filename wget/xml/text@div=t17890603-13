               <p>Court. It was difficult for the prisoner to put his hand in your pocket? - I had a pair of stocking breeches on, but how he got in his hand I cannot tell, the prisoner is the man, I tried to catch at him; I caught him by the shoulder, he never was out of my hand, till I delivered him to the officer Tring.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe you saw the man searched? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No money was found upon him? - No.</p>
               <p>It was the 15th of April, there was a great many people going to the play, I take it for granted? - Yes, I believe there was.</p>
               <p>This was in the dark passage of the pit? - In the pit passage.</p>
               <p>This man was certainly near you? - He was close to me, he touched me all the time.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you hear the money drop? - I felt it drop upon the top of my shoe.</p>

               <p>JOHN HOIROYD sworn.</p>
               <p>I was accompanying Mr. Woodall the prosecutor, into Drury lane theatre, on Wednesday the 15th of April; at the avenue leading to the pit, where there was a great croud just at that moment he told me he had his pocket picked, and I saw the prisoner there, and the prosecutor had his hand on his shoulder; the prisoner did not absolutely deny it; but wondered we should think of taking him, and endeavoured to get away; just then I heard money drop on the stairs, it was impossible to pick up the money on account of the great croud; this was at the top of the stairs, it might be on the first or second stair that leads to the pit door; then after some scuffling and endeavouring to get away, the prosecutor gave him to the constable in my presence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

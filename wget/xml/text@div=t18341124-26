                  </hi>. I am a sailor. On Wednesday, the 22nd of October, the prisoner came to my place, in Angel-gardens, Ratcliff-highway—she lived in the street, but I had not seen her for two months—I went up stairs—she kept calling me, and following me up stairs into my room—she sat down by the fire, and said she had no place to sleep; would I let her sleep there, as she had been walking three nights—I said I would—she pulled off her clothes and got into my bed, and after smoking my pipe, I turned in along-side of her—she slept till morning, and then I said I wanted to go out—she said she did not want to be seen coming out of my place, and asked me to lock her in—I said, "No; put on your clothes, and go out"—it began to rain, and was very cold—I did not go out—we breakfasted together—then she asked if I would let her wash her apron—I said I would—I went to lie down on the bed, and by this time it began to get late at night; she got herself clean, and walked about the house, and then said she was going out a bit, and would soon be back—this was about six o'clock—she came in half an hour, and went about the house backwards and forwards—my shoes hung up over my bed—she sat by the fire-side, and then got up—I said, "Cannot you sit down?"—she said, "No; I am going out a bit"—she went out; whether she went down stairs I could not tell, but she came into the room quite quiet—I saw her sitting on my bed—I had not heard her come—she began to <hi rend="italic">trot</hi> About the house again—whether she took the shoes then, I cannot say—she said again, "I am going out again;" and then she must have taken the shoes with her—nobody could have taken them except her—I had seen them safe when she was in the room, and after she went out they were gone—I found them in pawn at Falkard's, but he is not here now.</p>

On the morning of the 25th of October, the prisoner was given into my custody by the prosecutor—I asked her how she came to take the shoes—she said distress had driven her to it—I asked what she did with them—she said she pawned one pair and sold the other; and after naming, two or three pawnbrokers to her she said they were at Falkard's.</p>

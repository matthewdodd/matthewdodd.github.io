                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, S</hi> 289). I was on duty in High-street, Camden-town on 2d December last, about a quarter to 5 in the after noon, I was standing at the corner of Park-street and High-street—an old lady was in front of me—I saw a Hansom cab coming down Park-street at a terrific pace; I should say twelve miles an hour—I cannot say whether the prisoner was the driver—the old lady was knocked down by the cab, and the wheel passed over her—after she was knocked down the cabman whipped the horse, and drove off at a faster pace—I ran after the cab, the horse was galloping—when I got back the old lady was in a chemist's shop—'I had her removed to the University Hospital, where she afterwards died—I then went to the station and reported the accident, and described the driver of the cab as wearing a dark <hi rend="italic">billycock</hi> hat, and I also described the horse as a dark grey—I went to the stables of Mr. Bailey in Henrietta-mews, Brunswick-square, and I identified the horse that was in the cab—I was informed that the driver had changed horses about half-past 5 o'clock—I remained at the stables until 4 o'clock in the morning, but he did not return—another man brought the cab home—I went the next day, and the prisoner did not make his appearance—I was about three or four yards from the old lady when she was standing on the pavement.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it very crowded where the accident occurred? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I cannot recognise the prisoner as the man who drove the cab, because it was dark, and I did not see his face—the old lady was about six yards from the pavement when she was knocked down—an omnibus man picked her up—I did not see him do so, as I was running after the cab.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am house-surgeon at the University College Hospital—I was on duty when the deceased was brought in, a few minutes to 5 on the 2nd of December—she was quite insensible—there was blood on the front of her dress—I found some of her ribs broken on the right side and on the left: the left leg was smashed—she died shortly afterwards—I made a post-mortem examination, and found that the base of the skull and the collar bone were fractured—those injuries were the cause of her death—the fracture at the base of the skull was in itself enough to cause death.</p>

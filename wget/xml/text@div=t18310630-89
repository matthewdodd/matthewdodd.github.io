            . I live with my uncle, Mr. Archer, in Banner-street. I was in Featherstone-street on the 7th of May, and saw the prisoner and a man come out of the Green Man - she had a basket of linen, and he asked if he should carry it; she said, "No, I can carry it" - he put it on her head, and said, "What a heavy load!" the prisoner saw me, and I knew her - they then went on.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Clarke, in Goswell-road. I delivered the prisoner this linen on Monday, the 2nd of May, to go to Mrs. Gallin's to be washed and brought home clean on the Saturday, but it never came; the prisoner generally brought it in the afternoon - about five o'clock that Saturday she came crying very much, and said she did not know what she should do, she thought she should go out of her mind, as she had lost the linen; I asked how she came to lose it - she said she met a man, named William Ingley, whom she knew by sight, and he had another man with him - that they asked her to go to a public-house, where they had something to drink; that she then went and delivered one bundle of linen - that she then went into another house, at the corner of Tabernacle-walk, and while she was drinking there with the man she knew by sight, the other man went off with the things; she said the man asked where she was going, and she said to Goswell-street - he said he was going to Islington, and he would carry them for her, and then he went off with them; she has brought home the linen safe before.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH GALLIN. This linen was delivered to me to wash, and I am answerable for it; I employed the prisoner to carry it home - it was a light bundle.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and have inquired at the house she says they went to - I find William Ingley has used the house, but he is now out of the way; I inquired if the prisoner had been seen there with two men, but I cannot learn.</p>

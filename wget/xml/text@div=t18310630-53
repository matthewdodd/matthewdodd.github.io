On the 14th of June I left my bar, and went into the back-room; I then saw the prisoner going out at the door - I went and looked at the till, and missed a bowl with some silver in it; I know it had contained 4s., and I think more - John Shaw ran after the prisoner, and brought him back; my husband searched the prisoner, and found 6s. on him - I have not seen the bowl since; the till is behind the counter -I had seen it safe a very few minutes before, and I think there was not time for any one else to have gone in; there was another boy, but I did not see him.</p>

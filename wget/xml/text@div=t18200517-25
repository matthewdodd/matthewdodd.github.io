            . I am a butcher, and live in Ray-street, Clerkenwell. I have known the prisoner for years, he came to me on Thursday, the 4th of May, and was with me half an hour. He dined with me, and asked me if I would let him kill some sheep at my house? I said I would, and I could help him. He said a friend was going to send him some from the country to make the best of them, and he was going down to see about them. Next morning, at three o'clock, before day-light, he came to my house again and knocked me up. I found him standing at the door with nine sheep, and helped him to get them in - he then went home to bed, and I went to bed. He returned about nine o'clock, and then we killed the whole nine sheep - seven were sent to Newgate-market, and two I had myself, the carcases fetched 18 l. 7 s. I sold them at the market and paid it to the prisoner. I gave him a 5 l. and thirteen 1 l. notes. The sheep were marked with a cross on the rump (a black mark), I should think it was a pitch mark, and a little stroke underneath. We sent the skins to Mr. Griffin, the salesman. The prisoner bore a good character.</p>

            . I keep the Twelve Bells, Bride-lane, Fleet-street, the prisoner lodged at my house for five weeks. He left at different times to go after situations, and he said he was going to East Sheen. I do not know where he was on the Monday before he was apprehended. On the 8th of May, he brought me 20 l. and wished me to take care of it for an hour, and said he had received it at Newgate-market for meat - there was one or two 5 l. notes, and the rest 1 l. notes. About four o'clock that afternoon, he asked me for it, and I gave it to him.</p>

             re-examined. My sheep were marked with a pitched cross on the rump, and a little stroke underneath. I had had them in my field for a week, and observed the mark. The prisoner was in the habit of coming to my house to see my maid-servant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday, the 1st of May, a person came to the Twelve Bells, and asked for a person named Cumber, I said I was the person. He asked if I knew Stiles, I said</p>
               <p>"what Stiles?"</p>
               <p>"Why your father-in-law that is to be, said he." I said I knew there was such a person, he then said he was recommended by him to me to kill a few sheep, and dispose of them as I thought best, as he was embarrassed, and he must not be seen to do them away himself. Having been out of employ sometime, I said I had no objection, and asked what day they would be sent - he said about Thursday next. I did not see him again till Thursday morning, when he came to me at the end of Bride-lane, and said the sheep would come on the following morning, and if I met him at Kensington turnpike, or Hyde-park, I should see him there, and settle whether I should go all the way, or meet him. I met him by Hyde-park-gate, walked on towards Hamersmith, and he agreed I should meet his son with the sheep about Kensington - we went to a public-house, and had some rum and water, went to Astley's theatre, and after leaving there we went on to Kensington, and met the sheep and his son, whom he called George, with them. After he got through the gate I had stopped behind for an occasion, and when I came up, he said his son had sold three at Brentford, or there would be twelve for me to kill. When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170011"></xptr>we got to Piccadilly we found an obstruction, and then they drove them round; and his son met me and a person named Williams at Hatton-garden - there he parted. His son and I went down nearly to Cox's, then his son left, and I took the sheep into Cox's. I went home, returned at nine o'clock and killed the sheep. The skins were placed out in the street, and after some time, I went home to Bride-lane, and met him. He asked when I should take the money, I said I did not exactly know then when I should be paid for the skins, but the fat would be paid for in the afternoon. I went to Cox and told him what passed. We took the fat, I got 1 l. 11 s. for it, and I met him afterwards and gave it to him. He said he should call round and sell the sheep. I remained at Cox's all the afternoon, expecting him to call; and as he did not come, Cox and me, went down to my lodgings and waited there a few minutes - as he did not come Cox went home. A few minutes, after he came to the door to me, I gave him the money for the fat. He said he had not time to call round to see the sheep, this was Friday night. On Saturday morning, I received a note from him, to know when he could have the money, saying, he expected I should get it ready by Tuesday. I told Cox, and shewed him the note. Cox said, if he had known it he could have had it before. After my going home, and coming from Bride-lane, I met the man again and told him he would have the money on Tuesday. On Saturday, I received another note, saying, that instead of Tuesday, he should send his son to meet me at the Rodney public-house to take the money. I received the money, went and put it into my landlord's hands; having lost 48 l. three weeks before - I was afraid to keep it myself. About four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to meet the man at the Rodney, and he was not there. I met him at Westminster-bridge, returned with him to the Rodney, and waited there an hour. I wanted to leave the money with the landlady till he came, she said she did not wish to have any thing to do with it. I met him on Westminster-bridge and gave him the money, he asked for the letters I received, and I gave them to him. I am unprepared for trial or I could have got the landlady of the Rodney to prove I offered to leave the notes with her.</p>

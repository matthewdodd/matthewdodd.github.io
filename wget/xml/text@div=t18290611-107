On the 8th of May I went to bed about eight or nine o'clock and my house was all fast then - I was ill, and sat up in bed about three o'clock in the morning; it was getting day-light - I heard a great noise at the barn-door, listened, and presently heard the lip go down - I live quite alone; I heard somebody on the top of the oven, and then I heard them breaking the oven door open - they then came to an empty room next to my chamber, and there they pushed twice against the chamber door, which was locked, and the third time the staple flew out, and in they came two by two - there were four of them; I was sitting up in bed, and Hastings, when he saw me, drew back - I knew him before - he had carried my rolls about for a long time; I have known him all his life; then Slater came in - I have known him a long time, his friends live in London - but he knew my house, and was in it the day before; I did not know the other two persons - Slater caught hold of me by the throat, held me down, and said, "Lay there, or it will be the worse for you;" he then said, "Where is your money?" I told him I had got none; he said he knew I had - (I had none in the house) - he then said, "Where is your watch?" I told him it was at Hounslow, I had left it at the watch-maker's; he then asked where my breeches were - I told him under the pillow; they took my breeches from under the pillow and searched them, but there was no money in them; he then took the breeches, threw them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110050"></xptr>down in the room, and went to a corner cupboard, and said,"What is here?" I said there was nothing but a few old receipts which were of no use - he searched all the crockery, there was no money there; he then came to my chest - there has been no lock to that chest ever since I was robbed before; he opened it, and took up a patched coverlid, looked at it, and threw it down - then he took up a plain sheet, he looked at that, and threw it down; he then took and pulled four little drawers out of the chest - I said,"There is nothing there but old receipts;" after they had looked at the other end of the chest, they took out a pair of white cotton stockings, and threw them on the landing-place to the other three; they came in with a candle burning, but it was as light as day - then he took out a clean flowered waistcoat, and threw that to the other three, who stood against another room on the landing-place; I did not see him take any thing more: he then came, caught me by the throat again, and said I should show him where my money was - he pulled me out of bed - he said, "Follow me;" I followed him half way down stairs - the other three were down stairs then; I heard them say, "Don't let Spurling come down here;" Slater hallooed then, and said,"Don't you come down here or it will be the worse for you - go back;" I then went back into my room; I saw them leave the premises by the barn-door - I am sure the prisoners are two of them, for I saw them come in; I was sober - I had only drank a little beer; they remained in the house ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before they left. I at one time used to keep money in the house, sometimes 100l. - Hastings knew that; I was going to have them taken directly, but I took the opinion of a gentleman, who advised me to let it rest; Hastings came, blowed me up, and said he would know my liver out; the patrols took him up last Friday week - when I got up I found my shoes gone as well as the other things; I got up directly they went away, and shut the barn door - I did not go before the Justice of the Peace, as Mr. Sherbon advised me to let it rest - but I told my daughter of it; I was not before the Justice till Friday week - Hastings was in custody then; he lives at Hanworth - Slater was in custody last Tuesday; I spoke positively to their being the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.You have never been charged with doing any thing yourself? A. No; I knew Slater, but had not seen him lately, till he came into the house and sat down - there was no disguise about them.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did he not come to your house to pay you a visit, and drink with you? A. He came to the door next day, and said will you be any thing towards beer; I said No. I had no money - he said I should have some, and fetched a pot; I tasted it once - his wife was with him; I did not show them over my house - I knew him very well, and should have taken him, but I was advised to let it rest, for they would burst themselves, and bring all the blackguards in the world to swear against me; I did not take him up for a month, as Mr. Sherbon, who is the biggest man in the place, said let it rest - when Slater came next day, I did not ask where he lived in London, but I heard as he had told Mrs. Prior; I told him not to send for the beer - he might have stopped there ten minutes: it was about ten or eleven o'clock; I did not charge him with robbing me, or go before a Magistrate - Slater had also been visiting me the day before the robbery, and drank with me, but I did not know where he slept at Bedfont; the constable lives about half a mile from me - I knew Hastings lived at Hanworth; I am not in the habit of drinking, nor have I been wrong in my head - I have never found my property; I am seventy-six years old - Slater might have told me where he lived in London, but I took no account of it, if he did; my son found him out.</p>

               <p>THOMAS FORD. I am gaoler of Bow-street office. On Friday, the 5th of June, Hastings was brought to the office in custody on this charge; he was remanded, and when he came out I locked him up: in consequence of information I went and took Slater, at his own house, No. 10, Lambeth-marsh; it was a boot and shoemaker's shop - I understand he lived there; he was at work in the shop - I told him I took him for a burglary at Bedfont, at Spurling's house; he said he knew nothing about it - he came very quietly with me; I have known him these two years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What is he? A. A shoemaker; Spurling's son told me where I should find him.</p>
               <p>HASTINGS' Defence. I work at Hanworth. About three o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th of May a man came from Bedfont, and said there was a man from London whom I had not seen for fourteen years, and he wished to see all his friends before he left - I went to the Black Dog public-house, where Slater was and was with him till six; I went from there to the Duke's Head public-house, left about half-past nine, and got home as the clock struck eleven, and can prove I was at home till six in the morning.</p>
               <p>SLATER's Defence. I was brought up at Bedfont - I came to town at sixteen years old, and went down there when I was twenty-nine, to see my friends; the first person I saw was Spurling - I sent for a pot of beer, and sat drinking and talking with him; he made me promise to call next morning before I went away - I went to Smith's and slept at his house; he called me next morning - I got up and called on Spurling again - we had two pots of beer, and talked together a long time; he gave me the address of his daughter, who lived in town.</p>
               <p>JANE PAINTER. I live at Isleworth. My husband is a horse-keeper - I first saw Hastings at the Bell public-house, kept by Smith; it was on the 7th of May - I went there with his wife; he was lying by the fire quite tipsy - we went with him to Hanworth, where he lives, and got there at twelve o'clock at night; it is about four miles from Hanworth - it was Bedfont fair time - it was on the 7th, the Thursday of the fair; I had been to the fair - I do not know what month it was; it was January - I am sure of that.</p>

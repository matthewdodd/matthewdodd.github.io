                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 132.) On the 12th of August I was on duty at Paddington wharf—at half-past two o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing I heard footsteps, and went to the boat where the prisoner was—I asked if he belonged to the boat—he said, "Yes," and he was going at three o'clock—I said I should be back again by three, I should not leave the gate open—I went and <hi rend="italic">slammed</hi> the gate to, but remained inside—I saw him go to Mr. Rutty's premises, and take one truss of straw, take it into the boat, and come to the stable again—I saw another man following him—I went, and asked if he was allowed to take straw in the boat—he said "No"—I said, "You have taken one truss, I think"—I went to Mr. Richardson, who went to the barge with me, and found two trusses of straw on board—I do not know the other man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of John Ratty, a timber-merchant. The prisoner was his boatman—I did not allow him to take straw out of his stable—he had no right to take it—he took the boats to Cowley, and brought bricks from there, but he had nothing to do with the straw in the stable—it was on my master's wharf that the policeman saw him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do not you know that before he acknowledged any thing, Mr. Cross said he would forgive him if he would acknowledge it? A. No, I do not - Mr. Cross was not at the Police-office.</p>

            . I searched the prisoner's box - I found some gloves with the thumbs and fingers cut off, and one pair complete; the prisoner said he had cut the fingers off to make cots for his fingers - I found this night-cap in his box; he said he took them from the shop - I found this handkerchief and these other gloves at his mother's; I found on the prisoner this purse, a sovereign, five half-crowns, three shillings, a ring, a seal, and a silver franc: in answer to Mr. Cross' question, the prisoner said, "I will tell you as near as I can recollect - I first commenced with taking a shilling from the desk, afterwards a half-crown, and then 5s. - on two occasions I took a sovereign, and once a half-sovereign;" he was asked how he spent the money - he said he hired a phaeton and a pair of ponies, and drove some mantua-maker's daughter about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Mr. Cross say to him, "I know you have been robbing me - tell me what you have done, and when you commenced, and I will forgive you?" A. Not exactly that; he said, "Now, young man, mind what I am going to say - we have been missing different sums of money from the desk, and we are aware of a great deal more than you think; we have found some marked money which was taken from a young man's pocket - did you take it?" he then said what I have stated; I do not recollect Newgate being mentioned - I think if it had I should have recollected it.</p>

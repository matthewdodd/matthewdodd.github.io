                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, of 26, Gresham Street, in partnership with Thomas Westall; the style of our firm is Thomas Westall, Proctor, and Co.—the prisoner was a customer of ours—I have seen him accept bills—I produce a bill of exchange for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated the 5th of February, 1866, and one for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated the 1st of March, 1866—I know the defendant's handwriting; I have seen him write—the signature, "Charles Yarwood," to this affidavit, is his writing, also the acceptances to the two bills of exchange; they were drawn by myself in the name of the firm, Thomas Westall, Proctor, and Co.—the 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill fell due on the 8th of June; a day or two before it was due the defendant called and said he should be unable to meet the bill, but he would do what he could towards it, and he paid 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards it on the day it became due, with a notice that the bill was lying due at the banker's—he was at that time indebted to us beyond the bills, I can't say the exact amount—the bills had been given for the purpose of meeting an account—the bill for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. became due on the 4th July—I believe the defendant came the morning before it was due and told me he was in difficulty, that one of his creditors was pressing him, and he placed himself in our hands as his largest creditor—he paid us 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, he also paid us another amount for the creditor who was pressing him—I believe the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was accepted at his own house—the name of our firm on the warehouse door is the same as the bills are drawn in, "Thomas Westall, Proctor, and Co."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, of 30, King Street, Cheap<lb></lb>side—I know the defendant and have seen him write—comparing the signature to these two bills of exchange with one I saw him accept, I believe it to be his—he called on me on the 2nd of July, as he said, to ask a favour; it was to renew a bill which was coming due on the 4th of July—I asked him some questions relative to his position, the reason he wanted a renewal—he told me that a creditor was pressing him, that Mr. Westall had taken the matter in hand and was treating him very kindly by negotiating with the said creditor, and upon the faith of what he told me of his position, that he could pay off everybody, if he had time, I renewed the bill, or a portion of it, adding an open account which forms this bill; it was drawn by my partner, and I saw him accept it on our counter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know that at the time he swore the affidavit he had his protection from the Bankruptcy Court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I knew nothing about it—I knew he was afterwards a bankrupt—I think it might have been three weeks after—there was a composition of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound offered, which the creditors repudiated, and I think he then petitioned the Court himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Nash, a solicitor—I know the pri<lb></lb>soner—I remember his calling at our office to consult Mr. Nash about being served with a copy of a writ at the suit of Westall and Proctor—he saw Mr. Nash in my presence—after speaking to Mr. Nash with reference to his having been served with a copy of a writ, and stating that he was a bankrupt and so forth, it was ultimately by Mr. Nash transferred over to me to draw an affidavit to get leave to appear to the writ—in looking at the writ I found that the endorsement of the bills was Westall, Proctor and Co, and on the face of the writ they sued as plaintiffs solely as Westall and Proctor—that was quite irregular—the prisoner said that Westall and a Proctor, not trading as Westall, Proctor, and Co., which they ought to have done; what does Westall, Proctor, and Co. mean to these bills as drawers? It appears to me, instead of your owing two bills here, you owe four; you owe two bills in favour of Westall and proctor, and two bills in favour of Westall, Proctor, and Co."—he said he only owed two bills, and that was with westall and Proctor—he said,"I am a bankrupt now passing throught the Court"—I said to him, "Who is your inserted these gentleman, Westall and Proctor, in your statement of accounts?"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I said, "Have you inserted Westall, proctor, and Co., also in your accounts?"—I then said, "I had better go to Mr. Munday and ascertain the particulars of this, as he is living in the same street"—I went to Mr. Munday's office and had a conversation with a gentleman there, and after that, and acting upon what the defendant said to me, I advised him to make this affidavit—I said, "It appears that Messrs. Westall and Proctor have proved their debt; how they should have issued this writ I am at a loss to know, and I advise the affidavit to be drawn, inasmuch as Westall, proctor, and co. drawing as the en<lb></lb>dorsers of these bills must be a forgery, if you only owe westalol and proctor money"—that was what I said to him—I said that, having only inserted westall amd proctor, he ought to have inserted as well estall, proctor, and Co., and having omitted them and sworn to the correctness of his preliminary statement leaving out those two creditors when he ought to have inserted four, as they were two firms he might he indicted—after making that statement to him he swore to the affidavit, acting upon my advice.</p>

               <p>were entitled to judgment within twelve days—I asked him whether be knew such persons as Westall, Proctor, and Co., and he told me he did not, bat he knew Westall and Proctor—I did not ask him if he had any bill-book; I did not know if he had any—I saw the particulars of the bills on the back of the writ—it did not occur to me to ask him whether he had accepted bills for Westall and Proctor for these amounts—I said, "Do you owe Thomas Westall, Proctor, and Co., these amounts upon two several bills?"—he said, "No; I never dealt with Westall, Proctor, and Co.; all I have dealt with was Westall and Proctor,"which appears on the face of the writ—I say on my oath that I most decidedly believed Thomas Westall, Proctor, and Co. was a different firm to that mentioned in the writ—I certainly believed them to be different persons from information I received from the prisoner—he simply said he never dealt with Westall, Proctor, and Co., only with Westall and Proctor—I certainly believed them to be different persons, otherwise I should not have advised him to swear the affidavit to get leave to appear—I took it there were four bills instead of two—I saw the attorneys' names at the bottom—it did not occur to me to go to them and inquire who their clients were—I went over to Mr. Munday and had some conversation with him, and sub<lb></lb>sequently to the Bankruptcy Court to look at the proceedings—the application to a Judge is <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi>, the other side is not heard—I advised my client that I believed, from what he told me, that these bills were forgeries, and I told him he could be indicted for omitting Westall, Proctor, and Co. from his schedule—I knew there was a wrong one way or the other—he did not pay me, I don't know whether he paid my principal—I knew of these proceedings before the Alderman—Mr. Nash defended him there—Mr. Nash knew of the advice I had given, inasmuch as he knew I had drawn the affidavit—I was not called before the Alderman—in Mr. Nash's discretion he did not call me—I was there ready to he called.</p>

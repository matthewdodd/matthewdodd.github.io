The prisoner used to assist the potman, he had been there two months just before Good Friday—I had a room appropriated to my use, which I was accustomed to lock, and keep the key in my pocket—On Friday morning,1st April, at 11 o'clock, on going down stairs, I locked my room and bolted the window; everything was then safe—I had a gold chain with two seals, two rings, two bracelets, a box of coins, two knives, and a gold brooch there—oneof the coins was a good shilling with a head on both sides, which I had had a number of years—about eight o'clock, I went up stairs and found the</p>

I had known the prisoner about eight weeks when I was before the Magistrate on 10th May—about five weeks ago, I had my breakfast in the coffee room at Wallace's, and saw the prisoner; he said, "If you can get this thing out, I can make a couple of pounds of it," pointing to a bag which had something in it—I said, "I will have nothing to do with it"—he said, "If you will get it out, I will share the money with you;" I said, "I will have nothing to do with it"—it seemed like a copper tea-urn, the bag did not come right over the top, you could see the lid—I did not say anything to him about it, but he said something to a girl, and she told a policeman.</p>

               <p>and should not be long—I returned the bundle to him, and saw him go in—hewas gone about an hour; he did not come out again while I waited, but a woman came up to the top of the court, and said, <hi rend="italic">"Bill,"</hi> showed me a gold chain, and spoke to me about it—I believe it was the same chain that was in the bundle, by the small links, it had then turned black at one part, as if it had been tried—she had a bottle, and went and got some gin at a public house, and I saw no more of her or of the chain—I saw the prisoner again about half an hour afterwards at the Corner Pin public house, half a mile from the house into which I saw him go; he had not the bundle then—he told me at the White Horse that he had no money, and in the Corner Pin he paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a pot of beer—he paid with a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I did not notice whether he had any other money—he went with me on my way home, he stopped at a female's house, and there I left him—she met him in the road, and asked him to come home and see <hi rend="italic">Sal</hi>, and he went with her.</p>

I said, "There was not sufficient to charge you."</p>

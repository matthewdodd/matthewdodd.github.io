                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 2, Three Herring-court, Crip<lb></lb>plegate. On Friday, 22nd Aug., the prisoner came to lodge there, and brought two children, one by her side, and another in her arms, which appeared to be eighteen months old, but was not able to walk or talk—while the prisoner was there she was always drunk, and in a state of stupor—she was in the habit of going out for drink, and bringing it home in a bottle—she had plenty of money—on the Tuesday she was so much intoxicated that</p>

               <p>she fell from her door at the top of the stairs to the bottom—on the Thursday I went up-stairs with two more people, and found the infant in a most awful disgusting filthy state for any one to leave a dog or cat in—there was part of the crust of the bottom-part of a loaf lying by its head—three of the child's fingers were clung together from the filthy state of its nose, and with the other hand it had managed to pick out pieces of bread from the loaf—I took it down-stairs, washed it, and gave it some milk—I sent my lad up to the mother the same night to ask if she would let me give it some gruel, and she positively refused, and I offered to take it down and warm it, but she refused to allow me—on the Friday, in consequence of its having cried so bitterly on the Thursday night, I was determined to go and see it, for I thought it had died and I found it lying on the bed insensible, as though dead, without any covering on it, and the prisoner drunk by its side—I roused the prisoner as well as I could, and said, "If you do not light a fire, and give the child nourishing food, the parish authorities shall be made acquainted with this, for I am certain the child will die"—I gave information to Mr. Lloyd, the parish surgeon—he gave me directions, in consequence of which the child was takes to the police, and ultimately before Sir George Carroll—the child was a com<lb></lb>plete skeleton with scarcely skin enough to cover its bones—the fire was not lighted more than once during the week the prisoner lodged there—the other child was supplied with food from one of the neighbours—the prisoner told me her name was Johnson, that she was married, and her husband was a commercial traveller in the City—the infant was a girl, and she used to call it Mary Ann.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of New Basinghall-street, and am the medical officer of the East London Union. This child was brought to me on 29th Aug.—it was very much emaciated, which was the result of gross neglect—it appeared to be suffering from want of food and proper nourish<lb></lb>ment—it was taken to the workhouse, and wholesome food administered to it—I do not think it would have lived twenty-four hours, if proper means had not been taken—it improved, and gained strength in the workhouse, ind in three or four days I scarcely knew it—it died on 11th Sept. from inflamms<lb></lb>tion of the lungs—I am not able to trace the death to the cause of neglect, but in consequence of being in that state it lost its chance of recovery—if it had had proper nourishment before, it might have overcome the disease.</p>

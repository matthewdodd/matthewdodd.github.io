                  </hi>. I live at Elcho Street, Park Road, Battersea—I was formerly member of the same trades union as the defendants, the Amalga mated Society of Carpenters—up to January, 1874, I was in a situation at I Brade Co.'s, builders, as foreman of the joiners—the prisoners were employed as joiners until the 4th October; on Wednesday, 4th October, discharged them; I had authority to do so as foreman; that was about 2.55 in the afternoon—they would be paid for their work up till 5 o'clock—they would be able to draw the money at any time between 3. and 5 o'clock—I saw them between 3 and 5 o'clock in Messrs. Macefield's, the ironfounders—I had a conversation with them, but do not recollect what it was—I was I standing in the roadway outside the building—there was an excavation in<lb></lb>side the hoarding about 10 feet deep, 4 feet wide, and 12 feet 6 inches long it was for the purpose of drainage—there were boards laid on the ground, and one man was working in the hole at the time-near to this point George spoke to me—he said "You are a pretty b"—I said "As that is such an old tale I do not want to hear any more of it"—Williams then said You have no order to discharge us"—I said "No, foremen seldom have—Williams asked me then what I was going to do with the job they had started on—I said "Do not trouble your mind about that, I have some one else to do it"—George said "You could not do it yourself"—I said "I don't know that I am required to do it,. but whatever I have attempted I have accomplished"—I said "I want to get my bag and get away home, I want no more to say to you"—George advanced ahead of me, and Williams stepped towards the end of the hole, George passing up the side, and I after him-Williams stepped after me, and as we were about the centre of the hole Williams suddenly seized me by the shoulders and threw me down the hole, and said "Go down there, you b"—I made a catch at George, but</p>

               <p>he threw me off with his arm and struck me across the chest, and said "Now, you b——, you have your deserts"—as I fell I caught the opposite side of the hole with my left arm and turned round so that 'my back came across the <hi rend="italic">struck</hi>—I could see the prisoners at the side of the hole as I fell—they made a start to run away—as soon as I could get to my feet I called out to stop themthe man who was working in the hole helped me out—the policeman came to me and I asked him to take the prisoners in charge; he did not do so—I was taken home in Mr. Brade's trap—I went to bed and was in bed till the Friday—I then went the police-court and got a warrant against the prisoners—Dr. Kempski attended me; I am still under his care—I suffer still with weakness of the legs,' knee, and ankle-joints.</p>

They would not have to pass this place; there was a nearer way for their tools, but one way would be past this hole-before the Magistrate I said I smiled in one part of the conver<lb></lb>sation—there are planks and scaffold boards on both sides of the hole—I said I did not believe Williams struck his foot against the plank; to the best of my belief that is so.</p>

When the policeman came up I did not tell him to take Williams, and say nothing about George—I said to him "Please take that man's address"—I know Robert Lowe, he is a labourer in the employment of my employers—I have not heard Lowe give his evidence, except on the second occasion—George asked Lowe questions in his defence, he asked mostly all the witnesses—I heard Lowe say "Take that man Williams, you need not say anything about 'George"—when I grabbed at George, I did not nearly pull him into the hole—I could almost swear he was not in the hole—I remember George saying when the con<lb></lb>stable came up "You nearly had me in the hole"—when in the hole I saw. them start to run away—the hole was 10 ft. deep, I could see a man start<lb></lb>ing to run away—I cannot say whether George would have partly fallen if I had not grabbed him—by the expression George used at the time "Now you have got your deserts, "I did not think that George did so to save himself from falling into the hole—I cannot say if it was necessary for him to push me off, he was standing on the plank—what was done to me was done suddenly from behind in such a way that I threw out my arms and grabbed at something to save myself, and in doing so caught hold of George—I cannot say if George would have fallen into the hole if I had not grabbed him; the action made by him would have been with the intention of saving himself if he had been in front of methe words he used were after I had tried to grab at him to save myself, and after he shook me off, he struck me with his arm.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D., M.R.C.S. I live at Oak House I Battersea-Read called at my house on Wednesday, 4th October—I I examined him on the following morning; I found a contusion on the left I buttock and hip—I found the back joint of the hip swelled—he complained of numbness and want of power in the legs; these symptoms are the sign of injury to the spine—he has been under my care up to the present time—he still suffers from weakness of the legs and want of power, consequent, I believe, upon the injuries received.</p>

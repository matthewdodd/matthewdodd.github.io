               <p>JOHN BRICHENO. I live in Finsbury-square. On the 11th of March, I went to a shop in Chiswell-street - I pulled out my watch there, and asked Howard to tell me the time - I then put it into my pocket again, and when I got home I missed it - this is it - I have had it forty-two years - I bought it new.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. How do you know it? A. By the knob by which it opens - I have not had my sight these six years - I know the ribbon and the key which I always wind it up by - I never dropped it when I was putting it into my pocket - I think I did not drop it that day.</p>

            . I keep a general sale shop, at No. 95, Whitecross-street. On the morning of the 12th of March, the prisoner John Young came to me with another man - Young said, "Turner, would you like to earn 1l.?" - I said,"Certainly, in a fair way" - he then said, "You must come with us" - I said, "Come inside, and let me know the particulars before I engage" - he came in and produced a duplicate of a gold watch, and asked if I would buy it - I asked where he got it - he said his wife and the other man's wife picked it up yesterday - I said the proper persons to go with me to look at the watch, would be the women, as they could give more information - I then said I would meet him in half an hour, and I went to the station-house and made inquiries - they said there had been no information - I said I was to meet two women, and go with them to a pawnbroker's - the two men then went with me part of the way - they then left me, and said they could not find the women - I went with the men to the pawnbroker's, and while we were there the officers came in, and stopped the duplicate.</p>

The watch hung over the chimney-piece in the parlour - it was a metal gilt watch, gold seals, a gold key, and a metal chain. I saw it about twelve o'clock on Thursday last. hanging up. There is a garden before the house. I had been in the garden in the morning, and left the street door open, but the gate locked. I went down into the kitchen for a few minutes. There was a ring at the bell; my servant looked through the kitchen window, and said; there was a boy at the garden gate with earthenware. I desired her to say we wanted none. While I stood in the kitchen, we heard a noise in the parlour - I think one of the windows were up. I looked through the kitchen window, and saw a man going from the door. The earthenware man was gone. The garden gate being locked, the man must have got over. I only saw his back. I ran into the parlour, and missed the watch. I ran and unlocked the garden gate, and gave an alarm, and then saw two men running (they had no earthenware). One of them appeared the same size and appearance as the person who ran from the street door. One of the two called out to the other to stop. I saw them pursued, and heard they had made their way into the fields. I ran through the house, went out at the back door, and met them both - they were then standing by a pond, about forty yards from the house. I told one of them he had stolen the watch. He said he had not got it; a little boy who stood by said,</p>
               <p>"Ma'am, if you have lost a watch, I think I saw one of them put it into the pond." Some persons came up and took them, and searched them at the public-house. The watch was brought to me wet out of the pond. I am certain the prisoners are the persons who were running when I got to the garden gate; and I think nobody else could have put the watch in the pond. it is worth at least 7 l. or 8 l. together. I have had it ever, since.</p>

On the 10th of April, at about half past twelve o'clock, I saw the lady at the back of the house, and the prisoners running. They went and stood at the corner of the pond. They were the only persons there. The lady said,</p>
               <p>"Stop! you have got my watch." Bushell said he had not got it. I saw Barlow with his hands in his breast - he pulled something from it, and threw it in the pond. I could not be certain what it was. I ran directly and got the watch out of the pond. It had a chain, seal, and key to it. I gave it to the lady. Two men came and took them.</p>

            . I live next door to the prosecutor. I saw both the prisoners in company together; they made across a vacant piece of ground; Barlow sat down on some stones, while Bushell went and rang at the bell. I had seen them at the Southampton Arms, public-house, just before, and then each had a bundle of wood - they then separated, and Bushell went to the bell; Barlow directed his attention much to Bushell while he was at the garden gate - they were then about thirty yards distant. I had my suspicions, seeing that they had no stock of wood. I was dressing at the time, and thought I would put on my clothes and go down; but before I could get them on, I heard the alarm, and saw Mrs. Broughton opening the front gate to let out the servant, and several people runing round to the pond. When I was dressed I found them custody. I went to the public-house, and mentioned what I had seen. Bushell said, I had no business with it; that they were in custody, and I had no right to say any thing about it.</p>

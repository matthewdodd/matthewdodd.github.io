             down; she opened the door, and was running to give me the message. Before she came in, the prisoner at the bar rushed in; he moved his hat, and a black crape fell from under it over his face; he took a sword and pistol in his hand, and said, This is the suit of lace; you bitch, your money; I said, My money! he said, Give me your purse, or else you are a dead woman. I put my hand in my pocket for my purse: he held the pistol near my face: he said, D - n your blood, don't trifle; I am a gentleman in disress; I want two hundred pounds. I told him I had no more money in the house: then he bid me pull off my coat, and turn my pockets out; and he put in his hands to rifle them: he found no more money.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look upon the prisoner; recollect yourself well, and tell me if you can be sure as to his person?</p>
               <p>Chancellor. Yes; I am sure that is the man that took my purse from me.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. This was eight at night, on the eighth of April: it was dark, I suppose?</p>

               <p>Q. You was frighten'd, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Chancellor. Not. till he took out the pistol and sword, and dropped the crape; but he walked some way into the room before he let down the crape.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him as he came from the door?</p>
               <p>Chancellor. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he rushed forwards?</p>
               <p>Chancellor. Yes; he must be sometime a coming.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you half a minute's time to look at him?</p>
               <p>Chancellor. Yes; more than that, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before?</p>

            . I lived with Mrs. Chancellor. I am her journeywoman. On the eighth of April, at about eight o'clock in the evening, Mrs. Chancellor and her little grand-daughter were sitting together in the parlour: there was a single knock at the door: I went: the prisoner was at the door. I opened it: the prisoner asked if Mrs. Chancellor was at home; I said, I did not know but I would go and see: he said he had got a suit of lace to shew Mrs. Chancellor, just come from abroad. I told him to stop a bit at the door, before I could get into the parlour to deliver the message, he got past me into the room: he went as far as the table where Mrs. Chancellor was sitting; then he lifted up his hat, and a black silk, or crape fell down over his face.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not any silk or crape over his face when you let him in, or when he came into the parlour?</p>
               <p>Hampton. No; he presented a pistol and sword to Mrs. Chancellor, and said, This is the suit of lace, you bitch; 'tis your money I want: he said he was a gentleman in distress, and wanted two hundred pounds, and would have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mistress give him any money?</p>
               <p>Hampton. Yes; she gave him her purse: he d - d the purse, and said, That will not do for me; I am a gentleman in distress, and want two hundred pounds: the child cried; he held a pistol to her, and called her little squeaking bitch, and said if she did not hold her tongue he would blow her brains out. he ordered Mrs. Chancellor to go up stairs directly, and then he took up the purse.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Your conversation at the door was very short, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there no other conversation than what you mentioned?</p>
               <p>Hampton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. By what light did you see him?</p>
               <p>Hampton. The lamp which is over the door: as soon as he got to the table, he let down the black over his face.</p>
               <p>Q. About half a minute?</p>
               <p>Hampton. Longer than half a minute, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Your expression was, he rushed?</p>
               <p>Hampton. He came that minute into the parlour, and pushed the door to.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no-opportunity of seeing his face I suppose, but what you saw at the door?</p>
               <p>Hampton. Yes; in the parlour; I just got into the parlour first; I saw his face before he got up to the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe any part of his dress?</p>
               <p>Hampton. He had a lightish brown great coat on.</p>

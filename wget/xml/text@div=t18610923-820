                  </hi>. I reside at Peckham Rye—I hold an appointment under the Corporation of the City of London—on the afternoon of 4th of September, about twenty minutes to 5 o'clock, I was returning home on foot along the Old Kent-road—I saw an omnibus being driven towards me that would be towards town it was drawn by three horses us going very steadily—there was nothing particular to attracted my attention—it was some distance ahead of me—I could not see whether there was any one in the omnibus—the first thing that attracted my attention was the prisoner getting on to the top of the omnibus from behind he was I presume acting as conductor—he jumped up from behind, went over the roof, jumped on to the box by the side of the coachman and struck him a blow, and he immediately closed with the man by putting his arm round the upper part of his body or neck, I could not see which, and in an instant they fell off the omnibus together, and the right-hand side wheels passed over both the men—I ran up to the spot where the coachman lay—by that times the prisoner had got upon his feet—I said to him, "You have made a pretty mess through striking the man"—he said, "I did not strike him"—I said) "You blackguard, you did strike him, I saw you"—he then said, "He has been at it all the way up"—not seeing a policeman on the spot I took his number, and then went into the surgeon's where the man bad by that time been removed—he appeared to me to have been insensible from the moment that he fell—the whole thing was instantaneous.</p>

I was acting house-surgeon at Guy's hospital on 4th September, about twenty minutes past 5 o'clock in the afternoon, when the omnibus driver was brought in, he was dead—there was a wound can the right cheek, and the skin was grated off the right hand—I could not tell then where she mortal injury was—I made an examination subsequently and found that the right collar-bone was broken, the ten upper ribs can the right side, and the seven upper ribs on the left the liver was torn com<lb></lb>pletely asunder, and the abdomen was filled with blood—the body was in quite a healthy state—the fall from an omnibus and the wheels passing over him would be likely to cause the injuries I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturing chemist in Dennett's-read, Hatcham—on 4th September last, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in an omnibus proceeding from the Montague Arms to London—it was the omnibus of which the prisoner was the conductor, and the deceased the driver—when the omnibus started the deceased was acting as conductor, and said the prisoner as driver—when they changed horses they also changed, the conductor became driver, and the driver became conductor—a dispute com<lb></lb>menced between them at the Shard Arms in the Kent-road, and continued until the accident—at the time of the accident, or just before, the conductor had been disputing, and he said, "What is that you say?"—and ran quickly up the steps of the omnibus—I heard him cross the roof, and I presently saw the driver and conductor come tumbling down the side of the omnibus, and I felt two jerks of the omnibus—I got out and saw the deceased lying apparently dead in the road, and the prisoner scrambling up—there were a good many angry remarks between them before this occurred—I was looking out of the window of the omnibus—I did not notice it until I got to the Shard Arms, and then my attention was called particularly to it had been going on before, but I had not noticed it—I think the conductor was quite sober—I could see him when he was acting as conductor.</p>

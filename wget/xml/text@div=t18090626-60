The king's Arms is not in the city. He then took the bag of canary seed out of the corner, put it on the table, tied the mouth up afresh, took it on his back, and went out; I followed him into Long-lane, that is in the city; he went into Davis's, a little seed shop, he pitched the bag among others on the left hand side of the shop; I was looking through the window; he talked with Davis about three minutes, he came out in the street, I took him in custody, and took him into Davis's shop again; I said where did you come from with this; Davis was then in the shop, behind the counter; he said I live with Mr. Reynolds, I was to bring it here; I told him that was wrong, he had robbed his master of it, and I should take him to the Compter; he then begged his master to be sent for, upon which I sent for Mr. Reynolds. When Mr. Reynolds came, he said. I have found you out at last, you have been robbing me for nigh ten years; he said it was the first time; consider me and my family master. I delivered the seed to Eldridge.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ somewhere about ten years. On Sunday, the 28th of May, in consequence of information; I went to the King's Arms public house, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260054"></xptr>Cartwright has spoken of, I saw this bag of canary seed; I examined the bag, and the seed; the bag belongs to Mr.

             a lighterman, who had left it in my house with a quantity of malt, about three weeks ago. I afterwards looked in my house and found this individual bag missing. I have examined the canary seed, I have no doubt it is mine. I saw the prisoner in custody in Davis's house; I said I have got you at last, I have been looking for you a great while; he begged I would forgive him; he could not conceive what possessed him to do it; it was the first time, and if I would permit him to take the seed back, I should not be the poorer; he would never do the like again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This person has been a soldier a long time, he has been serving abroad, he has a wife and children, you did not prosecute Davis - A. No, the magistrate discharged him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had better made this man a witness against Davis, and prosecuted him - A. That was what I meaned to do.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN JOHNSON. I am a officer. This happened on the 1st of August; after I had taken the other prisoners into custody, I went into <placeName id="t18140914-138-crimeloc771">St. James's Park, close by Spring-gardens</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18140914-138-crimeloc771" type="placeName" value="St. James's Park, close by Spring-gardens"></interp>

I saw the lad turn up a number of women gowns; I saw him take a white handkerchief from a lady's pocket; when he took the lady's handkerchief, he crept in between the people. The mob was so great, I could not see him; the pressure was so great, I could neither lay hold of him, or acquaint the lady. This was the handkerchief; it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night. I have not been able to acquaint the lady of her loss. I saw the prisoner attempt a gentleman pocket. He was in and out of the crowd near an hour, at this work before I could lay hold of him. At last I caught the prisoner in my arms, and brought him out of the crowd. The prisoner pretended to be in liquor, and by his own account he had enough to make him in liquor, by what he said. He was not in liquor. I searched him, and found sixteen handkerchiefs all about his body, from his chest to his knees. There were soldiers breast plates, bells, and toys, in his pockets. One of these white handkerchiefs I saw him take from a lady's pocket. Nobody appeared at the examination except his father. He acknowledged he had taken three handkerchiefs: he said he had only been out a month upon the game.</p>

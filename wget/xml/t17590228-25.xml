               <p>Mr Bentham. I belong to the Navy-Office: there were some books belonging to the office missing; we knowing they could be of no service to any except cheesmongers, or chandlers shops, who tear them up for use. We sent people about, and there were some found at a cheesmonger's shop, the person said, he bought them of Mr Nixon another cheesmonger.</p>
               <p>Q. Who found them?</p>
               <p>Bentham. One Mr Wood; we got a search warrant of the sitting Alderman, and at Mr Nixon's we found a parcel of these books belonging to the Navy-office; he knowing the person of whom he bought them took him up, it was the man at the bar; he was taken before Mr Alderman Cokayne; the woman, wife to the man, was employed to light the fires in the office; she was taken up also; I ask'd her how she carried them out of the office; she own'd she carried them out in her apron, and the man own'd he had them from his wife; the man own'd he had sold some to Messrs. Gill and Wright, Stationers, on London-bridge, where we found a great many. (The books produc'd in court, and depos'd to as his Majesty's property.)</p>

               <p>JOSEPH HUGHES. Q. On the night of Saturday, the 29th of August, were you at the Crown public house, in the Minories, the night that this transaction took place - A. Yes; I was, having a pint of beer about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there - Yes; he was quarrelling with two men when I went in; one was a shopmate of his, his name was Scott; the other man's name I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the ground of his quarrelling with Scott - A. Scott said, that the prisoner's wife borrowed things and pawned them. There were many words; but I do not recollect all Evans said to Scott; have you any more to tell me, for I will have revenge. Evans then said, the first time that ever I catch your wife in my room, I will push her down stairs. I happened to go out and assist; as I came in Evans went out.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did he appear to go out in; cool and calm, or how - A. He did not seem to go out in a passion, as I saw. When he went out, a man went out with him. He came in again; he said nothing more at that time.</p>

I did; I think it was a little past ten o'clock. I heard Mrs. Evans shriek very violently. I heard her say, Frank, my dear, do not beat me; he said, I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any blows take place - A. I cannot say I did. She said, how can you believe what every one says, and come home and ill use me for it. She said, I have not borrowed any money of any one. He said, she was a liar. I heard her scream again, and something fell to the floor. In about a moment she shrieked again. I heard no more.

               <p>Q. To do what - A. Not to jump out. She got up in the window; first with one knee and then with the other, and turned her feet outwards. She extended her arms three times, and came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the extension of the arms three times before she quitted the window - A. The third extension of her arms she came down.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lords, and gentlemen of the jury, trembling under the awful situation in which I am now charged with a crime of the most brutal enormity, appearing before this Honourable Court with all the mischievous consequences created against me by public prints/, &amp;c. I most humbly appeal; confident, however popular clamour may condemn me, a conviction of my innocence, to which I call God to witness, and of your humane and impartial hearing, that you will permit me to submit to your consideration those matters irresistibly attached to the case, which will convey to the Court the impossibility of my guilt. On the contrary, satisfactorily convince you, that so far from committing the horrid act with which I now stand accused, I have uniformly endeavoured by every pacific persuasion to calm the perturbed state of mind under which my late unfortunate wife laboured, and to convey to her feelings, notwithstanding her innumerable faults, attachment to her person. Permit to represent, since my infancy, I have pursued a life of honesty and industry; the former part of which was devoted to the service of my country, in his Majesty's ship, Ville de Paris; since which I have pursued every means of procuring an honest livelihood. With solemn grief do I state, I unfortunately married the deceased eight years back, and, for a period, lived happy, enjoying an uninterrupted means by my honesty, confining myself to the humble following of a sawyer; of providing every comfort any well disposed couple might expect, for which I feel grateful to my Maker; when, unfortunately, my wife launched into extravagances impossible for me by my labour to support, continually pledging what few articles I had worked hard for, and contracting debts in every quarter unknown to me, which, however distressing to my feelings, I have, by the most pacific persuasion, painted out the inevitable destruction awaiting such conduct, which, however, only tended to kindle the flame of disaffection, and produced in her new inventions to plunder. Upon various occasions, after having pledged every thing she could move, she has, under various false pretexts, borrowed articles of my neighbours, which she has systematically consigned to the same fate; and, to avoid public detection, she has left her home, and, at the moment when we were entrusted with an infant to nurse, she has carried with her the child's apparel, which she had likely taken from its person a few minutes before, on putting it to bed, when staying out sometimes until one, two, and three o'clock in the mornings, intoxicated, after rolling about the streets, completely disfigured with mud and dirt, she would return; not withstanding all which, I have silently submitted to the same, and afforded her admittance, when she has declared she has lost her pockets, with their contents, amounting sometimes to twenty or thirty shillings; a wilful pretext to enable her to redeem part of the property borrowed of the neighbours, and pledged; a glaring instance of which will be satisfactorily proved by an industrious woman, the mother of the child, who upon some occasions she has actually called from her bed, and persuaded her to accompany her home, to plead in her behalf; who cannot deny, instead of my maltreating her, I have kindly signified my distress of mind at her staying out, and kindly invited her to my polluted bed. Detection upon detection of her infamy followed When at a moment of self-conviction she has absconded, plundering me of every article, not leaving me any thing except the clothes on my back. While at work, instances of which I shall prove by a work-mate of mine, and who unfortunately gave her to me in marriage eight years ago, at Christ Church, Newgate-street, of whom she has repeatedly borrowed money, under various pretexts, to whom, after roving about in a state of whoredom, for a week or so, she has applied to ask forgiveness, and persuade me to receive her; which, upon all occasions, I have, be it known to my weakness, readily complied with, and by other industrious and respectable persons, who have commisserated my fate, to whom she has boasted her finesse in deceiving me about her pockets, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160032"></xptr> acknowledged her pleasure in my weakness, in believing her. These desertions, with other acts of profligacy, reduced me to a state of wretchedness beyond human conception. My humble home repeatedly deserted, applications upon applications for money she owed, and articles she had pledged unknown to me; incapable of supporting it, although I worked like a horse to support an honest character, in which assertion, thank God, every one that knows me will gladly bear me out; imprisoned, as it were, on the Sunday, by her; as often as I might redeem them, pledging my decent clothes, and often deprived of but one shirt for weeks, I was compelled to form a resolution to restrict her from purchasing our necessary food, &amp;c. by performing such offices myself. This added to her fury; and incapable, by her repeated falsehoods, to deceive her neighbours or acquaintances, as heresofore, she gave way to immoderate passions, and became ungovernable, as often when no person was in her room as otherwise, and I absent at work all day. She would indulge such flagrant passions, often screaming and tearing herself, as one would suppose, to pieces. She would open the window of the room, when she has been known to alarm the neighbours, fearful she might throw herself out. One instance of the latter act can be proved by my landlord and landlady, on which occasion they were induced to rush up and persuade her to descend to her parlour. Sorry am I to repeat these instances of ungovernable passions, but my situation imperiously demands it; and I hope, as my miserable life depends upon your decision, you will humanely forgive me.</p>

               <p>Suspecting her, a few weeks before this fatal catastrophe happened, of having spent the trifle I had given her to pay the rent, I, on Saturday, made known my intention of paying my rent that evening myself, and went down stairs to my landlord accordingly, when in lieu of having six shillings to pay, which I conceived was this due, which he himself supposed was my opinion, he informed me, in lieu of my wife having paid him the money he knew I had given her, that she had spent it in inebriety and debauchery, and that he had a claim upon me for twenty-four shillings, when, on my return, I discovered she had decamped with every moveable, however trifling they were; upon which occasion she secreted herself from me from Saturday to the ensuing Friday, when she again returned, nearly naked, when I again, with the most kind intention towards her, received her, although I detected her. During such absence she applied to a Mr. Smith, in Charterhouse-street, in an apparent state of agony, and informed him, that I had that moment been brought home, by two persons, in a dying state, shewing him an old out-patients ticket for the hospital; under pretext of just having obtained such, and to buy me indispensible and immediate nourishment, borrowed six shillings, and of

            , a one-pound note. To guard against her organized schemes of deception was impossible; to repeat her actions for the last two years would astonish the most profligate, while it would claim from the dispassionate and philanthropist the tear of compassion and pity. On Saturday, the 24th of August last, as was my invariable custom, I returned home at four o'clock in the afternoon, when my deceased wife being out, I commenced shaving myself. I had scarce finished doing so when she returned, and as if pleased to see her, as I supposed, thoroughly collected, I addressed her by saying, my dear girl, if you continue this way we shall soon overcome our difficulties, and still live happy, when she informed me she had been taken ill in the street, and had reached in her apron, shewing it me at the same time; upon which I expressed my regret, and in as tender a tone as I was capable of, requested her to lay down on the bed, which she did, and to the best of my belief, fell asleep; upon which, having a lock and key to purchase at a neighbouring ironmonger's, for a box I was then having made by my workmate, and also to attend for my wages, I left her three shillings in silver and in halfpence, and went quietly out of the room, fearful of disturbing her.</p>
               <p>I purchased the lock and key, and on going to the sign of the Crown public-house, at which house the sawyers who worked for master regularly met on a Saturday, to make out their bills for the week's work, I called on Mr. Strachan, butcher, in in the Minories, and agreed for the aitch-bone of beef for our Sunday's dinner. At the Crown public-house I met my fellow-sawyer's mate, to whom I gave the lock and key, who, as he regularly did, made out our joint week's bill for work, which bill I took to my employer, who, about half past eight o'clock, paid me, when I returned to the Crown, and paid my mate his portion of the said work-bill. A few minutes conversation passed, when my shop-mates enquired how my wife conducted herself; upon which I informed them we agreed very well, and that I was in hopes, if she continued as she now behaved, I should, I flattered myself, I should by hard-work, be enabled ere long, to relieve myself from difficulties created by her improprieties. Upon which, one and all expressed their conviction. I did not know half she owed. She had borrowed money of every one she could. Amongst the number was my workmate, of whom, during her flight, and about the same time she borrowed six shillings. Of Mr. Smith, she had persuaded him, to lend her one pound, begging him not to acquaint me of the same for a time, intimating, she had pledged my Sunday clothes unknown to me; she wanted to redeem them, and replace them the next day, (Sunday); the whole of which she squandered away during her exile from home, from the Saturday to the following Friday before mentioned. Inclined to be home by my regular hour; called at the butchers, and paid for the aitchbone of beef, which I immediately took home, it being then near ten o'clock. On my going home, to my utter astonishment I beheld my wife intoxicated, and discovered, notwithstanding I had left her three shillings, she had taken the gown off her back, and had put on an old bed gown, which, upon enquiry, she acknowledged she had pledged. Disappointed in my hopes of any reformation, I, as well as I could, with a sorry heart, expostulated with her of her innumerable acts of treachery, and the difficulties she had plunged me into; besides acquainted her of the information afforded me by my shop-mates,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160033"></xptr> and very likely chided her in a harsh manner for obtaining the one pound of my mate. Chagrined at my unexpected dectection, she first began to cry, and deny the whole, which hurt me the more. I call God to witness I never struck her. She permitted her passion to overcome her, and most completely terrified me by her screaming, jumping, and knocking about, exclaiming, dear Frank, don't believe them. Upon which she made a desperate attack upon the room door, no doubt to fly out to avoid further animadversions, which I prevented by placing myself before it, in which I believe a scuffle might ensue for two or three minutes, in which I let fall on the floor the aitchbone of beef, having been from the moment of my entrance into the room, and missing the gown off her back, struck, as as it were, senseless. Observing her in such a violent rage, and persuaded my continuing speaking to her would only add to it, I silently set myself on a chair, with my back to the window, at the opposite side of the room, reflecting with silent grief, at my wretched situation; still determined not to let her go out of the room, especially as I was convinced she had been drinking. After screaming and jumping about the room, as if mad, she, unknown to me, flew to the window, which unfortunately was opened, and raised herself upon the sill of the window, and precipitated herself into the yard, paved with sharp pointed stones. Casting my eyes round I first saw her flying down out of the window. Distracted, I rushed down stairs; how, I know not; but, when collected, I found myself assisting my unfortunate victim of self-destruction, from the fatal spot where she alighted, to the step of our street-door. When I discovered blood gushing out of her head or face, suffice it to say, I was completely senseless for a few moments. When she held out her hand to me I embraced it for the last time. She wished me to accompany her up stairs, but Scott, the constable, denied me so doing and took me in custody.</p>
               <p>My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I once more appeal to God that I have set forth the truth, and nothing but the truth, and hope, when you consider the case fully, which I rest satisfied you will, you will easily convince yourselves of the improbability of my being her murderer. God forbid. Were I so, the sooner I quit this earthly career the better. Pardon me. I must disclose one more act to prove how bent to every species of advantage she was, even during the short time I left her to buy the lock and key, and obtain my wages. She had not only pledged her gown, but had actually borrowed a pair of flat irons of the landlady, and pledged them also: and more wonderful, after she had jumped out of the window in a state, dreadful as may be expected, told her of the same, gave her the duplicate, and requested her to keep this act from my knowledge, and privately gave a number of duplicates to Mr. Smith to keep for her unknown to me.</p>

            . I have the bail piece, in the cause of Stackhouse and Field, and the rule for the allowance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160088"></xptr>of bail. R. C. Mullett of the Spur Inn, High-street, Borough, is one of those bail.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. You have known Mr. Mullett some years. - A. Yes; I never knew him in difficulties.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know him before 1821 - A. Yes. I should think he was not in a situation to borrow small sums of money.</p>
               <p>The affidavit was here read, in which the defendant deposed as follows: - That he had personally known R. C. Mullett for several years, and was acquainted with his pecuniary circumstances, and confidently believed him to be generally poor; so much so, that he had, upon repeated occasions, prior to the year, 1821, borrowed of the defendant, various small sums of money; but although repeatedly applied to, invariably failed in making repayments, urgently pressing for further indulgence upon the ground of poverty; and that the defendant had, at the request of the said R. C. Mullett, sometime back, lent him his acceptance for 23, upon a solemn pledge, that the amount should be deposited to meet the bill when at maturity: which the defendant had, however, been compelled to pay: that the amount of the different loans and goods sold him, exceeded 40 l. which had been due since 1820; all of which remained unpaid; and that the defendant had arrested him in Michaelmas Term for the recovery thereof, which action remained unsettled: also, that the defendant had heard, and fully believed, that the said R. C. Mullett was at present indebted to Mrs. Week, of Kennington, between 400 l. and 500 l. which she had repeatedly declared her utter impracticability of obtaining payment and her apprehensions that she should lose the whole."</p>

            . On the 30th of January kept the Spur Inn, in the Borough. I had been an auctioneer, and lived in Blackman-street and King-street, Borough. I tendered myself as bail in the action in question; I have known the defendant about seven years, but have never borrowed money of him at any time whatever, nor did I owe him any money in 1824. He brought an action against me in November last, but it has never been tried; notice of trial has been given and countermanded; it was brought in Surrey, in Michaelmas Term. I have appeared to defendant, but it has never been tried; I certainly do not owe him any such sum.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any bill transactions with him. - A. I drew one bill of 23 l. on him, and 2 s. for the stamp. He came to me at the Spur Inn, where I was sitting, and said he had met with a misfortune and broken my chaise at Bexley, and as it was in price to him before, the best way would be for him to buy it. I had asked him 25 guineas for it, and at last agreed to take his acceptance for 23 l. and that is what this bill was given for, and for no other purpose. I never promised to take it up; on the contrary, it was for the chaise; it was duly paid; it was payable at Sir

               <p>Cross-examined by ANDREWS. Q. Who delivered the chaise to Mr. Munk - A. He came and took it while I was absent. I had bought it of Mr. Ingram. I was not concerned in the bankruptcy against the defendant, except being employed to take an inventory. I swear distinctly that the bill was given for the chaise, and not accepted for my benefit, or for me to take up. I never proposed to settle this, if he stopped the action against me, nor authorised any one to do so.</p>

             re-examined. In March, 1820, I was dining at the Spur-inn with Mr. Mullett, and recollect the defendant coming in, and stating that he had had an accident with the chaise, he had borrowed of Mrs. Mullett's wife during his absence. It was ultimately agreed that Munk should pay a bill of 23 l, and give a gallon of brandy. The bill was drawn and accepted; I got a friend to discount it for Mullett; 2 s. was added for the stamp.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen the gig - A. Often, when Mullett and when Munk had it. I have acted as attorney for Mullett, and put in a set-off.</p>
               <p>Q. I this it - (producing it) A. Yes; there is a charge made for the gig and harness.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Before you delivered that set-off, had he delivered his bill of demand, charging this bill of 23 l. - A. Yes; and we gave that in answer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you put that in the set-off by consent of your client - A. I think I told him, I intended to do it, as we might be excluded from proving it, unless it was inserted in the set-off.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was the set-off made by Mullett's express direction - A. Certainly not. I exercised my own discretion, with his consent.</p>

Mr. Mullett was then in business, as an auctioneer, and lived in King-street, Borough; he was in the habit of borrowing small sums of my brother; it might be from 5 to 20 l. He was in the habit of coming in, and saying,</p>
               <p>"I am short of money, can you lend me some?" This may have happened two or three times a year, in the way of business.</p>

            . I am also the defendant's sister, and have lived with him until within the last seven months. He was in the habit of lending Mullett different sums, at different times some years ago; sometimes 5 l. and sometimes 4 l., or it might be more; I suppose it was paid again. One morning, as I was at breakfast, Mr. Mullett came in, and wished Mr. Munk to lend him his name for 23 l. as he was rather pressed for money, and it would be of service to him, as he could immediately get it discounted. My brother lent him his name without the least hesitation. He mentioned 23 l. and said,</p>
               <p>"I will make it a few shillings more, because it won't look so much like accommodation." This was in the spring of the year 1820. He said my brother need not give himself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160089"></xptr>any trouble about it, he would find the money, Mullett was afterwards at our house, and my brother blamed him for not taking up the bill, Mullett wanted to turn it off to a chaise my brother had bought of him. My brother said,</p>
               <p>"No; you know you owe me the amount of the chaise in spirits and wine; I will not set the chaise against that" They had a quarrel about it. I knew myself of wine and spirits having been delivered to him. I sent them myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your sister was present at this conversation - A. No. It happened at my brother's parlour in the Borough. He kept a wine vaults.</p>

            . I was attorney for the plaintiff Stackhouse. I saw Mr. Mullett when this suit was pending, (about February last.) I believe he called Munk a great scoundrel and a rascal. When Mullett appeared to justify bail, it was settled that the attorney should produce to me proof of Mullett being possessed of the property he stated, and if I was satisfied, he was to justify. I saw Mr. Oakley; he said, I might depend upon it, that Mullett had the property sworn to, and I think he added,</p>
               <p>"but I will not say, it is not mortgaged for its value.</p>

               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You did not oppose the bail any further - A. I thought it unnecessary as I had two others.</p>

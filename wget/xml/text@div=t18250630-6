On Saturday, the 18th of June, at eight o'clock, I was at home - I had been in the shop a quarter of an hour before; a neighbour alarmed me - I went to my shop window, which was sound a quarter of an hour before; I found the glass broken in, and property gone. I found the prisoners in custody, and saw a pair of spectacles found on Godwin, by one Bunning, who gave them to me, in his presence, and said, in his hearing, that he had found them under his jacket. Taylor, the officer, came. The property was within reach when the glass was broken.</p>

On the 18th of June, about eight o'clock, I observed the prisoners standing at her window; Field's hand was through the window - he seemed to take something out, and gave it to Godwin; he did the same again, and then they turned away from the window; I called my brother, who crossed the road and secured them.

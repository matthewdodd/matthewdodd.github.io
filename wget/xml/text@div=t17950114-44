               <p>Q. Did you lose any effects on the 8th of January last? - Yes, I lost a velveteen coat without sleeves, and a pair of velveteen breeches; it was a boy's coat.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to lose them? - I went to call my wife away from her father and mother.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out of your house? - Yes, I did; when I came back with my wife I told her to go into a shop and buy a pennyworth it sprats, within the mean time she was picking the sprats, I went up stairs and lighted my candle, and found my things were gone; I had suspicion of the prisoner at the bar, he had been up in my apartment several times; he helped me to move from the one place to another about four or five days before.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he knew your house and knew your effects? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he did not say if he had the things back again he would not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did promise him if so he he would give me the things back again, because they were not my things, but things that I had to do for other people, and I was so terrified that I hardly knew what I was about.</p>

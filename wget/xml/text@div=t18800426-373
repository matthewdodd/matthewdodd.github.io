                  </hi>. I am a furrier, of 37, Milk Street, Cheapside—some time last year George Hardwick Robshaw suggested to me that I should add to my other business that of a woolen business—the result of that was that he became indebted to me 492<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in September last year—on 11th December he came and produced two bills for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and this document (marked A), and suggested that and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash as the terms of settlement between us—there is a stamp to it, and my name is written across it—I signed it in his presence that day—he did not give me the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said, "I shall give you the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to-morrow"—I said, "All right, it will only be a penny lost, I will see my solicitor," and I cancelled my name and returned the document-during the time he was my agent 1 had given him 15 or 16 of my bill-heads, signed in blank—on the following day I Went to my solicitor, Mr. Lovett, and deposited the document with him and the bill for 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—next day I saw George Robshaw at Mr. Lovett's office—Mr. Lovett told him he could not accept his proposition, as the bills were no good; he must give more money and put his own name on the bills—he said he could not give more money at present-some other conversation took place, and Mr. Lovett told him he must go to his own solicitor and try and settle it—on 17th December I saw him again at Mr. Lovett's office, and the proposition was again made that he should give more money and better bills—he Said he would give the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as soon as it was settled—on 31st December I took out a debtor's summons in bankruptcy against him, and at the hearing of that summons this document marked "C," dated 8th December, was pro<lb></lb>duced by him—this is the document on which he was convicted of forgery: "I hereby agree to accept in settlement of account, to date inclusive, bills for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and cash 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., &amp;c.

On the 1st of August, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed - it was moon-light, or it would have been dark. I got up, and found a ladder which is kept at the farther end of the yard placed under Mrs. Short's window - it was at the other end of the yard the night before.</p>
               <p>MARIA SHORT. I am a widow, and lodge at Mrs. Green's, on the first floor. On the 1st of August, about twelve o'clock, I went to bed. I shut the window down, and put a gimblet into it, but whether it caught the outer sash or not I cannot say, but am certain it was quite shut down. I went to sleep, and was alarmed about half-past one - it was moon-light - I could see my black petticoat on the floor - I was laying on my right side, with my baby sucking at my left breast, and on opening my eyes I saw a man reaching inside the window. I saw him take some of my clothes out of my box - the window was open, and he was leaning within it - both his arms were in the room. I was so alarmed I could not call out - I endeavoured to kick my eldest boy, who laid at the foot of the bed, but could not awake him - he took the clothes out of my box, and threw them out of the window - after that I heard the window above stairs open - the man was then within my window - I then saw him go gradually down - I got out of bed, and gave an alarm - Mrs. Barns gave the first alarm. I went into the yard, and found the ladder under my window. I had seen him going down the ladder, and Mrs. Barns said, "There is a man in the yard." I noticed that he had a dark coat on, but cannot swear to his person. I first saw him in the yard, and afterwards saw him get over the wall into the field. I missed the articles stated in the indictment (enumerating them). I gave information of the robbery next morning, and went into the taproom of the Red Lion public-house, and saw a man sitting down with a yellow silk handkerchief round his neck. I came out, and said I was sure he was the man who had robbed me. I felt certain of it, by the appearance of his coat - it was a particularly long coat, and came down to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150130"></xptr>the calves of his legs - I noticed it as he stood in the yard, before he went to the wall - I thought it exactly like the coat, and consider that the handkerchief was mine, and one which I had lost that night. I am certain the prisoner is the man I saw in the public-house. I went down to the office, and met Foster, the officer. He went with me to the Red Lion, but he was gone then. I found him by the turnpike-gate, and pointed him out to Foster, who went up to him. He was taken to the Black Dog public-house, and my handkerchief taken off his neck by Foster. The prisoner Gale came into the public-house, and he said to her, "I believe all is right." Foster told Lea to follow her home. I followed her, and went up to her room. Lea let down the bed, and I found some of my flannel - it was a petticoat, partly made, and some calico - a child's tippet, and my purse, was found in her pocket. I had seen no woman about the house. Gale solemnly declared she knew nothing of the robbery, and said her husband gave her the purse.</p>

            . I lodge in the room over Mrs. Short. On the 1st of August, about twelve o'clock at night, I opened my window, and heard the church clock strike twelve. After that, not finding myself very well, I struck a light, put it out again, and tried to go to sleep, but could not rest. I got up and opened my window again, and thought it was break of day, it was such a very moonlight night. The watchman called half-past one when I opened the window. I saw a man in the yard, and saw him go to climb over the wall - I gave an alarm of Thieves. He had on a dark coat, which seemed to hang low, and to be full behind, but it was not a great coat. He had a high crowned hat, which was narrower down at the brim.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday, the 2d of August, in consequence of information, I went to look for Clark, and found him by Mile-end turnpike; I asked where he was on Monday night - he said at home - I asked what time he was at home; he said he could not say to an hour; I asked where he got the handkerchief which was round his neck - he said he bought it yesterday morning in Petticoat-lane for 1 s. 6 d. - I said he must go into the public-house, for I wished to search him; we went backward, into the parlour - I saw both his hands up to his neck, and when we got to the parlour door, he threw the handkerchief off his neck into the parlour, and said, "Go in there, and I will be with you directly - I want to go backward." I said "No, you must go in now;" he had the door half open - I called him: he said, "Let me go; I am taken very bad;" I took him into the parlour, and told Mrs. Short to look at the handkerchief; she exclaimed "That is my handkerchief, and what my husband wore when he died?" she nearly went into a fit; he said "Be quiet, my good woman, I dare say all things will be right;" I searched him and found a key, which, he said, was the key of his door; I asked where he lived; he said at No. 23, Easterfield-street, Stepney; I then went back into the yard with him, returned to the parlour, gave the key to Lea, and told him to go and search there. I took Clark to the office, and as I took him through the passages of the public-house, Gale stood there; he said something to her, and then said "It is all right;" I took him to the office; Lea brought Gale and some property there - the prosecutrix's house is in the parish of St. Dunstan's, Stepney.</p>

            . On the 2d of August, between ten and eleven o'clock, in the morning, I saw Clark; Gale came running into the passage of the public-house, and said, "Where is my husband?" Foster took Clark away, but before he went they whispered together; Gale crossed over the road; Short and I followed her to No. 23, Easter-field-street, Stepney; she went up, opened the door, and Short claimed some calico which laid on a chair there, and between the mattress and bed I found some flannel, which she claimed, and, between the bed and sacking, some more flannel; and a tippet in the room; and in Gale's pocket, I found a purse - she said Clark gave it to her.</p>

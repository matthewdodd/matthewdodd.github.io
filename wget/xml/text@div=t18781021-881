Pfeil and Co. by means of a pass<lb></lb>book—they are ironmongers—when goods were required we sent a man with the book produced; he was to get what he wanted and have them entered in the book—we received an invoice for them perhaps quarterly or monthly—Laffar had been in my employment four or five years or longer—he was aware of our custom with reference to the pass<lb></lb>book—he frequently had access to it—on the 6th September I received an invoice for some articles that are not entered in that book, and found they were not for me—I went to the prosecutors, and took the invoice back to them and said it was not or me—they had not got the book; it was taken away by the man who fetched the goods—I find no entry in this book of any of the goods there which I never ordered, four cart arms and three bundles of spring steel, nor did I give Laffer or any other person authority to order them—two or three days afterwards, when before the Magistrate, I got back the book—it was left at Laffer's residence, I believe.</p>

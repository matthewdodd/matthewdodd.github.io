                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, of Holloway. I became acquainted with the prisoner about a week before 30th of last Sep., and gave him four debts to collect for me—one of the debts was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., due from Mr. Chisholm, of Cornwall-place, Holloway—I have never received any money from the prisoner—on 30th Sep. he called on me and said he should be obliged to summons Mr. Chisholm for the debt, and he should want 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that purpose—I gave him that money—he said it would be necessary to summons him to the Sheriffs' Court, in Red Lion-square—I saw him again on 9th Oct., when he told me he had taken out a summons against Mr. Chisholm, and that it would come on for trial on 15th Oct.—on 15th Oct. he came again, said he had appeared at the Sheriffs' Court, and there was no one there from Mr. Chisholm to proceed with the case, and that it would be advisable to take out an execution on his goods—I asked him what amount of money he wanted, and he said 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I gave him, and before I gave him that I wrote this paper from his dictation (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I and he signed it, and one of my servants also (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Sheriffs' Court, Red Lion, Oct. 15th 1851—I hereby authorize John Brown, my collector, of 5, Alfred-place, Blackfriars, to take an execution on Mr. Chisholm's good and chattels situated at No. 11, Cornwall-place, Holloway, Middlesex, for goods sold and delivered, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; expenses, summons and levies, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; execution on goods, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; total, 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; signed William Saville, John Dommett, and John Brown"—That "John Brown" is the prisoner's signature—before I parted with this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I believed that the representa<lb></lb>tions he had made of having taken out a summons and attended the trial of Chisholm's case were true; I should not have parted with my money if I had not believed so—the prisoner called again on the evening of the 20th Oct., and said he had come to take the goods and chattels of Mr. Chisholm—he went to Mr. Chisholm, came back and said he had found out that the goods were not Mr. Chisholm's, and the only thing would be to take out an execu<lb></lb>tion against him, in order to tell whether the goods were his or not, and that</p>

               <p>Q. What morning was it you discovered any thing amiss to your house? - Tuesday morning, the 7th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. The night before, who was the last up in your house? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. That was on the 6th? - Yes; nearly on the stroke of twelve, as near as possible when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to bed in what state of security did you leave your house? - The street door bolted with two bolts, and the bar door was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bar door open within or without? - It opens within.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is within the house? - Yes, within the house; within the lobby.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bolt the street door yourself? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And the bar door, how was that fastened? - That was bolted, a catch first and then a catch that pushes further.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your windows all left secure? - I will not say they were. I went round the coffee room, and they appeared as usual; but I will not take my oath that they were all fastened with the cheek bolts; they are slide up shutters. There are only two rooms on the floor, the bar and the coffee room.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say whether the shutters of the coffee room windows were fastened or not? - I cannot; the shutters were up, but whether they were fastened or not, I cannot say; one shutter draws up half way, and then another draws up over that, up to the top; the pin was in the middle between the shutters, but whether the side bolts and catch was in I cannot say; I am sure the pin was in, because I had made a particular piece of work with my servant for losing the iron pin, and I made use of a wooden pin; the wood served the same as another pin provided the cheek bolts had been in. The sashes were down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any disturbance in the course of the night? - Not till my servant came up to me about half after five, and told me the house was broke open,

            , he is here. I got up and found my bar broke open; there are two bars in the house; the tap room is below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean that bar was broke open that you spoke of as being locked? - Yes; that I locked with my own hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160182"></xptr>Q. Describe how it appeared to be broke open. - There are two screws that screws the cap on, that goes on in one side of the door post, and the two screws were wrenched off, and the cap down. The street door stood half open on a sort of jar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear that any violence had been done to that door? - None. That was opened inside apparently, and the other door that opens in the passage, after you enter through the street door, that was put back, and tied back by a knot in the string; I had left it put to over night, but not bolted. My windows were put down the same as I could see as I left them the over night, but I see the mark of a foot step from the area gate, which comes across the cellar flap on to a bearing iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that area gate locked? - It was locked, but it was apparently wrenched open, room enough to push it away. the cap of the area gate was pushed on one side, it was put to as when I left it, but the cap was pushed on one side; where they let down the beer there is a large cellar flap within the area; then the foot step was from that across about a foot, it was wet; then they went from that across to the other area again; I have two fronts, it is a corner house, there is an iron rester between the two areas, and they got on that to get into the coffee room window, there was the mark of dirt and wet on that rester; I observed there was a mark on the first window in the coffee room, apparently the mark of a shoe; inside I could see no mark of any foot, only on the sill. I found the windows and shutters apparently as I left them the over night, fastened with a skewer. Then I went below in the tap room; the bar of the tap room that my man keeps was in the same predicament as my bar was above stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. The bar room door below, how did you find that? - I found it with the cap off and the two screws out, the same as my own bar up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other violence about the house? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss at that time? - A great many things; rum and brandy, and wine, and table linen, and tea spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place, where was your rum and brandy that you missed, the over night? - Standing in my bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity did you miss? - I cannot particularly tell, because there was large cags of rum and brandy, as well as what we keep in bottles; there was some wine gone, and some peppermint.</p>
               <p>Q. You put none of these things in the indictment I observe? - I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any tea and sugar? - That was in a loaf, standing in the bar, and two pounds of moist with it; the tea was in three different cannisters, and in a paper besides I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as to the table cloths? - They were missing all out of the bar. The cotton was in the bar, eight yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the childrens frocks? - I do not particularly know that, there were some in making, and some for patterns that they were cutting out by.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know about any shoes? - I don't know a great deal about them, they were in the bottom bar; my man I believe does.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any silk stockings? - Yes, one pair; they were out of the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Any handkerchiefs? - Yes, from the same place, out of the drawers in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How many handkerchiefs do you think? - I don't know the number. Two table spoons, all in the bar, and the beaufet in the bar; three tea spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. What weight might the loaf of sugar be? - I believe sixteen or seventeen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160183"></xptr>pounds, I am not particular to the weight of it. There was above four pounds of tea in different caddies, and some from the grocers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in the house belonging to any person supposed to be there? - No, I found nothing, no otherwise than they had got the rummers down and appeared to have been drinking wine; there was wine left in the rummers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left any light burning in the house? - None, but what I burn all night myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they taken any thing else? - The money out of the till, but nothing but halfpence and farthings; the lid was lifted up when I found it in the morning, the bolt was not shut in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see afterwards any part of your property that you could speak to? - I see them all again at the magistrates, the next morning; I see articles that I could swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the things did you see your spoons? - No, nor the new linen.</p>
               <p>Q. You see your stocking? - Yes; them I could swear to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What is your christian name? - William.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep this house entirely yourself? - I do, I have no partner.</p>
               <p>Q. You have some lodgers in your house? - I have four; I believe there were four then.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at six o'clock in the morning you received an account that the house had been broke open, by one of your lodgers? - No, at half after five, when my servant came up to me in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Who went to bed first you or Mr. Hodson? - I; I went to bed about a quarter past twelve. I locked my apartment up; the tap room and the bar below.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the key? - Carried it to bed along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure any other part of the house? - No, only the lower part.</p>
               <p>Q. You fastened the windows of the lower part? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How near is any watchman to your house? - About two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning? - Five o'clock; I was the first up in the house. I found the tap room door open, and I found the bar broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sleep below stairs or above? - Below stairs, on the ground floor, in a little parlour, facing the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the lower bar? -About three or four yards. I found the bar door broke open, and the staple broke off of the lock, and the tap room door open.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you left it at night? -Shut it to; there is no lock to it, only a latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing out of your bar? - Yes; a new pair of shoes wrapped up in brown paper; they had taken the shoes and left the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had these shoes been left there? - Only one night, by a brother of mine, who made them for one Mr. Briggs; he was to call for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Briggs, where did he live? - In Somers Town.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what was missing from that bar of your own knowledge? - Not any thing particular. I found all the drawers pulled out, and the cupboard door broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever afterwards see any thing that you knew to be the property of Mr. Hodson? - No, only I can swear to the shoes; I have not seen them yet.</p>

            , and Hazle, and another man, and thinks I to myself, here are three men that broke open the house in Gower-street, a little time before. These two prisoners had two bundles, each of them a bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way were they coming? - Out of the Turnpike road, that leads from Paddington to Islington, into a brick field belonging to one Mr. Haycroft.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a road through the field? - No, there is not where they were going.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did they pass you? - Their clothes touched me. I said to them good morning to you, gentlemen, and the words they said to me were, good morning to you watchman; and the words they said to one another were, that watchman has got some suspicion of us, then says the other we had better go across the fields; I cannot say which of them it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to them when you heard them say so? - I was not four yards from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when they said that? - Just at the back side of Southampton place; they came into the fields to go to the south side of Southampton-place; then the other says, we will go our way into a turnpike road again, and then he will not have so much suspicion as he has got.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before you had wished them a good morning? - Just afterwards. Then I made the best of my way to the front of my houses along side of the road; and then thinks I to myself, they were a parcel of bad fellows, and I went on a reservoir which the new river company are making there just at the back side of the King's Head, at the corner of Tottenham Court-road, and I see the prisoners looking about them, all three of them; then I see them go into Charles-street, near Tottenham Court-road; they were about four hundred yards from me when they went into Charles-street, and then I thought if there was another watchman in Charles-street, which I used to find there, I thought we might take all these three fellows there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160185"></xptr>Q. Did you find any watchman in Charles-street? - No; I went and called one Croker up; I found him at home; he is one of the patrols belonging to Bow-street; I went to him, No. 4, Tottenham-court road; I called him up; and the words he said to me were, what is the matter, Underwood?</p>
               <p>Q. You told him your suspicions? - Yes; and he went with me; we went out of the New-road into Fitzroy-square, and the first watchman I met I asked if he had seen three men with two bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the three men again? - Yes, I see them again between Windmill-street and Percy-street, in Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the watchman that you enquired of in the square? - I cannot say; he is the watchman now in the square.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go from Fitzroy-square? - All the way down John-street into Windmill-street; then went out of Windmill-street into Tottenham court-road, down as far as Percy-street, and I turned myself round and see these two prisoners at the bar coming down Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Croker with you or not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other man with them or not? - No, he was not. And the words I said to Croker were, here are a couple of them coming. I went up towards them to meet them, and as soon as Henry Hale see me coming within the reach of the bundle he said, d-n your eyes, take that; he threw the bundle at me, and away he ran; Croker picked up the two bundles; then I ran as far as Windmill-street after Hale, and I ran into John-street, and in John-street Hale pulled this frock out of his bosom and said, d-n you, then take that too; I picked it up, and I followed him as far as Colvil-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both run the same way up Tottenham-court-road? - Yes, till they came to Store-street and Windmill-street, then Hazle turned up Store street, and the other, Hale, up Windmill-street. I followed him as far as Colvil-court, and into John-street, till I was almost out of breath, and I see two watchmen that stood at the bottom, and I begged them to stop this Hale; I cried out stop thief! and they never offered to put their hands to him, and they let him go; then in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour Hale was brought backup to me, at the Sun, by one Turner (he is here) the corner of Windmill-street; then after we had Hale to the watch-house, then we went to a place where we thought they came across the fields, into a field belonging to Squire Mortimer. I never see him go across the field, nor never see him in the fields but that was the strait road for him to come to Southampton-place.</p>
               <p>Q. From where? - You may come across from the Duke of Boulton's, and several other places. It is the way I thought they came. When we came there we went to see the ballast there, what they put on the turnpike-road, and I see it as if scattered about fresh; then I searched out, with a stick that I carry with me every night, and I searched out some tea and sugar, tied up in an handkerchief, and we searched about a little bit longer, and we found another bundle of linen, and table cloths, stockings, and a child's frock, in the next heap to it. Then after that I had intelligence that Hazle was taken down to St. Giles's watch house.</p>
               <p>Q. Croker was with you at this time? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing more of Hazle at that time? - No, I see him pass up Store-street.</p>
               <p>Q. To what watch-house did you take Hale? - To Pancras watch-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160186"></xptr>Q. What was it that led you to go search this field of Mortimer's? - I thought these men had come across that field, because as I heard two men at watch in Store street say that they see two or three men in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is this field to any place where you see the prisoners? - It is just along side, it is but just a road that parts the field from my row of houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason for knowing whether the prisoners had been in this field or not? - I had reason enough, because from the corner of my beat I had seen nobody in the road. I never see them in Mortimer's field.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was Mortimer's fields to any place where you had seen them? - Not thirty yards from my place, Southampton place; they came out of the road into my field.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did see them, were they coming as from that road? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you ever see them to Mortimer's field? - It was about fifty yards from it, where they met me in the field. When I was up at the end of my place I could not hear or see any body in the road, and when I came out of my place again I see them.</p>
               <p>Jury. Mortimer's field is the front of Southampton place? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the things you found in Mortimer's field? - Croker has them. I picked up this frock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are a watchman, sir, you seem at your ease here? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been here before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is your watch-house? - Pancras watch-house, is about a quarter of a mile from Southampton-place.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is the next watchman belonging to the watch-house to which you belong? - In Charles-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you generally carry a rattl with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a rattle with you on this occasion? - I had; I never sprung my rattle till I got into Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when the men were gone away you sprung your rattle? - No, he was not gone away; he was in my sight when I sprung the rattle.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not this field immediately adjoining that road? - No, near about forty yards from where the common sewer goes across.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you not see them cross the field if they had come across that field? - No, I could not; it was a foggy morning.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance were they when you accosted them, and they accosted you? - They came along side of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that these men, having these bundles with them, were so incautious as to say that you had a suspicion of them? - Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after that you also swear that they mentioned the road they were going saying we will go across the field into the turnpike road? - Yes, but they said something before that, that was part of what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is this reservoir where you went to reconnoitre? - At the back side of the King's Head, at Mr. Francis's cow yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts did you see them? - In the turnpike road.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance when you got on this reservoir was it to the place where you saw the prisoners at the bar? - They were going into Charles-street, not ten yards from the reservoir, just across the turnpike road.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say that before they were ten yards out of your sight, you thought it necessary for to get on a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160187"></xptr>place of this kind on purpose to see them, do you mean to swear that too? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that this was a very foggy morning, I think it would not assist you much to get on the top of a reservoir on a foggy morning? - You know it sometimes comes over, and then it casts away again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay on this reservoir? - About five or six, or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left this reservoir, you went from there to Mr. Croker? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were going to Mr. Croker, you stopped to speak to somebody in the road? - No, I did not. till I came to Fitzroy-square, after I called Mr. Croker up.</p>
               <p>Q. If you could see them on the reservoir, they could see you on the reservoir? - They might if they had looked back, I don't doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently they must have known that you got there only for the purpose of watching their movements? - I don't know what their thoughts were.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned with Mr. Croker? what distance of time? - When I see them again it was about a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was it from the time that you got off this reservoir, to the time that you see Croker? - About five minutes, I cannot say to a few minutes, it was not more than ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time that you see Croker, to the time that you returned to this place, and see Hale and Hazle? - Not a quarter of an hour after, I see Croker.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was it you first see these men after you returned with Croker? - I went towards Percy street, and I see these two men coming down Tottenham Court road, towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it of course they must see you? - Yes, when I came pretty handy to them.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance is Percy-street from this reservoir? - About a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me what reward there is on this occasion? - I never had nothing in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you guess what reward there is on conviction of a burglary - What can I guess when I don't know any thing at all about a reward?</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath you don't know nothing about a reward? - I do not upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it since you was at Great Marlborough-street? - The 7th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the sitting magistrate on that day? - I cannot say who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Conant the sitting magistrate? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now upon your oath before Mr. Conant, had you not a squable about the division of the reward, even before this man was committed for trial? - I never heard it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no squable with any other persons? - I had not; I was bound over with a forty pounds appearance, that is all I know about money.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the conductors of the patrole belonging to Bow-street</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - At Tottenham court, in Hampstead-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the 7th of July? - Yes, between three and four in the morning Underwood called me up, he told me he had seen three men together, of whom he had suspicion; I dare say it was not three minutes before I came out to him; I got up and dressed myself, and put my cutlass under my coat, and came out directly, I dare say I was not four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160188"></xptr>minutes dressing myself; he told me that they had crossed the field across the Hampstead-road, and into Charles-street, I knew the direction of the place very well; we ran up the new road, towards Paddington, then crossed Fitzroy-square, into Russell-place, and down Charles street; I believe that Underwood ran into another street, but in our pursuit we had not overtaken these fellows, we ran very fast indeed, we had given it up almost, we had got as far as Percy-street in Tottenham Court-road, through different streets below Percy-street, towards St. Giles's, and we thought we had passed them, and we turned back, and Underwood turned round and said, master, here they are, he knew them, I had not seen them before that moment; he said, here are two of them coming, I see the two, and I told him to make on towards them, and I kept in a line; he walks pretty smart to them, as soon as he got pretty near them, they each of them ran.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough before they ran, to take notice of their persons? - In regard to their clothes I was, more particular with regard to Hale than I am of Hazle; they ran from Percy street towards Windmill-street and Store-street; just as they ran, being apprehensive who we was, I drew my cutlass; each of them dropped a bundle from under their arm, they dropped them between Percy-street and Windmill-street, and this bottle of spirits was dropped on the stones, and did not break.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who dropped it? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of these things that were so dropped? - I picked them all up as quick as I could; and the public house was open at the corner of Windmill-street, the sign of the Sun; I got these things into the public house, and put them into a seat, and then pursued down Store-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the bundles? - No, I had not time, it was momentary; I pursued then after that prisoner, Hazle, down Store-street; Underwood pursued Hale up Windmill-street; when I got down Store-street, some of the people told me that he was got off, and I returned towards the Sun.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him in Store-street? - I did not; I see him take that way; I was returning to the corner of Store-street, I looked up, and there I see Hale in the possession of a couple of watchmen, towards the Sun, in the road, coming up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those two watchmen here? - Yes. I then ran towards Hale, and the watchman that had got him in possession, and I came with them to the public house, the Sun, and there I searched them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have had them bundles in your possession ever since? - I have, except leaving them over the way while I have been waiting here.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you absent from the Sun, before you returned to them again? - About three or four minutes. The watchmen then took Hale to the watch-house, then Underwood expressed, to me something of suspicion, that seeing them coming across the fields where his beat was, where were some gravel pits; in consequence of which I went with him to this field; they call it Squire Mortimer's fields, it adjoins Upper Gower-street; he shewed me the pit, I see then some of the Gravel which had been turned over.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you made the observation yourself, or he and you together? - Both together; there in turning over the place we found two table cloths, and a napkin, and a little child's frock, and one pair of stockings, in another place, just by, in the gravel, this I pulled up, or he, I am not sure, we were both together; this bundle containing two handkerchiefs, a quantity<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160189"></xptr>of tea and some sugar, in consequence of which we took this out, and was going towards home, and we met a gentleman with two young women with him, coming towards my house to inform me that a house was broke open near that spot, and that another man was taken, and that he was in St. Giles's watch house, and Underwood and I went and see him in St. Giles's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Which prisoner did you see there? - Hazle.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that Hazle was one of the two men that you pursued? - I am not so positive to him as I am to Hale, I believe him to be the man, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very sure that Hale is one of the men? - Yes, I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when Hazle was searched? - No, I was not; it was an hour and better before I was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say very fairly, Croker, you are not so positive to Hazle as to Hale? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance might the prisoners be from you at the time you first see them? - Fifty or sixty, or a hundred yards it may be.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a tolerable clear morning? - No, it was a foggy morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that the last witness spoke to you about this reward? -He never in my life asked me such a question; I know there is a reward, but if any of them had asked me such a question I should immediately have stopped his tongue.</p>

Do you remember this 7th of July? - Yes; I was standing at the corner of Charles-street, Rathbone-place; about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after four in the morning, I see Croker and the watchman coming down Charles-street, Rathbone-place, nearly opposite Percy Chapel, coming towards me, running as hard as ever they could, I asked the watchman what was the matter? he told me that they were in pursuit of three thieves.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. What do you mean by each throwing a bundle? - As soon as we came up they threw the two bundles away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick them? - I did not, I pursued one of the prisoners, Hazle, and he puts his hand into his coat pocket, and took a bottle out, and threw it away, and smashed it against the pavement; I pursued him down Store-street, and in pursuing him down Store-street he puts his hand into his pocket again, and slung a black silk stocking, new vamped, on the ground, and I picked it up; I pursued him as far as Gower-street, Bedford-square, and he ran out of my reach, and then I turned back, and gave the stocking to Underwood; I see him running down as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160190"></xptr>far as the long fields, I see him running down the new road leading to the Duke of Bolton's, I see him at a distance; he over run me, I could not run any longer.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see either of the prisoners? - This same morning; when I went back I see Hale with the four watchmen, coming up Windmill-street, I knew the man very well as soon as I see him; I never see him till I see him at the office, about eleven o'clock the same morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very sure that Hazle is the man that you pursued? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You seem very positive about this man; you pursued him and lost sight of him, and after that you met the prisoner Hale in custody of the watchmen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they say to you when you came up first, here, this is the man that you are looking after, and then you said yes? - They never spoke a word to me, only I assisted them.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you? - A watchman in Gower-street, Bedford-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember this morning, the 7th of July? - Yes, a little after four I heard a hue and cry of stop thief! come down Store-street, I had been just calling the hour of four, I was at the door, about No.22, Gower-street; several people came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any body particularly? - None but the prisoner Hazle; I see him about five or six doors up Store-street, he was coming towards Gower-street, towards the fields, running very fast; I ordered him to stop; I was in Store-street then; instead of his stopping he presented a pistol to me, and kept going on, I made a blow, thinking to catch him across the shins, to bring him down, I struck him on the outside of the left leg, but that did not shorten his pace; he took to the fields, and I finding he got the heels of me I sprung my rattle, and kept going on, and the watchman came from Southampton-row, and he seeing the watchman coming towards him, he went over some pales towards the Museum, into a little garden there, and said, good by, I am gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go in? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you pursue him? - To the corner of the pales going down from Gower-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him get over? - Close to the back door of the Museum gate into the field.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you when he spoke, good by, I am gone? - About the distance I am from your lordship. In a very little time afterwards I heard a servant woman call out, here is a man in our garden; I went round and was let in at No.3, and I went over the wall of No.3, into No. 2, and there he was in the garden, secured by a gentleman's servant, laying on the steps, on his back, almost fainting.</p>

               <p>Q. And that was the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, Hazle.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of the gentleman to whom this garden belonged? - I do not, no further than the number. I told him he must get up and come along with me, and I and another watchman brought him out; I asked him when I brought him out, where is the pistols that you had in your hand? pistols, says he, did you see any such thing in my hand? I told him yes, and would be on my oath of it; says he, you are a wicked man, you will swear any thing then. I conveyed him to the watch-house, I and another watchman, to St. Giles's, he was searched there by the watch-house-keeper, I was present; there was one black silk stocking found in his pocket, he said it was his own, and there should be a pair of them, and a silk handkerchief, but there was no handkerchief found in my presence.</p>

I ran down by the back of Montague House; I see the prisoner, Thomas Hazle, coming running along the fields, from Gower-street; my partner, Burnet, was after him, hallooing out stop thief! the prisoner had a pistol in his hand, but he did not offer to fire at me; he turned then short round and jumped into Sir Frederic Cavendish's garden, belonging to No.11; in Gower-street; I did not see the prisoner any more till he was brought out of No.2, to go to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him before he got into the garden? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him get in? - I did not; the first that I see of him was, his trying to make his escape over the wall, but could not; I gave an alarm where he was, and from that he kneeled down in the garden, behind some everlasting sun flowers; I see him doing something in the mould, but could not tell what he was doing of; he came up the garden and stepped on the steps that led down to the back room, stepped up on to the wall of No.1, Gower-street, went over the wall in No.1, Gower-street, from there I see no more of him till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the mould was searched, where you had seen him do something? - I searched it myself, and found a pistol, I have it, it was examined at the magistrate's.</p>

Did you apprehend either of the prisoners? - Yes, Hazle, I found him on the 7th of July, on an alarm, between three and four, both at the fore part of the house and at the back; a woman of the house came to me, saying, get up, there are some thieves about the house; I did not get up immediately, I suppose it might be about the space of two minutes; I went down stairs immediately, opened the back door, looked over the garden wall, on the right hand garden, where the prisoner was gone; I found him at a garden, at No.6, laying on the wall; I got up to the wall of No.7, he looked at me side ways; says I, what do you do here?</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him on the wall of No.6 or 7, before you got up? - I had not seen him on the wall of No.7; he goes running down the side of the wall of No.6, and jumped into the garden of No. 5; he goes out into No. 4, into No. 3,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160192"></xptr>and so on till he came to No.11, Bedford-square, which is the honourable Mr. Cavendish's garden; he could not escape that wall into the square, he made his return to come back again, he came down again from No.11 to No.1, Gower-street, on the top of the wall, from one garden to another; he comes from No.1 to No. 11 the same, in the out dwelling, which is Mr. Choir's; I takes hold of the prisoner, I asked him what business he had, and how he came there? he said that people had been using of him very ill, throwing sticks and stones at him, but intreated me in a very familiar manner to release him, and he said he would go off quietly about his business; I told him I should not release him, but I calls out watch, I knocks against the door, there was no knocker, but I kicks at the door with what violence I could, to make them let the watchman through there; it was near five minutes before any person came, at No.3 a servant got up, and they came over the wall of No.3 to me, but they took the prisoner through the passage of No.2; I delivered him up to the watchman, and held him by the slap of his coat through the passage, and went with him by the watchman, holding him by his coat; when he was taken to the watch-house he was then examined, I was present when this black silk stocking was taken out of his pocket, he said it was one of his, that there was another of them, but some how or other  he had lost it, there should be a pair; he felt in the pockets himself, and said that there should be another, he did not find another; there was nothing more found on him.</p>

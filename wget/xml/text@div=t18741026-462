                  </hi>. I am a telegraph clerk, and live at 43, Villa Street, Walworth—on 16th October, about 5.45 p.m., I was on the platform of Ludgate Hill Railway Station waiting for a train—I had been sitting down and had my hand in my pocket to preserve my purse—it was safe then—on the arrival of the train I got up and disengaged my hand from my pocket to open the carriage door—the prisoner pushed roughly by me—I looked round and saw him, and at the same I felt the weight of a hand in my pocket—I put my hand in my pocket and missed my purse directly—the prisoner ran past me and I ran after him as fast as possible—I called out "Stop that man, he has my purse"—I saw him stopped, and a gentleman gave me my purse—it contained 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and my season ticket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A good many people were waiting for the train—I don't know that two trains had come in from the City—I did not lose sight of the prisoner for an instant—my purse contained exactly the same when I opened it at the police-station—the people did not get before me when I called out "Stop that man,"They were too much taken by surprise and I was surprised too—I felt flurried certainly—the whole affair was instantaneous.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector at Ludgate Hill Station—I was on duty on 16th October at 5.45 in the evening on the opposite platform to where the witness was—I saw a train come in from the Viaduct Station and I heard some one call out "Stop that man, he has got my purse"—I ran across the line to the opposite platform, and saw the prisoner running down the platform as fast as he could and the last witness close by his side so that she could have taken hold of his coat at any moment—two gentlemen attempted to stop him, but he got past them, and he was stopped going down the staircase—I saw a gentleman with the purse in his hand and he gave it to the lady.</p>

            . My husband is a gardener; we live in Chester-mews; I paid the prisoner 2s. on Bland's account one Monday, two days before Bland was liberated.</p>
               <p>JOHN BLAND. Q. Did you desire the prisoner to receive these bills? A. Yes; I gave them to my wife for him; the money was never brought to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he a journeyman? A. Yes; he was to have 14s. a week; I had paid him nothing; I ordered him myself to collect the bills.</p>
               <p>ANN BLAND. I sent the prisoner for these bills; he accounted to me on the 18th of October; he gave me 5s. from Foster, and said that was all they could pay then, but on Wednesday they would pay the rest; he said Jenkin was so ill she could not pay any money; on Wednesday he gave me 7s. more from Foster.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you pay him his wages? A. They were not due; I paid him 3s.; I did not give him leave to keep these sums for wages; he had been but sixteen days with us; I authorised him to go and sell twelve quarts of peas, and bring the money to me, not to pay his wages; I never had the money - Mr. Bland's mother was not at the house - she lives in the country - there was an execution in the house, but the peas had not been seized - the officer saw me send them out.</p>

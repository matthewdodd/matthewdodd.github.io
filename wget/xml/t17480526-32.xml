               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner live in your house?</p>
               <p>Fowler. She did not live in the house, but she used to <rs id="t17480526-32-deflabel189" type="occupation">open and shut shop</rs>

               <p>Q. When did you miss the snuff-box?</p>
               <p>Fowler. In a quarter of an hour; I did not miss the other things then. My daughter met her a little after the last Sessions , and got her to my house. I cannot say that she took them; I only mentioned the box to her, and she absolutely denied it, and I let her go, and left it to God and her own conscience. I saw her afterwards at her master's, and there she acknowledged , that she took the snuff box off the ground, but did not take it out of the shew-glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give it you again?</p>
               <p>Fowler. I have it, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. You said she denied it.</p>
               <p>Fowler. She denied it, when she was at my house, but she could not do it at her master's, because there were so many people that knew of her having it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the ring?</p>
               <p>Fowler . Yes; she sold it that very day to buy her a bever hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say as to the ear wires?</p>
               <p>Fowler . I did not take any notice of them till she was committed, and then I took them out of her ears . I do not want to aggravate the crime, for she is but a young woman.</p>

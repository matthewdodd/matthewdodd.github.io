            . In consequence of something which passed between me and the proseutors, I applied to Godfrey, the Bow-street officer, and he came to my house, on the 16th of November; and in the course of that morning, the prisoner brought a letter to me. I observed that there were two prickles in his cart. I followed the cart in company with Godfrey. The prisoner first went to <placeName id="t18151206-158-crimeloc872">Bullstrode-street</placeName>

He there took one of the prickles out of the cart, and took it into the area. He then returned with a small hamper packed and corded, which he put into the cart. He then went into the house again, and brought out a prickle, which appeared to be completely empty. He then went to No.21, <placeName id="t18151206-158-crimeloc873">Crawford-street</placeName>

I looked down the area, and saw him looking at some empty bottles. He brought the prickle up full of empty bottles, and placed it in the cart; and then turned the cart round towards Holborn, and drove off; I was within thirty yards of him all the time; I never lost sight of the cart. When he got into Oxford-street, he crossed over into Charles street, Soho; that was not his nearest way, his nearest way was through Holborn. Then he drove into Greek-street, where there is an archway, which leads thence down Crown-street, into Phoenix-street. He stopped in Phoenix-street, and took the prickle which he had filled in Crawford-street, and carried it to the end of the street, and turned down into Stacey-street. I lost sight of him for a minute, and when I recovered it, he was gone into Wainwhight's shop. He keeps a bottle and rag shop.</p>

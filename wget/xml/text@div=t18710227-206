                  </hi>. I am a publisher's assistant, at 48, Charing Cross—on the morning of 9th February, in consequence of something I heard, I went to the Post Office, at Charing Cross, and made a communication to Mr. Hughes, one of the cashiers there—later in the day a message came to me from the Post Office, and I went there, and saw the prisoner, with this post-office order for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in his hand—he said he had obtained it from a gentleman, who asked him to go in and cash it, saying he would give him a shilling for the service, and told him to say it came from Campbell, of Glasgow—we have a customer of that name, and we are in the habit of re<lb></lb>ceiving orders from him, on an average, twice a week—the signature to the order is not mine, or any of our firm, or by our authority.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier, at the Money Order Office, Charing Cross—on the morning of 9th February, the last witness came there, and made a communication to me—about 3 o'clock that afternoon the prisoner came to the office, and presented this order, and asked for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., saying it was sent by Campbell, of Glasgow—I detained him, and walked him into the private room—I asked him where he obtained the order from—he said it was given to him by a man outside the office, who asked him to get 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash for it, and he should be rewarded with 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his trouble—I sent a messenger over to Mr. Spon—I asked the prisoner if he could describe the gentleman outside the office—he said yes, he could; and he described him as being tall, with a dark beard, black hat, and brown overcoat—I sent for a constable—I produce the advice of the order, it is payable to the firm of E. and F. N. Spon—the date of issue is 8th February.</p>

I took the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody—he said that the order was given him by a tall man, with long whiskers and brown overcoat, outside the office—I asked if he could identify the man—he said he could—I asked where he was—he said in Langley Street; that would be some quarter of a mile away—he first said outside the Post Office; secondly, in Langley Street; and thirdly, in Agar Street—that would be 400 yards away from each other—I did not see any such man—I went to see.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not allow the prisoner to see if he could find the man, because he made three different statements of where the man was—I did not think it likely that he could be in all three places.</p>

                  </hi> I am a bullion dealer, and live at No. 10, Lombard-street. It is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Mary, Woolnoth—on the 22nd of Jan. the prisoner came into my office—I am sure he is the man—he asked to look at one of four gold chains which were lying in a tray in the window—I took out the tray, and showed him the chains—he took one—I took it to the scale to weigh it while he was looking at the other three, and in an instant he <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> out of the office, and I discovered a chain was lost—no one else could have taken it but him—I ran after him, but he was gone—on Friday week last the prisoner came again into my office, and asked to see one of the lever watches that was in the window—I immediately recognised him as the same man who had taken the chain—I whispered to my partner, who was behind the counter—the prisoner saw me do so, and he immediately ran out of the office, and ran through Pope's Head-alley, which is nearly opposite—I ran after him with my partner and shop-boy, all crying, "Stop thief"—he ran towards Cornhill, near the Bank of England the officer stopped him, and he was brought back to the office—I charged him with the case—he at first denied it—at last he said, "Now it is no use, it is done, and if you will look over it, I will try and be an honest man, you shall have the money," or something to that effect, or, "If you will be quiet, you shall have the money."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you generally wear glasses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do, but I am long-sighted—this was in Jan. last, in the evening, perhaps between four and five—the gas had been alight for some time—I gave a description of the prisoner to the police, as near as I could remember his features—I have a partner named Baugham—he does not live in this house, but at Greenwich—it is his house as well as mine—I live in it—there are servants in the house—I pay the domestic servants—some of our joint servants sleep in the house—I remember having seen the prisoner in the shop once before Jan.—I cannot say exactly when—I described him at the station to the inspector or one of the officers on duty—my partner is not here—I came up to the prisoner about the same time as the policeman, and took him back to the shop—I cannot say how long he remained there—I dare say it was an hour—the policeman was not there with him all the time—my friend Mr. Samuel was there—he had dropped in casually—the prisoner remained there during the time his father was sent for—he wished his father sent for—the policeman requested to go on duty, to Cornhill, as he was on duty there, and I kept the prisoner till his father arrived—I said, "I am surprised that such a respectable-looking young man as you should be guilty of such a thing as stealing a chain," and then he said, "I am very sorry for it, it is done, and if you will look over it, I will give you the money," or something to that effect—he did not deny it—he did deny it at first—he said, "Are you sure it was me?"—I consider that the same thing as a denial—I told him to give me up the chain or the money—I did not say, if he gave me up the chain and money there would be nothing more said about it—I did not</p>

               <p>make him any promise—if I had got the chain or the money, I certainly should have kept him—the words he made use of were, "I will send for my father, and if you will look over it, if you will say nothing about it," as near that as possible, "you shall have the money, and I will try to be an honest man"—I had told him I wanted the chain—I said nothing about the money then—I said, "Let me have the chain or the money"—I kept him there till him father came—his father remained, perhaps, a quarter of an hour—the pri<lb></lb>soner remained till his father's return—some policemen were at the door, and the other policeman returned repeatedly—the father went away, and was to come back again, but he did not—the prisoner was taken to the station-house immediately after the father went away.</p>

                  </hi> I was at the prosecutor's on the day the pri<lb></lb>soner was there—the prosecutor spoke to him, and the prisoner said, "If you will look this matter over this time, I will endeavour to be honest in future."</p>

Q.</hi> How long were you in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Altogether about an hour—I left for ten minutes out of that time—the prisoner was there all the time—there were several customers in and out of the shop—I did not know them—Mr. Spielman's partner was there—I rather think he had not the same opportunity of bearing what was said that I had—I cannot say that any one, except myself and Spielman, heard it—I believe there was some<lb></lb>thing said about the money or the return of the chain—Mr. Spielman did not in my hearing say, that the prisoner had better send for his father, and let him bring the price of the chain—he did not say, "You had better give the chain up, and nothing more shall come of it; I only want the chain"—I remained till the prisoner's father came—I was not present at the interview—he beckoned to Mr. Spielman, I believe, and took him on one side—I did not hear what passed between them—they were talking together, perhaps, two or three minutes—I think the father expected to come back—I am not positive—I say that, because the prisoner waited there about fifteen minutes after his father went away—I did not accompany the prisoner to the station-house—I was in the house when he was taken by the policeman—that was from fifteen to thirty minutes after the father left.</p>

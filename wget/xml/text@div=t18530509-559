                  </hi>. I am staying at the Black Cap, in High-street, Camden Town. On Saturday, 2nd April, I was in the bar about 9 o'clock at night—the two prisoners came in together—Smith asked for half a quartern of gin and peppermint—she gave me in payment a sixpence—I gave her a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece in change—it was a black-looking one, and she refused to take it—I gave her another—I laid the sixpence down on a little counter a little below the other counter—the prisoners went away together—I left the sixpence on the counter, and our barman saw it—I saw him take it up, and he said it was a bad one—I saw him take it from the place where I put it—the prisoner came back in about two hours, about 11 o'clock—I did not see them come in, but I came into the bar, and saw them there—they had half a quartern of gin and peppermint again—they paid for that in copper money—while they were drinking it I came in, and they put the measure towards me, and asked me for half a quartern of peppermint, and I think Harris gave me a sixpence for that—I tried it, and it bent—I went to the barman, and I said, "Here are those two women who have uttered another bad sixpence"—I gave it to the barman, and he gave the prisoners into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Black Cap. On 2nd April I saw both the prisoners, at 9 o'clock in the evening—I cleared all the money out of the till, and in turning round I ran against the other barman, and that caused me to see the prisoners, because they laughed—they were objecting to a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece that was given them—I saw the sixpence lying on the counter—I saw it was bad—I ran after the prisoners, who were then gone—I came back, marked the sixpence, and put it on the shelf—I saw the prisoners again at 11 o'clock standing at the bar—I saw Harris offer a sixpence—Mrs. Spratt took it up—she tried it, and bent it, and gave it to me—the prisoner said, "Give me half a quartern of gin and peppermint," in great haste—they had not drunk what they had—I sent for a constable, and gave the prisoners in charge, and gave the two sixpences to the constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Smith. Q.</hi> You said you marked the sixpence when you took it, but you marked it at the station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I marked it again at the station; I had marked it before.</p>

On 2nd April, about 11 o'clock, I took the prisoner in the Black Cap—Harris said she had only been out a short time, and she had met the other prisoner, whom she had known since they were school-children, and they went to have something to drink—they said they had not been in the house before—I asked them their address at the station—they hesitated a long time, and refused, and said one place and another—one said they lived at Camden-town, but did not say the street—at last they gave an address, No. 7, Brackly-street, Bridge water-gardens—I went there, but could not learn anything of them—these are the two six-pences I received from Mr. Shelley.</p>

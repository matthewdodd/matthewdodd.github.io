                  </hi>. I live in Princes-street, St. George's, and am a baker of ship-biscuits. On the afternoon of the 21st of Nov. I sent 14cwt. of biscuits, six bushels of peas, and a sack of barley, to the ship <hi rend="italic">Harpy,</hi> which laid in a dry dock at Mill-wall—the peas were sent on a truck by a lad—the sack now produced is mine, and this bushel of peas in it, are the same sort as I sent.</p>

I was on duty in Ropemaker's-fields, and saw the truck broken down near Taylor's brew house—I watched it, and saw the prisoner hanging about the place for some time—I then saw him take the sack, put it on his shoulder, and go down Church-row to Hope<lb></lb>lane, which is a very dark place—I tapped him on the shoulder, and asked what he was going to do with the peas—he said, "A man has had an acci<lb></lb>dent, and broken down his truck; he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to carry these peas up here"—I took him back—there was no man there, and I took him to the station.</p>

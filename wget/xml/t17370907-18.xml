            . The Prisoner came into my Shop the 19th of July, to pawn a Shirt. I was above Stairs, but I had left a little Girl in the Shop, and while the Girl was calling me, the Prisoner (it seems) run away with these Things; for when I came down Stairs, the Girl was bellowing at the Door, and told me that that Lady there at the Bar, was gone off with the Bundle. I sent the Girl after her, and the Mob took her.</p>

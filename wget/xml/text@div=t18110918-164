On the 17th of August, the prisoner was working at a new house of Mr Pocock's; I had sent the cart there the day before with lead. The officer brought the prisoner to me with the lead and solder; he said he had stopped the prisoner with this lead; the prisoner said he hoped I would be merciful to him, it was his first offence, and it was my property.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol On Saturday, about nine o'clock in the evening, I stopped the prisoner in Penton-street, Pentonville; he had this lead tied up in a handkerchief on his shoulder; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said he was going to meet his master at Aldgate to do a job there; I took him back, and sent for his master; his master denied it; I asked him if he had got any more; he said no; I searched his waistcoat pocket, and found this folder.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The lead is worth about seven shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

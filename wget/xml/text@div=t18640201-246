               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402010048"></xptr>
               <p>about the quantity of water allowedâ€”I did not hear the captain say, "Drink salt water then"â€”the watch on deck were allowed the privilege of sleeping under a sail on deck when we did not want them, so that they could lie down and rest themselves thereâ€”they were supposed to be always handy, but sometimes they would not be awakened all night in warm weatherâ€”I never heard them complain that they were not permitted to sleep in their berths, but were compelled to sleep under this sailâ€”Lyons was the man that spoke the best English on board; next to him Carlosâ€”I am not aware whether Carlos usually talked Spanish among the crew; I think they always received our orders in English; they always understood us in Englishâ€”Lyons and Powell gave them orders in Englishâ€”the orders were given to Lyons and Powell by the captain, the first mate, and myself, and by them translated to the othersâ€”that practice continued after the death of the captain, as far as the navigation of the vessel was concernedâ€”when I wanted to communicate anything to the crew I communicated to Lyons.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">English names, and speaking the English language. In addition to that, there is a piece of evidence furnished by the prisoners themselves on this subject, viz., their request that the ship may not be taken to any place where there were English authorities; which would imply that such a place would be one where they would be most in danger. I am of opinion, therefore, that there is abundant evidence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">whether it is inevitably proved is another matter</hi>) <hi rend="italic">upon which the Jury may find that this was a British ship. As to the other objection, that there is no evidence that the Flowery Land, named in the certificate, is the Flowery Land in question, that is for the Jury: we have it that this particular ship was a British ship, in addition to which it has been held over and over again, that identity of name is abundant evidence of identity of the thing. The only thing I was about to look at further, was whether there was any statement in the certificate of who the captain was; I do not see it; but it is a matter of perfect indifference, because, independently of that, there is abundant evidence, to my mind, that the ship is the ship named in the certificate, and independently of the certificate, there is other evidence upon which the Jury might well come to the conclusion that this was a British ship.

               <p>a passenger on board—the name of the first mate was John Carswell—the steward's name was <hi rend="italic">Aboo</hi>—he was a Malay—the cook was a Chinaman; I do not know his name—there was also a boy who attended to the lamps; I don't know his name, but we called him <hi rend="italic">Cassa</hi>—Michael Anderson was the carpenter—there was a Frenchman, an able seaman, called Candereau—the prisoners were all seamen, able or ordinary, on board—some short time after sailing there were some complaints by the captain about some of these men being deficient in their duty—I never saw the captain use any violence—I have heard him call them names, "<hi rend="italic">Coolies</hi>," and "Sons of bitches"—the men complained about the food and water, which was attended to directly and rectified—I heard Blanco make one complaint, and that was attended to—he did not think that the scale of victualling and articles was enough, and wanted more—I remember about the commencement of September Carlos being wanted on deck—the mate and I went and asked him several times to come on deck—he would not come, and the mate took hold of him and pulled him out of his berth—he said he was sick, and wanted his watch below—all the watch stopped below with him—they were Marcelino, Marco, Watter, Blanco, and Chaucis (<hi rend="italic">Lopez</hi>), Carlos, and two others; I don't re<lb></lb>member their names—the mate and I brought Carlos <hi rend="italic">aft</hi> on to the quarter<lb></lb>deck—all the rest turned to their work but Carlos—he would not turn to, and the mate ordered me to bind him fast to the rigging—I made him fast, and he remained bound for about five minutes—the captain then came up out of the cabin, and inquired what was the matter, and gave me orders to loose him, and he gave him some medicine, and he went below and turned into his berth for the day—some days afterwards I remember a quarrel between Carlos and Blanco—I and the mate interfered to stop them from fighting—the mate and Carlos struggled together, and the mate gave him a blow; I can't say for certain where, but he gave him one, I think—I re<lb></lb>member the night that the captain was killed—I had the first watch, from 8 to 12—Mr. Carswell, the chief mate, relieved me at 12—his watch lasted from 12 till 4 in the morning—when I was relieved I turned in—there is a house on deck, divided into four compartments—the prisoners lodged in one compartment, on the port side; the fore compartment; not all the crew; these eight prisoners, and Powell and Williams—those ten occupied the fore compartment, on the port side—on the starboard side, were the carpenter, Candereau, a seaman, and the boy Early—on the starboard side aft was the cook's galley, and on the port side aft the boatswain's store—on going down the companion ladder, the first berth on the port side was the mate's; the next was the captain's brother, and the next aft was mine—the captain occupied all the starboard side himself—the main cabin was between, with a sky-light opening on to the poop—I turned in at 12 o'clock the night the captain was killed—I was awoke by a noise on deck, about 3 o'clock—it was a noise like a beating or hammering on the companion—I instantly ran out of my berth and tried to get on deck to see what was wrong—I could not get on deck for some person lying on his face on the companion ladder, with his head parallel with the top step—a number of persons were beating him on the head with hand-spikes or capstan bars—I recognised one of them to be Blanco—at the same time I received a blow that hurled me right down the companion again into the cabin—I took hold of the man they were beating, and tried to pull him away, but I was not able to move him—I then called out to the captain for assistance, but got no answer—I went into his berth, and found that he was gone—I then went into the main cabin; I trimmed the light, which was very dim, and I found</p>

               <p>the captain lying dead, and a pool of blood round him—his night dress was all full of cuts on the left side—I then went into the captain's brother's berth—I found him gone also—I next went back to the companion, and examined the man who was lying in the companion, and found it to be the captain's brother by his dress—I then went into my berth, and locked the door—the noise was going on all this time, for about three-quarters of an hour—the noise ceased about five minutes after I went into my berth, and they kept calling me several times on deck—it was some of the men; who it was I don't know; I did not recognise their voices—at the end of about three-quarters of an hour a great many of these men came down in the cabin—Lyons was spokesman; there was Blanco, Duranno, Santos, Chancis (Lopez), and Carlos, and some others—the parties that I have mentioned circled round my cabin—there were some behind them—I could not see who they were, but these I am sure of—Lyons called me out of my berth—I asked him what he was going to do with me; if he was going to kill me—he answered no—he said they had killed the captain and the mate, and the captain's brother had got away somewhere; they did not know where—he said, "I do not know where"—he meant to say that he had got away somewhere, or stowed away—he did not say they had killed him; he had got away from them, or something to that effect.</p>

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What next? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They wished me to navigate the vessel to some place so that they could get on shore—I asked him where I was to navigate her to—I understood from him that there was nobody on board that knew anything about navigation; none of these men—the other prisoners were all in the main cabin at the time Lyons spoke to me; they were all close to him; within hearing—I had opened my door, and come out at this time—all the prisoners were near enough to hear what Lyons said—I mean those that I have mentioned; Blanco, Duranno, Lopez, Watter, Carlos, and Santos—I asked where I was to navigate the ship to—Carlos told me to the River Plate or Buenos Ayres—Carlos spoke in English when he told me that—he said it was a good country, and plenty of Spanish people there—that was all that passed then about navigating the vessel—the ship was then 19 south and 36 west—the next thing I saw was Marco Watto with a rope round the captain's neck, in the act to haul his body up out of the cabin—I begged of him to allow me to sew him up in canvas, as I did not like to see his body going overboard like that—he allowed me to do so, and I sewed him up—I went on deck about 5 in the morning—I saw Santos when I went up—I passed him on the deck—he was armed with a large knife, and he put his hand on it in a very threatening manner—about 8 in the morning all hands were mustered in the cabin—all hands came into the cabin, with the exception, I think, of the man at the wheel; I don't know who that was—Lyons spoke in English to me, and said the men wished to have free access to the captain's berth; they wanted to see what money and clothes he had got—the chief actors in gathering up the money were Blanco, Lopez, Watter, and Carlos; the others were sitting round about in the cabin, but I can't remember what they were busy about—they rummaged all the boxes and desks—when the only was all gathered up it was put on the table in the main cabin—Lyons told me to share it into seventeen parts—Watter objected to that, and mentioned eight—he speaks some few words</p>

               <p>in English, but he spoke in Spanish—I understand a little Spanish—I ob<lb></lb>jected to divide it out; I said I did not want to have any share in it—Lyons said I should have a share in it, and to divide it out amongst them—I objected to do it, and said they could do it without me, but Lyons insisted that I should do it, and I shared it out in seventeen parts—I put my share into the writing-desk, and never saw it after—the four that were the chief actors in gathering up the money gathered out the clothes as well—they did not ask me to divide them; every one took what they liked; I don't know exactly who took them; all that were in the cabin, I believe; I did not take much notice of what they did—I saw the captain's watch put into the writing-desk where I put my money; I don't remember who put it there—they put it there, they said, to sell it afterwards, they could not divide it—I saw chests of boots and shoes broken open, and each took what they liked out of them—I do not remember who helped themselves to those; I don't remember any names; all that were down there—they had not left the cabin—I don't know what became of the cap<lb></lb>tain's brother—the cargo consisted of bottled beer, wine, iron pipes, and bale goods—there was some champagne; that was broached—I saw cases of it knocking about the deck, and bottles of it, and all sorts of cloth and merchandise—who were the actors then I don't know—some few days after this had happened we saw a ship standing in the same course that we were—I asked Lyons if I might speak to her, as I wished to compare longitude—he said he did not think these men would allow me to speak to any vessel or hoist any signal, but he would go forward and speak to them, and see if they would allow me—he went forward, and came aft and said I might speak to her, but not to say anything about what had occurred—I steered towards the ship and spoke to her; she turned out to be an English ship from Liverpool, called <hi rend="italic">The Friends</hi>, bound to Buenos Ayres—Carlos told me to say the ship's name was <hi rend="italic">Louisa</hi>, and not to say where we came from, or where we were bound to—I gave the ship's name as <hi rend="italic">Louisa</hi>, from New Dieppe, bound to Valparaiso, forty-seven days out—I did that because I was afraid for my life; I gave that fictitious name because I was afraid if I did otherwise I should meet with the same fate as the captain and the mate—the other men were all on the quarter-deck at the time—after <hi rend="italic">The Friends</hi> had passed there was a great noise amongst these Manilla men, the Spaniards, and two Greeks—they were talking in Spanish—I could not understand them properly, but they looked very threatening, as if they were dissatisfied about something—Lyons told me that those who did not understand English thought I had told all about what had occurred—they did not actually do anything, but they were standing talking to one another, and casting very threatening looks at me—I remember on 30th September Watter being on deck; he took a knife to the steward, and cut him through the fleshy part of the arm, and put a cut in his right side about three inches long and half an inch deep—next day I was called in to the steward's berth—Blanco, Watter, Chancis, and Lyons were standing outside the door; Duranno was also there—I had got the steward to get all the captain's papers into his berth for safety—he had done so, and they were tearing them up and heaving them overboard—the steward was a Malay—they asked me if I knew anything about the papers and the gold watch—I said, "No"—Chan<lb></lb>cis spoke—he said they were looking for the gold watch they had lost—I told him I did not know anything about the watch—we made land on the morning of 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> October—we were about ten miles from land when we first sighted it—when we sighted land I could not get the crew to speak to me;</p>

               <p>they did not seem as if they required my services any more—they tacked the ship and stood off all day—when they had got about thirty or forty miles from land they scuttled the ship—about 8 o'clock at night Blanco came down into the cabin, and ordered me on deck—when I came up on deck I found they were <hi rend="italic">clewing</hi> up the sails and getting the boats over—I asked Lyons what he was going to do with the ship—he would not speak to me—about ten minutes afterwards Marcelino passed close to me—I asked him what they were going to do to-night, or if they were going to kill me—he said he was not, but he thought Blanco was—that was all that passed then—about three-quarters of an hour after that I got into the boat—there was the cook, the steward, Frank Powell, Watter, and the boy Early; that was all that were in that boat—the other part of the crew were some on board and some in the boat astern of the ship, made fast to the ship—the boat in which I was pulled away from the ship, about a hundred yards—we were called back by somebody from the ship; I could not recognise the voice—Powell, the cook, Early, and Watter were pulling—nobody in the boat wished to go back with the exception of Watter; he ordered Powell to pull the boat's head round, which Powell did not wish to do, and Watter used he oar to him and made him do so—the boat was then pulled back alongside the ship—Lyons spoke in English, and ordered us to come on deck—I did so—when I got on deck I saw Lyons and Duranno throwing bottles of champagne down into the boat—I heard the steward singing out some time afterwards in the water; he was singing out-to Lyons for help—he was in the water swimming—he never came ashore—I then went into the boat astern—I was ordered in by Lyons and Blanco—I stayed there about an hour and a half—several things were passed into the boat, but by whom I don't know; it was dark, and I could not see—after that hour and a half Lyons, Duranno, Chancis, and Blanco got into the boat; they were the last to leave the ship—the others were in the other boat; some were in the boat with me while these four men were on board—I saw the ship go down; she went down the very minute these men left her—I did not see the cook land ashore, or the lamp-trimmer, Cassa—we steered for land, our smaller boat being towed by the larger one—we landed at 4, P.M. on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> October—when we landed Lopez said I was to say it was an American ship from Peru, laden with guano, for Bordeaux, in France; and that she had foundered 500 miles out at sea, and that they had been in the boats five days and five nights; that the captain and the other sailors had got into another boat, and we had lost them during a heavy breeze of wind, and which way they went they did not know—I did not state that to anybody; I never got anybody to inquire of me; there was no one to speak English to—that night we stopped at a farm-house of a man named Corria; he afterwards drove me to a place called Rocha—that was on the 5th—I found out that there was a man in the camp who could talk English; that was some miles distant—I and Can<lb></lb>derean got into a cart—we found a person named Manuel Ramos, a store<lb></lb>keeper, who could speak English—we had to go twenty-one miles—none of the prisoners knew I was going, nobody but Candereau—we made a com<lb></lb>munication to Ramos—after that I went before the Naval Court at Monte Video.</p>

TINDAL ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the captain, when he left England, in the habit of drinking a good deal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not a great deal—he was not a temperate man, still he did not drink to any excess—there was a complaint made to the captain about the want of water—they were allowed three buckets a day—Blanco made a complaint</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402010048"></xptr>
               <p>about the quantity of water allowed—I did not hear the captain say, "Drink salt water then"—the watch on deck were allowed the privilege of sleeping under a sail on deck when we did not want them, so that they could lie down and rest themselves there—they were supposed to be always handy, but sometimes they would not be awakened all night in warm weather—I never heard them complain that they were not permitted to sleep in their berths, but were compelled to sleep under this sail—Lyons was the man that spoke the best English on board; next to him Carlos—I am not aware whether Carlos usually talked Spanish among the crew; I think they always received our orders in English; they always understood us in English—Lyons and Powell gave them orders in English—the orders were given to Lyons and Powell by the captain, the first mate, and myself, and by them translated to the others—that practice continued after the death of the captain, as far as the navigation of the vessel was concerned—when I wanted to communicate anything to the crew I communicated to Lyons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After you heard this dull sound of something going on on deck, when you saw the parties there, you say you saw Lyons; had he not a cut across the face, and was he not bleeding very severely? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was next morning, when he came down to call me out of my berth—that was the first time I saw him after the death of the captain—I did not see him go on deck afterwards to have his face dressed—it was a severe cut; he was bleeding very much—when I came out they said they were not going to hurt me—I remember going to Lyons and putting my hand on his shoulder; I rested my hopes upon him—I cannot decide upon which of the words he used, whether he said they had killed the captain or" <hi rend="italic">we</hi> have killed the captain"—he spoke to me in English—I can't say which it was—everything I had got to say relating to the crew or the navigation of the ship I always communi<lb></lb>cated to Lyons—I could not say that amongst the men who took possession of the vessel there was any one man more prominent than another—I don't know anything about where they slept at nights—I never came on deck of a night unless they came and called me, or there was something serious that wanted me on deck—sometimes they used to come down and sleep in the cabin—when we sighted <hi rend="italic">The Friends</hi>, and the men looked threateningly at me, Lyons interfered between me and them, and seemed to be explaining to them, so as to shelter me from their anger; I understood so by his looks, but he was talking in Spanish—I believe he was doing so, and I believe he suc<lb></lb>ceeded—he was the principal assistant to me in the navigation of the ship—I do not recollect, on leaving the ship, saying to him, "Do you want to kill me, <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>," nor his replying, "No, certainly not, we have been like brothers together"—it was he who ordered me into the boat astern—he showed every anxiety to save my life; and I have not the slightest doubt but that he did save my life.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any distinction made either in speaking of the men, or in addressing them, between the blacks and the other men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they were never styled "blacks"—all that I heard the captain call them was" coolies "and" sons of bitches"—I suppose coolies would be termed blacks—I don't remember who he was addressing when he so styled them—the quarrel between Carlos and Blanco was after Carlos had been tied up to the mast; I don't remember how long after—it was not a severe struggle between them—the mate and I interfered, and stopped them—they had not time to struggle much; one had got a knife, and the other a hand-spike—I don't know what it was about—I don't remember ever seeing Carlos quarrelling with any of the other coolies—I cannot say it did not occur, because I did not see it to my knowledge—the captain used to talk to the coolies in Spanish—I don't know what language they spoke among themselves—Spanish was the general language that was spoken on board amongst them—Carlos slept in the same compartment with the blacks; I have seen him there—I never heard of his objecting to sleep there; not that I remember—I never remember his speaking to me about it—he did not tell me that he did not wish to sleep in the same compartment with the blacks—he was not in my watch—I won't say he did not complain, but not to me that I know of—I have been about eight years at sea—white men do generally object very strongly to be put in the same compartment with the blacks—I do not remember that Carlos very seriously objected to being put in the same compartment with them after his quarrel with Blanco—the captain was pretty kind to Carlos—he exhibited great humanity on the occasion of his being tied up; he desired him to be taken down from the mast—he was not tied up; he was standing quite comfortable—he was tied to something—the captain desired him to be be loosed, and to turn in, and to have medicine given to him—I don't remember that the captain's brother was kind to him—I never saw him show any kindness to him—I left the watch on deck at 12 o'clock—I do not know whether Carlos was at the wheel at that time—I never took particular notice—it was Carlos who told me to go to the River Plate or Buenos Ayres—that was on the morning of the 10th of September—he told me that in the cabin, close to my berth door, the morning that the captain was murdered, after I had been three-quarters of an hour shut up in my berth—it was dark at that time; it was not quite day-light, just—I don't remember how many men were down there; I have mentioned how many I saw—I was very much alarmed and excited—I am sure it was at that time that Carlos told me to go to the River Plate—he told me to go to the River Plate, that it was a good country, and there were plenty of Spanish people there—I mean to say that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402010050"></xptr>
               <p>he told me that in the cabin that morning—I remember his speaking to me about it on one other occasion on the quarter-deck; I don't remember how many days it was after the 10th September, I am sure it was not Lyons who told me to go to the River Plate—I remember saying to Carlos, after something had been said about Buenos Ayres, "If we go there, I shall be punished first, as I am in the command of the ship"—I don't remember the date of the month that I said that; it was some days after the 10th; it was after they had requested me to navigate the vessel; it was said on the quarter-deck; I believe we were alone—I don't remember that he was then complaining about the blacks; he might have done so—he said that Buenos Ayres was a good place to land, and all that, because there were no English authorities there, or anything of the sort—I don't think I said, "I shall be punished first if we go there;" if I did say so just now, I did not under<lb></lb>stand you—I remember Carlos saying something like, "No, we shan't be punished, as we had nothing whatever to do with the murder"—I might have used words to the effect that if we went there I should be punished first, as I was in command of the ship—Carlos might have mentioned in reply, "No, we shall not be punished, as we had nothing whatever to do with the murder;" I can't give you a decided answer whether he did or not; I had too much to think about—I can't say yes or no, whether he did say so—I went ashore in the boat with Carlos after we left the vessel—if Carlos was in the other boat which left the vessel, and then went back, I did not see him—it was Carlos who told me to call the ship the <hi rend="italic">Louisa</hi>—he was then on the quarter-deck—some of the blacks were there; I don't say that they were close to him—they were within a few paces of him, within hearing—I don't know whether they had been speaking to him before he told me that; I was looking at the ship; I don't know whether he came by their orders or not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have mentioned that a number of men came down on the morning of the 10th, and Lyons asked you to navigate the vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not direct the ship's course for Buenos Ayres exactly that day; at least I did not do so directly; I did it that day—we were originally bound for Singapore—on the morning of that day Carlos told me to navigate the ship for the River Plate—he spoke to me afterwards about its being a good place to land, but I can't say how long afterwards; it was some days; I don't recollect his words exactly—he was talking about the place; that it was a good place; that there were no English people there, they were all Spanish, and they could get away, or something of that sort—I don't remember what I said in answer; I very likely agreed to his words then—it did not matter what they said to me, I said yes to it—the quarrel between Blanco and Carlos, when the mate and I interfered, was about 1st September—that quarrel had nothing to do with Carlos being tied up; the quarrel was some days after that.</p>

I am a Frenchman—I was a seaman on board the Flowery Land—I was in the habit of sleeping in a house on the deck—I slept in the same part of the house as Andersen, the carpenter, and Early—some days before the captain was killed, I received a communication from Frank Powell—I communicated that to the captain—I recollect the morning that the captain was killed, but I don't know the date—I was woke up about 3 or half-past 3 in the morning by the carpenter and little <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> (Early)—they were quite trembling, and the carpenter was crying—they did not give me any direction, they only told me to go to the wheel—I did so—when they came and awoke me, I asked them if it was 4 o'clock—they said, "No; but you go to the wheel"—as I was going to the wheel, I saw the prisoners all together in a lot, but as it was dark at the time I could not exactly distinguish, but everybody was there—seven or eight of them had hand-spikes or capstan-bars in their hands—I did not speak to them—I only spoke to Frank Powell—he told me that two were in the water; the captain's brother and the first-mate—I asked after the captain, and he said, "Look here; there is death in the cabin;" pointing with his finger—I looked down in the cabin where they were in the habit of eating—I looked through the little window which is close to the compass, close to where the man at the wheel stands, and I saw the captain, dead, lying stretched out in the room—Frank Powell had not any weapon in his hand at that time—I afterwards went into the cabin when it was daylight, and saw the body of the captain wrapped up in canvas—a rope was thrown over some part of the body, and it was hauled up, and thrown into the water—I helped to haul it up, and Watter, and another; I don't know who it was—Watter said to me, "If thou dost not lend a hand, take care of thyself"—at that time a great number of persons were in the cabin, but I can't say who they were—the room was full of blood—after the captain had been thrown into the water the cabin was washed a little, and then the boxes were all broken open to see what they contained—I observed three persons doing that—Marco Watter, <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> Catalan (Lopez), and Ambrosio (Duranno)—I saw some money taken out, and put upon the table—<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> Catalan said the second-mate was to divide it; to share the money—he said he was to divide the money amongst all the persons on board—I did not hear any of the others say any<lb></lb>thing about the division of the money—afterwards the second-mate was told to share it into seventeen parts—the money was then shared into seventeen parts; after that, all the day long, eating and drinking went on—after that it was the second-mate who navigated the ship—I know that three days after the murder he was spoken to about it, but I do not under<lb></lb>stand English sufficiently to know what was said—some days after the captain was murdered, I was in the room where I slept, and Basilio Delos</p>

I am a native of Norway—I was carpenter on board the <hi rend="italic">Flowery Land</hi>—the captain did not like the crew—I heard him say so on deck, because they were not able to do their work—I have seen the captain strike some of the crew, the steward, the cook, the lamp-trimmer, and Marco Watter; he struck Watter with his flat hand at the side of the head—I did not see that more than once—the captain said to him at the time, "You are come aboard my ship as able seamen, and you cannot do your work, and when you are in China you will expect your pay"—I have seen the first-mate strike Basilio (Santos) with a rope; not so as to hurt him—I remember when the captain was killed; about 2 o'clock that morning the boy, Early, came and woke me up—I went on deck—I saw the chief-mate lying close to the step leading to the poop—he asked me who I was—I told him I was the carpenter—he asked me to help him into the cabin—I got him on the poop—I found that his arm was broken, and his face was smashed to pieces—he asked me to go and fetch the captain—as I was turning to do so, I received a blow on the head with a hand-spike, or capstan-bar—I could not see who it was that struck me—Marcelino after<lb></lb>wards spoke to me about being struck—he said, "Me strike you"—I can't remember how long that was after I was struck; it was not the same morning—I had a stiff neck for two or three days from the effects of the blow—I fell by reason of the blow, and I then went into my berth—I was called up again about half-past 5 or 6—I saw some of the captain's clothes ransacked in the cabin—they were all there then, except the man at the wheel—I saw the captain's body thrown overboard—Blanco and Watter, and I believe, the Frenchman helped in that—before I came on deck after</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Flowery Land</hi>—on the night of 10th September, I was on the first watch—I turned in at 12 o'clock—the first mate succeeded me, and came on—I don't know what time it was when I got up next morning, but I think it was about half-past 3—I got up so early, because I heard some noise on deck—it was a noise of somebody screeching on deck—nobody called me—when I got up I saw the chief mate on the starboard side, on deck—he was groaning—I did not go up to him—Andersen, the carpenter, came up—the chief mate was then lying in the same place—the carpenter went to him—the chief mate told him to help him into his berth—he did so—I saw somebody run after the carpenter; I could not tell who it was, because it was dark—he had a hand-spike in his hand, and I saw him strike the car<lb></lb>penter with it on the back of his neck—the carpenter ran forwards, and I ran after him, under the gallant forecastle—I went to the wheel soon after that; about 4 o'clock—Candereau was at the wheel at that time—I was with him for about ten minutes; after that I went to the cabin—the whole of the crew were there—I did not see Taffer, the second mate, there then—I heard him afterwards crying in his own cabin, and I heard Lyons call him out—he came out and said, "What are you going to do with me? are you going to kill me?"—Lyons said, "No"—I did not hear him say anything else—I heard him afterwards tell him to take the vessel to some port where they could get clear—that was on deck—I did not see the captain's body hauled up, or know who hauled it up—I remember the money being divided—after it was divided I heard the men talking in the forecastle—I heard Francisco Blanco say, "I have killed the mate," and Duranno said, "I had a heaver; I first struck him and felled him on the deck"—it was then that Blanco said, "After I saw you strike him, I took the handspike and struck him on the head"—Watter said, after they killed the mate he was in the cabin with Joe Lyons, Francisco Blanco, and Joseph Chancis; they struck a light to see where the captain was sleeping; Joe Lyons was keeping the candle, and Marco Watter, Joseph Chancis, and Francisco Blanco, they stabbed the captain, the whole three of them"—when that was said by Watter the whole gang was in the forecastle; they could hear it—the whole of the prisoners were in the forecastle—Lyons was there; the whole of them</p>

               <p>that were sleeping in the house on deck; Lyons, Blanco, Duranno, Santos, Carlos, Watter, and Chancis, I don't know the name of the other; it was Marcelino; he was there—I also saw Marcelino in the cabin when they went to the second mate—at the time Watter said what I have stated, these men did nothing; only were laughing—I heard Lyons tell the second mate to take them to some port, so that they could get clear—the mate asked him, "Where do you want me to take the ship?"—he replied "Wherever you think it is better"—I remember going into the boat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the indictment was not sustained, inasmuch as the jurisdiction of the Court was not shown; the jurisdiction would depend upon whether or not this was a British ship; for the purpose of proving that, the prosecution had put in a certificate of registry, under</hi> 17 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 18 <hi rend="italic">Vic. c.</hi> 104, <hi rend="italic">sec.</hi> 107; <hi rend="italic">that certified copy, he was prepared to admit, was to be received as proper proof of the contents of the registry, and if it had recited that this was a British ship, or that the owner was a British subject, it would be sufficient; but it nowhere did so; section</hi> 18 <hi rend="italic">provided that no ship should be deemed to be a British ship unless she belonged wholly to natural born subjects, to persons made denizens by letters of denization, or to a body corporate; if either of those classes of persons was shown to be the owner, it was to be deemed a British ship provided it was registered; but the registration did not make it so; that was a sine qua non; upon the face of the certificate itself, it appeared that the ship was built in America, and for aught that appeared the owner might be an American; his name and address only was given, without any description of him as a British subject or a naturalized person; the certificate also showed that the vessel was the subject of a certificate of sale, and he contended that even if it was a British ship at the time of registration, the prosecution ought to go further, and show that the power of sale had not been exercised in favour of any but a British subject; upon both these grounds he submitted the prosecution had failed to show any jurisdiction in this Court.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">further submitted that there was no evidence to show that the certificate referred to the identical ship on board which this mutiny took place.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON BRAMWELL</hi>.—"<hi rend="italic">I am of opinion that there is nothing in the objection, but that there is abundant evidence to go to the Jury—to say nothing of the presumption that a ship could not be registered if it had not been a British ship, and that the authorities had properly informed themselves of that matter, the owner is described in the certificate as" Wm. Weemys Kerr, of</hi> 25, <hi rend="italic">Poultry, in the City of London, merchant; "that is a British name, and the name of a person residing in the United Kingdom, and surely if John Jones or John Smith is described as living in a certain place in the City of London, there is a presumption that he is a natural born subject. But besides that, there is abundant evidence; she sails from the Port of London with an English name on her, with an English captain on board, with two English mates, and an Englishman, the brother of the captain; at least, persons bearing</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">English names, and speaking the English language. In addition to that, there is a piece of evidence furnished by the prisoners themselves on this subject, viz., their request that the ship may not be taken to any place where there were English authorities; which would imply that such a place would be one where they would be most in danger. I am of opinion, therefore, that there is abundant evidence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">whether it is inevitably proved is another matter</hi>) <hi rend="italic">upon which the Jury may find that this was a British ship. As to the other objection, that there is no evidence that the Flowery Land, named in the certificate, is the Flowery Land in question, that is for the Jury: we have it that this particular ship was a British ship, in addition to which it has been held over and over again, that identity of name is abundant evidence of identity of the thing. The only thing I was about to look at further, was whether there was any statement in the certificate of who the captain was; I do not see it; but it is a matter of perfect indifference, because, independently of that, there is abundant evidence, to my mind, that the ship is the ship named in the certificate, and independently of the certificate, there is other evidence upon which the Jury might well come to the conclusion that this was a British ship. However, if the Solicitor-General entertains any doubt upon the matter, and desires to give further evidence, he can do so." The</hi>

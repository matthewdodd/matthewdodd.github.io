                  </hi>. I carry on business at Nos. 6, 7, and 8, Queen Street, Oxford Street, as a coach ironmonger and plater—the prisoner was my apprentice—he has been with me about five years—he left in September, 1876—I also occasionally employed a man named Hassett as a plater—Barlow, my half-brother, was there, and had been since he was a boy, as ware-houseman—I never authorised him to sell anything—on the 23rd of March I went to Mr. Allen's, in Drury Lane, with O'Dea, where the prisoner was working with Hassett—I asked Hassett to step into the parlour, so that I might speak to him privately—he hesitated, but went into the parlour—I had seen a casting on the floor—after speaking to him I went back to the shop, and looked about, and saw a number of articles—I have made a list—. these eight files were found at the shop, and the knobs—some of the other things were found at the prisoner's lodging—most of these were stolen within a year ago; I cannot say if all were—I asked the prisoner how he came by them—he said "I had them of your brother"—I said "You have no business to have them of him"—he said "I paid for them"—I said "My brother had no right to deal in those things, and you had no right to accept them"—he was then given into custody—I then went to his lodgings and found the articles contained in the list produced—the pad end does were found there—my name is stamped on them; also the two breech rings, and this ingot of tin—I recognise the tin by my brother's writing on the paper in which it is wrapped—I never authorised anyone to dispose of any of these things—I manufacture them to make up, and not to sell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I identify the tin by the numbers—I buy it from Thames Street—I know one piece by the holes which my men stamped by my punches—other people may have punches similar—I employ sixteen men—the head locks are made especially for me in Walsh—my brother has never been allowed to sell rough castings—my trade is to furnish coachbuilders with fittings—I recognise the breech rings by the two dots at the end—I never sell these things as they are—they are covered with silver—I know the cruppers by the patterns—no one else makes them like it—my brother was in my employment the same time as the prisoner was.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer C</hi>). I went to 25, North Street, Manchester Square, with the prosecutor—the prisoner gave that address when he was charged—I went first to the shop where the prisoner works, I found eight files, twelve head locks and other things—they are too many to enumerate—the prosecutor identified them—I produce a list—the prisoner was asked as each article was produced where he got them from, and he said <hi rend="italic">"From Ted</hi>" meaning the prisoner's brother—on March 25th I went to the prisoner's lodgings and found the articles mentioned in this list—the ingot of tin was in a box in the prisoner's room.</p>

On 16th March, I was on duty, and saw the two prisoners in Circus-street—I had been watching them a quarter of an hour—I saw them stand opposite Mr. Harvey's shop—Wilkinson put his hand in his pocket and gave Gorman something—that was about thirty yards from the shop—Gorman then went into the shop—she came out again and joined Wilkinson—I went into the shop and ascertained what Gorman had done there; and in consequence of that, I followed the prisoners till I saw them go into the Walmer Castle—when the prisoners were taken, I found on Gorman a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, a half-crown, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and 10 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers all good—during the time we were watching them, Gorman went into several shops—Wilkinson waited outside, and when she came out he joined her again—I got this florin at the Walmer Castle.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Wilkinson's Defence.</hi> I was waiting for my brother leaving his work; the female I am now charged with came by, and knowing her from keeping a fruit-stall, I spoke to her. After conversing some time, we went into the prosecutor's, and she called for some gin, and paid for it with a half-crown or a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece: when I came out, I walked some distance with her; she entered no shop during the time she was in my company—I was bidding her good-night when the policeman took her in custody, and he said to me, "I shall take you on suspicion of having bad money, as you and the woman have given a bad florin for drink at the public-house." I told him his suspicions were wrong, as I knew nothing about it, and I bad no bad money to my knowledge about me; he searched me and found my statement was correct, for what money I had was genuine—the barmaid informed you I gave her no money, and the ironmonger never saw me.</p>

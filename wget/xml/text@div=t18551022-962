                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Hutton, as whole<lb></lb>sale stationers, in Budge-row. Miller was our porter—it was his duty to take the list from Mr. Gregory, our manager, at each day's town delivery—it was his duty to load the waggon for the town delivery—he had a porter, named Neale, to assist him—he would literally load the van, and, if he had not as much as was in the invoice, it would be his own fault if he did not point out the error—if there were twenty or ten reams additional, it would be impossible for Wake not to know it, as one of the reams in question weighs over a hundredweight—I do not think Miller could take ten or twenty reams by mistake—the boy, Joyce, used to attend on the cart—I do not think anybody could have put paper on the cart without Miller's knowledge if he attended personally on the loading—on 24th Sept, I think it was, I went with an officer to Lewis's shop, No. 36, Mitre-street—(that is where Moss gives his address on some of the invoices)—we first went into his little front parlour—he was engaged in taking an order for lucifer match boxes—the officer told him he would recollect that he had been there some few days before, about some paper, and said, "You will allow Mr. Millington to look over your premises?"—he said, "Certainly," and took me over—I saw probably twenty reams of paper, some without wrappers at all, and others with the labels; others with a portion of the wrapper torn off—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a perfect ream from my own warehouse—here are two wrap<lb></lb>pers—one has a label pasted on, and there is a little stamp, which bears the date as well as the label—this is one of the reams which were at Lewis's house, and I potently believe that it came from my warehouse, having received 450 reams of it—I asked Lewis where he got these papers—he hesitated and thought a little while, and then said, "Oh, that? I bought—that long before Christmas"—I said, "Indeed! that is strange, considering it only paid the duty in June last"—I do not think he made any reply to that—he said he bought it of different people, mentioning the names of Wilson, and Morgan, and Stacey—he said that he had invoices of what he had got, and had his file up, and looked for them, in ray presence, but could only find one, bought of a man named Evans, without any address on it, in the preceding year—he looked for the invoices some time—I was there an hour, or an hour and a half, but he produced no invoice but that—I directed his</p>

               <p>attention to the rest of the paper, and made the same remark, but he could not produce the invoices—I found one ream where the duty had not been taken off—the Excise laws regulate that this stamp shall be on part of the two folds—as it is done quickly, it is not always perfect, but this ream has it perfect—the date here is "7—6—55"—whoever did this, has omitted to tear off the dates on almost every ream—I have examined many of these reams—they all bear the same date—I think there were eleven reams of this sort of paper, and we received on the following day to this date, 450 reams—all the paper that we receive in stock bears the charge date—this is dated June 7th, and we received it on the 8th—I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that it is our paper—I asked Lewis what his object was in tearing these off—he said that he had pill boxes to make, and tore these labels off, as being thicker paper—here are twenty-three quires of very large brown paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the cover was torn off one ream before the former ream was all used.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). On 17th Sept., after taking Moss into custody, I went to No. 36, Mitre-street—I went into Lewis's work shop; he is a lucifer match box maker—I saw a pile of paper there, between twenty and twenty-five reams, the whole of it had the excise labels on it, and they all appeared to be perfect reams—I did not disturb them then, I was looking for the catalogue mentioned by Moss—I went again on the fol<lb></lb>lowing Monday, the 24th, with Mr. Millington, after I heard of the cart stopping, and found about the same number of reams—there were then no excise wrappers, they had been torn off in the interim—I am sure of that—</p>

               <p>I saw Lewis both on the first and second occasion—he said that he got these nine reams of paper before Christmas—I saw Mr. Millington point out the stamp mark "June" to him—I asked him where he bought it, he said he had the invoice—I said, "Get it," and he could not find it—he gave me two invoices, which he said had reference to a portion of the white paper bought at Williamson's—Mr. Millington said, "There is no such name," and then he said that it was Wilson and Morgan, and of Stacey; and in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> he pointed out that particular paper to me—I did not go in uniform on the first occasion, but I told him I was a policeman, and came to search, and that I had Miller in custody for stealing paper—on the second occasion I told Lewis that the carman had been bringing paper to his house for the last twelve months—he said that it was no such thing, and if it had been brought there he must have seen it, and that it was only a roll of music paper that Moss used to carry—I said, "Reams of paper brought here on a man's shoulder"—he again denied it, and said that no paper came to his house except to him, and he should not have allowed it to remain there—I described Wake, and asked whether he knew him—he said that he did not—I took him and the paper to the station—on the 2nd I took Miller and Wake; Miller said that he was innocent, and did not know Moss; and on the Wednesday, I asked Wake whether he knew Moss, the singer, and he said, "No."</p>

It is my duty to superintend the execution of the town orders—I gave Miller a list from which he would have to get the goods from the warehouse, take them to the cart, and as a rule would put them into the cart—I gave Wake the invoices for each parcel of goods; there ought to be nothing in the cart, for which there was not an invoice—for each quantity of goods so invoiced and delivered a receipt should be brought back, re<lb></lb>turned to the desk and ultimately filed—it was Wake's duty to bring back</p>

               <p>the receipts; he ought to have delivered nothing for which there was not an invoice, and for which he did not bring back a receipt—I recollect no customer in Mitre-street, ever—Wake had no authority to deliver paper there, without an invoice from the house—I find no receipt for goods delivered at No. 36, Mitre-street—we received a great quantity of this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>), and it is impossible to trace it, having had some in the house previous and since, but it is of the same quality, and is charged with duty on the same date, "7—6—55"—no paper has been sold to Lewis at all—the rest of the twenty reams are without wrappers, there<lb></lb>fore it is impossible to identify them, but it is my belief that they came from Messrs.

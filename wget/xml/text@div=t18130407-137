It was put in my sty in the night. I got up about eight o'clock in the morning, Harris and Moore said they had put a sow in my sty; they asked me to let it stop there a day or two. They after that asked me to buy it. I refused. After that I saw Harris and Moore, and Ive, at the Crown public-house. Harris asked me to heat some water to scald the sow. Ive said he would satisfy me to heat the water. I said, if I do it, I will have ten shillings. I went home. Moore and Ive came to my place about four o'clock. Ive killed the sow, the others assisted him, and it was agreed that I was to cart the pig to Ive's house, in Ears-court, Kensington. About half past six o'clock the next morning we wrapped the pig up in cloths, to keep it clean; we put it in my cart, and I took it to Ive's house. Ive is a butcher. He and Harris took it out of the cart. I went to the public-house, Moore and Harris followed; Harris pulled out three one-pound notes; he changed one note, and gave me ten shillings.</p>

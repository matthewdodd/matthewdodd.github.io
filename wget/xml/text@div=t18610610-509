I am a menber of the Royal College of Surgeons, and am house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital—on 30th May last I saw the deceased Boy when he first came into the hospital—he was what we call "concussed"—he was capable of giving a monosyllabic answer when roused—I asked his name, and he said, "Teddy," and then went off again into a sort of sleep—there was a ragged wound abovey the left eye, extending through the scalp to the Bone—I could not detect a fracture until after death—he died about 6 o'clock next evening—I then examined the body, and found a fracture a the back part of the head, through the Bones—there was extra<lb></lb>vasated Blood, and the Brain itself was ruptured in parts—I therefore concluded that he died from the fracture and bleeding, the result of the injury he had sustained—it is difficult to say whether the wheel of a ca B knocking him down would produce that injury; it might, but I could not assert one way or the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver—I was first ca B on the stand the night this accident occurred—not one ca B left the stand at this time, or just before, and not for twenty-five minutes afterwards—I was waiting on my box at 10 o'clock, and saw the policeman coming across the road with the</p>

               <p>two children on his right—in the meantime, the Hansom cab was coming across the road, and, as soon as it had passed my cab, I heard him say, "Stop!"and the cab stopped at about twenty to thirty yards after—he said, "You have run over the child"—I got off my box; and at the same time, Bowman came and picked the child up—when the cab came up, the police<lb></lb>man was about two feet from the horse's head—they were about one yard in advance of my horse, towards the Hansom, past my cab—the policeman was close by the side of it—I saw the cab pass the policeman, and the first child, and saw it strike the other one, who was a little in advance—if the policeman had a child in each hand, he would have saved the pair of them as well as himself it would not have happened—if he had taken one step he would have cleared the horse—the prisoner was not going at all at an unusual pace for a Hansom cab; they are not stopped directly—he pulled up in very good time—it was two or three cabs down, when the policeman halloed out "Stop!" and I do not suppose the man went more than from twenty to thirty yards after that—from what I saw, the accident could not have been prevented by the cabman—I do not think he was to blame—the night was dark; and I considered the one that was in fault was the constable, for not having one in each hand—I do not expect persons to be passing directly under the horses of a cabstand—it is rather a dangerous place—one would suppose he would look before crossing the road.</p>

LLOYD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you think if the prisoner had been going at a less rapid rate, he would have prevented it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I should think his rate was not exceeding eight miles—the pace I go at is from seven to eight or six—four is the pace we go at by the hour; that is a different thing altogether—many do go at eight miles an hour, whether it is usual or not I cannot say—I was on the cab box—I jumped down directly, as soon as I heard the cabman say, "Stop, cab, you have run over the child"—I was facing Baker-street, facing the side that the policeman came over—I was watching the Bazaar at Madame Tussaud's, for a fare coming out—I had not a fare coming out, I was waiting for the gentleman there, that blows a whistle, to call us over—I did not make any motion of moving—I was not going to start—I was waiting for the whistle Blowing—I saw the cabman after he stopped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Brother of the prisoner—I was with my cab on this night in Dorset-street—I was not on my cab—it was behind the four-wheeler, standing second on the rank—I noticed a Hansom cab coming across from Baker-street to Dorset-street, not knowing it was my brother—the cab was,—about six yards past the crossing—he pulled up between twenty and thirty yards after—it was about the third cab down—I saw the policeman with these two children—he was walking across the road with both children on his right-hand side—the youngest had hold of the hand of the eldest one—the Hansom cab passed the policeman and the eldest child; and the stock of the wheel caught the skull of the youngest child, he being farthest out—it just brushed his forehead—it could not have been prevented, whether my brother was sober or otherwise—I look upon it as a pure accident—the policeman, placed as he was, would hide the children from my" brother—it was rather a</p>

               <p>darkish night—I have known my brother all his life—he is a very sober man, and kind—I never saw him under the influence of liquor before—he is a careful driver—he was not going at an unusual pace—it was a pace that is constantly gone by Hansoms, fare or no fare.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you know he was drunk on this occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not own that at all—I said that he had been drinking—one of the children was in advance, and the policeman would hide that child from the cabman—the policeman was crossing the road just ahead of the four-wheel—I do not know whether the eldest child had hold of the policeman's hand or not—the youngest was the outside one—it was natural enough that the man, seeing a policeman, would never think of looking for two little children by the side of him—the child that was knocked down was slightly in advance—it was impossible for the cabman to have seen the child.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The night was so dark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—on these cabs the cabman sits very much behind—there being no fare the ca B would project up; the shafts would be off the horse's back, and it would make a distance of six inches.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You must have been close to where he stopped? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the policeman told him he had knocked the child down—I did not hear my brother say he was a liar—the policeman had hold of his collar, and he had hold of the constable's collar—I did not see him strike him—I never heard him say he would be d—d before he would be taken.</p>

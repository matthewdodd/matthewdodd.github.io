            . I am butcher, and son-in-law of the prosecutor. On the Monday I found the prisoner at Staines, at the Angel and Crown; I asked him how it was he did not return with the horses; he said, two of them were in the stable, and one he had made an exchange for- I asked what money he had received; he said, £15, and the cob, and that he had been robbed of £12,£13, or £14 - I then told him to get ready to return to town that afternoon with me; he got his horses ready, and started them on, while I stopped about twenty minutes to get my horse refreshed; I then went after him, he had been through the first turnpike, but when I got to the next turnpike he had not been through; I came on to Brentford, and stopped nearly an hour expecting him, but he did not come; he afterwards told me he had been robbed of £9; I said, "You told me you had been robbed of more;" he said, "I did not know exactly what I had been robbed of."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he had been robbed as soon as you saw him? A. Yes - I don't know that he was exactly sober; he went about his work, he did not appear to be tipsey.</p>

            . I am a livery-stable keeper, and live in the Borough. I am the prisoner's uncle - after he was in custody I called on the prosecutor; he said, he did not care who the prisoner robbed, so as he sold the horses and got him plenty of money - the prisoner was in my employ for five years; I found him honest - the prosecutor offered to take 29l., and then he sent his solicitor, and said, he would take 15l.</p>

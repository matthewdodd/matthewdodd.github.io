                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Steward's depart<lb></lb>ment at Greenwich Hospital. The prisoner was a messenger in the Secretary's office—on Wednesday morning, 15th Sept., I went into the Steward's office—there are three other clerks employed there besides me—neither of them were there—there is a rail partition there, and, on looking through that, I saw the prisoner on his knees at the desk—as you enter, the body of the office is railed off, and inside this rail partition is the desk—the prisoner was on his knees at the lower drawer of the desk—the drawer was open—the old gold lace is kept in that drawer, which has been taken from men who have been dis-rated or who die—it is there to be used again—I saw the gold lace in the prisoner's hat, which was between his knees and the drawer—there might have been a little gold lace left in the drawer, but it was very little, if any—the prisoner heard a noise, I suppose I disturbed him when I came in, and he emptied the lace out of his hat as hastily as he could, and he got up—I said, "What are you doing there?"—he rose up, and said, "I am come for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185209200097"></xptr>
               <p>the vacancies"—on that day we report the number of vacancies in the hospital for the information of the Admiralty—the prisoner would be sent for those docu<lb></lb>ments—they are printed and written documents—I believe the printed forms are kept in the second or third drawer of that desk, but it was not exactly my duty to attend to them—the drawer the prisoner was at was the lowest drawer—on his getting up and saying that, I told him to leave the office—he fell on his knees, and begged for forgiveness—I merely heard the word "mercy"—I could not distinctly hear anything else that he said—he said nothing before he fell on his knees, and I said nothing to him only, "Leave the office"—when he fell on his knees he put his hands together—I told him I should be obliged to name it to the steward—he then left the office—I think the lace that I saw in his hat would be worth a guinea or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I recognise this piece (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) at a piece I had seen in his hat—he had been sent for papers before; I have been in the office, when he came for them, but on that day he could not have them, because the man would not arrive with the dead notes till about 11 o'clock, and at that time no such documents were attainable—on former occa<lb></lb>sions, when he has come for these documents, they would be filled up by one of the clerks, and given to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are not the vacancies on Monday and Wednesday given before 11 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The Monday's vacancies are always given as soon at the office is open, but not the Wednesdays—I do not know what time Mr. Gay has sent you to get the vacancies—I do not know that I have ever seen you in the office before 10: I do not see how you could get in—I cannot undertake to say you have not been there before 10—I should say there was from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of lace in your hat, when I saw you stoop<lb></lb>ing down and putting it in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was in the act of searching the drawer.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he in the act of searching? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not appear so: he had no right to be there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I told you that Mr. Gay sent me for the vacancies, that I was not stealing the lace, I was merely looking for the vacancies. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I do not recollect bis saying that Mr. Gay bad sent him, and that he was looking for the vacancies—I cannot swear that he did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Mr. Gay sent me twice during the morning for the vacancies—you say that I went on my knees to beg pardon—I kneeled down and said, "I am as innocent as a baby that has not been born;" I hoped you would take no notice of it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I will swear he did not say he was innocent; he begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you only distinguished the word "mercy," are you quite sure that the other words which you did not hear, were not what he has said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What timer did you take the lace out to take to the police office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The policeman came in on the Thursday about 2 o'clock—the drawer had never been disturbed after I closed it—orders were given that the drawer should not be disturbed—the office is never opened till 10 in the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who opens it in the morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The messenger, not this man.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this gold lace kept in an unlocked drawer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is, because it is so often used.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The business of the office begins at 10 o'clock in the morning, did you remain in the office till it was closed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at half past 4—no one interfered with the drawer during that time—I went the next morning at 10—no one disturbed the drawer till the policeman came—I do not recollect that the prisoner said he was perfectly innocent, and begged me to take no notice—I heard him say with hfs hands up, "Mercy, mercy!"—I am sure he did not say, "I am quite innocent, and therefore show me mercy"—I should have heard it if he had, I was very close to him—when I told him I must report it to the steward, he was still on his knees; I did not bear him say anything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that on Mondays he used to come to the office, as soon as the office was open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we used to make the vacancies out, and give them to him—he would remain in the body of the office—he would have an opportunity of seeing the clerk take the printed blanks, not from that drawer, but the second or third drawer—it was in that department where the blank forms are kept that I found him kneeling—the prisoner was messenger to the secretary—there is also a messenger to the steward's department—I did not see him that morning—it was his duty to wait in the ante-room, and come in the office when the bell was rung for him—I do not know whether he was there that morning—it is part of his duty to see who goes in and out—the secretary's office is in the same part of the building—it is upstairs over our office, which is on the ground floor—the 15th Sept. was on Wednesday—on Wednesdays we wait till the Infirmary dead notes arrive—we enter them, and fill up the number of vacancies we have altogether, and they are taken to the steward to be signed—the report from the Infirmary usually comes from half past 10 to 11 o'clock—on Mondays we are not so particularly accu<lb></lb>rate as we are on Wednesdays—on Mondays we do not wait for the report from the Infirmary, and on Wednesdays we do—the prisoner had been mes<lb></lb>senger in the secretary's office, I believe, between five and six years, and I believe he had held an appointment before that, the situation of boatswain's mate in the Infirmary—the appointment of messenger to the secretary was a promotion—those appointments are given, if a man behaves himself well—none of the drawers were locked—there are generally four clerks in that office—their proper time for coming is 10 o'clock—when I saw the prisoner there it was between ten minutes and a quarter past 10.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police to Greenwich Hospital. On 16th Sept.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in that office—there are drawers in the desk at which I transact business—there are eight drawers, four on each side, one above another—none of them are locked—this gold lace was taken from one of the drawers where it was usually kept tem<lb></lb>porarily—I cannot say how long this had been there—I had only returned the day before—when a man is disrated, the lace is put there for a day or two to see if it is wanted for another, and if it is not it is taken to the store, and locked up—the papers that were in that drawer were not forms of vacancies, they were forms of vouchers; they do not at all resemble the forms of vacancies—I know of the prisoner coming to that office for forms of vacancies, but not that morning—he had been in the habit of coming for them for four or five years—I have seen him there about once a week—he did not go to the drawer for them; I gave them to him—they were always kept in the same drawer—I suppose he knew where they were kept by his seeing me take them out of the drawer so often—he would know they were in that drawer—I do not know when this gold lace was put in the drawer, for I had been away a month.</p>

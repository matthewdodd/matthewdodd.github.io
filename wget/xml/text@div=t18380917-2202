                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Rice. On the morning of the 15th of September I got drunk, and was locked up in the station-house at Bow-street—I had then a half-crown, one shilling, and twopence half-penny—I awoke about six o'clock in the morning, and found the money all right—I put it in two papers, and laid it down by the side of me on the board—the prisoner, who was locked up with me, came and took the papers away—on e had the silver and the other the copper—I saw her do it, and asked her to give them to me, but she would not—when she came into the yard, I had her searched, and the money was found on her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Lombard-street, and am a tailor, in part<lb></lb>nership with Edward Philip Doudney. The prisoner worked at the top of our house, and slept there—I keep my waistcoats and trowsers in the shop at the bottom of the house—on the 22nd of December the shopman told me the drawers were wrong—I saw they had been opened, and saw footmarks that somebody had got into the shop through a hole, and there were footmarks on things under it—I went up stain, and began to search the prisoner—I took his hat off, and in it found three silk waistcoats—these are mine—I called an officer, who stripped him, and found a pair of trowsers on under his own, which had been taken out of our drawers—in the afternoon we had another search, and found his great coat, and in the pocket of it another pair of trowsers—he was going to leave, and going home that day.</p>

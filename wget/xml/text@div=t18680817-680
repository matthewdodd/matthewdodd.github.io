                  </hi>, I am a grocer, of 11, Brookley Walk, Homerton—on Monday, 28th June, I went to bed about 1 o'clock—at 2 o'clock I thought I heard somebody in the room; I thought it was my mother, and did not pay much attention, I opened my eyes a little, and thought it was my brother, I opened them further, and saw the prisoner gliding across the bedroom—I called out, and he bolted out of the room—I had known him before—the shop was secure when we went to bed, and when we went down we found a piece of glass cut out of the parlour window, and the window forced open—I missed some money, tobacco, flour, bacon, and a leg of lamb, value about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I traced some flour along the garden to the place where the prisoner lives—I went there with Bray about 6 o'clock, and found the lamb, bread, and some very white flour, similar to what I had had—I found the prisoner under the bed in his own room—the policeman had knocked.</p>

On Sunday morning, 28th June, I went with Slater to the prisoner's house, at 6 o'clock, and found the prisoner concealed under a bed in a room next his own—a man and a child were in the bed, and a woman stood at the door—I found a leg of lamb, three or four quartern loaves, and some flour—he said that he knew nothing of the lamb, and the bread he had bought at Bethnal Green—at the station he said that he had picked the lamb up at his own gate, when he went in doors—he was dressed—the ground was so hard that I could not say whether there were footmarks of more than one person—I found no tobacco, butter, or cheese.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a tobacconist's shop, in Clapham-road. On the 22nd of Oct. the prisoner came and asked lor a cheroot—I served her, she laid a shilling on the counter, I saw it was a bad one; I told her to sit down on a cigar chest in the shop, and I walked round the counter—she then stated she did not know it was a bad one (I had not said it was bad)—I waited till a constable came along, and I gave her in charge—before the constable came, I asked her where she got it—she said it was given her by an old gentleman outside—I went to the door, but could not see any person answering the description she gave—this was between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening.</p>

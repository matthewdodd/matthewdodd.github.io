            . On Christmas-day, at half-past five o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming out of the King's Arms tap-room window, with this fowl in his hand - I asked where he got it; he said from his own house; I took him into the public-house, but they had not lost it there; I brought him out, and he then said "I had this fowl in the public-house yesterday two or three times" - I said,"Dead or alive," he said, "Dead;" I felt it, and said it was quite warm - he ran away; I pursued, and took him - here are the legs of the fowl.</p>

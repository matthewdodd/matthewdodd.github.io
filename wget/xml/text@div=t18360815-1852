                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Gray's-inn-lane. The prisoner occupied a furnished room in my house for about eighteen weeks, with her daughter—on the 6th of August, I missed the articles stated in the indictment—I missed part from one room, and part from the other—I was going up to ask her when she meant to leave, and I missed the car<lb></lb>pet—I told her of it—she said, "Come in"—I then missed the other things, and she said she had got the tickets—I have since seen them all at the pawnbroker's—the prisoner is a widow, and had the care of chambers in Gray's-inn-lane, as a laundress—she has a daughter sixteen years of age.</p>

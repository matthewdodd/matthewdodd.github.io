            , Midwife. On the 30th of October, I was sent for to the Prisoner, and found she had been delivered of a Child. She said, something (she knew not what) was come from her, but it was no Child. I ask'd her, what she did with that which came from her? She said she did not know where it was. I told her it signify'd nothing to deny it, for I was sure she had had a Child, and therefore a Child I would find. Then she confess'd that it was a Man Child; but said it was born dead, and that her Father took it from her, but she could not tell what he had done with it. Her Father coming in I told him his Daughter had been Deliver'd - Deliver'd ! says he, Ay, so she has - of a Sir-Reverence. Those were his Words, begging your Worship's Pardon. I saw so much by his Behaviour towards the Prisoner, and some other Passages, that in short, I told him, I believ'd he was Father to the Child, as well as Grandfather; and that he had done my Business, and deliver'd her himself before I was sent for. So he went out, and I examin'd the Prisoner, and she declar'd to me, that her Father had lain with her, and that she never had to do with any other Man but him. On the 2d of November following, the Prisoner's Mother gave me a Note, I suppose it was sent from her Husband, who was then run away, and in this Note, it was said, that the Child was wrapt up in an old Curtain, and laid in among some Horse-litter in Tom Turd's-Hole (a Place where the Nightmen lay their Soil) and there it was found. I saw no Marks of Violence upon it; but I believe it bled to death for want of proper Help.</p>

I view'd the Body, and found no external Marks of Violence; upon which I proceeded to open the Cavities of the Thorax and Abdomen. The Lungs appear'd inflated ; I cut off one of the Lobes, and putting it into a Vessel of Water, it floated; I am therefore of Opinion that the Infant had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050011"></xptr> breathed; I likewise found that the Blood-vessels in general were empty, and the Navel-string lacerated, and not ty'd; for which Reason, I believe, proper Help was wanting, and the Child might bleed to Death.</p>

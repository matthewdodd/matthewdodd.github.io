                  </hi>. I am a lamp manufacturer, and carry on business in Roupell-street, Lambeth—on Saturday, 2d December, after my workmen had left my factory, the prisoner came to me—he bad been an apprentice to me about ten years ago, and he continued to work for me occasionally, about a year and a half—on that evening I was in the show-room; while there, the prisoner came to me—I was alone, my other people having left the premises—he asked me for employment for a railway, to write a character for him—I said I did not oppose to give him a character, but I did oppose to write one unless they asked me—we talked about ten minutes—I went into the workshop to wash my hands—he followed—be said he was very sorry his father had put him apprentice to me, for had be been with another master, he might have lived with his master, and should not have been obliged to go to sea, and would have business to do now—I told him that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186601080038"></xptr>
               <p>he had had many masters besides me, and never kept one, and my opinion was that if he had been with another master, he would not have stopped longer than he did with me—by that time my hands were washed—I came back from the workshop, passed the show-room, and was putting my coat over me—when he saw me ready to leave the premises, he said, "So you won't give me a character?"—I said, "No"—I put on my coat, and took my umbrella ready to go out—he then spoke about the character again, and asked me to write it—I told him I declined to give him a character, and at that time I saw a sort of movement in his body—I took my umbrella, and turned the key of the gas with the top of it—I passed before him, and at that moment he did <hi rend="italic">shot</hi> me here. (<hi rend="italic">At the back of the neck</hi>)—the ball has been extracted—he was in a corner of the door, and I was passing him—I called on him by his name—I felt no pain, but if I recollect, a sort of giddy feeling and a cold penetration in the jaw, and a blow—I did not attempt to go out—the door is so heavy, that if I had attempted to open it he would have killed me more easily, so I called him by name, and said, "William, what are you doing?" and he did give me another shot here (<hi rend="italic">on the breast</hi>) but it did not have any effect—I went over to him, and tried to catch his arm—I got the revolver, but before I could catch his arm, I received a wound here (<hi rend="italic">on his hand</hi>)—I caught his hands, struggled with him, and had my shoulder to his—he was leaning on a ladder which was not fixed—he fell, and I fell on the corner of a weighing-scale, and cut my knee—I was holding him—we were struggling together—I took the pistol out of his hand; I believe he was on his knee—I was on my knee crying "Murder!" at that time—during that last struggle I had the pistol, and he was trying to take it from me—I put my hand out of his reach to prevent his taking it and I discharged it twice at him.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Susan Hall was here brought into Court</hi>)—I did not roll him about in a crate, but when he was a boy he put himself in a box, and stopped one day in it—we did not know where he was—we found him in a box, but I did not put him in—that was not the very time I threatened to kill him with the soldering-iron—I never was taken to a police-station in my life; a friend of mine was, but I was not with him when he was taken, nor did I go there afterwards—he was taken there for shooting sparrows with a small stock-gun—I did not threaten to shoot the policeman on that occasion, with a pistol—I never threatened to shoot anybody—I did not threaten the policeman at all—I did not tell Susan Shirley that I threatened to shoot the policeman—I have lived in my present place about two years—I lived in Princes-street, Stamford-street, before that—I had a fire shortly before I left Princes-street, and I left on account of it—I was insured in the Westminster office, and received 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that insurance—the prisoner did not say that he would go down to the insurance company, and tell them about the fire in Princes-street, on this very occasion, immediately before the shooting—I believe he was angry, but he did not appear so—he said nothing about the fire—he has never said anything to me about giving in<lb></lb>formation, nor have I heard that he has to other people said anything about the fire—I never threatened to shoot this young lady, who is not my wife—she complained about my temper—cruelty is not the meaning I give to the words she used—I had no struggle with her so as to account for her saying that I put her wrist out—I believe it is natural—I may have, pushed her, but I never beat her, or gave her a blow—she has not tumbled when I pushed her, but in the space of five or six years I may have given her a push—I have not threatened to shoot her—this is the only pistol I keep—I believe when the young man lost it it was loaded—I loaded it myself when I gave, it to him two or three months before—I loaded it with cartridge, containing a bullet, and powder, and a cap at the top.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 29, Roupell-street—I have been in Mr. Huss's employ since November, 1864—I sleep in the outer workshop—he gave me this pistol for the protection of the premises—I kept it down by the side of my bed—I missed it in August, and never saw it again till it was in the constable's hands—the prisoner used to come into the workhouse—all the men that work on the premises come there—I had no other pistol given to me after I missed this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there any door between the place where Mr. Huss sits and the workshop. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, his office is next to the show-room—coming in from the street you go right through the workshop into the show-room—I had looked for the pistol—I was accused of stealing, but I did not—I believe Mr. Huss searched for it—I left him about the latter end of August—it was shortly after this—I told him I wanted to leave, and went after a situation—Mr. Huss's temper is rather irritable at times, but I never found him irritable to me.</p>

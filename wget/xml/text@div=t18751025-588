I am the wife of the last witness—on 29th September I had bought a bottle of stuff for my ancle labelled "Poison," this is it—I took the paper off it and put it on the table about 6.50, so that anybody could see the label—when the prisoner came in I pointed the bottle out—he picked up, looked at it and said "Poison!" and then he said "I could have given you a better prescription than that myself"—he then wrote a prescription, but I did not see what he wrote, I thought he was in fun, I did not think he meant it and I took no notice—he wrote something about oil and liniment—I have not got it, I have lost it—he had offered us some wine before—he sent for some glasses and brought them back—I had then gone into my bedroom to rest my ancle—I heard him pouring out the wine—he then tapped at the door and said "Here are two glasses of wine for you and Mr. Brand"—when I followed my husband into the room I found that the prisoner had gone—he usually stopped two hours when he came and on other occasions he has partaken of the wine—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am lecturer on chemistry at Guy's Hospital, and public analyst of St. Pancras—I received these two bottles from Inspector Gee; the larger one contained only a wine glass of liquid con<lb></lb>taining alcohol, opium, essential oil of camphor, ammonia, and a very small quantity of red colouring matter which might have been derived from red wine—this name and address was on the small bottle when I received it—the larger bottle contained a weaker solution; the proportion was about one to one and a half, the smaller bottle being the stronger—the explana<lb></lb>tion of that would be that the two glasses had wine or something in them, and that a larger quantity of the colour had been added to one than to the other; the two were similar, but of different strengths; there was double the quantity of opium in the smaller bottle to what was in—the larger—something must have been added to the larger bottle to dilute it—I simply reproduced those articles by adding certain things to port wine, which gave a similar taste and similar chemical tests—a person taking a wine glass of what was in the smaller bottle would take a dose of opium greater. than the minimum fatal dose—if he had drunk the whole glass there was enough to kill him—most probably it would not kill, but a similar quantity has been known to kill—in the other bottle there was about a fluid drachm "of laudanum, or four grains of opium—a wine glass of it would contain more than has been known to kill.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was alcohol and coloured matter in both, but I cannot say that it was wine, as it was so altered by the other ingredients—that was consistent with the presence of red wine—liniment for a sprained ancle would contain the ingredient I have mentioned, it would contain laudanum, and soap liniment, and compound camphor liniment, which contains spirits of wine—there is opium and alcohol, which is spirits of wine—the small bottle contains 1 1/2 ozs.; this wine glass would hold 2 ozs.—if you took the small bottle and poured the contents into the two wine glasses it would not half fill each—the large bottle contained more than would fill the small one.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am a member of the College of Physicians of London—I was connected with the Hoxton Private Asylum about ten years—I had the prisoner first under my charge there in 1845; I speak from notes—it was an ordinary case of acute mania—I remember that he con<lb></lb>ceived that his brother George had some intention to injure or murder him,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187510250030"></xptr>
               <p>and the consequence was he had a loaded gun, and was going all over the neighbourhood, but not where his brother was likely to be—he was suffer<lb></lb>ing from delusion—he was admitted on 9th July, 1845, and was discharged on February 6th, 1846—he was violent from time to time, but not as a general rule—he came in again on 23rd February, 1850, and was discharged on September 6th, 1850; he was under my charge for those seven months—I cannot recall the particular form his mania assumed then, but I know it was always that some one was about to destroy, or injure, or poison, or get rid of him, and that some of his relatives had poisoned some other people; it was always that some individuals were about to do him mischief, and he con<lb></lb>ceived that his sister was about to hurt some other member of his family he was not under my control at that place afterwards—he was in the asylum from October, 1855, till June 3rd, 1856, but at that time I had ceased to be the physician to the asylum, though I was constantly there, as my brother was superintendent of the asylum—the prisoner was there again on 23rd April, 1861, and was discharged on March 3rd, 1862—I should say that he was not there after that—this is a document from the asylum—I believe he was confined a fifth time at Bethnal Green—I have been present in Court during the hearing of this case, and have heard that as far as Mr. Brand was concerned they were on friendly terms—the act charged against the prisoner is consistent with any form of mania—the Lunatic Asylum was subject to the visitation of the Commissioners in Lunacy, and no person could be admitted without the certificate of two medical men that he was insane, and stating the data upon which that opinion is formed—I saw the prisoner after the charge was preferred at the police-court, and again at the Old Bailey, and in my opinion he is decidedly not a person of sound mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He has never been of sound mind since I first saw him in 1845—the symptoms of acute mania are many, but it applies generally to the disease coming on suddenly, as if from some physical change—if he is now fifty-six, his age was twenty-six when he was first confined—my impres<lb></lb>sion was that he was not a man of drunken habits, but that it is insanity depending on congenital deficiency of the brain, a constitutional case of in<lb></lb>sanity—it was such insanity that he would not be responsible for his acts other people looking on and not noticing it, is perfectly consistent with the act—it would not probably be the first visible symptom of the delusion, and in other respects he would behave as an ordinary man—I had not seen him latterly, but the appearance of his face and eyes when 1 saw him at the Old Bailey showed me at once that he was a man who had indulged in drinking for a long while to a great extent—taking spirituous liquors would render a man doubly insane—anything which caused the heart to send the blood to the brain would in a weakened brain destroy its power for action—it is an ordinary thing that he should appear like anybody else.</p>

The treatment of insane patients was a speciality with me at that time—I call it irresistible impulse—when a man has passed five or six years in an asylum and has been detained there by the medical attend-mt, without any desire to make a profit, no sane man could be detained—had the prisoner gone out and purchased this medicine and brought it into the louse he might have intenteded to poison, his finding it on the table makes considerable difference; in a man whose mind is weakened you cannot tell what passes, but I think this was a sort of temptation; he had been out to get the wine and there was the linament; I tell you deliberately that I do lot think he knew that he was doing wrong, or if he did, this was an irresisti<lb></lb>ble</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I have known the prisoner ten or twelve years at Colney Hatch—he lived a quarter of a mile from the asylum with his sister, who took care of him for years—my father attended him there, and also at Winchmore Hill—I have always considered the prisoner to be of unsound mind—he used to wander about the fields with a loaded gun and said that his brother wanted to shoot him; everybody was afraid of him—I conversed with him about it, and in 1867 I took him up to Bethnal Green Asylum; that is a private asylum—he was there for a month, and was much better in consequence of being restrained from drink—he is of unsound mind apart from drink, but when he drinks that accelerates it—looking at him as he stands now without any drink in him, I believe he is of unsound mind and not responsible for his actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The form of his mania when he was confined was violence, acute mania,—when I saw him he was smashing everything in the kitchen and threatening to kill everybody—I have not studied madness very much—the longest period of confinement when I knew him was a month; that was after giving him self to drink.</p>

I have attended him and my father before me—my father would have been here but he is ill—I attended the prisoner as a family doctor; I had nothing to do with his mind, except in 1867, but I have met him and walked with him; he was then quite rational—he knew perfectly well on all other subjects what he was about, but he sometimes said that his sister was going to poison him when she brought up his tea every morn<lb></lb>ing, and that his brother was going to shoot him—I have not known him for the last eight years, he has left Colney Hatch and gone to Winchmore Hill—as long as I have known him his mania was doing injury—he was capable of knowing right from wrong, with the exception of that one idea—I have no doubt that he has been decidedly insane ever since I have known him—he has been let out as cured five times and then he breaks out again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The idea that persons are going to poison them is a frequent delusion of persons whose insanity is aggravated by drink.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a surgeon, of Winchmore Hill—I have known the prisoner for the last seven or eight years, living with his sister—he has always been greatly addicted to drink, and then he was violent and decidedly insane, but when he was sober it was difficult to get him to admit any of his insane ideas—he has been under my care and attention—many of his ways were not those of a gentleman, he used to play foolish tricks and prac<lb></lb>tical jokes, and when he gets a little drop of drink on board he is totally reckless—in my judgment he is decidedly of unsound mind, even when sober—he was very fond of his garden, and I have known him sow a bed of peas broadcast—I do not think he is responsible for his actions at this moment—I never knew him do anything malicious, it was more doing things foolishly—his sister has done all she could, and has had a keeper for him, but after<lb></lb>wards she Bent the prisoner away as he got so uncontrollable and made the house so miserable—they are all independent—the father was in some way connected with the City or the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He has sense enough to conceal his insanity when he has not got drink in him—I never found it at other times, except in those foolish tricks and in making up messes for the servants—his impulses are not irresistible when he is sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brother of the prisoner—he will be fifty-six next Sunday—he was first placed under restraint in 1845, and afterwards on four other occasions—my sister Betsy is very much attached to him, and he has lived with her for the latter part of his life—he is of a kind and generous disposition, but he would have impulses—I should say that even when perfectly sober he never was right, but of course when he was drunk he was very much worse—when he had not been drinking he told me that my sister was the murderer of the family, and that Dr. Bury was un<lb></lb>willing to give a certificate of his death, and he was not sure that he was not poisoned; that all the servants were bad characters, and put sneezing powders in the water to make us all sneeze—sometimes his conversation was almost learned, and the next moment he would fall off into something very stupid—on one or two occasions he said that his real father was con<lb></lb>fined in a cellar below—ever since 1845 he has been very eccentric at times, and my opinion is that he has never been really sane—on the oc<lb></lb>casion of his going to Hoxton House, he had gone to the station-house to complain to the police against me, but he had got a loaded gun and his mania was that I had got all the windows open, and was going to shoot him—the magistrate discharged him on the condition that I should take care of him, and actually lent me a policeman to take him to Hoxton House, Dr. Miles'.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's sister, and live at Winchmore Hill—he lived with me rather more than seven years—I was very much attached to him and anxious to take care of him—he left me nearly two years ago, and took a lodging in Camden Road on his own account—I hoped that a gentleman would be able to control him better than I could, and that if he did not like it he would return to me—I then went; into the country but he spent more than half his time with me—through the dread<lb></lb>ful delusions he had I was frightened of him., and thought I ought to have some one to control him—I consider him of decidedly unsound mind, from the accusations he brought against me and my nephew, and the singular way in which he passed his time—he said that my man servant and I broke open his boxes and stole his things, and he constantly made charges against the servants, and said nothing about it the next day—he has mixed things for the servants, strawberries and mustard, but at my house it was whiskey and other things; it was mere boyish fun—the servants said that he would say "Just taste this, is not it nice?" but not to give it as medicine—when we went to Hoxton House he had cards printed "Sir John Cameron," but I have never heard him speak of that again—the chief ac<lb></lb>cusation he brought against me was that I murdered my elder brother and my nephew.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of Newgate, and have had the prisoner under my notice since his incarceration there, on, I believe, 14th October—I examined him with a view to discover the state of his mind, hearing that he had-been in an asylum more than once—I did not discover anything irrational in his mind, and I talked to him in relation to to the charge—as far as I could see he had the sense of an ordinary person; he treated every question I put to him naturally—he had the appearance of an inebriate, but his appearance now is very much improved—I examined him, but I was not aware of the delusions under which, he suffered—I referred to the charge; he discovered no delusion about it, but denied all knowledge of it—he seemed blank as to what had occurred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My observation is limited from 14th October, till the present tune—the opportunities of observation of the other medical gentle<lb></lb>men would be greater—they have given distinct evidence of insanity—one of the strongest evidences of insanity is delusion.</p>

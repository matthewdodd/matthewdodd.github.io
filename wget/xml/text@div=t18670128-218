                  </hi>. I live in the Minories, and manage the shop of Mr. Foster, Wells Street, Whitechapel—on Tuesday, the 15th January, I hung this coat up behind the door inside about six o'clock, or between then and half-past six—I saw the prisoner come in, take it, and run away—I followed him, he dropped it in the street, ran through Wellclose Square, and I lost him—on the next Friday I saw him in Wells Street near the shop, and pointed him out to Wilson—ho saw me, and immediately walked away, and then ran; I called a policeman, and we went, but could not find him—ho was taken on the following Thursday, but I was not present; that was nine days after the offence—somebody brought the coat back.</p>

I am the prosecutor's foreman—I saw the prisoner enter the shop on the 15th, look round the door, and take Battersbee's coat—there were four gas burners in the shop, and I am positive he is the person—I saw him several times on the day he was taken, but I was in the shop alone and could not leave.</p>

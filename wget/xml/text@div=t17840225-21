               <p>Court. What words? - Deliver: I rather hesitated, upon which the prisoner swore he would shoot me, if I was not quick. I gave him my purse, containing forty one guineas and two half guineas; he then demanded my watch, which I gave him, it was gold, just on delivering the watch, I saw a watchman come round the corner of the street, and at the same time I heard him rattle, and in the mean time the prisoner ran off; I then jumped out of the coach, and the coachman getting off the box with the watchman, we pursued him, and he was taken by another watchman.</p>
               <p>Did you see the man run? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he turn out of your sight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What distance was he from you when he turned out of your sight? - I should suppose as far as from here to the door.</p>

               <p>How long was it before he was taken? - I suppose in about two minutes there was a cry that he was taken; as soon as I came up I did not know at the instant whether he was the man or no, but I said you had better feel whether he has got any thing about him; the watchman put his hands in this way to his great coat, and found a watch in his great coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that your watch? - It was, on my saying it was mine, the prisoner then said, as you have got your watch you may as well have your purse, and took my purse out of his pocket himself and gave it me, it was my purse.</p>

               <p>Should you know him? - I will know him when I see him; I called out murder at the first, and stop thief; then I sprung at him and pursued him; between the time of my following him and his being taken might be about five minutes.</p>

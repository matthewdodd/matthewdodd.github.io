                  </hi>. I live in Houndsditch, and have two partners, we carry on business as importers of foreign goods. The prisoner has been one of our warehousemen about four years—his duty was to attend to customers—if he sold goods he would make up parcels, or he might direct others to do so—if a warehouseman makes a sale to a customer, whether he makes up the parcel himself, or has it made up, it is his duty invariably to have the goods checked by the invoice by some other person in our establishment—there is no mark put on the invoice—in consequence of having had some articles stolen from us about ten months ago, we made an alteration, and prohibited our shopmen purchasing goods from us—the prisoner was aware that we had done so—I was sent for to the station, and when these parcels were opened I examined them—this purse, these pens, and these tumblers, are not in the invoice—I am quite sure of that—this invoice is the prisoner's writing, the prices here named are lower than the articles ought to have been sold at—these goods are taken out of parcels which are marked—the outside of each parcel is marked with the price in our private mark—the prisoner knew the private mark—these goods in the invoice are at lower prices than the marked price, and some of them lower than the cost price to us—I am not able to tell from this invoice, whether the prisoner bad had the goods checked to him—this purse is worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the pens, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and the tumblers, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on opening the parcels, and finding the goods were charged under cost price, I said to the prisoner, "Mr. Hunter, did you have these goods checked?"—he said, "No, Sir, I did not"—I then charged him with stealing—the custom of our establishment is, that if a gentleman comes and purchases a parcel of goods to take with him, the person serving him would make the invoice, and then make out a ticket to his number, and call "Cashier!" and the lad attending in our shop would come to him, see that the check was signed, and take it to the cashier in the desk—the invoice would then be stamped as this is, by the cashier—each of our shopmen has a check-book—they make the amount on the check, get it signed by some person, and that check with the amount of cash is then taken to the cashier—this invoice has not been exa<lb></lb>mined by any person in the establishment, because it is 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. below the worth of the articles; and if any person had examined these articles with the invoice, they must have seen these tumblers and other things, and that would have been another reason why it would not have been passed—this letter is the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To Mr. W. H. Graveley, 21, Gloucester-terrace, 6th Nov. 1851; Dear Sir, I am surprised I did not see you when you came; I was looking out for you all the morning; will you come this evening between 7 and 8 o'clock; if you do not see me ask for me, do not be afraid; the things are all looked out, the invoice is all ready; later than this evening will be useless.

               <p>goods are paid for, the person who examines signs the check, but if they are entered in a book, the book is signed—our cashier would not be entitled to take money, unless a check were produced—there was a check produced when the money was paid by Graveley—I have not that check; it was destroyed the following day, as is usual after the books have been examined—the prisoner was given into custody the same day; but we close our accounts at 4 o'clock in the afternoon—what is done after that, goes into the next day's account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But if you gave this man into custody on Thursday night, why was a document destroyed which was connected with the goods stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because we were not thoughtful enough to keep it—it was destroyed with others—the prisoner may have been in our service four or five years; I do not think it is as long as five or six—we have seventy, or seventy-five men and lads in our establishment, in different parts, and a large amount of business going on—our stock is very great—we sell a great quantity of jewellery, articles of very small bulk, but of considerable value, to the whole of which the prisoner, in common with other warehousemen, would have access—supposing the pri<lb></lb>soner were to sell articles, it would be his duty to pack them up, unless he were busy, and then somebody under his directions would pack them up—we have not employed a person under him to pack them up—we have a per<lb></lb>son named Holgate; he is not employed to pack up things, but he might do it under the prisoner's directions—the prisoner would not say, "Pack up these," and go away—he would stand by his side while he did it—I have seen warehousemen order things to be packed op, and go away—these things do not lie about very much—each of these articles was in its proper place, or should be—one article might be taken out to show—I do not know how long these parcels were left on the counter before they were taken away—I had not seen them there—I do not know that they had been packed up and left on the counter, with the invoice on them—we have had complaints about goods getting into parcels which ought not to be there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were those complaints from persons who purchased things in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; from such a house as Morrison's, who would purchase perhaps 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods; and they would send word that there was, perhaps, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of goods that were not charged—there may have been such a tiling happen in a small way at times—if these parcels had been examined, I do not think it possible that these three tumblers could have been overlooked—we take out articles from parcels to show, but they are generally put back in their places—we should never take three tum<lb></lb>blers out to show—there was a ticket taken to the cashier, which was destroyed after the prisoner was in custody—I had a search made for it, and it was not to be found.</p>

               <p>on the ticket, and it was signed by the prisoner, why did you pay it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I did not notice it—after I heard about Mr. Hunter, I looked at the ticket, and I spoke to Mr. Davis, one of the firm; he made no reply, and I thought nothing of it—it was then thrown with the rest—they were brushed over Mr. Davis's desk, and swept away—I should not have taken—the cash for it at all, if I had noticed it at the time—I have been cashier about sixteen months—I know the counters on which these things are packed up—there is not often a great deal of goods on the counter where they generally serve, and where they tie up parcels—the persons who sell the goods tie up the parcels—it is very rarely that other persons tie them up, unless they are asked to do it.</p>

I live at 21, Gloucester-terrace, New-road—I am traveller, for the firm of Gray and Son, Engineers, at Lime house—I know the prisoner—he spoke to me on this occasion, and requested me to come and purchase a few articles for him, at his master's—I received this letter from him, on 6th Nov., and in consequence I went to Mr. Hyams, about a quarter before eight, in the evening—when I got there, I found the parcels were done up, and were on the counter—I had not been there to select the goods—I did not know what the parcels were to contain—the invoice was ready made out—I had not previously given any orders about the goods—I gave the prisoner a sovereign, which was handed to the cashier, and the cashier handed me two shillings change—the sovereign was my own—the prisoner requested me to pay for the articles when I fetched them, and he would return the money to me again—I took the three parcels away—I was not aware of their contents till they were opened at the station-house—I had arranged with the prisoner, that he was to meet me in the parlour of the public-house, in Bishopsgate Church-yard—I was to go there at once, and wait till he came—he told me that the young men were not allowed to pur<lb></lb>chase for themselves, and that was the reason be wished me to purchase these things—he came to the public-house—I was sitting in the parlour, and he joined me—he said to me, "I will help you to carry your parcels"—I had selected a doll for my child, and a pencil-case for myself, which were added to the invoice, and paid for at the same time—they were the only two articles which I had selected—we went on, and I looked into Whitechapel Church, where my wife was—I then carried home two of the parcels—one of them contained the doll—I had the pencil-case in my pocket—the other two parcels belonged to the prisoner—I saw the parcels opened at the station—I remember Mr. Hyams coming there—I don't recollect whether he said anything to the prisoner.</p>

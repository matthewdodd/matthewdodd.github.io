                  </hi>. I am a baker, living in High-street, Wool<lb></lb>wich. Joy was in my employ—Dybell was in my employ for about one hour—two days after Christmas I missed one sack of flour—I and my father asked the boy about it—his name is Thomas Farley—I went for an officer, and apprehended Dybell, who was in bed, and took him to the cage—I did not find any flour—all I know is, I lost some flour—I lost a great deal before—I had spoken to Joy—he said he was sorry, and should be glad to assist me in finding it out—a sack contains five bushels.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. Parsons, and have been so for three months. About seven o'clock in the evening of Tuesday, the 26th of December, Joy and Dybell were in the bake-house—Joy was going to put the sponge in, he took half a sack of flour, and put that into the trough, (that was the proper place for it)—he took another half-sack, and put part of that in, and then he put about two bushels on Dybell's back, in the sack, and Dybell borrowed my cap to carry it with—he went away with the flour, which was about two bushels—I saw that—Joy told me not to</p>

               <p>say a word about it—I did not say any thing—I got my cap back in a quarter of an hour—a man came back for Dybell's hat, and brought my cap—his name was Garratt—he is not in custody—I told my master the next day, directly he asked me—I also told him I had stolen some loaves of bread—that is all I know about it.</p>

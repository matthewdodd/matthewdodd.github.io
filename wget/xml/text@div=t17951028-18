               <p>Q. Did you see her do that? - Yes; I told her she had it, and she threw it on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take it out of her pocket again? - Yes; she ran out of doors.</p>

               <p>Q. The moment you told her she had made a mistake, she returned it? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Court. What was done with the ribbon and lace that was taken from that woman? - I have got the lace in my pocket.</p>

               <p>I produce the ribbon. When I went into the shop the woman was in sits, and I got a coach and took her down to Bow-street, and the basket was down by her, and I took the basket and went to Bow-street, and I examined the basket at Bow-street, and found this ribbon in it.</p>
               <p>Q. To Harriott -. Did the prisoner bring in a basket with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that basket taken to Bow-street? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. To Berisford. Have you kept that ribbon till now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When you found her, I don't know whether you found her in the shop? - I found her in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she was very ill, in sits? - Yes, she was, and that made me very careful of her, it was as much as two of us could hold her.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not stop her? - I did not; I was coming down the court at the time.</p>
               <p>Boswell. It is my ribbon, there is my mark on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You cannot say that that ribbon had not been sold out of the shop? - It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Court. Who sells in your shop besides yourself? - I have a brother that serves, but there was no possibility of bringing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. To Harriot -. That was not the ribbon you sold the woman? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - Yes</p>
               <p>The prisoner called there witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

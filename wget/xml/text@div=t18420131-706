                  </hi>. In January I kept a beer-shop is the Harrow-road. It was burnt down on the night of the 17th, or morning of the 18th—I went to bed about seven minutes after twelve o'clock—I had four watches at that time, and among them a silver watch with a gold chain and two gold seals—I wound it up At twelve o'clock, and put it on the table—the fire broke out about twenty-five minutes after twelve o'clock, just after I had gone to bed—the house was burnt to the ground in twenty minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Slater. On the morning of the 18th of January, about ten minutes after nine o'clock, I was standing close to Mr. Morley's house—there had been a fire there—I saw the prisoner in a passage which leads under the house, and another young man with him—I saw the prisoner pick up a watch, put it into his pocket, and walk away with the other young man—I followed them about half-a-mile, till I saw a policeman—I then told him of it—he went to him, and asked him where the watch was which he picked up at the fire—he pulled it out of his pocket, and gave it him, saying, "There it is"—the policeman took him, and told the other one to come to the station, but he ran away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There was a number of people on the premises, was there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the firemen were on the first floor, looking for a body that was burnt—I saw some rubbish fall down while the prisoner was there—the moment it fell the prisoner put his hand down, and picked up the watch—he went nearly half-a-mile before I spoke to a policeman—I had never seen him before.</p>

                  </hi>. On the morning of the 18th of January, Hunt spoke to me, and pointed to two men; in consequence of which, I stopped the prisoner, and said, "Where is that watch you have got?"—he put his hand into his pocket, and said, "Here it is, don't hurt me"—I said, "You must go with me to the station"—I took him there, then went to No. 1, Paddington-green, where Mr. Morley was staying, and showed him the watch—I should say I took the prisoner half-a-mile from the house which was burnt. (The prisoner received a good character.) <hi rend="largeCaps">

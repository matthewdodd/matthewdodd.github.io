               <p>HENRY GODDARD. I am a Police-officer. I went to Mr. Turrill's, in Oxford-street, on the 5th of April; I saw Williams there - I told him Mr. Turrill had been robbed, and asked him to step up stairs; I then asked him to get his duplicates, if he had any about him - he said he would fetch them; he went up stairs - I followed, and he gave me a pocket-book, containing several duplicates, amongst which was one for a dressing-case, pawned for 1l. 15s., and one for five pencil-cases, pawed for 10s.; he said he intended to have restored them again, and he did not think there was any harm in taking them - I asked him if he knew a man named Rogers; he said he had not seen him for six months, but he afterwards admitted that he had seen him a few days before, and had drank with him; I then went with Clements to James-street, Lisson-grove - he brought from a house there some property, which Mr. Wright identified; I do not know what Rogers is - in consequence of what Williams said I found four prayer-books, which were pawned at Mr. Dobree's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q. You desired Williams to produce the duplicates, and he did? A. Yes; he made no attempt to prevent my seeing them.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK CLEMENTS. I am a Police-officer. I took Rogers at the Cape of Good Hope, in Titchfield-street, on the 5th of April; I said he would have to give an account of a robbery at Mr. Turrill's - he said he could not, for he knew nothing about it; I asked where he lived - he would not tell me for some time, but at the office he said it was at a coal-shed in Great James-street, Lisson-grove; I went there with Goddard and Wright - a key which I took from Rogers opened a box which I found there; I found in the box this Bible, wafer-seal, three sticks of sealing-wax, and other things; I took them to the office, and asked Rogers how he accounted for the possession of them - he said he had received them from Williams; I went the same evening with Mr. Wright, to Jewin-street, and after waiting several hours, I apprehended Evans - I asked him if he knew a person named Turrill's; he said he did - I asked if he was in the habit of going to that shop frequently; he said he was - I asked if he had ever pawned any thing for Williams; he said he had, and after some hesitation he recollected himself, and said he had pawned a dressing-case for 35s. - that he took out a waistcoat at the same time, and took the remainder of the 35s. to Williams.</p>

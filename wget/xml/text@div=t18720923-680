                  </hi>. I am a carman, residing at 57, Manchester Street, Aldgate—on 15th June I left Milton Street, about 10.10—I was on my box—I got to the Minories about 10.45, or from that to 11 o'clock—I met the prisoners in Milton Street, at Mr. Hudson's Yard, a few minutes past 10 o'clock, and when I left the yard they were with me and another man—I gave them a lift—after we left Milton Street we went to a public-house, and I paid for a pot of beer—I went on in the van with the two prisoners, and Howes on the box—at the Minories they went in and had something to drink—I had a drink of beer—they got into the van, and Howes drove away again—I don't know whether he calls himself Roberts now, but he is know to us by the name of <hi rend="italic">Creeping Jesus</hi>—his name is Farringdon—I don t know whether he gives his name Roberts, and Smith goes down with me in the van, and shoves his knee in my neck—the other one fell kicking me in the face and rifled my pockets and took my money—they rose off the tail</p>

               <p>board of the van just as we got to Goodman's Yard—Howes still kept driving on and never stopped till he got inside the gates—I then got off and went round to the public-houses to see if I could see anything of them round the Minories, round Sparrow Corner and Goodman's Yard—perhaps I was gone a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I had lost 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a sovereign, half-sovereign, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and two penny pieces—I saw them last when I put them in my pocket in Milton Street—then I took a shilling out for the beer, and put 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. back with the rest—when I got <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the stable-yard I went home—I saw Howes there then—I was smothered with blood about the face—I gave information to the police on Monday morning—I was hurt severely and have not got over the effects yet—my eye was hurt—I stopped at home a week, and went about with the policemen—the left eye was closed up for two days, and I was forced to pull my right eye open to see out of it—my neck was hurt, and I can't hear as well with my right ear as I did before by a great deal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was only at one public-house; we stopped at three—we stopped at the Golden Lion and had a pot—I paid for one and I had a share of it—I don't know what the others had after I came out—they got into the van, and we drove to another public-house—they asked me to have some beer there—I refused to have any—we pulled up at one in Lon<lb></lb>don Wall, but I did not get out of the van—I did not have anything there—we pulled up at the Coach and Horses in the Minories—they brought out some gin first, which I refused, and one of them brought out some beer and I had a drink out of the pot—we did not stop at any other till we got to the yard—I was not drunk—after I had been knocked down and robbed I went and searched in some public-houses—I should, say that was about five minutes after I had been knocked down—Howes drove all the way—I never told him—I had no chance of shouting out when I was knocked down, his knee was on my neck—I had not the least chance of making any noise—Howes was sitting on the box not more than two yards off, and he kept on driving—all this side of my face was covered with blood—when Howes pulled the van up I had a chance of telling him—I did not tell him—I went and searched then—I saw Howes in the yard when I came back—he did ask me where I had been—if he did I did not tell him—I say I was sober, and that Howes did not ask me where I had been; I did not say anything to him when I camp back—I never told him that the two fellows who had been riding in the van had robbed me—the van was mine—Howes was in the same em<lb></lb>ployment—I was stupefied when I got out of the van—I went into several public houses—I was not too stupid to do that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Wainwright, sugar refiners, of Whitechapel—I met Bennett in Fore Street, one Saturday night, in June, just by Milton Street—there was me and Bennett and the two prisoners, and two other stragglers—I did not know who they were—we went into a public-house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230056"></xptr>
               <p>in Fore Street—we had three pots of beer—Bennett had some of it—he said "We must see about getting off home"—I said "I am going home, I will have a ride down with you"—the prisoners said they were going that road, and they had a ride as well—I drove—Bennett was sitting on a basket on the near side of the van—the prisoners were standing up each side of the rail—when we got to London Wall we had another pot of beer—it is a house the carmen generally stop at—I paid for that—we all had some of it—we took some out to Bennett—we came out and drove to the Minories—we had a half-pint of gin there—Bennett was sitting on the basket in the van—I came out and drove on again—I said "Bennett, I am going home now"—he said "You may as well come down to the stable and help me put the horse away"—we all had some of the gin—the prisoners were in the van—we drove down the Minories, round Sparrow Corner, and that way—when I got to the yard, I looked round, and could not see the prisoners in the van—I did not hear anything on the way, and Bennett never called out to me—we passed through the arch of the Midland Goods Station—there is a lamp over the booking-office, and there was no traffic about then, it was between 11 and 12 o'clock at night—Bennett got out of the van as I stopped at the yard, and went away—he came back about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, and said to me "You know all about this affair"—I asked him what he meant—he said "Oh, you know, "and then the foreman would not let him come in the yard—he had a cut on his eye—he said "You know what that is"—we went over to a public-house at the comer of the yard and had a pot of beer there—he said then "You know all about it"—I know nothing about it—he did not holloa to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not want to go with these men—I said "I should go home"—but Bennett said "Come and help me put up the horse"—I was three-parts drunk—we stopped at three public-houses on the road down—we had three pots of ale in; the first in Fore Street, one pot in the second, and gin in the third—Bennett partook of drink at most of the places—I took him the beer out myself in Fore Street—I saw some gin brought out to him, which he drank—I was alongside the horse then—when Bennett came back to the yard, he was bleeding down the side of his face.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see that when you got out of the van? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say; I did not have time to look at him then—I stopped outside the yard, because the gates were shut, and he got out directly and game back ten minutes afterwards—the foreman helped me to put the horse up, and I believe after we had had the last pot of beer he took me home—Bennett had been to get his wages that evening, and I had got mine—I was half drunk when I took my wages, because I had been in the country that day, and the foreman could not give my wages at first—I should say that Bennett was three-parts drunk.</p>

On Monday, 17th July last, I saw the prosecutor in Seething Lane Police-station—he was very much bruised and disfigured on the left side of his face—his neck was partly on one side as if he had got a stiff neck—he made his complaint and I was instructed to take the matter in hand—from what he said I went in search of the prisoners and found they had left the place where they usually worked—I ascertained that they were in custody for another offence in Coldbath Fields—I went there with prosecutor on 16th July, and he picked them out from another one—when they were freed I went and took them into custody, and told them they would be charged with robbing and assaulting</p>

               <p>George Bennett on 15th June last in the Minories—Roberts said he knew nothing of it, and Smith said he was innocent—on the way to the police-station Smith said "Why were not others brought in as well as us?"—I said "What do you mean by that?"—he said "There were others in the van besides us, and Jack Howes was driving, why don't you bring him in?"</p>

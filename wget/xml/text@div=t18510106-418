                  </hi>. I am yardsman of the workhouse of Bermondsey. The prisoners had lately been inmates of the workhouse—these saws are the property of the Guardians of the Poor of Bermondsey—I saw them safe about ten o'clock on Wednesday night, 1st Jan., in the work-room—I went into the work-room next morning, and found a square of glass had been taken out of the window; that would admit a small person—I looked round, and missed these two saws—went into the kitchen, and missed two loaves of bread, some mutton-chops, four or five ounces of tea, and some sugar, a waistcoat, two towels, two aprons, and a pair of stockings—this is the tea and sugar—the chops were before the Magistrate, and I knew them—here is about five ounces of tea, and about 1 1b. of sugar—I know the sugar by its colour—I know this waistcoat; here is the mark of the Guardians on it—I saw it in a drawer in the kitchen on Wednesday night, at half-past nine—these stockings are the property of the Guardians; they have the mark of Camberwell on them—they were in the drawer that night, and were missed the next morning—I had seen the place locked up that night at ten—no one could have got in and abstracted this property before half-past five in the morning except by getting through the window—there is a short street at the back of the workhouse, where some new buildings are going on, and there is a wall about four feet high, which they could get over and get to the outside of the window—these bits of wood belonged to the saws.</p>

I am an inmate of the workhouse—I know these towels—they belong to the Guardians—they were given me for my use—I had them in use for twelve months—they have my initials in the corner—I saw them safe at eight o'clock on Wednesday night under my desk; when I came down on Thursday morning I missed them—my office is within the building—there was no other mode of getting to my place but through that window, I believe—I went to bed about eight.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 182). I was on duty on Thursday morning, 2nd Jan.—I saw the prisoners and two other persons at half-past five o'clock in front of a lodging-house in Kent-street, which is nearly half a mile from the workhouse—Spiller had a bundle, and I found the two saws at the end of the house—the prisoners were knocking at the door—they went in, and I went in and took them—they were</p>

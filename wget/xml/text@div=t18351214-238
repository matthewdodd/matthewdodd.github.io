                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Bryant, a furrier. I went to Mrs. Harris, in Norfolk-street, Islington, on the 7th of March—the pri<lb></lb>soner was there—about ten o'clock, I meant to go away, and missed my shawl and veil—this is the shawl—when it was bought it was worth 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw the prisoner again the same evening at Mrs. Harris's—I did not see her after it was found, till she was in custody at Worship-street—she said she had lost them, and if I would not prosecute her they should be returned.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At that time you were not mar<lb></lb>ried? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; my name was Collins—I was in the habit of visiting Mrs. Harris, and always saw the prisoner there—she was not married at that time—I lived with my father and mother at Ball's Pond before I was mar<lb></lb>ried—I saw the prisoner two or three days afterward at Mrs. Harris's—I had been in the habit of lending her things on two or three occasions—I never saw her from the time I was married, till she was in custody—she said that she came into the room, where she supposed I was, to ask me to lead the shawl, and not finding me, she took it, intending to return it—I believe she would have returned it if she had known where I lived—she was the last person I should suspect.</p>

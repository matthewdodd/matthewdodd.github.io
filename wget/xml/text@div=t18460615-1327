                  </hi>. I live in Little Wild-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and am employed as a private watchman. On the Friday afternoon, the 5th of June, I was opposite to the National Gallery, in Trafalgar-square, and saw the prisoner and two other persons—in consequence of what I observed I followed them to Panton-street, Haymarket—they all three stopped at Messrs. Garrard's, a sil<lb></lb>versmith's shop—I went into Mr. Brumby's, a bookseller's shop, and asked him to allow me to watch from his window what was going on—while I was looking out of the window, the prisoner came up to the prosecutor's window first—another came up close to him—one of them waited at the corner of Panton-street—I saw the prisoner run something along the glass—I did not see anything in his hand—after that the other held a handkerchief in front, where he had been drawing along the glass—a gentleman's servant came out of the shop—on that the prisoner and his companion walked away—I could not see whether they abstracted anything—I suffered them to go because I thought it had not been perfected, and that they would come back—the gen<lb></lb>tleman's servant pointed to the glass—I went out of the shop, and found the prisoner in a watering-place, in a court in the Haymarket—I had called the attention of the bookseller to what I saw—I called a policeman, and told him to take the prisoner to the silversmith's shop, on suspicion of felony—he did so—I do not know what became of the other two—I never saw them except at the corner of the street—I lost sight of the prisoner, but not for a minute—I am positive he is the same man—I found the glass had been out—I bad seen it perfect before they came to the window.</p>

Garrard's window is twelve or fourteen yards, I should think, from the bookseller's window—there was glass in the bookseller's window, and books on the shelves—I got close to the window, and leaned over the books—the gentleman's servant pointed to the window—I did not go to him, because I should have lost the prisoner—I was not looking out for a job—I was out for a walk—I do not watch in the day time—I did not know the prisoner or the others before.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a bookseller's shop at the corner of Panton-street, opposite Mr. Garrard's—On Friday, the 5th of June, Hind asked me to allow him to come into my shop, and called my attention to what he saw—I saw the prisoner at Mr. Garrard's window, and a slim young man with him, who placed a red handkerchief at the corner of a square of glass-the prisoner immediately placed his hand under the handkerchief—I observed a motion of his hand, as if he used a screw-driver or gimlet—a livery servant came out of the shop, and the prisoner and his companion retired from the window for a few minutes, up to the Haymarket-they returned and made a second attack on the property of Mr. Garrard—I went out, and on my return home the prisoner was in custody—I have not a shadow of a doubt touching his identity.</p>

On Friday, the 5th of June, at half-past one o'clock, the shop window was all safe, and the spoons were in the window—it is my business to stand on that side of the shop where the window is—I discovered the flaw in the glass about four o'clock—Mr. Garrard's attention had then been called to it—I missed twenty-five apostle spoons—we have uot recovered them—they bad been placed at the corner of the window, close to the spot where the piece was gone.</p>

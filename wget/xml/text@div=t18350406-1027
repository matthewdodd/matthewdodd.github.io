The prisoner was in my service about four months—I sent him every morning to Belle Isle—on the 4th of April, I put the bread on the counter for him to load his barrow while I went down to the bake-house—there were fifteen quartern loaves and twenty half-quartern—I did</p>

I saw the prisoner fetch his barrow—he then looked into the cask, but did not take any thing—he then went and took two loaves out of the cask, and ran towards the New-road, where he had left his barrow—I pursued and took him—he wanted to get away, and said the bread belonged to him—he had been to Belle Isle with fifteen half-quarterns and ten quarterns, but instead of delivering the twenty-five loaves, he kept two back, and delivered only twenty-three.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at New Brentford. I employed Froomes to work with me on my premises, on 28th April—I had some lead sash-weights in my nail-room—he could get there from where he was working by going up a ladder, which was inside the wash-house—I had seen the weights safe a day or two before he was at work there—I missed them on 5th May—I made some inquiry, and went that day to Goodman's house, and asked him if he had purchased any sash-weights, and described them—he said he had not—I said I had found a place where they had been offered for sale—I then left, and went away about a hundred yards—be called me back, and said he had purchased these seven sash-weights; he laid them on the counter, and asked if they were mine—I said they were—he said he had bought them, and given 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a 1b. for them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 157). I heard of the robbery on 5th May—I found the prisoner on 16th May—I knew where his friends lived; I passed there several times, but did not see him—when I took him, I told him it was for stealing some leaden sash weights of Mr. Blundell—he said he should tell the truth about them—I then went to Goodman's, he had the weights—he said he had given 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb. for them—he gave me this book, and said all that he had bought for twelve months past had been entered in it; this lead is entered in it, but no price put to it.</p>

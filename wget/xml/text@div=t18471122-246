                  </hi> I am a licensed hawker—I have been lodging for some at time Mr. Morgan's at the Rose and Crown Inn, Wandsworth. On Tuesday evening, 2nd Nov., I was in the tap-room at the Rose and Crown—I was a little the worse for drink—I saw Stepney there, I did not notice Moggeridge—there was more than one woman there—I treated them and other persons with beer—I took out a sixpence first, and then half-a-crown to pay for half a gallon of ale—I had my purse in my pocket—there were thirteen sovereigns and one half-sovereign in it, and I cannot tell how much silver—I recollect that Stepney had her arm round my neck—I laid my head on the table, on my hand—I do not know how long I laid so—I afterwards felt in my pocket—my purse was gone, and my pockets, turned inside out, I had not a halfpenny left—I ran to the bar, and shouted out that I was robbed—I lost my money, that brought me to my senses—the landlord came from the back parlour when I shouted—he said, "It would have been a good job if you had lost your head"—I ran to close the door to get a policeman—the landlord would not let me shut it—he said he was master of his own house—I went out and got a policeman—I was back in a few minutes—the people who had been in the tap-room were then all gone—when I was going to bed I missed my comb, my scissors, and pocket-book, which had all been in my pocket—I have seen the scissors again—I had had them nearly twelve months—I had them from Henry M' Leary—I left Mr. Morgan's house after that—he proposed to get me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

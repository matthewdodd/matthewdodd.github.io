                  </hi>. I am a saddle and harness maker in Finsbury-place. The prisoner was in my service for seven years—I discharged him on the 3rd of August—he was to come again to finish some work, which he had left undone—he came again, finished part of his work, and at night he came for his wages—I called him into the counting-house, and told him the foreman accused him of taking a pair of traces off the pre<lb></lb>mises—he acknowledged that he had—I asked him where they were—he said he would not tell me, and I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Palliser's service. On Wednesday or Thursday I missed a pair of traces from the prisoner's bench in the manufactory—I made inquiry about it—on the Saturday the prisoner came to finish his work—I asked him where the other two traces were, as there had been four—he said he had taken them down, from which I supposed he had finished them and taken them down—I said, "You have not taken them down"—he said he had—I said, "Who did you give them to?"—he could not tell me—I went and asked the foreman if he had received them—he said, "No"—I told the foreman he had better not pay him till his work was finished—the traces produced I believe to be the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I told him they were not finished, but I would bring them on the Monday—he said, "Have you pawned them? if you have I will lend you the money to get them out"—I said, "No, I have not." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did say so.</p>

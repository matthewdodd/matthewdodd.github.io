                  </hi>. I am a journeyman carpenter, and live in Holbrook-court, Fitzroy-market. On the 20th of December, I was in a public-house, in Tottenham-court-road, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—I was not intoxicated—I did not sit down, but stood at the bar—I cannot say how long I had been there—I work for Mr. Brown, of University-street—I left work about six o'clock, and went into the public-house with a friend—I remained there till this time—I was going home, met another friend, and went into this house—my three half-crowns were in my jacket pocket—I went into the house—I had them in my hand, and put them in my pocket—after eleven o'clock I was robbed, but I was intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's daughter, and am twelve years old. I never go to church—I believe if I tell a lie I shall go to hell—I went to Mr. Gurney's public-house, in Tottenham-court-road, with my father—he was going home, and met a man who asked him to have something to drink—we went into this house, then into another, and stopped there till eleven o'clock—my father had three half-crowns in his pocket—I saw him put them into his left hand side pocket, in the first public-house—I did not see them taken—five or six men were standing behind his back—one of them put his hand into my father's pocket, and took the money out, but how much, I do not know—I cannot say who took it—the prisoner was one of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 20th of December, I was outside this house—there was a disturbance—the prosecutor gave the prisoner into custody, and said he had lost two half-crowns and a shil<lb></lb>ling—he then said it was three half-crowns—I searched him—he produced nine half-crowns—the girl came forward and said he was the man who took the money from her father's pocket—I immediately took him—he told the Inspector a girl had given him the money—he said at first it was his own.</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner was you robbed? - On Sunday evening, the 28th of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon, me and my wife went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any body with you? - No, only me and my wife; we returned home a little after eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the windows? - They were all shut up, and the doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark when you returned home? - It was quite dark; I found the doors just the same as I left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any violence after you came home? - After we had been home, we thought we heard some body in the shop; we were sitting in the parlour, by the fire; the shop and parlour is all on one floor.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came in you shut the door after you; you saw the house was shut up? - Yes; there was a light in the room but not in the shop; and when I heard a noise in the shop, I saw the prisoner at the bar in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you see him in the shop? - Through the sash of the door; when I saw him I got up from the chair and pursued him; I suppose he heard me get up from the chair; I went to the shop door and see a man with his back towards the house, in the street, against the wall; then I went to him, and I said, my lad, what business had you in the shop? he said, he had not been in my shop, he did not know where my shop was; so I went and put my hand into his coat pocket, and forbid him to move from where he was standing; he then made a jump and dropped the cocoa, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the cocoa drop? - Yes, I see it drop; with that I picked up one of the parcels and pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see both of them drop? - Yes, I saw both of them drop; so I pursued him, and took him about a hundred yards from my shop, when I took him I charged an officer with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you kept the cocoa from that time to this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that to be your cocoa? - I believe it to be mine; I had only two parcels in the shop window.</p>
               <p>Q. How were these two parcels in the shop window, were they papered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the same sort of paper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any writing on the paper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the writing? Was there any writing of your's? - No, but I know the night before I left it there, and put it up myself in the window, and this is the same writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment how he got in? - No, I cannot form any idea of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your door? - I latched the door after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure? - Yes.</p>

On the 14th of July, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in and asked for a skein of sewingsilk, which came to 3d. and one yard of twist; he paid for them, and took a piece of twist out of the drawer, and kept it in his hand. He had a piece of cloth in which I saw him attempt to wrap it up; he put both into his pocket. He pulled the cloth out again, and put it on the counter, leaving the twist in his pocket. I went round the counter and charged him with having put a piece of twist in his pocket. He said he had not, and almost pushed me down. I went up to him again, he then took the twist out, which I caught in his hand. He begged me to let him go, saying he had a wife and four children, one of whom was dying, which induced him to do it.</p>

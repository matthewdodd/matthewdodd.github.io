I am a carman of 7, Commodore-court, Poplar, and ply for hire outside the East and West India Docks—on 8th July, about 11 in, morning, I was outside the docks, and Furniss and a man named Watson, who is not here, came to me—Furniss said, "I shall have a little job for you in the course of an hour or so," and at half-past 1 or 2 o'clock they came to me again, and told me to bring the cart—Watson got up into it, Furniss walked on a-head, and I drove into the docks at the north end, alongside No. 2 shed, where I found Brooks—Watson said, "Back the cart, and I will put it in"—there was some rope lying there, with a full sack lying on it, which did not cover it—Watson and Brooks gave me the rope to put into the cart, and Watson told me to put the sack under the <hi rend="italic">shakings</hi>—when the cart</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable and clerk in the police office in the docks—on 8th July, about half-past 1 o'clock, Brooks came to me, and this order was produced," <hi rend="italic">Please to pass bearer with about 5 owt.</hi> old rope, from the schooner, Planet; G. H. Derel, master"—I said that I had not the name of the captain on the licence, and said to Brooks," What quantity have you?—he said, "3 owt."—I said, "The pass is for 5 owt"—he made no answer—I told him to let me see the rope, and bring it up—I looked at it, and from the pass and the rope, and some information I had, I suspected that it was not correct—it is usual to have rope brought up before I sign a pass—I told Brooks that it was not satisfactory, he must leave the rope, and fetch the captain—he said that it was no use going, as the captain was not on board—next day, Saturday, about 11 in the morning, Brooks come again, and said, "Mind that rope does not belong to me; James Furniss gave me the pass, and asked me to buy the rope"—I said, "What do you come to me for?"—he said, "I have come here to clear myself; I will have no more to do with you"—no charge had been made against him then—he went away—I saw him about 10 o'clock that night in Wade-street, Poplar, and said, "You must go with me to Mr. Liddell," another constable, which he did, and from there he was taken to the station-house.</p>

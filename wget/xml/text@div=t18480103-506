                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Joseph Willes Rumball—we are silk-mercers, at 78, Oxford-street. The prisoner was our assistant about ten months—these nineteen yards of satinet are ours, and worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we purchased it at Morrison and Co.'s, in Fore-street—it had never been sold—this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is the prisoner's writing—it was given to the pawnbroker, to get the money for this satinet—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Gentlemen, My son has full authority from me to pawn the article in question—Henry Williams, 86, Newman-street.")</p>

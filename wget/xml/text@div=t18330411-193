I lost a stove from there on the 30th of March; I had seen it safe and fixed about five o'clock the same day - there were four keys in different locks in that house at that time - I afterwards saw the stove and the keys in the hands of the Policeman; they were the property of Mr. Robert Eckett.</p>

             (Police-constable G 48). I live at No. 11, John-street. Wilmington-square. On the morning of the 30th of March I stopped the prisoner in Bagnigge-wells-road, carrying this stove; he said he was taking it to Ray-street, for Mr. Hibbert - I took him to the station, and found these keys on him, which fitted the doors of the house, and the stove fitted the place; he was about two hundred yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw two men in the street, who asked me if I would do a job; they took me to Chapel-street, and gave me the stove and the keys - they had each of them a parcel; they told me to go to Ray-street.</p>

            . I live at Merton, in Surrey. I was possessed of a horse, which I lost on the morning of the 18th of June; I saw him before on the morning of the 17th of June. I missed him on the morning of the 18th, when I found my stable entered, and the staple wrenched out of the door, and the door broken open. I saw him again on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100012"></xptr>Friday at about eleven o'clock; I know nothing of the prisoner with respect to it. I had some harness stolen with my horse, but only found the collar. I saw the horse at Mr. Ing's; it is a horse now down here. I don't know the prisoner at all.</p>

            . I was at work with this horse on the 17th of June; I went home with him about three o'clock. I saw him about nine o'clock on that day. The next morning, the man who looks after the team, went to the stable first; I went between five and six, and saw that it was broken open. I had locked it the over night, that I am sure of; I carried the key in doors, and hung it up as usual. I know the prisoner at the bar; I did not know him before the horse was lost. I did not go with my master to Mr. Ing's.</p>

            . Mr. Ing is my master, and my uncle; he is a cow-keeper. I and Mr. Ing were at the Grafton Head, the corner of the yard, on Wednesday morning, the 19th of June. The prisoner and another man came in, and the prisoner asked Mr. Ing if he had any place that he could put his horse in; he said, yes, and came out to the door, and he sent me down to take the horse in; I took him down the yard, and the prisoner went with me. The horse was in harness in a cart; I unharnessed him. and we took the collar off, and hung it up in the stable. The prisoner bid me give him a quartern of oats, which I did. After that, he asked me if I would go up and have any thing to drink, and I said, yes, I would, and I went up, and got something to drink, and the other man was there; they had a bowl of gin and milk; nobody paid for it. After this, the prisoner came down the yard again, and ordered me to give the horse another quartern of oats. I did not see the prisoner or the other man after that. I never saw the prisoner again until the next morning. My master went up to Mr. Roffey's, not this Mr. Roffey, his brother. The next morning the prisoner came to fetch the horse and cart away, and I was ordered, if he came, to get some body to help me to secure him. He said, he wanted the horse out directly, and while he was gone to a certain place, I sent for a constable; then I gave him into the hands of the constable. I was ordered directly to fetch the officers from Bow-street.</p>

               <p>GEORGE SQUIBB. I am watchhouse-keeper, and apprehended the prisoner. I went up to him as he came out of the privy, and said, my friend, is this cart, and the horse belonging to it yours; and he said yes, it is. In consequence of that, I said, there is a very strong suspicion that it is not yours, and I must detain you; and I said Mr. Goodwin, you assist me to take this man to the watchhouse. In his left hand waistcoat pocket, I found this pistol, loaded; it is not loaded now; there was a ball in it, and powder; and there was ball and powder enough for another load or two.</p>

               <p>George Hughes. I have been to look at the horse; it is now down at the door; that is the horse that the prisoner brought in the morning of the 19th; I have the collar in my hand.</p>

            . I have been down to see the horse, it is mine; it is one that was lost from the stables on the morning of the 18th.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the first place, the constable said that pistol was loaded, and it was not; neither are those two balls that are there, mine. Another thing, the ostler says that nobody brought the cart in but me; but the owner of the cart took it out himself. I am a total stranger. The first time I saw this cart was at Battle Bridge, on Tuesday, about the middle of the day; the man was offering it for sale, and I believe the person who was looking at it, would have bought it, only he said, he had another one making. Then after that, the owner went on with his cart. I went to the person who was about buying it, and the man said, if he could get it for fifteen or sixteen pounds, it would be a bargain. The next time I saw it was when the owner was coming from Cambden Town, coming from the New-road to Tottenham-court-road, and I said, hoy; have you sold your cart; and he said, no; and I said, stop, and I will buy it of you if we can agree; and he said, very well, wait a minute or two; and I waited a bit, and he returned again, and we agreed for fifteen pounds, and I paid thirteen pounds down, twelve pounds in notes, and one in silver, and I told him I would give him the rest if he would go up to my cousin's, and he said, very well, and we put the cart in, and then he came back again, and we waited, and then came another person, who lived handy there, and paid him some money, and I thought he well knew him, and he paid him down some money, three or four pounds; I understood that he kept an iron shop, and that he brought it from his own home. When he got to my cousin's, I asked him to take the rest of the money, and he asked me my name, and where I lived, and all that, and I said, I would come and meet him.</p>



               <p>- KENTON. I am a sawyer; I live up by Lord's cricket-ground, near Paddington. I know the prisoner; all I know of him is seeing him along with his brother; I know him by sight.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him any where on the morning of the 19th of June-A. I don't know the day of the month, but I saw him in Tottenham-court-road, Wednesday three weeks, yesterday, it was between six and seven o'clock in the morning, and in Tottenham-court-road. As I was crossing the top of Tottenham-court-road, I saw him looking round a cart; that cart had a horse to it; there was a tall stout man, and the prisoner, with that cart. I heard the prisoner say the cart was not worth so much money; it was fifteen pound that he said was two much; he said the cart was very much out of repair, and would never run long. The other made answer, that sold it, and said, it would run for three months longer with very little repair. Then they walked round it a little bit, and then walked of the road on to the pavement. The prisoner said I have not enough to pay you now, but I will pay you some now, and settle the rest with you in the morning, or something to that purpose. He said, you meet me here at this public-house to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock; there was a public-house not far off, he pointed towards it, and said, I will settle with you, and you will get a stamp for a receipt. I saw the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100013"></xptr>pull his money out, it consisted of notes; he said, here is twelve pounds in paper, and here is one pound in silver. I saw the prisoner give that money to the man.</p>

               <p>MARY GATES, I am a widow; I live in Thomas's-buildings, Somers Town, at the top of Phoenix-street. The prisoner at the bar has lodged with me; he took my lodging on the 1st of May, Wednesday. He lodged with me until he was taken up; he slept at home the night before he was taken up, and the night before that; he never slept out of his lodging since he has had it; he went to bed at about half past ten on the night of the 17th; he came in about seven, and continued at home from seven until he went to bed, and never went out of doors, and at half past ten he went to bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether he continued in the house until the next morning - A. I am certain of it.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did he go out the next morning - A.About nine.</p>

               <p>George Hughes. The Grafton Head is twenty or thirty yards from the top of Tottenham-court-road. I saw a man named Read, a dealer in marine-stores, in the public-house. There was another man with the prisoner; it was between nine and ten in the morning when the prisoner came back; the other man never came back.</p>

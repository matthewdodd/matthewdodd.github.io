I lost two pairs of stockings between the 18th and 22nd of January; they had been in my possession on the 18th, and the prisoner left my father's service on the 22nd - I have seen them at Guildhall, they had the letter B. which the laundress had put on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The laundress put it in? A. Yes - I had bought them on the 5th of January; the prisoner had been two or three months in my father's employ: she had given notice to quit; she had not left her address with me - I had paid her her wages - we had a character with her; the initial of her name is the same as mine; I have two sisters.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you an opportunity of searching her box? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BLUNDELL. The prisoner was in my service from the beginning of November till the 22nd of February - I received information that she was gone to live in Fetter-lane, and I went there with an officer; I found two pairs of cotton stockings in her box, which was enclosed in a trunk - she gave up the key of it; I had a pair of stockings with me, and those I found corresponded with them; she said they were her own, but did not say where she got them; she said at Guildhall that she bought them and marked them, and her name being Baines, she had marked them with the letter B. - here are the stockings, and this is the pair I took with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean there were no other things in the trunk marked with B.? A. There were other things marked, but not in the same way; this is done by a laundress - I did not see her do it; it is just run with a needle and cotton, and the other articles were marked in the way a sampler is - these are marked with red; I do not know what colour her other things were marked with; there might be stockings marked with B. for what I know - I saw a great many stockings marked with B.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said you found these stockings marked with a B. - that she said she always marked with a B., and you say they were not marked in the same way? A. They are marked in a more temporary way.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there a B. on the prisoner's stockings? A. There might be; no doubt there was, but I did not take particular notice; there was a difference between these and hers.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know there was a difference, if you paid no attention? A. They might be marked with a B. but I did not take particular notice; all that I looked at were marked 
               <persName id="t18300218-152-person1044">B. </persName>
            - I cannot swear they were not marked with red; they were of a different texture - the prisoner had given notice to quit - I had not quarrelled with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make a charge against her, and she said she would not stay in the house? A. No. My cook afterwards gave me warning to quit; I did not ask the prisoner to take the cook's place; the cook's name was Simmonds - I had no quarrel with her, I do not know whether my wife had - I have not been speaking to any of the witnesses who are to give the prisoner a character, to my knowledge; I have not, to my recollection - two or three persons have come to me to request me to be as lenient as possible - I have spoken to a man named Hilditch; I have not endeavoured to prevent his coming forward - I told him she had been guilty of a theft, because Mrs. Hilditch had recommended her into my family; - it was a fortnight after she left before I went to search her trunk, but I did not know of it before.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Blundell to the prisoner's room, in Fetter-lane - she presented the keys of her box; I said, "You had better open it yourself;" and she did - we found two pairs of stockings in the box; Mr. Blundell looked at them, and mentioned the slight way in which they were marked; there is only one pair marked - he made an observation on the marks of the others in the trunk; on the size of the letter - the other stockings were marked with a small B. - I considered some of them were marked with red, and some with ink.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She gave up her keys the moment you asked her? A. Yes - it would not take half a minute to take out this mark.</p>

            . My mother is the laundress, and I have the care of the linen; Miss Blundell wore these stockings, and sent them without a mark; I marked three pairs, and sent them home with the mark on them - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180071"></xptr>this is a mark I put in for Miss Blundell - these other pairs have had the mark, but it has been drawn out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long would it take to remove this mark? A. I cannot say, certainly it could be removed.</p>
               <p>EDWARD DUNSBY. I am a hosier. I sold some stockings of this sort to Miss Blundell.</p>

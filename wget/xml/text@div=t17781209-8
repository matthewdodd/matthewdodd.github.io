               <p>Upon the 14th of November, while I was standing at my door, between eight and nine in the morning, I saw a young woman at the pamphlet shop opposite; she seemed to stand very uneasy, shuffling up her petticoats. I looked, and saw a piece of linen hang down to her shoes from under her petticoats; she went into the pamphlet shop, and then I saw more of the linen. I went up to her, and asked what she had there; she said, nothing; I took hold of it, and pulled it from between her legs, and delivered it to the woman of the pamphlet shop, and we went to Mr. Gardiner. She delivered it to Mr. Gardiner.</p>

I call'd out stop thief, and he was secured and carried to an alehouse. After he had been there some time he took my handkerchief out of his breeches, and said that he did not take it, but that another person pick'd it out of my pocket, and gave it to him (produced in court, and deposed to by a mark on it. )</p>
               <p>Lancelot Warton. I am a pastry-cook near Holbourn-Bridge. I have seen the prisoner very frequently picking pockets in our neighbourhood. I saw him take this out of the gentleman's pocket, and then ran down Field-Lane, we followed, and he was taken.</p>

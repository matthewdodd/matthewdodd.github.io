                  </hi>. I am a brewer, and live in Laurence Pountney-lane, in the parish of St. Laurence, Pountney—the prisoner Cheetham was in my service for twenty-five years, as nurse previously, and then cook—my family went out of town in April last—Cheetham had the care of my house in August—there was no one else in the house—the prisoner Bentley is Cheetham's daughter—she has been forbidden to visit her mother for years—upon my family returning to town, Cheetham left the house about two o'clock, saying she was going to the green-grocer's to get some vegetables—she did not return—she sent M'Adam at eight o'clock in the evening, to say that she had been robbing me, and was staying at that person's home, being afraid to face us—there was, among the things left in her charge, a mug, three spoons, and a table<lb></lb>cover—I have seen them since at the pawnbroker's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in Trinity-square, Southwark. I have been in the habit of calling on Cheetham, at Mr. Hepworth's, for the last six months—she. made a representation to me about the family being about to return—she appeared very much excited several times when we have gone there, and stated that she had been making away with some of her master's property, but did not state what the things were—a few days after when I went there, she told me they were plate, and other things—she ap<lb></lb>plied to me to get them out of pawn—in consequence of my prevailing on her, she dictated to me of this list of articles which were in pawn—is my writing—I took these items down from her statement—I put down nothing but what she told me—I asked her for the list of those things she had made away with—I carried the message from Mr. Hepworth—I did not hold out that it would be any better for her to do so—I told her Mr. Hep<lb></lb>worth wished me to get a list of the things she had made away with—among them there are three spoons, a table-cover, and a mug—she expressed herself very anxious to get back the things—I did recover some of them—have</p>

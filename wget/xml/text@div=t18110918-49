            . I am a looker at the warehouse, Seething lane, I made the prisoner pull off his jacket, I looked in the lining and there was one lump more besides what he had put on the table, he was very sorry he said, and he hoped we would pardon him. He gave us information where we should find more, - we went to Walworth and there we found about eighteen pounds more.</p>
               <p>- ELDRIDGE. I am an officer, I had a pound of indigo delivered to me by the last witness, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>- CHAMBERLAIN. I am an officer, I searched some premises at Walworth in consequence of what the prisoner said, I found this indigo there, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Higgs,) Whereabouts is the value of the indigo. - A. From three to ten shillings a pound.</p>

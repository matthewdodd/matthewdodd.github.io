As I was coming by the window I saw a great many bricks lying about, I looked in and saw that a range was gone, three feet and a half long. In consequence of some information, I went, with a constable of the name of Wilkes, to the prisoner's apartments, in Trotter-bone-alley, Brick-lane, up two pair of stairs; there was a young man of the name of Stokes, held his head down that I should not see his face; I suspected him, I said to him, I did not know that you lived here, I suspect my fowls are here; I looked at Howe's bedstead, he was in bed, and presently I perceived the end of my sack upon his bed, underneath him, he was lying on it, and I said, I have found you, have I; I took the sack, and told the constable I could swear to it, (produces the sack); it is marked I.S.B. and a patch at the bottom of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else? - A. I was going to search about the room, but the constable said I had no right; Howe said, he did not know how it came there, he supposed it was brought in by two young men.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I came home from my benefit club, about a quarter after ten o'clock, and the next morning I went to Islington with a pair of shoes that I had soled and heeled, and when I came back I laid down, I had been very ill; I do not know how the sack came there.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the constables of St. George's Hanover-square, I am a neighbour of the prisoner: On Saturday night the 11th of April, I was sent for by the landlord of the Compasses, to hear the old man's story; he told me he was robbed in the Park that day; he told me exactly the same words that he has told in Court now; upon hearing that, I went over to the prisoner's house, he was then sitting at the fire in the shop; I told him what I had heard, and desired him to come over to the Compasses and speak to the prosecutor; after some altercation, he came with me to the Compasses; the prosecutor was then in the tap-room; I thought the prosecutor should not see the prisoner, and I placed him where I thought he would not see him, and I told him to look round the tap-room and see if the man was there; he said he was not there; I moved then from before the prisoner, and desired him to look round again; says he, that is the man who robbed me, if there were a hundred people there; I immediately took him into custody, and had him in custody till I took him before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Gurney. The prosecutor had been over and seen him in his house before that? - A. I believe he had.</p>

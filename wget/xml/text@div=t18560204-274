I am a beer shop keeper at Stratford, in Essex—on Monday, 21st Jan., the prisoner came into my house about a quarter before 10 o'clock at night—he wanted half a pint of porter, and tendered me a penny for it—after he had had that, he called for another half pint—I was in the act of drawing it—I looked round, and he laid a shilling down—I told him it was bad—he said that it was not—I said, "I will show you"—I put it into my mouth and bit it into two pieces—I gave him into cus<lb></lb>tody, and gave the shilling to the officer—the prisoner was discharged the next morning.</p>

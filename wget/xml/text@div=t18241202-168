I was in the parlour - the prisoner called me into the kitchen, and said, he wanted to buy a gold seal and key - there was a young woman there dealing with another woman for caps - the prisoner shut the door, and told me to open my box - there were no other persons in the kitchen; he then told me to open my box; he took out several things, and asked me the price - he said he should like such a one, but did not buy any of them - she said, she wanted to exchange a pair of ear-rings, which she did; but I made no bargain with the prisoner. I left the box while I put in the ear-rings. I might be there about half an hour, and went away. I did not look in the box again that day nor the next, but I looked into it on the Monday, and missed several gold seals and keys. I went into the country, and on my return, I told the landlord of the public-house of my loss - the officer went with me to another public-house - last Monday week we saw the prisoner, and he said, he would serve me out for giving charge of him for such a thing - when the officer had taken him about two hundred yards, he told the officer to stop, and he would speak to me - he then asked if I would be satisfied if I got my property back. I said, Yes; the officer has got three seals and two keys.</p>

            . I am a constable. Between five and six o'clock on the 29th of November, I found the prisoner at the Shakespeare's Head, public-house, Percival-street; I charged him with this robbery; he said he knew nothing of it. I took him to the office, and in going along he asked me to stop as he wanted to speak to Mr. Moseley, and asked if he would be satisfied if he got his property back - he said Yes. He said the property was in Addle-street; I went there, and a young woman came to the door, she gave me two seals, and one key - the other key and seal I got from Ansley.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I asked if he would be satisfied if he got his goods; he said Yes. Then he said if I would satisfy the officer he should be satisfied; I said, "I have no money;" he said, "You have got a watch, go and pawn that:" I said I did not like to do it myself, but I sent it by another man - it was pawned for 1 l.; they kept the 1 l., and said they would be with me in the morning; they came again, and wanted another pound, which I could not raise.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHIRES re-examined. When the prisoner had given up the seals he asked if we were satisfied; the prosecutor said, "No, I am not." The prisoner pawned the watch - he kept the duplicate and the money. The prosecutor was not willing to prosecute him, and asked me what he should do - I said I had nothing to do with it.</p>

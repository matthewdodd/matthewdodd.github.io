On the 16th of January I left my house between twelve and one o'clock in the day; my wife was out - I left nobody in the house; I shut the door after me; it was fastened by a spring lock - I returned in about twenty minutes; I turned the key, let myself in, and saw the prisoner and another person, one coming out of the parlour, and the other coming up stairs from the kitchen: the prisoner was coming out of the parlour - I asked how he got there, and what his business was - he said the door was open, and he came to see a Mr. Richardson, at No. 8, Bedford-place, (which is the number of my house), who he had been recommended to, as a carpenter, for work; there was no such person living in the street - I am quite sure I fastened the door after me; there is no area gate to my house, nor any steps - the kitchen window, which looks into the area, has not fastening to it; it is a sash window - it was shut down when I went out; I went into the kitchen to see that it was shut before I left; the prisoner and the man jostled together, and tried to pass me in the passage, to get away - I kept the prisoner: I took hold of him, pushed him back several times, and detained him till Haines, a gardener, came up the street; I called for an officer, who came up, and I gave him in charge - I looked round my house, and found some clothes, which were tied up in a bundle, removed from a cradle, in which I had left them, and put on a table in the parlour; I saw them in the cradle when I left the house - the officer, Hart, took charge of the bundle; there were frocks, caps, nightgowns, shifts, shoes, stockings, handkerchiefs, and ribbons in it - I cannot say how they got into the house.</p>

            . I live at an empty-house, No. 7, Bedford-place, Kensington, opposite Mr. Haynes'. On the 16th of January I was standing at the window, and saw the prisoner go up the yard in front of the house; it is five or six yards long - the prisoner and another man went up the yard, and went up to the street door; the prisoner got over the iron rail, and got down the area - the other man stood by the door; the prisoner opened the door inside, let him in, and shut the door - I saw Mr. Haynes come home in about eight or ten minutes; the door was still shut - I saw Mr. Haynes unlock it; he went in, and shut it after him, and in about two minutes he opened the door again, and two men came out into the middle of the yard; Haynes took the prisoner by the arm, and led him back again; the other man ran away - Haynes fetched Hart, the constable; he left the gardener with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>- I am a Policeman. Hart is obliged to attend the Magistrate at Queen-square this morning, having apprehended four men last night - I know nothing of this business.</p>

             re-examined. I had put the bundle in the cradle myself just before I went out, with several other things; I had not seen the contents of it then - I had seen it about two days before; my wife had made up the bundle, in my presence, and I placed it in the cradle with other things, to put them away, as the sweeps were coming - there were frocks, shoes, socks, ribbons, caps, and nightgowns; they were my property - the bundle was exactly in the same state as when it was made up two days before - it had been in another room before I put it in the cradle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came from the country, and was out of work for seven weeks; I was in a public-house in Tottenham-court-road, drinking - a man said he could give me a job if I called at No. 8, Bedford-place, on Mon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160005"></xptr>day, and I went; a man opened the door, and told me to come in - he went down stairs, I stood in the passage - the gentleman came and asked what I did there; I said I was waiting for Mr. Richardson.</p>

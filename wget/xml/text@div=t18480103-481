On 25th or 26th Nov., about seven or eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop and produced some papers to me—this is one of them—(<hi rend="italic">read, "Giv bearr</hi> one quart <hi rend="italic">otmel.</hi> Cclapps")—in the dark of the evening I did not take that notice to see that it was not Miss Clapp's writing.</p>

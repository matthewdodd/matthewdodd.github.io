                  </hi> On Sunday night, 29th April, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in the Blue Boar, in the Minories—the prisoner and a tipsy sailor came in; he was not so tipsy as the sailor—they had some half-and-half, which the sailor paid for from a bag, which was tied to his neck handkerchief, and then called for some gin and beer—the prisoner pulled the bag from the sailor's neck, and put it into his pocket—I said, "You must give that man his money again, or else you don't go out here"—he said he had not got it—I said, You have," and put my hand into his pocket, took it out, and threw it on the counter—it was opened; there was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—a little while afterwards the prisoner called me out, saying, "I want to speak to you"—he went to a watering-place; I went there too—I saw him fumbling with his pockets; I did not like it, and walked backwards—he followed me, put his left hand on my shoulder, and cut me under the chin with a sharp instrument—he aimed at my throat, but I put up my arm—I hallooed out that my throat was cut—I bled, and ran across the road, and fell—I was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi> I am a tailor of Rosemary-lane. I was outsidethe Blue Boar door—I did not go in—I saw a tipsy sailor go in—I heard Donoghue say the prisoner had stolen the sailor's money—he would not give it up—Donoghue struck him; he said he had not got it—Donoghue put his hand into the prisoner's pocket and pulled out a little bag, and held it up beforeeverybody—presently the prisoner and prosecutor came out and went to awatering-place—I heard the prisoner say, "Where is the little bag?"—I did not hear the answer—the prisoner put his hand to his trowsers, as I supposed, to take down the fall—Donoghue said, "Come along," as I understood to go in again; as he turned to go in, the prisoner drew a knife across Donoghue's throat—I saw the knife—he crossed to the other side of the way, shut up the knife, and chucked it away—I laid hold of him, and kept him till a policeman came.</p>

                  </hi> I am a shoemaker of Vauxhall. I was in Rosemary-lane—I saw the prisoner apparently shutting up a knife—he threw it across the road; it struck fire on the pavement—I picked it up. <hi rend="smallCaps">DANIEL KEYMER</hi> I am landlord of the Blue Boar. I heard Donoghue accuse the prisoner of taking the sailor's money—a fight ensued—the prisoner got the worst of it, but said he would not give the money up—Donoghue said he should, or he would give him more of it; and if he did not he would take it out of his pocket—I advised him not, till a policeman came, but they were both in the heat of passion, and Donoghue took it out of his pocket and said, "Here it is," and laid it on the bar—shortly afterwards I heard a cry in the street that somebody was stabbed. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM HENRY HOLM AN</hi> I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital.

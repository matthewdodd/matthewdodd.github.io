                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Bread-street, Golden-square. The prisoner was in my service—I had suspicion, and put some marked money in my till at eight o'clock at night, on the 18th of July—I examined it at ten o'clock, and one shilling was missing—I sent for a constable, and searched the prisoner's box, and the shilling was found in it—it is one I marked.</p>

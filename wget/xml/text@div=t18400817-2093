                  </hi>. I am clerk to Trueman, Hanbury, and Co., brewers—the firm is Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, Bart, and other partners—Jane Rouse, who keeps the Crown public-house, is one of our customers. On the 8th of July, the prisoner came to their counting-house near two o'clock in the day, and brought this letter—it contained this cheque.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letter read.</hi>) "Mrs. Rouse's compliments to Messrs. Trueman, Han<lb></lb>bury, and Co., and will feel greatly obliged if they will cash the enclosed cheque for her in any possible way, being in immediate want of it, and not having sufficient time to send to the banker's for the same, or else she would not trouble them. Old Crown, 8th July, 1840."—The cheque was for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on Spooner, Attwood, and Co., signed "W. H. Payne."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is Rouse, your customer, married or single? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Single—that ex<lb></lb>cited some suspicion in my mind—I asked him who he brought it from—he said from the Crown public-house at the corner of Hare-street—I told him to sit down, and I went into another room and consulted with the managing clerk—after that we had him in, and asked him again where he brought it from—he said from the Crown, Brick-lane—he was asked who gave it him—he said a man in the house behind the bar—Mr. Johnson, who was present, told him he had been telling stories—he then said he would tell the truth, and said a person in the street gave it to him—I left the room—a policeman was sent for, and he was given in charge—I left Johnson and another person in the room with him.</p>

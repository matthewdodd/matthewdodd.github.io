The prisoner was in our service—on 23rd March, on taking down a dish from a shelf in the kitchen, I found behind it two purses—one contained a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note and a sovereign, and the other eighteen shillings—I told my husband, and he went for a policeman—when the prisoner came in soon after, I told her what I had found, and that I believed the money to be ours—she said she was not surprised I had found it, for she had put it there, and the money did not belong to us, but to her sister—the policeman was there at that time—I went with him to the prisoner's room, and in her box found a book, a locket, and chain—the book was wrapped in some clothes near the bottom of the box—it was mine—the locket and chain belonged to my children—the prisoner had the care of the children at times—she had borrowed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of me on 13th March—she had received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wages on 17th Feb., and she had spent all but 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was with her at the time—she bad no authority to have the book, locket, or chain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer in the parish of Tooting-Graveny. On 8th March I missed some Bank-notes and sovereigns from my cash-box—on 23rd March my wife brought me two purses, containing a Bank-note, a sovereign, and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the note was one that had been in my, cash-box—I had taken the number of it on this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was left in the box—I had received it of my mother—I gave the prisoner in custody—when a customer wanted change I used to go into the parlour for it to my cash-box, and not wishing to detain the customer used to leave the box open till I returned, perhaps ten minutes—the kitchen opens into the parlour, and the prisoner could see when my back was turned.</p>

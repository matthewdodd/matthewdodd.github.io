                  </hi>. I live at 9, Sparrow Corner, Minories, and am traveller to a provision merchant—the prisoner and I had been living together as man and wife about seven years—she has borne two children, a boy named John and a girl named Jane—the boy is about six months old—I had separated from the prisoner about six weeks before this, but I had seen her every day at her own place—I went to see her for the sake of seeing the children—on 5th June, between 5 o'clock and 5.30, I was on the Blackwall pier, about my ordinary business—I saw the prisoner there—I had the eldest child, I had taken her out for a walk, and the prisoner had the boy in her arms when I joined her—she was talking to two foreign gentlemen on the pier-head, and she turned round and saw me—the only thing she said to me was that she would drown the children or poison them—I told her if she did she would be hung for it—I let go of the girl and let it play about on the pier-head, and the prisoner ran to the child, got hold of it, and made in attempt as if she was going to jump into the water, only she bethought herself and came back again—directly after that she took hold of the child again by the arm, and she bad the other child in the other arm, and she jumped right off the pier-head into the water—there was an alarm given—there were lots of people on the pier-head, and everybody tried to save her—I saw her taken out, and the two children—she was in a very bad state after coming out of the water—she was insensible—the children seemed to be all right—they were taken to the house where she lived, which was close handy—I took the children there, and she was taken by some of the dock people—afterwards, in the house, she tried to take the boy out of a lady's arms, and put her arms round its neck, and if she had her own way she would no doubt have strangled it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not mean to strangle my child, I wanted to give it the breast, and put out my arms to take it, and they would not let me have it—I told him I should soon be dead, and he said it would be a d—good job if I was dead; and when I said I should drown myself and the children, he kept saying "Do it, do it," and dared me to do it.

                  </hi>. I am lodging at 11, Preston Street, Poplar—on this afternoon I was returning from the pier, and hearing a scream. I went back, and saw the prisoner in the water, with her two children—I did not see her throw herself in—I saw them taken out—I took the little girl home—the father asked me if I would go with him, and take the child to the house—I did so, and the prisoner was brought there afterwards, and a doctor was sent for—by his orders I put the little boy into a bath, and when I took it out to wipe it, the prisoner tried to wrench the child from me—she took hold of it round the neck, and had H by the legs—she said she would die with her children, and she said so before that, as soon as she came into the room—she appeared in a very excited state—I don't think she was sober, her breath smelt very strongly of spirits.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On 14th March, seven years ago, I left my home with the intention of marrying this name in three weeks. Since that we have lived together; he did not marry me; I had children by him, and did not like to leave him. He behaved very well to me at first. We were in great poverty, and I shared it with him. The last twelve months he has turned out a real vagabond, and since that he has been calling me all the names he could. I bore it all in silence, as I did not like to bring disgrace upon my children. He began to stay out night after night, and when I questioned him the only answer I got was "What odds is it to you, you are not my wife; I can do as I like." One night, about six weeks ago, he told me he was a married man, that his wife was alive, and had found him out. It preyed on my mind a good deal, and since then I have certainly neglected my home and myself, and felt that I was going to destruction. I said "I would sooner be dead than continue to lead such a life "He said "The sooner the better. "I bore it till I was almost distracted. On this day he came and took my girl out. I went with the boy on to the pier. There were two foreigners that knew him, and he came up and said something about the b—Irish. I got angry, and we quarrelled on the pier<lb></lb>heid.

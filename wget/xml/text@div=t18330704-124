On the 3rd of July, between one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoner in his shop - I first saw her attempt to take another handkerchief - I then watched her more than I had before; I took particular notice of her, and she took this handkerchief, she stood before it so that I could not see her take it down, but as soon as she was gone I missed it; I pursued her into Long-lane, which is about five minutes walk, and there took her with it, and brought her back - I did not know her before - this is Mr. Clamp's property, and has his mark on it.</p>

On the 10th of December I went up stairs, helped the prisoner to make the bed, and left her alone to sweep and dust the room; after she had done she brought me down the key, and sat down to dinner with the family - about four o'clock I sent her out with two half-crowns, to buy some soap, and desired her to make haste back; she said she would, but I never saw her again till the Monday, at Queen-square; in consequence of her leaving I went up stairs next morning, to examine if my money was safe - I unlocked the cupboard door, opened the box lid, found every thing turned upside down in the box, and missed all the money; I am certain it was all safe the day before, when I took a sheet out of the box; the prisoner came up directly after, but was not there when I took it out - I had let one pair of the stockings drop a few days before, and she said, "Well, mistress, there is some private blunt there - I suppose master don't know you have got it;" my husband knew I had money there, but did not know the amount. On the 7th of December she asked me to lend her 4s. to buy a duplicate of some silk handkerchiefs, but I did not lend it to her.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she left the room open several times while scouring it, during which time the lodgers had access to it - that when her mistress sent her out she met some friends, who detained her, and she was afraid to return - and that the money found on her she had saved in service.</p>

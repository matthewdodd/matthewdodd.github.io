On Friday, the 12th of November, at a quarter before four o'clock, the prisoner came and knocked at my door; I looked out at the window, and he asked for Mrs Carley - I said I was the person. He asked me if I had not a son abroad; I said Yes, I had, at St. Helena; he said, should I like to hear from him? I asked him to walk in, and he went into the back-parlour, and said, should I like to see my son? I said, undoubtedly, nothing would give me greater pleasure; my son had been absent twenty-two years. He asked if I should know my son - I said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I did think I should, indeed; I said I know I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130023"></xptr>should; he told me to consider twenty-two years made a great alteration in a man's appearance. I said it was true, but I was sure I should know him; he asked what made me so positive? I told him, from a mark I gave him before he came into the world. He then told me that the yellow fever removed the marks on the body, and asked me where the mark was? I told him in a very curious place; he then with his right hand pointed to his cheek, and said</p>
               <p>"It was here." My son had been marked there with an apple - I had not told him where the mark was. He then said</p>
               <p>"Are you positive you should know your son?" I said</p>
               <p>"Yes, quite positive; but I fear that is a happiness I shall never have more in this world." He then said,</p>
               <p>"You say you are positive you should know your son, but I see if you do know me you won't know me; I may as well go." He took his cane up to go - I then said,</p>
               <p>"you are not my son." He said</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear mother, I am your son; why will you not know me?" I then asked him if he was come to stay in England? He said he was come to consult with me respecting his discharge, which he had to buy from the East India Company's Artillery (which my son was in). I said,</p>
               <p>"What will your discharge cost you, child?" He said 22 l. and if I could let him have the money till Monday, he would repay it, as he had 583 l. to take. I told him I had not so much money as 22 l. in the house. I asked him to take some refreshment; I then believed that he was my son. I sent my lodger to get some brandy, and he had some cold beef; he then spoke of occurrences which had taken place in my family - such as my having two children christened together at St. Mary-le-bone church; which induced me to believe that he was my son. I then asked him to go up stairs - I opened a drawer, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here my dear son, is the funeral bill of your late brother;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! poor Joe, I wish I could have seen you once more before you died." I then showed him a pair of spoons I had bought with some of his late brother's clothes which I had parted with - he then said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! mother, I have promised to make these spoons a present to our captain's lady, who has been such a kind friend to me." He did not take them, because I objected to it; there was a silver pencil case in the same drawer; he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! mother, let me have that - it is just what I wanted;" I told him he might take it if he pleased, as I bought it on purpose for him: he took it. I then opened the drawer where my money was, and took out a small tin box, which had the money in it; there were seventeen sovereigns in it: I counted them, and said,</p>
               <p>"My dear, I have got but 17 l.;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Is there no more mother?" I said, No. He said,</p>
               <p>"Let me count them:" I had them in my left hand, and he took them out of it, protended to count them, and put them in his pocket. I then showed him some handkerchiefs which had belonged to my departed son, which I had saved for him, as I supposed - he said,</p>
               <p>"Give me one of those silk handkerchiefs:" I said,</p>
               <p>"Take both child if you want them:" he took one of them which was orange and blue. He then came down stairs, and then was in a great hurry to go, as he said if he did not see his captain that night, he should not be able to get his discharge for nine days; he said he would return that night to sleep, if possible, at my house. I then asked him whether he would sleep in my bed or in the parlour: he said he would sleep in the parlour, because he had come from a hot climate, but if he did not return that night by ten o'clock, he would be with me at ten the next morning, to breakfast: he then said,</p>
               <p>"Don't detain me, my dear mother, let me go, for the sooner I go, the sooner I shall be back;" he then shook hands with me at the door, and told me not to fret, he would be back as soon as possible. He had taken the seventeen sovereigns out of my hand, and said he would return them on the Monday. I never saw him again till a fortnight ago, when he was at the Police Office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This money you gave him, believing him to be your son? A. Yes, undoubtedly; I wished for it again, being my all. I told him to take the pencil case and handkerchief: I did not object to his taking the money out of the house, as I expected it would be returned when he took his money. I have never seen any of the things since.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Would you have lent the money to the prisoner if you had not believed he was your son? A. No. I expected he would return it, and he told me I should do no more work.</p>

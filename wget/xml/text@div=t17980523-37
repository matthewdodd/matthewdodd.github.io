               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, can you undertake to swear that that is the person? - A. I can; I dare say he was ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, about the window, I am perfectly satisfied in my own mind as to his person; he was not apprehended till the 27th of April; the same square of glass was broke a second time that day. I had seen him four or five days about the house prior to that, and did not know whether I should take him or not; the lace I have never found.</p>

I went into the shop, but could see no person. Next morning, I found a hole had been cut in a pane of glass, large enough to put two fingers through, and missed all the knives that were near the hole-it was large enough to hook them through with a wire - I put a box against the hole. On Monday evening I saw several boys round my shop. I went to the window, and missed more knives-the boys dispersed while I was going out.

            . I am apprentice to Mr. King. On the 3d of February, Whitcombe, one of the scholars, asked me if I wanted to buy any knives? he said he bought them the day before at Thomas's, in Oxford-street for 1s., that he wanted a pen-knife, and this was not one, which made him want to sell it - A boy named Deacon produced another, and then Whitcombe shewed me another, which was a pen-knife. I took them away, and gave them to Mr. King. In consequence of what Whitcombe said, the prisoner was taken. We asked him where he got them? he said they were his own. Mr. King is not here.</p>

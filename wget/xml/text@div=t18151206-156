            . I was employed by Mr. Westwood, the deputy solicitor of the Bank, to act under Dickens the officer, for the purpose of getting introduced to the prisoner at the bar. I was introduced to him on the 10th of October, and made an appointment to meet him the next morning at nine o'clock at the sign of the white Dog, Widegate-alley. I met him at the appointed time, and place, but he could not see the person whom he wanted to see. He should not be able to let me have any before the evening. We then went out together, to <placeName id="t18151206-156-crimeloc854">Barbican</placeName>

Then he crossed the way, and desired me to walk slowly on; and in the course of five minutes, he overtook me, and said it was all right; he told me he had got one for a sample, and he gave me a counterfeit three-shilling piece, for which I gave him one and sixpence; I marked this one, and afterwards gave it to Dickens. (The counterfeit three-shilling piece put into the hands of the witness;) that is it. We were then to meet by his appointment, at the <placeName id="t18151206-156-crimeloc855">sign of the Baker and Basket, in Cloth Fair</placeName>

When he came in, he told me all was right; he had seen the person whom he wished to see, and I could have them. He asked me then how many I wanted? and I told him fifteen shillings worth; and he told me that the person of whom he had them, would not serve him under a pounds worth. I told him I had no more money, and then he gave me ten counterfeit three-shillings pieces, which I marked and gave to Dickens, the officer, in about ten minutes after I received them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. What do you get by becoming an informer - A. Nothing that I know of.</p>

Yes; I was introduced to the prisoner by a person who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060059"></xptr>was a stranger to me, whose name in Jack; I believe Jack as they call him is in Court. I have been once here before upon a similar prosecution, and once at Clerkenwell. Jack is a stranger to me, but not to the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 11th, I saw the prisoner and Spanner in company together at the Baker and Basket, in Cloth Fair. In the morning, I gave him nine shillings, to buy six counterfeit tokens of the prisoner. He brought me seven and sixpence, and one bad token, which he marked in my presence. (Token put into the hands of the witness.) That is the token; Spanner brought me ten on the 12th. I had searched him before he went into the prisoner's company and after he came back. I had given him fifteen shillings for the purpose of purchasing, and I saw him mark them. (Tokens put into the hands of the witness,) these are they.</p>

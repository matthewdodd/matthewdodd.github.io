                  </hi>. I am landlord of the house, No. 1, Richard-street, St. Leonard's-road, Bromley; the prisoner and her husband, the deceased, lived in the upper portion of the house, they occupied two rooms; there are only four rooms in the house besides a kitchen and a small room. On the night of 24th April, I let the deceased in I think somewhere about 9 or 10 o'clock, but it is a good while ago and I almost forget the time—I think he must have had a little to drink, but I cannot say, I was not in the habit of seeing much of him—he went up stairs and then went out again, and remained out about twenty minutes—I did not let him in again, he had the key and he walked in and went up stairs—the prisoner came in about an hour after I had let him in—I was sitting in the kitchen when she came in, I only saw her come by the passage—a little after that I went to bed—about 1 o'clock the prisoner came down stairs, and asked for the key of the front door—I told her where it was, and she went out—in about three quarters of an hour she returned with a girl, unlocked the street door and went up stairs—1 heard a talking up stairs, and the girl told me that Mr. Turton was dead—I immediately told her to go for a medical man or the police—the prisoner was up stairs at this time—she was not making any noise; it appeared as if she was cutting up some wood to make a fire—I came out of my bed room, and the prisoner went out after a policeman—I met her with two policemen—I had called in one of those policemen the night before—the prisoner had come down stairs between 12 and 1 o'clock, and told me that her husband had taken arsenic, and I went and fetched the policeman and he went up stairs, I did not—after the policeman came on the night in question, he went up stairs, and then called me up—I went up and found Mr. Turton lying dead on the floor, with a pillow under his head—I had not heard any quarrelling between them, only on one night; that was nothing violent, only just a rough word—I never heard any com<lb></lb>plaints on the part of the man, but the woman was very noisy by herself, and disturbed every body in the neighbourhood—I heard her tell him a few days before, that he had been a whoring—on the night this occurred, I heard no noise at all.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 161). About 2 o'clock in the morning of 21st April, I was near the house where the prisoner lived, and saw her standing at the corner of Richard-street—I went up to her at once, and spoke to her—I knew her before—I asked her what was the matter—she did not answer—I asked her again, and she said, "My husband is dead"—I immediately went with her to the house, and went up stairs—I asked what room her husband was in, and she said, "The front room"—that is used as a sitting room—the back room is a bedroom—I found him dead—he was lying, on the floor, on his back, with a pillow under his head—I observed some marks round his throat—they were afterwards examined by the surgeon—I examined the room, to see if I could find anything; and while doing so, the prisoner said, three times, "I did not do it; I did not do it"—I examined some tumblers and bottles that were there—she said, "It is no use your looking; I have not given him anything"—he had no handkerchief round his neck—I asked her where his neckcloth was—she said she did not know—I after<lb></lb>wards found it hanging behind the door in the same room, and a shawl hung over it—it is not here—it is so long ago, that the things were given to the brother—it was very much twisted at the ends—the prisoner afterwards said that she had put it there and forgot it—I then took her to the station—the face and hands of the deceased were quite cold—I had been called to the house on the previous night by Walker, about half past 1 or 2 o'clock, and the prisoner then told me that her husband had taken arsenic—that was said in the passage below—I went up with her into the bedroom, and found her husband lying on the bed, with his clothes on, asleep—I awoke him, and told him, in the prisoner's presence, that she had said he had taken poison—he said, "I have not; I do not know what to do with my wife; she is going mad"—he appeared as if he had been drinking, but nothing more—I then told the prisoner she had better go to bed, and left the house—about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards I was passing the house, and she opened the window, and said, "Are you the devil?"—I made her no answer, and she said, "The cats are scratching the graves open"—I advised her to shut the window, and go to bed—on the Monday after I went again to the house—I saw a pail on the landing up stairs, containing some wet clothes, and at the bottom of it I found a brace—it is not here—all the things were given up, as we did not think the case would ever come to a trial—the brace had a buckle on it—I had noticed a mark under the deceased's left ear on the first occasion—it was like a wound—I compared the buckle on the brace with that mark, and it was the same size, and fitted exactly—I found a corresponding brace on the trowsers that the deceased was wearing, and only one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at Poplar. I was called in by the police to examine the deceased—he had been dead for two or three hours—there was a broad livid mark round the neck, particularly under the left ear—the skin was abraded, as if a knot had been tied—all the external appearances were consistent with death by strangulation—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, which led me to the same conclusion—I noticed a mark under the left ear—I compared that with the buckle of a brace, shown to me by the policeman, and, in my judgment, it might have caused it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">KENNEDY</hi>. I am a surgeon, at Bromley-terrace. I saw the deceased on the Saturday morning, about 2 o'clock, lying in his clothes on the floor of the sitting room—the body was warm, but the extremities were quite cold—I do not think he had been dead more than an hour, or an hour and a half—his posture did not indicate any struggle; he seemed as if he was placed there—I observed a black circle round the neck—I have heard Mr. Robert<lb></lb>son's evidence, and concur in his opinion—I saw the same symptoms exter<lb></lb>nally and internally—in my opinion, death was caused by strangulation—I saw the buckle compared with the mark on the throat—it might have been caused by that, but I could not say decidedly—one part of the circle was larger than the remainder—the knot of a handkerchief, if it came on that part, might have done it, or pressure with the hand; it is quite possible—it is impossible for me to say whether, in that case, the handkerchief would be drawn by the deceased himself, or by some other person—I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—my decided opinion was that death was caused by strangulation—there was no appearance of any other cause of death—all the other organs appeared healthy—there were some slight scratches on the face—he had the appearance of a man who had been drinking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On what part of the neck was the mark of the knot? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between the carotid artery and the trachea, just over the carotid artery; the pressure would be on the carotid artery—I cannot say that did not cause the death—that would keep the blood in the lungs, and present the external appearances I saw—there was slight congestion of the brain—if the man had laid down in a state of drunkenness with the knot of the handkerchief pressing upon the carotid artery, I do not think that would have caused all the appearances I discovered; I should expect to find the brain more congested from the stupor of drunkenness—I cannot say whether, if the man had gone to bed with a handkerchief tightly tied round his neck, and the knot of the handkerchief pressing upon the carotid artery, that would have caused death by strangulation—I should not like to go to bed in that way.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Villa Street, Walworth common, and am an omnibus conductor—on Wednesday morning, about one o'clock, I was in Bishopsgate Street—as I was walking along two men came behind me—I was knocked down by a blow at the back of my head—they unbuttoned my coat, and turned my pocket inside out, and took from my left trousers pocket 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., every farthing I had—I shouted out, and a gentleman</p>

               <p>and policeman came to my assistance—the men were still there, and I was on the ground—the prisoner is one of the men—I caught hold of him, and he dragged me along a little distance—he cut my knuckles dragging me through the mud—the policeman took him in custody on the spot.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I take hold of you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, Yes; you took my money—there was one sovereign, two shillings, and sixpence in Copper—I was sober—this happened near White Lion Street—I had not got hold of your legs when you were taken in custody—you made no resistance.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 24). On the morning of 22nd January I was on duty in Shoreditch—I heard a cry, and my attention was drawn to the other side of the road—I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor on the ground, and someone over them—as I came up to the prisoner he dropped some coin on the ground—I asked him why he had dropped it—he said he never dropped any coin—the prosecutor came up with his hands bleeding, and said, "That rascal has robbed me, and taken my money"—I caught hold of the prisoner—he was about fifteen yards from the prosecutor—there was no one in the street—it was pouring with rain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Which side of the way did this happen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the opposite side from Shoreditch Church—I did not see Mr. Wade till I had hold of you—the prosecutor never said anything about what money he lost till he got to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 64, Albert Road, Dalston, and am a Parlia<lb></lb>mentary agent—on 22nd January I was in Shoreditch about one o'clock—I saw Clark knocked down—I saw the prisoner, the prosecutor, and another man all together—he called out, and the prisoner and the other man ran away—I caught hold of the prisoner, and gave him to the constable—there were no other persons about the place—the prisoner dropped several coins, but I could only find 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am quite sure the prisoner was one of the men—I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What part of Shoreditch were you in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the narrow part—I did not cross the road with the constable; he came up afterwards—I was going to take you at the same time—I said to the constable at the station, "If I had known they were robbing the man, I could have caught both of them."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. The prosecutor was so drunk that he did not know what he was about. The inspector would not book the charge, until he saw Mr. Wade and asked if he would be a witness. When I was brought up not one of them appeared, and I was remanded for a week. The prose<lb></lb>cutor said he was in Bishopsgate Street, it was nearly a quarter of a mile from there. He says that I was taken by the assistance of Wade and the policeman, he does not say I had hold of his legs. I was thirty-five yards ahead of him when I was taken. I believe he was intoxicated, and did not know he had locked me up the next day. I have had five weeks' imprison<lb></lb>ment now, and know nothing about' it. I was not in company with anyone, so cannot call any witnesses. The prosecutor said there was nobody else there, there were about thirty persons there when I was taken to the station. He said he had hold of me when I was taken in custody, but the gentleman states I was fifteen yards away.</p>

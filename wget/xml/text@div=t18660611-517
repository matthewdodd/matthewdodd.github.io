Smith and Lister's, of Cannon-street; I buy all my goods of him"—he then showed us what he had got, and Mr. Smith identified them, and we brought them away—the goods were in different parts; some were upstairs, and a good many were exposed in the window; the others were in square boxes—there was no concealment or hesitation—I did not see anything that would justify me in taking him into custody—he asked his wife to produce the invoices—she went up stairs and got them—he said that Norton had represented to him that he was the agent of a Luton house, and that they were job lots, some of which had been reblocked.</p>

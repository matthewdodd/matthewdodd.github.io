                  </hi>. I am a coal-seller, of 6, Winstanley Road, Battterses—I was ill and had to go to St. Thomas's Hospital on 19th January with my wife and child through typhoid fever—I was lodging at 133, Grant Road, Battersea—the prisoner lodged in the same house and worked in the same yard that I did—my lodgings were left in charge of Mrs. Sich, the landlady—we had a second floor room and paid a weekly rent—this clock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was at my lodgings when I went to the hospital, and this antimacassar was left in the prisoner's charge until we came out of the hospital, the first Thursday in April—I then when to where the prisoner was then lodging, 38, Grove Road, Battersea, and took a parcel of clothes that my wife took with her to the hospital—he had brought the boxes from where I was lodging to his own lodgings—I had given him no authority to do so—I left them there till I returned from the Convalescent Home, Bognor, which was the first Thursday in May, and removed the boxes from his lodgings about a week after, when he told me he had pawned the clock; and the day after he was charged I saw my antimacassat at his lodgings—I also missed a waterproof cloak which I brought from the hospital and left in his care and a scarlet and black wool shawl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I asked you to take my child and look after it—the steward of the hospital wrote to you about it—I cannot remember authorising you to remove my things from Grant Road, so that I should have no rent to pay there—I believe you lost your own child at that time—you wrote to me when you lost your child, and told me you were obliged to take my child back to the hospital as you had not the power of keeping it—when I returned from the Convalescent Home I brought the child to your wife on the Saturday morning and asked her to take charge of it while I went to the hospital to fetch some clothes and I took it to you on the previous Sunday morning—you told me you had pledged the clock, but you did not say what for—that was after I had asked for it.</p>

When the prisoner told me the clock had been pawned I did not say anything to him, because I had very little time—I said I could not help it, and I had no time to do nothing with it—I had to be in the hospital at 3 o'clock, and then it was 2—I did not tell him to get it out of pawn.</p>

I am a pensioner in the 9th Lancers, and live at 9, Caro<lb></lb>line-place, Chelsea—on Friday, 12th January, about half-past 11, I went into a public-house at the corner of White Lion-street, Chelsea, where I met the two prisoners—they asked me and another one to give them something to drink, and I did so, and afterwards went out of the public-house—they followed me, and when I had got, I should say about thirty yards from the</p>

I am landlord of the Rose and Crown, at the corner of While Lion-street, Chelsea—on the night of 12th December the prosecutor came there with three others, of whom the prisoners are two; I am sure of that—they all appeared the worse for liquor—in consequence of that I sup<lb></lb>plied only a quartern of gin, which the prosecutor left untouched—he put his hand in his pocket and put down some coppers, and a half-crown amongst them—I picked up the half-crown, handed it to him, told him to be more careful, and paid myself from the coppers—the men had evidently all been drinking—they were not shamming drunkenness as soon as the prosecutor paid for it, he said, "Now, I am off"—he turned round, and they followed him.</p>

             and son. On the 14th of February, I was going up the yard, I saw one of the warehouse doors half open, I thought some one was in there; I went and saw the prisoner in the warehouse; I saw sugar in his hands; he appeared to be very much confused at the sight of me; I asked him what he wanted there; he wanted to see George; I told him George was gone; I came out of the warehouse, he followed me, and as he came down the yard he past me, I thought his pockets looked full of something; I followed him into White cross street; I saw sugar drop out of his right hand pocket as he was walking along the street; I was sure it was my master's property: I laid hold of him, he begged me to forgive him, he had never been a thief before; I took him back and sent a man into Wood street to inform my master of it. The officer came and took the sugar out of his pocket which weighed five pounds; some was raw sugar and some was lump.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the yard, the door was open, I thought I might take some sugar, it would sweeten my wife's and childrens tea, that was all; I never did such a thing in my life before.</p>

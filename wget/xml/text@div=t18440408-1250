                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">linen-draper, Upper Whitecross-street.</hi> On Saturday afternoon, the 9th of March, the prisoner came into my shop and asked for black kid gloves, white kid gloves, and gauntlet gloves—I showed her some black kid gloves at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pair—she asked for some better, and as I walked to the top of the shop I looked round very short, and saw her take a pair of kid gloves out of the paper which was opened, and put them down into her lap—I returned and opened the other kid gloves—she then asked for various others—I said, "I have no others"—she said, "You have nothing good enough or large enough"—she then went away without purchasing any thing—I followed her—she turned to the right out of my shop, and then to the left down Old-street—mine is the last house in the street, except Mr. Ham<lb></lb>mond's—I returned into the shop and rang the shop bell—my wife came down—I then went to the kid gloves and counted them over, which I had done previously—I found one pair missing—there had been nine pair, and there were only eight—I followed the prisoner—as I crossed the road I met her—she said, "I presume you are the gentleman whose shop I was in"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "I have left my umbrella"—I said, "I have not</p>

               <p>noticed it, walk back"—the took the umbrella and left—a young man two shops off said something to me—I then followed the prisoner—I saw a policeman coming—I overtook her near Mr. Sinclair's in Old-street, and said "I want you"—she said "What for?"—I said "For stealing a pair of gloves"—she said "I have no gloves of yours"—I said "No, you have thrown them away"—I took her back—the policeman was with me—she was very desirous of having some conversation with me—I said I would not—I saw her fumbling about her arm, and said, "What have you got there?"—she said, "Nothing of yours"—it was a little basket with a pair of black kid gloves in it, which I thought were mine, but they were not—she said she was very respectable, and should not be guilty of any thing of the kind—I ulti<lb></lb>mately gave her into custody—a man named Parks was brought into my shop while the prisoner was there—he produced a pair of black kid gloves—they were mine—he said in the prisoner's presence that he saw her distinctly throw them away in the area close by my door—I swear that no other person was in the shop while I was showing her the gloves—these are my gloves, and those I missed that day—a neighbour named Brown was there when the pri<lb></lb>soner was there, and said something to me.</p>

               <p>his expenses would be paid—the officer did not ask if I was going to give her in charge—I did not say "Decidedly not; I did not see her take them"—the carter said something about throwing the gloves down the grating or area—the officer did not whisper any thing to me at that time—there is an open<lb></lb>ing under the window at Mr. Hammond's shop, and an iron grating drops down inside; and as you enter my shop door this little opening is just at the left, hardly a yard off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carter to Mr. Maskin, of Maidstone—I was going up White Cross-street on the afternoon of the 9th of March, and saw the prisoner near the corner of White Cross-street—she stooped and hurled a pair of black gloves away—she was going towards Mr. Clark's shop—he was walking in front of her—I got out of my cart and picked up the gloves at the side of Mr. Hammond's, the ironmonger's, window just by the grating—his shop is the corner, and Mr. Clark's is the next door—some one came after me, and brought me back to Mr. Clark's shop—I gave the gloves to him.</p>

I am in the employ of Mr. Britton, of Upper White Cross-street—there is only one shop between ours and Mr. Clark's—in the afternoon of the 9th of March I saw Parks go past, and my attention was drawn to him—he got out of his cart and picked up the gloves at the other side of Mr. Clark's door, towards Old-street, just by the grating of Mr. Hammond's shop—I have measured the distance from Mr. Hammond's grating to the pork-shop, and it is 10 yards—I told Mr. Clark what I had seen—I attended at the police-office, and was not called.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspector of the G division of police, and am now frequently employed by the Mint—on 15th December, about 8 in the morning, I went to 27, Union—street, Lambeth—walk, with two or three inspectors and four or five sergeants—the house door was shut—we forced it open, and saw the male prisoner come from the back yard in his shirt—sleeves—Sergeant Leather took him in custody, and he was taken into the back room, where the female prisoners were—(there are two rooms on the ground floor)—I asked him what part of the house he occupied—he said, "These two rooms," meaning the front and back parlours—we then com menced searching—I saw a parcel on a ledge in a little coal cupboard in the ground floor passage under the stairs—I called one of the officers to take it out—Sergeant Elliott handed it to me—it was this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), wrapped up in this rag—I opened it—it contained two doable plaister of Paris moulds, each for malting shillings—I showed them to the prisoners—they said nothing—another packet was handed to me—I did not see it found—it contained twenty counterfeit sovereigns and a blank counter—Inspector Brannan also handed me six counterfeit sixpences—I requested Inspector Young to bring the male prisoner into the front parlour, so that he should be present at the search—he did so, and Sergeant Elliott searched a china ornament on the mantelshelf, and found a little paper packet containing four counterfeit half—sovereigns, separately wrapped up in paper—I then asked Inspector Young whether he had searched the male prisoner, and the male prisoner pat his hand in his pocket and took out a sovereign, a florin, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a penny, all good—I looked at the florin, and said, "That florin has been in plaster"—he made no reply, but, when the half—sovereigns were produced, be said, "It has nothing to do with me"—in the packet produced by Ser geant Brannan was a florin and four shillings in good money, all of which have been in plaister—that was the parcel where the twenty sovereigns were—the prisoners were taken to the station in cabs, where the male prisoner said to Matilda Love, the prisoner with the child, "Do not you know any thing about it," to which she replied, "All right"——while watching the plate I frequently saw the prisoner Francis go in and out—the prisoners have been under occasional observation for years, but on the last occasion two months—we searched other parts of the house, and found a small portion of plaister of Paris in a bag, and a piece of glass in a cupboard in the back room with plaister of Paris on it—it is necessary in making moulds to have a smooth flat surface, and they generally have glass or a smooth marble slab—there were other persons lodging in the house—I searched it, but found nothing up stairs—the cupboard under the stairs was not locked.</p>

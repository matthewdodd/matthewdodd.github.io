                  </hi>I am a labourer. I have been committed by the Magistrate, and come from gaol to give evidence-el know the prisoners—Morgan is a baker, and I believe Smith is a biscuit baker—in November last I was in the habit of seeing the prisoners at the Hampshire Hog pub<lb></lb>lic-house, in Rosemary-lane, which is about half a mile from the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's premises—I was there on Friday morning, the 22nd of November, and saw both the prisoners there—Morgan asked me if I would go and ask Mr. Smith, a potato-merchant and corn-chandler in the neighbourhood, if he would buy two sacks of middling—I agreed to do so, and went—the prisoners went there with me—they went on down North-street, and I went into Mr. Smith's by myself—I came out, and told them Mr. Smith wanted to see a sample—Morgan said he would give me a sample, and he went home and got one—Smith stopped with me till he came back—I took the sample into Mr. Smith's shop, leaving the prisoners—I bargained with Mr. Smith for it for 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a sack, if it was like the sample—next night (Saturday) I saw them again at the Hampshire Hog public-house, about six o'clock—I think Morgan told me he was going to get two sacks of middlings, and if I would go with him and push behind the truck, he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Smith was present, and heard what was said—I agreed to do it—we were standing outside the Hampshire Hog public-house door at the time—Smith left us, and Morgan and I went to get a truck at Mr. Hurst's, in Cannon-street-road, or New-road—I stopped across the road, while Morgan went into Hurst's for the truck—he brought it, and I wheeled it a little way down into the highway, and Morgan took it the rest of the way, down to Mr. Hullah's place, at Wapping—Morgan said the men bad not done work, and we had to wait at a public-house for the best part of an hour, leaving the truck outside the public-house door—it was Mr. Hall's public-house, I believe, not exactly opposite the prosecutor's pre<lb></lb>mises, but not far from them, in the same road—while I was in the public<lb></lb>house Morgan went out, and said he was going out to see if the men had done work, that he might get the sacks—he went out two or three times—the last time he cane back, and said, "It is all right, we can get them now, come along"—he wheeled the truck over, and I followed him—the gates were shut—they were opened by Smith, I believe, from the inside.</p>

               <p>as I saw him come out after the two sacks were brought out, and shut the door—when the gates were open Morgan went in—I did not see Smith before Morgan went in—the door opened, and Morgan immediately went in—he was not five minutes getting the two sacks—he carried one out at a time—when he brought out the first sack I held the truck while he put it in—he then went back, and brought another, which we put into the truck, and then Smith came out and shut the door—he did not come out till both the sacks were put into the truck—they were taken to Mr. Smith's, in Back Church-lane—Morgan held the handle of the truck, and I helped to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi>it—Smith ran on first, and I saw no more of him till ten o'clock that night—when we got to Mr. Smith the baker's, we did not find him at home—his sister was managing his business—Morgan and I both went into the shop—I went in first—we told Mr. Smith's sister we had brought two sacks of middlings—she said she knew nothing about them, and could not have them left there, because her brother had not said any thing about them—we took them away to Morgan's house in Thomas<lb></lb>street, Commercial-road, which was about a quarter of a mile off—they were put into a cupboard there—they were not taken away from there till Monday morning—I went to Mr. Smith's again about ten o'clock—Morgan and Smith accompanied me, but they did not go in—I found Mr. Smith at home—something passed between me and him—I afterwards saw the two prisoners, and told them that Mr. Smith said it was too late to have them in that night, but to bring them as soon as I liked on Monday morn<lb></lb>ing, and he would have them—it was arranged that I should take them on the Monday—when 1 first saw Mr. Smith on the Friday, he said he should like a sample of them, so that he could go and see if he could find a shop to put them away at—I told Morgan and Smith that—he also asked if I knew where they came from, and told me I need not be afraid of his saying any<lb></lb>thing—on Monday morning, before I was up, Morgan came to my father's house, and I went with him up to Mr. Smith's—he was at home—Morgan went in with me that morning, and Mr. Smith said he would rather have nothing to do with them, that he had been offered a good price, but not so much as we said they were worth—I said they came from down Wrapping—Morgan was present—on the same morning I went with Morgan to try to sell them—he went home, got a sample, and took it to a person in a street opposite the George, Commercial-road—he is a bread baker—Morgan went into the shop first with the sample—I stopped outside, a long way from the shop—Morgan came to me again, and said the man had offered him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the two sacks, and he would go back and tell him he should have them for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he went back, and told me he was to have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—Morgan then went and borrowed a truck at the first turning in the Commercial-road, past the turnpike—I went with him to the turnpike, and waited there while he went—he did not say where he was going to get it—I saw him go down the first turning past the Commercial-road turnpike—he returned with the truck in about five minutes—we then went to Morgan's house and got the two sacks of flour—he carried one out, and I the other—I put them into the truck, and we took them to Davis—I went with him—the truck was backed up close to the door, and the sacks shot up on the pavement, and Mor<lb></lb>gan and the master of the shop pulled them in—Davis gave two sovereigns a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paper of coppers, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Morgan—I believe one of the sacks had a back ring on it, but I did not notice it parti<lb></lb>

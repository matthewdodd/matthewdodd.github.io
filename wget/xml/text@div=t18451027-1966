                  </hi>. I live in Spital-street, Spitalfields. On the morning of the 24th of Sept., I was taking a walk round Pocock's-gardens, Bethnal-green, and saw the prisoner beating his wife—I stopped and looked over the fence at them—after that he came out to me, and asked if I knew his wife—I said, "No, I neither know you nor your wife;" upon that he struck me a blow—I struck him again, and we had a struggle together—I at last threw him, and fell on the top of him—he caught hold of my throat, and said, "You b——r, I will choke you"—some man pulled me off him—he felt in his pockets, apparently for a knife—he asked a pot-boy, who stood by, for a knife—the pot-boy said. "It is time for me to cut," and ran away—the prisoner then ran into his garden, and into his cottage at the back of the garden, and came out with a knife, came up to me and said, "Where is the thief?"—he jumped up at me with the knife, and struck me—we had a struggle together—he struck me in the breast with his fist, and cut me on the head—I bled for an hour and a half—one or two people laid bold of him—I told them to hold him while I went for a policeman—the knife was not in the bent condition it is now before he stabbed me—Young got behind the prisoner, who threw the knife out of his hand, and Young picked it up—I got to the station, and they sent for a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Worship-street. On the 24th of Sept. I saw the prosecutor walking in Pocock's-gardens—I saw the prisoner run out of his house after his wife—they were quarrelling—the prosecutor was standing looking at them—the prisoner told him to go on—he did not go on—I did not hear what else passed, but the prisoner immediately struck him—there was a struggle, and they threw one another down twice—the prosecutor got up, and was thrown again—the prisoner</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On the 24th of Sept. I saw the prosecutor at the police-station—he had a contused wound on the left side of his head, about an inch in breadth—it was not serious in its nature, but in the effect; it might have produced erysipelas—the wound might have been inflicted by the knife in question.</p>

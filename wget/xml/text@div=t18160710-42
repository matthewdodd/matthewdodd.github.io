               <p>JOHN WEST. On the 11th of June last, about half past ten in the morning, I went from my room on the basement to the water-closit in the front area. After being there a few minutes, I heard a person come down the area steps, and I supposed it to be some trade's person. In a minute or two, I returned to my room, and found the door unlocked; I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100023"></xptr>left it locked, with the key in it. When I opened the door, insted of its going back as usual, it recoiled upon my arm with some force, which naturally caused me to look behind the door, and there was the prisoner; I looked at him for a moment; I did not know him before. I said to him, what do you want; he said nothing. I said, what do you do here then; says he, I want to speak to Mr. Webbe. I did not know a Mr. Webbe, and I said, there is no such person lives here; and that is not your business; to which he made no reply. He had got the two corners of his apron held up. I said what have you got in your apron; he said, nothing. I said it is a lie, you have got some of my plate. I then called another person. I took the prisoner into the middle of the room, and told him to put down what he had got in his apron; he did, and it was the plate in question. I sent for an officer, and gave him into custody.</p>

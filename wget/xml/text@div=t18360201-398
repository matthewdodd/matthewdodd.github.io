About ten minutes be<lb></lb>fore seven o'clock, on the evening of the 15th of January, I locked my room, door, and went up to my landlord, and almost immediately heard my door open, and I came down with a light in my hand—my room is below—I heard the door move and went down with the light—I had locked it—I put the key into the lock but it would not open it—my landlord came down and tried it—his name is Thomas Ulyate—he pushed the door but could not move it, and at last put his shoulder to it, and found the door give a little—John Hughes came, and they thrust the door open; there was somebody in the room—we got a light but it was put out several times—I could clearly distinguish two persons in the room—they were secured and kept in the room till the policeman came, which was very soon—I grasped hold of one of them before the policeman came,—that was Baldwin, he tried to make his escape—they were both secured—when the police<lb></lb>man came, and I could get into the room, I found they had taken a silk</p>

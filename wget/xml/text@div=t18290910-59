            . I am in service. I lost my lace collar and four yards and a half of sarsnet ribbon from the back kitchen, at No. 20, <placeName id="t18290910-59-crimeloc340">Park-street, Camden-town</placeName>

            . I went with the prosecutrix, who said she had been robbed - what she has stated is correct; the staple was out of the door-post - the prisoner denied that she had broken the door open, and said it must be the landlord's son who had done it - her mistress gave her a good character, and said she supposed it arose from jealousy.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the door of the privy shut. - A. It was fastened up by a gimblet, it would turn the same as a button would, there was some hay there for the sheep to feed upon. I saw the prisoner near ten o'clock at home in his own pair of stairs room, I had taken the sheep away and returned and waited for his coming home. I knocked at the door, he said he would be d - d if he opened the door, I told him it was of no use, I would come in, after that he opened the window, he said what do you want, I said Mr. Bloxham I want you, he said he would be d - d before he would be handled about by any such d - d rascals as me, he said he would come forward the next morning and he would punish me severely for stealing his sheep, I told him I did not mind that, if he did not come down I would break the door open, I sent a young man to fetch a hatchet to chop the door open, he heard me, he came down and I took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Wednesday morning last Mr. Smith, a brick maker came into my house, he works just opposite, he said</p>
               <p>"Bloxham, there is a sheep run up the brick field," I said I would go after it, I might know the mark, I brought the sheep out, I asked Mr. Clark to open his gate, I said, this sheep belongs to some butcher, it is marked with a B. Mr. Clark immediately opened his door, I put the sheep into his place, and borrowed a bit of string of him, and took the sheep down to my house. I said to Mr. Clark, you know I have got the sheep, if any body makes enquiry send them to my house. I went to four butchers at Somerstown and left the mark there. I came home about a quarter before eight o'clock at night, my wife came and said they had hauled my sheep away.</p>

            . I am a cow-keeper. On Wednesday morning last the prisoner asked me if I would let him drive the sheep into my yard on purpose to catch it, he said he believed it to be a lost sheep and he wished to find an owner for it, he said he thought it belonged to Mr. Bunnel, because it had the mark of B upon it, he caught the sheep and led it away with a string through the public road to his home.</p>

On the 25th of April, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner there - he said he expected a friend, and would not take any thing till he came - he waited there alone, and went out hastily in about five minutes, without taking any thing. I immediately went into the parlour, and saw two of the pins broken off; I ran out, and took him about fifteen yards off; he gave up two pins, and the officer found two more in his pocket, with some bagatelle balls, which were not mine - he said he was in distress, but 1s. 2d. was found on him.</p>

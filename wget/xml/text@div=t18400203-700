                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Thomas Mason, a bookseller, in Museum-street, Bloomsbury—he has books outside the window. On the 4th of February, about half-past four o'clock, I saw the prisoner who was at the window, take a book up in his handkerchief, and walk off—I walked after him—he turned round, saw me, and began to run—I followed him from street to street, and lost sight of him for about three minutes, while he turned the corner, at last I overtook him, and the policeman secured him—he threw the book down, and I picked it up—I am certain he is the man.</p>

I was coming down Museum-street, and saw the book on the pavement—I took it up, and went along—there are four or five houses before you come to Charlotte-street—I turned down that street—this girl came after me, and said, "Stop"—I turned round, and thought she wished to claim the book, having sees me pick it up—I thought it might not be hers, and I walked on towards Russell-street, hearing a cry of "Stop thief!" I turned up Charlotte-street, and seeing her, I thought it might belong to her, and presented it to her, but she would not take it, and I threw it down—a lot of people gathered—I ran down to the right, and the policeman took me.</p>

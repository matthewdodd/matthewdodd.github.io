                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Todd, a cheesemonger, in High-street, Islington. About two o'clock, on the 23rd of Feb., the prisoner Bailey came into my master's shop for a pork chop—it came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. she gave me a sixpence—I put it in the till, and before I had scarcely shut the till some inquiry was made—I had not left the till—I opened it again immediately, and I found the sixpence which Bailey had given me—there was no other sixpence there—I found it was bad—I kept it in my possession till I gave it to Randall the officer—I followed Bailey out of the shop, and saw her crossing the road—I told her it was a bad sixpence that she gave me—she denied it—she made a deal of scrupling about my putting the sixpence in the till, and then she offered me a shilling, and wished for the sixpence back, but I refused to do so—I kept it in my possession—Randall the police<lb></lb>man came in with the prisoner Saunders, who made great resistance, and Randall called for assistance—I tried to give assistance—I went round the counter, but before I could get to Saunders he put into his mouth something which he swallowed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Saunders. Q.</hi> When the officer brought me into your shop what did I do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You were very violent—I stood behind the counter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Saunders.</hi> The officer said to two men in the shop, "Aid and assist in the Queen's name," and I said there was no necessity for that, I would show what I had; I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out a shilling and said, "That is all I have; is not that a good one?" I said, "Mark it;" the police<lb></lb>man put it in his pocket; he had hold of my two hands; I could not put anything into my mouth. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He gave the policeman a shilling, and said what he has stated, but he put something into his mouth.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Bailey.</hi> I came into your shop, and was going to have a piece of bacon off the same piece that a lady had some; she gave you two shillings and a six<lb></lb>pence; I changed my mind, and had a bit of pork, and you took my sixpence, and the lady's sixpence, and a fourpenny-piece, and put them into the till on the right side of the shop; I came out and crossed to go to the next public-house to have the pork chop cooked, you came and said, "Are you aware what you gave me?" I said, "Yes, a sixpence;" you said it was a bad one; I said, "Why did you not say so before I left?" I came back, and you opened the till and gave me a bent sixpence out in change for the shilling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I gave her a good sixpence in change for the shilling, she wanted the other sixpence back, but I would not give it back.</p>

            . I am a law-writer. I was walking by the shop of Mote and Appleford, and saw Ward walking away with these trousers - the two prisoners were together; Ward first put them under his coat, and then handed them to Wheeler - they were both near the door when Ward took them; they were hanging rather inside the door, and fastened by a string - I did not see them cut down; I told Mr. Pyatt of it, and the prisoners were stopped in Exmouth-street - Wheeler threw the trousers and a pair of scissars away from him; Ward was taken in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - there was no cry of Stop thief! they ran when the officer was in pursuit.</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I was coming from Covent-garden, where I had been to buy some walnuts - he cannot say he saw me at the door. Witness. Yes; I saw him go, and ask the price of a handkerchief - I swear Ward gave you the trousers as you turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Ward. He never saw me near the place. Witness. Yes - I am sure he is the person I saw walk away from the shop with the trousers.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday, the 8th of September, a person told me he believed Wheeler had taken a pair of trousers; I crossed, and got within a few yards of him - he had them under his arm; he ran, and threw them down with a pair of scissars - I took him; he said he had picked them up - I asked why he ran; he said he was startled at the time - I took him towards the station, and my brother officer was called to take Ward.</p>

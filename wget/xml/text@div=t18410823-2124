                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living in High-street, Hampstead—the prisoner was in my service twelve years. On Sunday, the 8th of August, I missed a silver mug, which I had seen on the Friday—on Monday my wife told me two spoons were missing—I inquired of William Tibbs, my servant, who had the care of my plate—I asked the prisoner that day what had become of my silver mug—she said she knew nothing at all about it; it was very strange where it could be; that she had looked for it, and would look again—she looked in several places—I then went to the sta<lb></lb>tion, and in the evening, when we found the two spoons were missing, the officer came down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's servant—I have the care of the plate. On Saturday night I missed a silver mug—I told Mr. Ford—I mentioned it to the prisoner more than once on Sunday morning—she said she did not know where it was, she would look for it—I saw her look for it—she said she had not seen it, and did not know where it was—on the Monday evening I misssed two silver spoons and a glass-cloth—I asked her about it—she said she did not know where it was—I was present when the policeman found these these things in the drawer—the prisoner had the key in her pocket—she said, "<hi rend="italic">La!</hi> me! I must have put them there for safety."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant S</hi> 3.) I was called into Mr. Ford's house on Monday, the 9th of August—when I got there the prisoner was called up into the drawing-room, and asked by Mr. Ford if she had seen any thing of the mug and two spoons—he put the question several times—she said she had not—I asked if she had any objection to have her boxes searched—she said, "Oh, no;" but it should be for the last time, if it was—I searched her box, and found nothing—Mrs. Ford was present at that time—she said, "Henessey, you have a chest of drawers down in the kitchen"—the prisoner said, "I will go down and call Tibbs to search his bed-room"—I said, "No, we will all go down together"—the prisoner gave me the key of the drawer—we both pulled open the middle drawer together—she assisted to search the drawer, and she shuffled the things about—in doing so, she shuffled this cloth to the back of the drawer—I said, "What is this?" and found these things in it—the prisoner said, "Dear me, I must have put them there for safety."</p>

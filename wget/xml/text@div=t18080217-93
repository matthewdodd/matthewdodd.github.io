               <p>- GORE. I am clerk to Mr. Clark; on Friday the 15th of January, I sent this man with five barrels of beer to Saffron hill workhouse; here is the gauge bill that I sent with the beer; I gave it to him to deliver with the beer, and here is the book that the prisoner signed at the workhouse, of the delivery.</p>

Yes, we had five barrels on the dray to go to Saffron hill workhouse; we delivered four; the cellarman at the workhouse asked the prisoner if they were all down in the cellar, he made answer yes, there were all; I made answer there was one more to go down; the prisoner said that was to go home again he took it home and struck it along with the empty casks.</p>
               <p>JAMES BRADSHAW. I am in the poor house Saffron hill; I am blind. I asked Butler if all the beer was down in the cellar; Butler said yes, Evans said there was one more to come down. I came up stairs and told the maid to give them the book; he delivered the gauge bill, to whom I cannot say.</p>

            . I gave butler the beer book, he put down five barrels of beer in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Bradshaw or Pedder what he delivered. - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARK. When the man returned home, and they were taking the casks off the dray, the man that was taking account of the casks, discovered, that there was one with a great deal of beer in it; I was called, in consequence of that I examined the cask; I found it contained beer exactly of the same quality as that which had been carried out; I asked the prisoner which way he came in possession of it, and for what purpose; he said the people at the workhouse had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170054"></xptr>given it him; from the quality of the beer I knew that must be an untruth; I took him and Evans to the workhouse to see what quantity of beer they had delivered; when we got to the house we went into the cellar and there we found only four; while I was conversing with the men the prisoner slipped up stairs and ran away; I had some difficulty in securing him. I am very sorry to say that draymen make up beer in this way to the injury of the brewer; it was done with intention of converting it to his own use, he would take it out in parts and mix it; his intention was to rob my customers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If I had any intention to rob my master I would not have taken the beer to my master's, but in the hurry of business I was mistaken; I took it home. It is the first time I ever was before a justice in my life. I hope you will restore me to my family.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

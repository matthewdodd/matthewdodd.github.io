                  </hi>. I reside at 42, Medway Street, Westminster, and am the wife of the deceased and the mother of the prisoner by a former husband—my son lived with me—he came home on the evening of 7th May—my husband asked me if the boy had left any money towards some clothes—I said he had not—he said "Then he shall not leave the room until he does, "and he struck the boy in the face with his fist, and dis<lb></lb>coloured</p>

               <p>his eye very much—there was a salt cellar on the drawers, close to his hand, as he went to go out—I did not see him take it up, but we found it under the table about two hours afterwards, when we came back from the hospital—my husband did not fall, he leaned his head forward, and I saw blood—he was an out patient at the Westminster Hospital for a week—he then went in as an in-patient, and died the following morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Besides the blow your husband struck were there not some words of provocation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he called the boy a great many foul names, and used very bad expressions before the blow was struck—I went to push the boy out of the room—if he had not happened to turn his head back at the moment he would not hare received it—he had been in a very weak state of health for some time—my son is a very well conducted boy—I could not say that my husband was under the influence of liquor—being Saturday he might have taken a drop, but he was not tipsy—he was a very violent, passionate man, and made use of very bad words.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on 16th May—on the way to the station he said that he flung the salt cellar at his father, but he did not intend to hurt him, he was very sorry for what he had done; he knew the law, and he knew he was bound to go before a Magistrate for it—I produce the salt cellar which the wife handed to me on the Monday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the surgeons at Westminster Hospital—the deceased was admitted as an out-patient on 7th May last—he had a wound on the forehead, partly lacerated and partly incised—he was attended daily as an out-patient for a week—on the 14th I admitted him as an in-patient, and he died the following day—the cause of death was the formation of pus pressing on the brain—he became paralysed on the right side after coming into the hospital—the wound might have been caused by this salt cellar—the pus which pressed on the brain arose from that wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose the wound, externally, did not seem dangerous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did not appear serious—it was not thought seriously of, or we should have admitted him at first—he was in a very weak state of health generally—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and opened the body—I believe the blow to have been the cause of death—there was not sufficient disease of any of the internal organs to cause death so soon.</p>

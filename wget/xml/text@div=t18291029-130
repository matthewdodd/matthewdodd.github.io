            . I am ten years old (the witness being questioned appeared perfectly aware of the obligation of an oath) - I live with my parents. I was in Oxford-street on Tuesday night last with my little brother; I was playing the flute to get a few pence for my father and brother - my father is a musician; while I was playing the prisoner came and asked me to come down as far as the <placeName id="t18291029-130-crimeloc722">Haymarket</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had you received any thing previous to this shilling? A. Yes, people had given me pence in the street; I had received something from the same house before.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went did I not tell you if you would go with me you should have 6d, to remunerate you for playing, and if that would not satisfy you, you should have half of whatever was got? A. No, he made no bargain with me that he was to have any part of what the gentleman might give.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the Magistrate I was to have half of what was given at the house you were going to? A. You are a story teller; here is the coin he gave me.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was at the end of New-street, Spring-gardens, behind Messrs. Drummond's banking-house, and perceived the prisoner going up New-street with two children; I suspected something, and walked back wards and forwards - I did not see the children playing; in about five minutes I heard a cry of Stop thief! saw the prisoner running away, and this boy after him; I stopped him at the corner of the mews at the end of New-street - he said, "Officer, don't say any thing, I will give you something to drink to let me go;" I refused, and took him to the watch-house - the cry of stop thief! proceeded from the witness; I knew the children, having watched them - I found a letter on the prisoner, also a shilling, and other things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The shilling was given to me in the morning, and was wrapped in a pawnbroker's duplicate enclosed in a letter in my pocket - I had not time to do that if I had taken it from the boy; a sixpence was thrown out, and the boy took it up - another parcel was thrown out to me; the brother went to pick it up, and I prevented him - whatever was thrown out of the window was in a paper; it contained the pocket piece, or whatever it was: but the first that was thrown out was silver - his brother picked that up, and put it into his waistcoat pocket; the next was thrown towards me - his brother cried, and I gave it to him whatever it was; the shilling found on me was given me by my sister-in-law - I had not had a shilling for six weeks before; I have had the run of the whole house I lodge in, and could rob the people in the very house this sixpence was thrown from, for I slept there three nights, and the servant knew me; I lived fourteen years with Lord Northwick; he sent me two sovereigns, and recommended me to Mr. Glover to go to Swan River; and if he had gone I should have gone as his bailiff, but he declined going: I went and got work in Marchmont-street, but was not in employ at this time; I have a wife and four children.</p>

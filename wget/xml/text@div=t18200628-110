On Wednesday night, the 21st of June, I was packing up my clothes to go into the hospital, the prisoner came into the room, forced his hand into my pocket, and took out a small box containing a 10 l. note; he took the note out, laid the box on the table, and left the room - he was quite sober. I had paid him my rent. I called the watchman, it was sometime before he came, he went to fetch an officer. The prisoner then went out, and returned before the officer came - he denied taking it and was taken to the watch-house, and then gave charge of me. I found my note at the office. Next day I happened to go into the Prince of Wales, public-house, kept by Compton, and told my story - he asked what sort of a note it was? I said it was torn not quite in the middle, and had red writing on it; he then shewed it to me. I cannot read.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you lose a 1 l. note that evening - A. Yes. The prisoner said if I would send for some gin he would find it - I agreed to it; he brought the gin and gave me 18 s. 6 d.; four of us drank<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280052"></xptr>of it. He took the 10 l. note afterwards. I have heard him say he cannot read or write.</p>

            . I keep the Prince of Wales, public-house, in Church-street, about one hundred yards from the prisoner's. About eleven o'clock on the night the prisoner was charged with this robbery, he came into my house, held up a 10 l. note, and said he wanted change; I told him it was a 10 l. note, and I could not give him change, for my father had taken the small notes up when he went to bed. He asked for a shilling's-worth of liquor, which he had. I gave him 19 s., and told him I would give him the rest next morning - he left the note with me. Next morning the prosecutrix came with another female. I delivered the note to my father; he shewed her the note - she described it first, said it was torn across, and had a red-ink mark over the Ten, which was an exact description.</p>

            . I am a beadle. The watchman sent me to the prisoner's house, I found him and the prosecutrix in the room, about a quarter past eleven o'clock at night. She said he had robbed her of a 10 l. note, he said he never had a 10 l. note; that she had thrown her notes about the floor, that his mother picked up a 1 l. note, and he went to get some gin with it. I saw five notes on her chest. I detained them both.</p>

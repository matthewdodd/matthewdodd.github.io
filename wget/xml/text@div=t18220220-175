            . I drove the coach. On Monday, the 28th of January, at four o'clock, I started from Isleworth; Mrs. Forsyth was an inside passenger - she gave me her luggage, and I locked it in the hind boot; it could not drop out. I unlocked it at Charing-cross, it was then safe, and when I came to Southampton-street, there was a cry that the boot was open - I got down, and found the bag was missing. I went back as far as Bedford-street, but could hear nothing of it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 28th of January, at ten minutes before six o'clock, I was on duty, walking about, between the theatre and Bedford-street - I saw some people at the corner of a court. Directly I got up the prisoner ran across the road, to the corner of Adam-street, and had got this bundle up against the post, he was surrounded by six or eight people - I went away; I stood behind a coach, and saw the prisoner go away with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200074"></xptr>two more, with a bundle on his shoulder, the other two were walking on the curb close behind him. At the corner of Salisbury-court, he said to the other two</p>
               <p>"Is this it," the others said</p>
               <p>"No; d - n you, go on." I then took him, and asked what he had got; he hemmed and ha'd; he said he was going to take it to the coach office, but he did not know what office. It was a greasy night, the bag was not muddy.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up in the road.</p>

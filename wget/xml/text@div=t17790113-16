On the 29th of October I left her in the house, and went into the city about three in the afternoon; I returned about six. When I came in I missed a gown, which I had to wash.

The drawers were locked when I went out, and the keys were in my pocket. She broke a fork and an old iron skewer in breaking the locks open; the fork was in the drawers, and the skewer on the table by the drawers. I left nobody in the house but the prisoner; when I returned she was gone. I gave an information at Sir

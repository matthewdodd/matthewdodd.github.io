                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 925). At midday on Saturday, 9th February, I was on duty with Bury at the Ship Tavern Passage, Leaden<lb></lb>hall Market, and saw the prisoner pushing about in the crowd in a sus<lb></lb>picious manner—he put his right hand under his left arm and put his fingers into a gentleman's ticket pocket, walked away sharply, and came to me, put his right hand under his left arm again, and put his fingers into my ticket pocket, but got nothing from me—he then followed a lady to Bull's Head Passage and made several attempts to pick her pocket, but her bag was in his way—he then came between me and a gentleman on my left, put his right hand under his left arm, and took something from the gentleman's ticket pocket—I heard coin jink in his hand as he was looking at it—I caught hold of his hand—he struggled and threw some money away, some of which went down a grating, and all I could recover was a halfpenny—I gave him in charge to Bury and went after the gentleman.</p>

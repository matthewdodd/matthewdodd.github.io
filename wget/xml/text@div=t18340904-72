               <p>HENRY STANTON. I live in Hackney-road. On the evening of the 23rd of July, I was at a society in Bride-lane - I met the prisoner, and went to a house and drank with him - we then went out, and a girl came and spoke to him - he said she was an acquaintance of his, and asked me to give her something to drink - I said it was too late, the houses were shut up - the girl said, "Come to my house" - I went with her to a house in <placeName id="t18340904-72-crimeloc400">Bell-lane</placeName>

            . I have been stopping at this house since I have been from the country - I went into the room; the prosecutor was there - he said he was not going to stop with the other female - I saw the prisoner come in - he sat by the prosecutor's side, laid him back upon the chair, put his hand into his right hand pocket, and then drew it out, but I did not see any thing in it - the prisoner then left the room - the prosecutor immediately said he was robbed, and the other female ran after the prisoner, but could not find him - she came back, and the prosecutor said he would give her in charge, but she went away.</p>

             (police-constable G 140). I took the prisoner at the same house the night after - he said he took the money with the intent that the prosecutor should not be robbed by the females, and he intended to give it him again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the house the night after, to inquire for the man, and they gave me in charge.</p>

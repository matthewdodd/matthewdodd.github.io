I believe she has lived with me about four months; a circumstance occurred in the family, I will not state the circumstance. It induced me to go into the kitchen, and speak to the prisoner. The kitchen is divided from the parlour by a partition; I said to the the prisoner, Ann, your conduct during the time you have been in this house has been much to my satisfaction, but Mrs. Hatton has made communication to me, which, if true, will lessen you very much in my opinion. Now, if you will let me look into your pockets, I shall consider you know nothing of it, and that Mrs. Hatton is wrong in what she has stated to me. She refused to be searched; she said no, if you want to look into my pockets, you must send for an officer, then you may look in my pockets or my boxes, as long as you please. I said if that is your wish, I will certainly send for an officer. I called for the errand boy, to send for an officer; she then begged that I would not send for an officer, she consented to be searched. In searching her pockets I found as many of notes as applied to the business I wanted to find out. I searched the notes and letters that applied to the business; we found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110046"></xptr>six yards of ribbon in her pocket, and a pair of patte ear-drops, which I have had ever since the ribbon is in possession of the constable. We also found a little snuff box on the table, I value that at a shilling; a top of a silver cannister that had been brought into the shop as old silver, worth about two shillings. I am a watchmaker and jeweller; I found a silver knife in her possession, and another silver fruit knife; the silver knife has my private mark upon it. We deal in such things in the shop. I gave the prisoner in charge. These articles were left with me.</p>
               <p>COURT. What things were left with you - A. The top of the cannister, a box, and a pair of ear-drops, all but the ribbon.</p>

On the 11th of December, before eleven o'clock at night, I examined the street door - it was bolted; my servants and family had retired to bed before that. I was alarmed between three and four o'clock in the morning, by a ringing and knocking at the street door; I got up, opened my bed-room window, and saw several persons round the door, and heard persons coming up stairs. I went down to the kitchen, and found the kitchen area door open, and two large holes in it, which were apparently made with a centre-bit; they were large enough for a person's arm to be put through: the pieces of wood which were cut out of the holes were within the kitchen.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Anne's, Soho. On the morning of the 12th of December, about a quarter past three o'clock, I was going down Nassau-street, on the opposite side, and saw a man at this door - I asked what he wanted there; he made no reply, but ran off; directly after that the prisoner ran out of the door, which was open, and down the steps; I am sure he is the man; I did not know him before: I had a good view of his features by the gas-light, and am certain he is the man; I directly called Stop thief! Leach, the watchman, sprang his rattle, and went after him. I went to the house, got a light, and went in at the street door with three or four more men - we went up, and alarmed the family; Mr. Cocker and I went into the kitchen, and found two holes in the area door; there is an arch over the door, which prevents a person being seen from the street. I heard a man was taken, and found the prisoner in the watch-house; I am certain he is the man; he had light thin shoes on; the gas-light was not far from the door, and on the same side. I had a good view of him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of King-street, and part of Nassau-street. I was at the top of Nassau-street; Stevens came by me, and walked down Nassau-street - I followed, and heard him say to a man at the prosecutor's door, "What do you do there?" he ran off; I followed, and then saw two men run down Nassau-street; I was nearly opposite Stevens; he told me to spring the rattle; I pursued - they turned into Gerrard-street, and round the corner into Grafton-street, but before that Cummins, a watchman, got between me and them; they ran faster than me, and thinking they might turn a corner I ran up Hayes-court, into Greek-street, and saw the prisoner come running up to the corner of Greek-street; he was one of the two I had pursued; he ran as fast as he could; I said, "If you don't stop I will knock you down;" he made no reply, but kept running on as fast as he could, and when I got nearer to him he made a kind of dart to avoid me, but I hit him on the head with my stick, and knocked him down; he was secured; I am sure he is the man who ran from Nassau-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get round to Greek-street? A. He ran up Litchfield-street a little way - there is then a turning. I found a crow-bar and lantern on the left hand side of Grafton-street; I saw nobody else passing all the way I pursued. The prisoner had very thin shoes on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does Litchfield-street cross Grafton-street? A. Yes - he got from there into Greek-street; I stopped him at the corner of Church-street and Greek-street.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 12th of December I was in Gerrard-street, coming towards Nassau-street, and heard Stevens saying, "What are you doing there?" I went on, and saw two men run from Nassau-street, and cross towards Gerrard-street - they turned towards me; I crossed to meet them: they ran back as hard as they could; I called Stop them! the rattles sprang; Cummins met them right under the gas-lamp; Leach and Cummins were full thirty yards before me. I lost sight of them, and went to No. 11, Nassau-street, with Stevens, to examine the house; we entered the street door, which was open; two holes were cut in the kitchen door, both the bolts undone, and the bar laid on the floor. I picked up two pieces of wood which had been cut out of the door - I produce them. A centre-bit has been applied in seven places in one hole, and six in the other.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was at my stand, and heard Stevens say, "What do you do there?" I looked over to Nassau-street, and saw a man coming down that street - he turned round to go towards Gerrard-street, and crossed over to the corner of Nassau-street;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120004"></xptr>Cook said, "Stop these men," and I saw there were two men. I crossed over and met them - I made a blow at the other man, and hit him on the breast, at the corner of Gerrard-street; they both got away; I pursued them along Grafton-street, and by Grafton House I heard something thrown down; I still followed - the other man turned down Litchfield-street, to the right - the prisoner ran on about four doors beyond Litchfield-street, and stopped up against some shutter, to hide himself, as a watchman was coming by. I saw nobody else passing at all. I saw the prisoner's face in Gerrard-street, and am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you first see him to swear to him? A. When I crossed over in Gerrard-street they both passed close against me - it was the other man who I struck. I had a good opportunity of seeing the prisoner - there is a gas-light at the door where they passed me - it shone in their faces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home, and in Compton-street I heard a cry of Stop thief! I went through Church-street, and a watchman laid hold of me, but I know nothing about it.</p>

I went there with him; he pointed the house out, we found nobody there that knew him. I then took him to the watch-house.

I was asking the prisoner how he came to give me a bad note; he said he did not know it was bad; he was standing where I left him; he walked away from me; he said he received it of one Mr. Smith, down High-street, and would go and fetch the man who gave it him.

            , on Sunday last I went down to Seven Oaks in company with Goodhall, with whom I had been working at harvest work as a labouring man. We went down for the purpose of enlisting as substitutes in the Militia, and on the Monday following, we met the Serjeant of the Militia, at the Crown-inn, and I received 2 l. 10 s. from the Serjeant upon enlisting, as the bounty money.

             also enlisted, and received the like sum; I and him started from Seven Oaks on Monday night, and arrived in town on Tuesday morning; we went on Tuesday to Clerkenwell, for the purpose of enlisting again as substitutes in the Militia, but did not; on the Wednesday we went to the Borough for the like purpose, but did not succeed; yesterday morning we went down to Westminster, and coming back we met with two young men whom I had known before, and one of them called Jem, asked us both to buy some forged notes of him, at 5 s. each, and we agreed to buy three 1 l. notes, but having no money, Goodhall agreed to pawn his coat and breeches, which were at a house in Lloyd's-court, No. 3, and we all went together, and Goodall delivered me his coat and breeches, which I went and pawned at Dobree's, in Holborn, for 18 s. Goodhall and the other men waited for me by St. Giles's Church, and when I joined them again I gave the young man 15 s. and Goodall 3 s. and the duplicate, and the young man then went away, and in about a quarter of an hour afterwards he met me and Goodall at a public-house, by appointment. I and the young man and his companion, then went to St. James's Park, where Goodall joined us, and the young man took the notes out of his pocket and wrote on one of them which he gave me, the other two were put in my snuff-box, which Goodhall took into his possession, and then went to Mr. Giles's shop, and offered the 1 l. forged note, when I was taken into custody. Goodall went with me to the street, and was to remaln at a public-house there untill I joined him."</p>

I said no; he said it would do some good for us if I would; he said you, may as well come along, I have got a friend here, which was these two young men; he did not say what he was going to do. I lent him my clothes, and he pawned them for 18 s. and gave me 3 s.; I never saw him give the young man 15 s.; they went away. I went and dined in Chandos-street; he came back, and said he was going to St. James's Park. I said I should have my dinner. I did not see the young men give him any note, nor did he shew them to me till we got to Silver-street, he then said he had got 3 l., I was to have 1 l. and he would see me in Stacey-street. I knew nothing of the notes being bad.</p>

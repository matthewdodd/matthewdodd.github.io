                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Robert Watt, a pawnbroker, in Clerkenwell. About six o'clock in the evening on the 1st of July, the prisoner Costello came in to pledge an iron-while I was writing the ticket, the other came and began to converse with her-while they were talking, Costello snatched a gown off, and put it under her clothes—they both walked out—I went and brought Costello into the shop, and she told our lad to stop the other—I told Costello to put the gown down, which she did, and tried to throw it across the counter—I knew her before.</p>

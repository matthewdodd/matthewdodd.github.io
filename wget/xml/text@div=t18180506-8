Fernandi took my watch, seals, and money, as stated in the indictment, from me - He searched my pocket. The other man said, "Leave him a shilling;" he said,</p>
               <p>"I will not leave him a scrap." I am sure the prisoners are the men. I saw them in custody eight or nine days after. I had given information at the office.</p>

            . I am seventeen years old, and am servant to Mrs. Solomon, who lives at No. 17, Swallow's-gardens, Rosemary-lane. The prisoner, Fernandi, is my father-in-law - He lives in New-court, Thomas-street, Whitechapel. On Easter Sunday I went home to ask my mother to go to Stepney-fair; she said she would go on Tuesday. I went there on the Tuesday, and went to the fair with my father and mother; when I returned I supped there. I went there on the Tuesday about three or four o'clock - We came home about nine o'clock in the evening. I left my father at home. I left them about nine o'clock - We got home from the fair about eight o'clock, and staid at home till nine. My father stopped at home to mind the house. I heard he was in custody about a week after.</p>

               <p>I am one of the beadles of our ward, and I was officer of the night, between the hours of twelve and one the prisoner was brought in and charged with robbing the man of a guinea and some silver, and he said that there were two remarkable pieces, a shilling and a six-pence, when they brought her in I saw her dribbling down the mouth, and I suspected she had got it in her mouth, I searched her and found she had it, and at last with a deal of trouble, I got one guinea and two shillings out of her mouth, she had two pockets on, and out of her pockets I took the money out myself two shillings and six-pence, which answered the description the man gave me of the sixpence, it was a new six-pence with a hole punched just at the edge of it quite through, the shilling was stamped with a letter A in the middle of it; she said she had received some money of some man coming along, and she put it into her mouth for fear of being robbed to take care of it; I have got the money about me. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. How much of that money can you swear to? what do you know the shilling by? - By the letter in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the six-pence? - It being a new six-pence and a little hole in the edge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had been down to Gravesend along with a young man, and he took his money and he gave me a guinea and some silver; I came from the Gravesend boat, and going along I met that young man and he told me he would give me six-pence; I told him I would not oblige him for six-pence; so with that he gave me a shilling; he wanted me to have connection with him in the street; I told him I would not except he would go home with me; he said then he would be revenged, he called out watch; and said he was robbed; with that I was taken to the watch-house, and the constable of the night took one guinea and two shillings out of my mouth; he gave me the six-pence and the shilling for obliging him, but I would not oblige him in that place.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. On your oath did you give her this money? - No.</p>

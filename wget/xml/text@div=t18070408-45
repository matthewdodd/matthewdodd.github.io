               <p>Q. Where did the noise come from. - A. From Leman-street, the corner of Prescott-street; I says to the prisoner, let us go and see what is the matter; we both went up and endeavoured to make peace, if we could.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up how many persons did you find, and who was there. - A. I found six, and the deceased made seven; the deceased was then fighting. We told them to disperse As soon as we said that the deceased fell on the patrol, and struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a blow was it. - A. I do not know; the deceased fell down upon the prisoner. I laid hold of the deceased by the coat, and pulled him from the patrol. I said to the prisoner, we will take him to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Q. The deceased then struck the patrol. - A. Yes, with that the patrol made a blow, and struck the deceased over the head; then we took the deceased to the watchhouse.</p>

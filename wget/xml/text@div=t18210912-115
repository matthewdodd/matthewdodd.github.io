            's house. It is in the parish of St. John the Evangelist - I occupy three rooms. On Friday the 6th of July, I went to Fairlop-fair, with Mr. and Mrs. Nightingale, his wife, and other friends; we left the house about nine o'clock in the morning - I left the doors of my apartments locked, they are all on the first floor. I had a tin box, containing one 50 l.; one 20 l.; five 10 l., and one 5 l., notes, five guineas, one of which was Queen Ann's, two 7 s., pieces and some silver, and two promisary notes, one for 1500 l., and the other for 750 l.; I left the box locked, in the bed-room cupboard, where I always keep it, the box was also locked, and I had the key with me, and the key of my bed room also. I came home between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, went up stairs to unlock the doors, but found them forced open, the cupboard door was also broken open, and the cash-box gone, the doors had been forced open by some sort of a chisel, there was some blood on a cupboard door, were there was two silver spoons, which spoons were also gone, and there was some blood on the dressing table cloth, in the bed-room. I have recovered none of my property. My cash box has been produced to me by the officers. I know Garton, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120072"></xptr>lodged while I did in the house, and left two or three months ago. Thurston worked for Mr. Nightingale, and is his nephew; I have seen him there frequently, Garton married Nightingale's daughter.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Nightingale, (Thurston's uncle) is a master bricklayer - A.

               <p>Q. Then as she was taking care of the house, Thurston would naturally go into the house to have tea there on that day - A. He boarded and lodged with her, and as she was there it was the place for him to have tea.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. He went back and continued with you - A. Yes; I parted with him in Horseferry-road; he then went towards where he was at work.</p>

At this time, I lived in Wright's-passage, Tothill-street; I remember Fairlop-fair, it was the first Friday in July - I know the prisoners and know Mrs. Garton; I saw her on that day about half-past three o'clock, going into Nightingale's house with another woman; they went in at the back door, there is a gateway leading into the yard - I was at work in the yard in a shed; there is a dog that lets nobody in, but those he knows - as soon as the two women came into the yard, he knew Mrs. Garton, he got up, and she held him while the other woman went into the house and she followed - a few minutes after that a boy came for me to get some mortar, and as I was going for it, I met the prisoner Garton at the Bricklayer's Arms, the corner of Stretton-ground, about 200 yards from the house; I saw him afterwards in Orchard-street, which is farther off; he was then going into Stretton-ground, walking in a hurry, or running - it was about ten minutes before five o'clock, as I heard the clock strike when I got to Nightingale's - I do not know whether he was going towards the house or from it.</p>

             and Mrs. Jarvis came to the house about three o'clock - they came in at the back door, let themselves in, and came down into the kitchen - Burn was in the back yard at work; they staid with me three quarters of an hour, and kept talking - neither of the prisoners were there.</p>
               <p>Q. While these women were there, did any knock come at the front door - A. Yes; Mrs. Garton went up, I followed her, and saw it was a man, who said he was Mrs. Topp's doctor - I had never seen him before; I heard no other knock at the door; when the women were gone, I went up stairs, and found the front door open.</p>
               <p>Q. While Thurston, Darvell, and the boy Nightingale were at dinner, were they out of your sight - A. No; they could not have gone to Topp's room then, without my knowing it. Thurston came at four o'clock to tea, and staid a quarter of an hour, or rather better; he had tea in the kitchen with Darvell and Nightingale, they came and went away together. Between seven and eight o'clock, Thurston came again for the key of his room; Mrs. Topp and Mrs. Nightingale came home about twelve o'clock - I then left, and did not know of any thing wrong; Mr. Topp and Nightingale came home about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Thurston was in want of money - A. I do not know, he had money of me that week, he had given me a sovereign to keep, and he had it of me; I do not know whether I had more money of his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. He came to dinner and tea, and stopped in the kitchen with you till he went - A. Yes; they came and went away together. I have seen a man named Holland, it was not him that I saw at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. These women came and staid about three quarters of an hour - A. Yes; I was in the kitchen all that time, except when I went to the door, and was absent then a very short time, not five minutes - she gave an answer to the man, and I came down.</p>
               <p>Q. In that time, Jarvis might have gone up stairs, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120073"></xptr>pass you, without your knowing it - A. I do not think she could, for we were on the landing place; and when I went into the kitchen, I found her there - I went to the door as quick as usual, and returned; the doctor merely asked if Mrs. Topp was at home, Mrs. Garton said</p>
               <p>"No; she was gone out." He said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, then, she is better", and left, I believe, for I went down and left her to shut the door - she was not long before she came into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. When the women went away, did you accompany them up stairs - A. No; Mrs. Garton was in the habit of coming to the house, and knew the way as well as I did; she went out at the front door, whether she left it open or not, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was it possible for Jarvis to go up to the room while you were answering the doctor, without your seeing her - A. No; for she must pass close by me.</p>

Between two and three o'clock on the day of Fairlop fair I saw Mrs. Garton, she took me to Nightingale's house, we went in at the back door, there was a large black dog in the yard, I was frightened at it, she went in first, it let her pass, and she held it while I came in; old Mrs. Nightingale was on the kitchen stairs and asked us down, we went down, nobody else was in the kitchen, we were there about three quarters of an hour, a knock came at the door, in about half an hour Mrs. Garton went up first and the old lady after her. I heard nothing that passed at the door, they were not gone above two minutes, and came down one after the other; when we left we came out at the front door, I went out first and she after me, I do not know whether she shut the door or not. We went to my place in Orchard-street, and staid at my door together, and while we were there I saw the prisoner Garton running up Orchard-street, towards my door, he beckoned to her with his hand, and using a bad expression desired her to make haste over to him, he seemed agitated, she went to him, I saw her give him something out of her pocket, what it was I do not know, she came back to me immediately, and went up stairs with me and staid about ten minutes. She looked out of window, saw some person in the street and left. I did not see Garton again that evening. I was taken out of bed the next day, and taken to prison. Mrs. Garton was also taken up, we were sent to the same prison, but kept separate. While I was there, on the Thursday week after I first went, Garton came to me in prison, I had not sent for him, he put his hand through a small hole to shake hands with me, and asked me how I did. I said I was very indifferent, and he knew very well that I was perfectly innocent of what I was there for, and it was a pity that I should stay there innocently; he said he knew I was innocent, and said he was the man who robbed Mr. Topp, and that Thurston was in the kitchen, keeping old Mrs. Nightingale in conversation while he (Garton) broke open the place, he said he broke open a one pair of stairs front room door, and a one pair of stairs back room door, and that back room was a bed-room, that he broke open a closet in that bed room, and in that closet was a tin box, he took the tin box out of the closet, laid it on the bed, and in breaking open the box he cut one of his fingers, he held up one of his fingers which was cut across; I saw that it was cut; he said that when he opened the box, he took out a 50 l. note, a 20 l. note, and five 10 l. notes, some guineas, among which was a Queen Ann's guinea, and some promissory notes, and one silver spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he took the spoon out of the box or cupboard - A. I do not know which. He said he changed the notes and got sovereigns for them of a Jew in Whitechapel, and lost two hog in the pound in changing them. He did not say how many sovereigns he got. He said he broke all the the three doors open with a crow-bar, and that he threw the box away, he did not say where; he said he threw the crow-bar away in the Willow-walk. He called for a pot of porter, gave me some and took the rest away. I saw no more of him. I was discharged on the Saturday following, and have been out of custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you live with - A.

               <p>Q. Had you seen Garton or Thurston before Mrs. Garton asked you to go out with her - A. No, nor did I know Topp was going to the fair till I saw Mrs. Garton, and was never in Nightingale's house before, he is quite a stranger to me. I did not know who lived there before</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Your friend is a lamplighter - A. Yes; he carries a ladder - he lights the gas lamps. I have been tried here myself twelve months ago, and was imprisoned six months. I was brought into that as innocent as I am in this. I was never here but once and that was for a pair of boots.</p>
               <p>Q. You have described the money and notes, even the Queen Ann's guinea, as well as if you did it yourself - A. It is what he told me and I told the Magistrate. I had been a fortnight in prison. I do not know

            . I know Richard by sight. I do not know whether he ever uses the lamplighter's ladder. Garton said nothing about getting in at the window, he said he got in at the door. I saw Holland just as I was coming back from the house, Mrs. Garton was talking to him. I have known Mrs. Garton six or seven years. I have seen her with Holland. I do not know that she cohabits with him. I never heard her say that if she could get her husband convicted and sent to Botany Bay she would marry him. I have seen them together at the public-house, not in a private room. Garton's wife was discharged when I was, and was afterwards taken into custody to be a witness. I never moved from my chair while the old lady was up stairs. I never saw the box. He only told me once about it. I remember the amount of the notes and all about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Mrs. Garton was at your lodging when Garton came running - A. She was at my door, we came straight from Nightingale's, and waited at my door about ten minutes when he came running, my house is not far from Nightingale's, but she took me a back way which I did not know, she met Holland, I walked on and did not hear their conversation. I did not go near enough to hear what Garton said to his wife. It was between four and five o'clock, about the time for tea; she said she gave him the key. I never saw Holland in custody on this charge. I did not see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120074"></xptr>Garton there when I was examined, only me and his wife were put to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you in prison more than once - A. No. I was with the rest of the women, he came and spoke to me through the bars.</p>
               <p>Q. All the women might have heard it - A. It was the time all their friends were admitted, they were talking to them. He told me every word of his own accord. He mentioned promissory notes, those were his very words. Perhaps half a dozen women were in the same place talking to their friends; the grating is about a yard and a quarter long, if they paid attention they might hear what he said. I stood at the end of the grating on one side. I went and told Topp of it on the Saturday, after I was liberated, and told the Justice. Garton was taken on Tuesday, which was when I told Topp. I had not seen Mrs. Garton nor Holland before I told Topp.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday, the 24th of July, I apprehended Garton in Vincent-square, near Vauxhall, his wife was with him. I searched him and found sixty-six sovereigns in his breeches pocket, and in his waistcoat pocket 9 s. 6 d. in silver, a crooked half guinea, and the key of a padlock. I conveyed him to the the Ship, public-house, in Horseferry-road, to search him further, and in passing the window a man named

            , a lamplighter, was sitting; Garton said to him,</p>
               <p>"Bill, I may thank your bl - dy woman for this." In going up stairs to make further search, I saw him fumbling at his breeches with his left hand. I immediately seized it, and in that hand I found in a little leather bag sixteen sovereigns, and a gold chased ring and in his fob a silver watch, two gold seals, a gold key, and metal chain. On the 1st of August, I went to Brown's-gardens to look for the box, and found it down a privy. Topp claimed it. I searched in Willow-walk, but could not find the crow bar. I examined Garton's hand, his finger were wrapped up with a handkerchief, it appeared cut, he said it was a fester, it appeared a scratch.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 120.) On the 17th of March I received a handkerchief from Mr. Lawrence Kortwright, with a boy in cus<lb></lb>tody—as I was conveying him to the station, the prisoner kept winking his eye at the boy, and said to him, "Go quietly, <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi>;" and directly he said</p>

               <p>that, the prisoner I had, resisted very violently, and when I got about 100 yards from the shop I took him from, my hat was knocked off—I had at that time two handkerchiefs, one which I had taken from the prisoner that I had in custody, and the one I received from Major Kortwright—the prisoner was close to me, and when I stooped to pick up my hat, he took the two hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs from me—he threw Major Kortwright's handkerchief into the crowd, and this other handkerchief I picked up at my feet—the other handkerchief has never been found—another officer came up, and I gave this prisoner into custody—I kept my own prisoner myself—this prisoner denied the charge at the station.</p>

I gave a handkerchief in charge to Atto when he took Field—I saw the prisoner eighty or a hundred yards down the lane—I saw a man snatch a pocket-handkerchief from the officer, and I am pretty certain it was the prisoner—I will not swear to him—I saw one hand<lb></lb>kerchief drop, but whether it was mine or not, I cannot say—I was not following the officer—I made an attempt, but was advised not to go on.</p>

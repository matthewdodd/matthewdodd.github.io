                  </hi>. I am a grazier, and live in Lawrence-street, Lisson-grove. On the 7th of May, I was in Smithfield—I had a horse for sale—the prisoner came to me and asked if I would make an exchange with him—there was a horse brought up just afterwards—he asked me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to boot—I offered him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he afterwards agreed to 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said it was a very good horse, and if I liked to make the exchange, he would—I paid him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but never got the horse, nor did he have mine, for the horse he showed me was owned by a person named Purser.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Globe-road, Mile-end, Bethnal-green. My man had a horse in the market—I saw it brought up towards Mr. Trent's horse, within two or three yards of it—I did not hear what passed between Mr. Trent and the prisoner—the prisoner came and asked me if I would take 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my horse—I said, No—he then came and asked if I would change it, and take two sovereigns to boot—I said, no, I would not change at all—the horse spoken of is mine—the prisoner had no authority from me to change it away, or sell it.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you know him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that was all the conversation I had with him that day, to the best of my recollection—I followed my horse, but did not have a conversation with Mr. Trent—I do not think I ever saw Mr. Trent's horse—it was not close to mine—my horse was on one side of the rail, and Trent's on the other—when my horse stood for sale, I should say it was nearly twenty yards from Trent's, but they were nearer afterwards, when they were brought and shown out—they were not shown together, that I know of—I saw Trent standing about three yards from my horse—I did not know what the prisoner was going to do.</p>

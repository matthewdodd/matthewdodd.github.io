                  </hi>. I am a painter of 25, Judd-street. On the night of 5th November, I was with a female in a public-house, opposite York-street, Pentonville-hill—the prisoners and another female were there—I left the female I was with to go home, and the prisoners and the other woman followed me—I was sober; I knew what I was doing—I went to the door of a brothel about a quarter of a mile from the public-house—I went into a room and sat down on the edge of the bed—I rose up again to go, and found my watch guard swinging, but felt my watch in my waistcoat pocket; I took it out and put it into my trousers pocket—the swivel was cut—that was not above five minutes after I went in—during the whole of that time all the three women were in the room—I was thrown on the bed by all three of them and found Field's hand in my trousers pocket—I squeezed her hands hard and made her drop the watch into my pocket again—I hallooed "Police" as hard as I could call—I was thrown on the bed again, and Smith and another one caught me by the arms, and the other by the throat, and with one hand over my mouth, and then my watch went—when I was nearly strangled the police came in, and I gave them in charge—one of them left the room before the police came—I have never seen my watch since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 106). About half-past I on the morning of 6th November, I heard a cry of "Police" from 6, Paradise-street, which is a brothel—the outer door was closed but not fastened—I pushed it open, turned my lamp on, and saw Field holding the prosecutor by the throat and Smith had him by the hair—he was struggling with them—I pushed them back into the parlour, and he said that he had been robbed of his watch—his chain was hanging down—I took the prisoners—I had met a woman in the street who I do not know; she was coming in a direction from 2, Paradise-street.</p>

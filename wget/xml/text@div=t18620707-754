                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. William Attwell, who keeps the Vine Hotel in Bishopsgate-street—on the night of 22d June, the prisoner came to me about 11 o'clock, and asked if he could have a room—I said, "Yes, No. 6"—he said he should like a sandwich—he went into the coffee-room and had it, and after about half-an-hour he came out and asked what time we closed—I said about 12 o'clock, and that after that time he must ring the bell for the porter—he then went out—I went to bed about half-past 12 o'clock—after I was in bed I was disturbed by hearing a noise at the door—I laid and listened, and heard the noise, and then I heard footsteps move—in three or four minutes afterwards I heard a slight noise, and then the door opened, and I saw a man walk into the room—I screamed out and saw the man go back again—the door gently closed—my husband then jumped out of bed, and we both watched at the window—in about twenty minutes, we heard a slight noise again, and saw a man pass the window—my husband called out and asked him where he was going to—the person went towards No. 11 stairs—he had a red shirt and white drawers on—we saw him about a quarter of an hour afterwards come back again—I did not see where he went when he came back—as soon as he passed the second window, my husband came out and said, "You are No. 7, are you?"—I said, "No, he is No. 6, for there is no one in No, 7"—I did not see him when he went into No. 7, because I ran up stairs to the boots then.</p>

Bennett's room—he was apprehended about a quarter to 4.</p>

Bank note, which I paid into the Marlborough Bank on the 15th of July - I kept it in my bureau till then, with other notes; I do not recollect taking any other 5 l. Bank notes, except one, which I paid in with it; I have got the note from the Marlborough Bank again, and produce it; I cannot positively swear it is the note I received from the prisoner; I put the private mark on the one I had of her, but it is the same mark I put on all notes paid me by passengers, which is the letter M.

               <p>COURT. Q. You know the mark on it is yours - A. Yes, and I paid no other 5 l. note into the Bank so marked; I have them both here, the other is marked W. H. C. for White Horse Cellar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Corke, a butcher of Merton—on Friday Morning, the 8th of April, I heard a noise of someone jumping over our fence—I looked out at the window, and saw four men standing under the tree, directly under the window—the prisoners are three of them—after they passed the penthouse I saw one of them putting my baby's cap into his pocket—I called "Police" and called the servants—all the four men turned and looked at me—I went down, and found the parlour window open—I missed a scarlet jacket, a scarlet cloak, three anti-macassars, and a table cover, which were safe when I went to bed—the window was close down then, but I am not sure whether the catch was fastened—it had not been opened since Christmas—I did not know the prisoners before, but I am sure of them.</p>

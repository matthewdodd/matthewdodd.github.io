On 30th May, I was going to my work, and met Miss Vaughan—before I met her, I met six young chaps running round the corner from the Queen's-road—they were running from the direction of Miss Vaughan, coming from the Queen's-road, towards Princes-terrace, and they turned down by the comer of a public-house—Miss Vaughan said some<lb></lb>thing to me—I saw which way they turned, and went a nearer way and over-took them—I saw the prisoner Watson pass the bag to one of the others—it was a leather bag—I ran to catch hold of the one that had got the bag, and Watson turned and pushed me back—I made another start to run, and he prevented me again, and I caught him by the collar and threw him on the pavement, and kept him till the policeman came and took him from me—Anderson is very much like one of the boys, but I will not swear positively to him—they were all running pretty nearly together.</p>

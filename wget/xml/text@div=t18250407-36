I went out at six o'clock, and on returning at ten, found the upper part of my house destroyed by fire; the first and second floors were destroyed - it was extinguished when I returned;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070021"></xptr>the ceilings of the parlours were only damaged, and the kitchens unhurt - no part of it is yet habitable. I am a working silversmith, and had about 300 ozs. of silver there - some worked, and some not. On Monday I attended the firemen to search, and found from 113 to 120 ozs.; some of it had melted and run together, and some had not melted; there had been about 100 ozs. in bars, as it came from the refiners. I found that quantity considerably deficient; we continued to search on Tuesday and Wednesday, and found in all 170 or 180 ozs. The prisoner was one of the firemen, and in his presence I showed them all some stone and tile, and told them the silver, in the state it probably would be, would resemble that, except in weight, and told them not to throw any thing of the sort away without showing it to me - they left on Wednesday, and I afterwards found 13 ozs. more. On the 15th, Abut and Sons, refiners, sent me a piece, weighing 16 ozs. 5 dwts. - I went there, and took Heath into custody: we next took South, in the Borough, and then went to the Hope Insurance Office, and took the prisoner.</p>

            . I am foreman at the Hope Fire Office. I was at Mr. Starkey's on the day after the fire. On Tuesday Mr. Starkey took up a piece of tile, and said the silver would resemble that, and desired us to bring it to him - I believe the prisoner was present.</p>

            . I am principal clerk to Messrs. Abuts. On Tuesday morning, the 15th of February, Heath brought me a piece of silver to be assayed; he is a gold and silver chaser: as soon as I saw it I knew it to have been melted by me, by the shape of the ingot into which it was cast - the fire had not affected it. I sent to Mr. Starkey. I melted 2,200 ozs., and he had 200 ozs. of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has the heat had no effect on it? A. It has only blackened it. An ignorant person might not know it to be silver.</p>

            . I am a beer machine maker, and pewterer, and live in Bride-lane, Fleet-street. On Sunday, the 13th of February, the prisoner came to my house about six o'clock in the evening, and said he had got a piece of metal which he had found in the ruins of a fire - he did not know what it was, but it would serve me as solder; I gave him nothing for it: he was an acquaintance. I thought it heavier than the metal I generally use, and next morning took it to Heath, to be assayed. I could not tell what it was from the colour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He did not sell it to you? A. No. I just took it up and put it down; solder is heavier than pewter, but silver is still heavier.</p>

                  </hi>. I am under-gardener to Hannah de Rothschild, of Gunnersbury-park, Ealing. On Thursday afternoon, at half-past twelve o'clock, I saw the two prisoners together, getting over the palings at the fur<lb></lb>ther side of the gardens, where there is a drying-ground for clothes—Taylor had a bundle in his arms—when they got out of the premises they both went different ways—I followed Taylor, but lost sight of him, going round a break in the hedge—some one told me something the next morning—I went into the lane, and found this sheet by the bank at the edge of the ditch, near the premises, where it was taken from—it was hidden under a bundle of nettles and grass which had been cut off the bank—it was between nine and ten yards from the place where the prisoners had got over—the sheet was wet when I found it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Brentford. Between twelve and one o'clock on the 6th of Sept. I saw the two prisoners—I knew them both—they were running away from Baroness de Rothschild's place across for Ealing—I saw Turner running after them—Taylor seemed to have a bundle—I could not see what it was—I saw Lemon make a kind of dead stop within about ten yards of the place—I did not see him do anything—I did not tell any one what I had seen.</p>

Q.</hi> You did not help the under-gardner to run after them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not run at all—he spoke to me at the time he was running—he asked me whether I knew them—he did not stop—Lemon was not long stopping on this side of the wall—I saw the under-gardener after dinner the same day, about two o'clock—I did not tell him then, or have any conversation with him—I could not get near him—I was at Mr. Mills's gate, and he was inside—I did ring the bell, but I did not get near him—one of the men who works for Mrs. Rothschild opened the gate—in the first place it was said that it was I that did it—I rang at Mr. Mills's bell, and asked them whether they thought it was the other party, but they knew before I told them—I first told Turner on the day after I was taken before the Magistrate—Turner was before the Magistrate—he saw I was under charge—I was remanded that day, and I walked off with two policemen towards Mrs. Rothschild's place—there is no public-house there—we did not go into any public-house or beer-shop—I did not go into any house with a policeman—we went to the station-house—I and the policeman had no con<lb></lb>versation about this—I told him that it was the two prisoners that were run<lb></lb>ning away—that was before we went before the Magistrate at all—I did not tell it to the Magistrate at all—I was taken on the 6th—I have been in a little trouble before about a watch—I gave it up to the policemen when they came after me—I was prosecuted for it, and had two months—the other time was about some mushrooms.</p>

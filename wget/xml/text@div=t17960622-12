               <p>Q. Have you any partner? - A. None at all: About eight o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 4th of May, I came down stairs and found my son engaged, showing the prisoner some coloured patent silk stockings; as he seemed to look them it largely, I thought it adviseable to attend him myself; he looked out a quantity of the coloured ones,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220034"></xptr>he desired to look at some white, saying, they were not all for himself, some were for his relations in the country; after he had looked out a quantity of the white ones, he asked if Mr. Hoole, the haberdasher, lived near, he wanted to buy some ribbons, and I directed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he given you directions before this, to pack up any hose? - A. Yes; he had desired me to pack these things up with great care, that they might go to the country in safety, that he would go to Mr. Hoole's, and buy the articles he wanted there, and would return and pay for those he had picked out; I observed him open the door very quick; immediately upon his opening the door, or rather his going out of the door, my warehouseman,

               <p>I was shopman to Mr. Shute: On the 4th of May last, the prisoner came into the shop, between eight and nine o'clock; I was dressing up one pair of stairs; Mr. Shute's son came to me, and told me-</p>
               <p>Q. You must not tell us what he said? - A. I came to the top of the stairs, and looked some time, and saw the prisoner looking out some stockings; Mr. Shute was there at the time; I saw the prisoner take some stockings from the counter, and put them into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they loose stockings on the counter? - A. They were; I called the porter, and desired him to stand by him, and seize the prisoner the instant he went out of the shop; I waited a few minutes longer, and saw him take some more, and put into his pocket; I told the porter what I had seen; he said, he had better go down stairs, and seen employed at the bottom of the stairs, to be nearer the prisoner; immediately after, I saw him go out, and run away, and we pursued him down Gutter-lane, and Wood-street, and cried, stop-thief, and he threw his great coat off; I passed the great coat, and followed him down Wood-street, crying, stop-thief, the whole time; the prisoner turned into Lad-lane, where he was stopped by a man; I did not see him stopped, he was stopped the instant he was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken back to Mr. Shute's? - A. I brought him back, and met Fitzpatrick with the great coat, and we went with him to Mr. Shute's; when we returned, some stockings were taken out of the great coat pocket, by the porter, and some by Mr. Hart, there were nine pair of silk stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which side pocket it was? - A. No; I looked at two of them, and found my own mark upon them, I had put it some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt they were Mr. Shute's property? - A. Not the least in the world; Mr. Shute desired Fitzpatrick to go for a Mr. Wathen, a hosier, at Snow-hill; the prisoner said, it was unnecessary, there were sufficient evidence against him, he threw himself entirely upon Mr. Shute's mercy; he said, it was his first offence, and when he heard his safe, he would pity him, and not be severe against him.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. The prisoner said, there was sufficient evidence against him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was after you came back, and said, you saw him take the stockings? - A. No; it was alluding to the stockings taken out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been some time in the shop before you ran out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Bargaining with Mr. Shute's son? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, as he ran, he threw his great coat off? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Harris. (Looks at them.) There are four pair which are marked by myself, those I speak positively to; the others have no mark that I can swear to; those that I can swear to are worth about two guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. Perhaps, though they cost you two guineas, the manufacturer could manufacture them at thirty-six shillings? - A. They might cost the manufacturer less than two guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shute. (Looks at them.) I am able to speak to those that are marked, the rest I believe to be my property; the whole cost me four pounds ten shillings.</p>

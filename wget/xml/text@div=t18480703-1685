                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, G</hi> 82.) On 17th June, about ten minutes past one in the morning, several men were quarrelling in Greek-street—a woman called "Police!"—I was crossing over, and James met me, collared me, and attempted to butt me—he put his head in my belly, and tried to throw me over his head—I collared him, and we both went down together—we got up again, and I sprang my rattle—I got James nearly to the corner of Compton-street, and one of his companions said, "Give it to the b----b----," or something of that sort—I received this blow on my head from one of his companions—we then struggled—several of his companions attempted to rescue him—I got a little fresh life in me, and when I was rising I re<lb></lb>ceived a second blow on my head—I never let him go—I was severely kicked and bruised—I have the marks on my side and on my forehead now, and hare been in the doctor's hands ever since—Purkiss came up when I was on the ground, before I got the second blow.</p>

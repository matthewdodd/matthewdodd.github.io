            . I am a watchman of the market: last night, Mr. Chantrell's servant gave the butter into my care till morning; I saw it a quarter before 10 o'clock, and a quarter after 12, this flat was gone; I saw nobody there to take it. An acquaintance told me this morning, that a person was in custody at St. Bride's watch-house; I went accordingly, and found the prisoner and butter.</p>

            . I am a watchman of the Fleet-market; the prisoner came between 12 and one o'clock, and brought this butter, desiring me to take care of it: he put it down, I asked him who it belonged to, whether any of the market? he said it did not. I told him I would not take charge of it. He said he was going to carry it to Newgate-market; a young man offered to carry it for 2 d. he said that would buy me a pint of purl. I helped him up with it, and he took it away: he went up Sea-coal-lane. A lamp-lighter told me there was a man with his coat off upon his head, and a basket on it; we went up, he had his coat and waistcoat on, the butter was set down on a form, and he lent upon it. I said, you are not got to Newgate-market yet, and asked him why he would not go? he said he would not go till morning. I said I suspected him; and so stopped him, and got the constable: the prisoner told me he had got 53 lumps: I said it could not be so much, it was not heavy enough: he said they made short weight in his country; he said it came from Pancras town. We opened the basket, and instead of 53, there was only 19 lumps and a pound. (The butter produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor.) He told me it was made by one Mr. Jones, a milkman, that he had it of him. I went to Pancras to find this Jones, and could find no such person: I then went to Kentish-town, and found he lived in a country-house at Finchley, and had left off making butter a long time.</p>

On 10th Match, about 2 o'clock, I was in Rose-street, Long Acre—I saw the prisoner there—I knew him before—I called him by name and said, "You are suspected of having counterfeit-coin in your possession; what have you got about you"—he said, "Nothing"—he pulled his hand from his coat-pocket and held it partly closed—I called Inspector Fife's attention to it, and he seized his hand, and took from it this parcel containing ten counterfeit half-crowns, wrapped separately in paper—I said, "They are bad"—the prisoner said, "I believe I know what they are Mr. Brannan, two men gave them to me, they are gone into Pepper's"—I said, "That can't be so, because I have had you under obser<lb></lb>vation since you left the Lamb and Flag, and I have just come out of Pepper's myself"—the Lamb and Flag is nearly opposite Pepper's—I took him into custody.</p>

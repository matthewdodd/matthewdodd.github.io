               <p>I watched with the last witness; presently after we were on the watch, I was in the shed, the prisoner scrambled up upon the tiles of the shed, and went into a little hatch-door that goes into the warehouse; I saw him go up the tiles, but did not see him go into the door; he brought out two bundles of mats, and put them down on the shed, and laid them so that when he got down he might reach them; I went out of the shed, and secured him; laid hold of him as he was coming down; he made this excuse, he wanted lodgings; this was the very man I laid hold of; he has not been out of custody since; we went and brought the mats back again; I knew they were my master's.</p>

               <p>I had been to Wimbledon; I was tired, and went there to rest myself an hour or two; as I was afraid of the dogs there, I did not stand up on the tiles, nor go into the window they speak of; I have no witnesses; they never saw me meddle with any thing of these people's property.</p>
               <p>To Williamson.</p>
               <p>Were the mats on the shed, or in the warehouse? - They were in the warehouse, not upon the shed.</p>

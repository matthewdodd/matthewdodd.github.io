After taking the prisoner to Mr. Sims's, when we got on the road towards the station he became very obstreperous—I walked first—the prisoner had got Jeffery's stick out of his hand—I took it from him—Jeffery said, "He has got a knife"—I struck him on the hand with the stick—he turned very obstreperous, and we tore him out of his boots, or he kicked them off.</p>

               <p>—he had the knife open in his hand—he held it up—I was reaching after it—he tried to stab both me and Jeffery—he wrenched himself away from Jeffery, and came to me, and stabbed me—he jumped right on me from the back—I could not tell where he put his hands, but he struck me with the knife just under the right ear, as far down as the middle of the throat—on that I fell, and saw no more—I made the best of my way to the doctor's, about 300 yards off—the blood was flowing from my wound—they took me home on a chair, and I have been at home ever since, six weeks last Sunday—the wound discharges a good bit now.</p>

I was taking the prisoner to the station, with the last witness—he commenced struggling—he stopped in the first place, and Kentfield and I went to pull him along, and pulled him, as it were, right out of his boots, or he might have kicked them off—we were pulling him; they came off, and he was struggling, trying to get away from us—he tried to throw me down, and I made the best use of my feet to try to keep up—I had not hold of his boots at all, they came off because they were not tied on—I hurried him to go—he put his boots on, but they were not laced—I never kicked him, he kicked me—I was walking on after he left his boots, ten or fifteen, or twenty yards—he said, "Let me put my boots on"—I said, "No, I will see you d—first; had you been quiet you should"—he said, "Won't you?" and he seized me, and I struggled with him—he said, "You b——, if you don't release me I will stab you"—he shook me about, and tried to get away from me—he let go his right hand, and drew the knife out of his pocket, and held it over me—I said to Kentfield, "He has got a knife;" and Kentfield hit him with the stick, I could not swear where, but he struck him, and he went to try at the hand which had the knife in it, and in the struggle the prisoner got out of my hold—he had the knife holding up, and away he went to Kentfield, and then away he ran as hard as he could go—I went after him, and a policeman stopped him.</p>

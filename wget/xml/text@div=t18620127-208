                  </hi>. I am one of the partners of Thomas Berry Rowe, and Co.—the prisoner was engaged by us in July last—his duty was to come to Brentford every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon or evening, and to pay in all moneys received up to the time of his being there—he paid the moneys, over to me,—on 18th December last, or after it, we did not receive from him the sum of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due by Mr. Milton—it should have been paid on Tuesday or Thursday next, following, the date of the receipt—the 18th was on a Wednesday—if received on Wednesday, it should have been paid at Brentford the next day, Thursday—we did not on that following Thurs<lb></lb>day, or any other day, receive from him the sum of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can tell you whether I received any moneys from him on 19th by reference to our book I have here (<hi rend="italic">referring</hi>)—there was no money received from him that day, not an entry at all—we have a customer of the name of Baylis—if the prisoner received money on 24th December, it would be his duty to account on the Tuesday, the very day—he handed me in an account on the Tuesday, 24th,</p>

               <p>the same day that this was received—he handed me several moneys—1 have in my own handwriting, the account containing various sums, among others there was a sum which he acknowledged having received from Mr. Baylis for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he never paid me the remainder, either then or any other occasion—I did not, on 2nd January, receive from him a sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on account of Mr. Gillett—he did not come to Brentford at all on the 2d—he wrote to excuse himself from coming on that day—he was apprehended on the following Friday night, the 3d, or early on Saturday morning the 4th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You reside at Brentford? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the prisoner resides at Greenwich—he stated that he resided there when our firm first engaged him—he was paid by commission, with a guarantee of a minimum sum, amounting to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, it never exceeded that—I was present when our firm engaged the prisoner—he was asked where he had been before, and on being told, we asked him what amount of soap he thought he would be likely to sell for us, judging from his experience at the last house he was with—he stated he thought, with his connexion, he would be able to sell so much soap—we were satisfied with the way in which he took orders for us—there was a verbal arrangement with him at the time he came, that he was to spend his whole time in London taking orders for us, and receiving payment for the same—the manner in which he was to pay, was, that he was to come down every Tuesday and Thursday to Brentford, and pay in at those times, all the moneys he had received on account, up to the time of his coming; he has paid moneys into a bank in London on our account—I do not recollect, on any one occasion, his paying to me moneys that he received from one person to the account of another—I do not recollect the case of a man of the name of Flash, which by mistake, was paid to the account of Case—I am mostly at Brentford—when he pays me in money, he gives me the account on paper—I have one paper that was paid in to me on 24th—I think the paper of Thursday, 19th December, is there—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the prisoner might have paid Milton's account to one of my partners if I had not been there—the entries are in my handwriting generally—the entry of 24th December, is my handwriting—the entries are not all in my handwriting—he paid in altogether on 24th December, 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him into custody when I discovered the error in Milton's case.</p>

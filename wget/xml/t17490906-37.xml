The prisoner stood over me with a hanger to terrify me . One of my knee-buckles was silver and the other not ; they attempting to take that which was not, I told them it was not silver, so they never meddled with the other. After this they stood over me consulting what to do with me about ten minutes; I said to them, pray don't make surgeon's work on me ; the prisoner looked hard at me, and said, D - n his eyes, what shall we do with him? another said, bind him; one of them pulled out a halter, then I begged for mercy; then the prisoner took me by the arm and pushed me along , and a way I walk'd.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had four witnesses to prove him at the Ship and Satlor near Temple bar, the time the robbery was committed; but being examined apart , they appeared full of contradiction, that the jury gave no credit to what they said.</p>

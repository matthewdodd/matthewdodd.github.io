                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 34). On 29th Oct., about one o'clock in the morning, I was on duty at Islington, near the canal, and saw the prisoner and another man—I threw my light on them, and saw they had a smock smeared with blood—I got over the wall, and said, "Halloo, my lads, what have you got here?"—the prisoner said, "What we have got is nothing but our own"—I said, "You may as well let me have a look"—he refused—I laid hold of the bundle; the other one threw it down, and said, "You b—r, look," and ran away—I opened the bundle, and then pursued them—we had a fight for nearly twenty-five minutes; first I was down, and then the prisoner—we went on the tow-path; I got hold of his handkerchief—they said, "Let us drown the b—r," and ran me back into the canal, and both <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me as hard as they could—as I held the prisoner tight he dragged me out of the water, which is eight feet deep—I held him tight till assistance came.</p>

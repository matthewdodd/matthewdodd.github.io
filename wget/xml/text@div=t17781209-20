             thought she heard a noise and went up stairs; when she came in she said, I believe you are robbed. When I came into the shop, all the things mentioned in the indictment were missing; some of them were in unlocked boxes, and some of them were in the window. The prisoner had told me that she was distressed and had no where to be, as she was a poor servant girl out of place. She has said since, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090016"></xptr> two elderly women told her, if she could rob or steal any thing they would support her.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker in the Broadway, Westminster. The prisoner pledged this gown with me on the 15th of October, between seven and eight in the evening; she had a woman with her. The prisoner pledged the gown in the name of Walker. About a week after this, Mrs. Harris came and asked me if I had such a gown as this in pawn; I said I had; she asked whom I took it of, I said of the prisoner. She said she had been to Sir

            's, and she desired if the prisoner came again, that I would stop her; the prisoner came on the seventh of November, in company with another woman, and desired to have this gown put in the other woman's name, as she was going to sell it to her. That is not the same woman, I believe, that came with her when she pledged it. I immediately secured her, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I got acquainted with a woman, who is a girl of the town, and walks the Strand; she would take me to a milliner's in Clare-Market, as I was distressed; she was going to have her cap put on to go out of nights; this woman, the prosecutrix, hired me to come there to go out for her, and I was dressed up in these things, and what money I got of a night I gave to her; she saw company at home herself; she stays at home of a night; I went out; she said the other things I should have to change me. She ill-used me one night when I got no money, and said I should not come there. I thought as I had given her all the money I got, I had a right to take these things away. I am but sixteen years old.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you been in this way? - About six months. I was with her about a fortnight. The girl, who took me to her first, was one Miss Jones; who is now in Tothil-fields Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Prosecutrix. How came you to find out that the gown was at that particular pawnbroker's? - A girl of the town it was that told me. There are several girls I work for. I rent the place of this gentlewoman that is here.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had the girl that gown ever upon her back? - No; it never had been upon any creature's back since I bought it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it a girl of the town told you it was at the pawnbroker's? - No; nobody told me that this was pawned, but only they saw her at a pawnbroker's pawning a gown.</p>
               <p>Jury. I understood you that you was informed that that gown was at a pawnbroker's, and therefore you went there? - That she was pawning a gown there; two silk gowns; the one was this, the other a light-coloured one.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you ever given the girl any thing to wear? - Never.</p>
               <p>Jury. What was she doing in your shop? - Trying on a cap. This gown would not come on her if it was to be tried; it is a very little size; this gown was bought of a clothes woman. I have a witness here who saw me pay for it a few days before.</p>
               <p>Court. That gown does not seem to be finished? - No, it is just as I bought it; if I had let it out the cuffs and apron would have gone with it, but they were left in the box.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you get it from the pawnbroker? - Never, he has brought it with him now.</p>
               <p>But when was it you heard of it? - The 7th of November.</p>
               <p>To John Hill. Had you that constantly in your custody from the time she brought it to you? - Yes.</p>

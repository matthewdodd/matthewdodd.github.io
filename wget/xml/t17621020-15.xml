The next morning I asked him for the key of his box; I searched it, and in it found 10 packs of cards sealed up; there were none of his cloaths in his box, which surprized me; then I took him before Justice Wright: The justice told him, he should be committed, or go for a soldier, which he chose; he accepted of going for a soldier, and entered accordingly: On the 15th of September, there came a letter from

               <p>Q. Where was the box?</p>
               <p>Cleive. That was at a cooper's in Hays's-court by Newport-market; the things mentioned in the indictment were all found in that box, and they are all my property. I have missed them since, though I did not before: When Powell was taken up, he owned that he had them of Parry; he said, Parry brought them there, and said they were his own; then the Justice sent for Parry, who was with the regiment at Northampton, who, when brought before him, in my hearing confessed to his taking them; he said, he was very sorry, and it was the first fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the two prisoners together?</p>

               <p>Cleive. He did, for he wrote all Parry's letters for him; they were very intimate.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Powell?</p>
               <p>Cleive. He draw'd beer at a publick-house in Shugg-lane, and had lived next door to me at a public-house about four years ago, and knew that I carried on the trade of a cutler.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether you did not agree to forgive Parry every thing, upon his enterin as a soldier?</p>
               <p>Cleive. He is not indicted for them things. I gave him his indentures at the justice's, and had forgiven him all that I then knew of, and he entered into the prince of Wales's regiment.</p>

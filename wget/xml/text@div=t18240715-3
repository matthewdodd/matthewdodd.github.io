On the 15th of June, about four o'clock in the morning I was in bed, and was alarmed by a violent knocking at the door - my wife went down stairs, returned, and said something; I went down, and found the back kitchen window open - the sash was lifted up. We missed a piece of bacon, a mortar, a pair of high shoes, a pair of stockings, a coat, and other things - the value of the whole was 20 s. or 25 s. They were taken from both the kitchens, and the passage. I went to the watch-house, found some of the property there, and told Maybank that more was missing - he had the two prisoners in custody, and shewed them to me; West had my coat on; we then went to Sheen, and he had got my shoes on. Both the coat and shoes had been stolen that night with the other property. An old pair of shoes were left in the outer wash-house - Maybank fetched them, but I did not see him fit them to Sheen.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Luke, Chelsea. On the 15th of June, between four and five o'clock in the morning, a man came and gave me information. - On going towards the prosecutor's house I saw West throw part of a ham, and a brass mortar over the wall from Russell's yard; I said,</p>
               <p>"You have been robbing the house; where is your companion?" he made no answer, but jumped over the wall. I took him into custody, and found a pair of high shoes in his pocket; I took him to the watch-house, returned, and found Sheen concealed in Russell's privy. Russell claimed the coat which one of them had on.</p>

I examined Russell's premises, and on the border of the wall I found the marks of large nails of shoes or boots; Sheen had nails in his shoes; we took one out, and compared it with the wall, and I compared the shoe with the wall - the nails corresponded with the marks. Russell claimed the shoes Sheen wore, and the coat which West had on. Sheen had left his old shoes behind in Russell's wash-house - I gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150005"></xptr>them to him afterwards, and they fitted him.

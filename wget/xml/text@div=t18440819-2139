                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 35.) At half-past five o'clock in the morning of the 4th of Aug. I received information, and went to Mr. Stansby's wharf, at Paddington—I found his stable door open and the inner loft door had been broken open—I went to a boat in the canal, and saw Williams and Phipps unloading some gravel out of it—I asked how, long they had been there—they said that they had been there all night, that they came at eight o'clock in the evening, and worked till half-past ten, then went to the Red Lion, came back at twelve, and worked till two, then laid down on a truss till daylight—I said, "I suppose you have heard about Mr. Stansby's place being broken, and the corn stolen?"—they said, yes they had—I asked if they had seen anybody—they said, "No"—I asked them if it was possible for any one to come there while they were at work, and they not see them—they said, no, it was not, and they had not seen any one—I went into the boat, and on the top of the deck I saw some loose corn scattered about—I lifted up the scuttle, and observed Bull and Lovell there—I asked what they did there—Lovell said he came to assist in unloading the boat; but that they had slept too long—I told them to get out—Lovell got out, but Bull seemed rather reluctant—I said, "Get out"—I saw something under him, and said, "What is that?"—he said it was nothing—I said it was something—he then said it was corn for the horses—I saw it was a sack—I then saw on the opposite side, where Lovell had been, some split beans—I asked who they belonged to—he said they were for the boat horses—I awoke the captain of the boat, who was asleep aft, and asked if he had got any corn—he said, "Yes, from three to four bushels" and he had two empty sacks, and a piece of a sack and a tow<lb></lb>ing line—I asked if he knew about any beans—he said no, he never gave his horses any split beans, and if there were any they did not belong to him—I found about a bushel of beans, and a sack containing black oats, beside the sack of white oats I had found before—I sent for assistance to the station, and then the captain pointed out three bushels of black oats, which belonged to him—he said the white oats were not his—I had seen the prisoners pass me a few minutes before twelve o'clock—they were all together, and walking along the Wharf-road—when I found the place broken I traced beans from the stable to the boat.</p>

I live on board this boat—I had two empty sacks on board, and a piece of a sack—I had about three bushels of black oats on the deck of my boat, but no beans at all—I had the care of the boat—Williams and Phipps came to work about half-past eight o'clock on the Saturday night, to unload, and when I was going home, Phipps asked me to leave the deck unlocked that he might have a nap if it came on rain—I left it—I returned to the boat about twelve, and saw Williams and Phipps at work—I went straightway to bed, and know nothing more about it—when the policeman awoke me, I saw Lovell and Bull sitting on the beans—I did</p>

                  </hi>. I am horse-keeper to Mr. George Stansby—he is a wharfinger, and lives at No. 9, Wharf-road. On Saturday night, the 3rd of Aug., at eleven o'clock, I left the stable all locked up safely—I went next morning, about five, and found the doors undone, and some beans scattered about—I went up to the loft, and found the inner door broken, and missed a sack of white oats, and some split-beans, which were my masters—the stable door was shut to when I found it, and it must have been opened from the in<lb></lb>side—there is a wooden rack in the stable, and a person could get from there into the loft—I went with the officer to the boat, and saw Phipps and Williams—I saw some beans scattered from the stable to the boat—I com<lb></lb>pared the white oats, and the split-beans with those which were in my master's loft—they corresponded exactly.</p>

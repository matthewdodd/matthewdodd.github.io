               <p>Bartholomew Harnet. I hope your Lordship will please to give me Leave to discover something of my own Character, which some body here has vilified. I have a Letter sign'd by the Mayor of Cork, and several other worthy Gentlemen, which will satisfy -</p>
               <p>Court. Let your own Character alone for the present, and tell the Court what you have to say against the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Harnet. I lodge in London Alley in Moorfield's. I had Occasion to go to one Citon's, who keeps the Harp and Crown near Iron-gate. When I came from thence it wanted 10 Minutes of 10 a Clock at Night. I lost my Way as I was going Home, for I was a Stranger in Town, it being but 10 Weeks since I came from Ire-land. Somewhere or other I met the Prisoner, and asked him which was the Way to Bishopsgate-street. He said, that the Way I was going was one Way, but not the right Way. I told him I would give any Body a Penny or Two-pence to shew me. He offer'd to go with me himself, and I consented. Then he carried me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060018"></xptr> up one Street, and down another, till I had gone, I believe, thrice as far as it was to my Lodging. Sir, says I, you must certainly be wrong; you have either surrounded me, or lost your Way yourself. No, says he, you was a great deal out of your Way when I met you, but now I shall soon set you right. So in a little time more he brought me into Upper-Moorfields ; then I told him that I know whereabouts I was, and therefore would give him no farther Trouble; and with that I offer'd him a Penny. He said, that would not do, for he had come a great Way with me. Then says I, you shall have 2 d. He said he would have more; but I told him he should have no more, and I would not be impos'd on. I had no sooner spoke but he whistled, and up came another Fellow, who clapt a Pistol to my Breast, and swore, if I stirr'd or spoke, I was a dead Man. Then they turn'd both my Pockets inside out, and took from me 5 s. 9 d. Says the Prisoner, I believe your Buckles are Silver ; as indeed they were, but I told him they were not. However, he took one out and look'd at it, and swore it was good Silver. No, indeed, says I, they are but white Metal, they cost me no more than a Groat, and if you take 'em away, I have not a Groat more in the World to buy another Pair. Before he could take the other Buckle out of my Shoe, we heard some People talking, upon which, he and his Companion run away. Court. Was there any Light that you could see the Prisoner's Face by?</p>
               <p>Harnet. Yes; I took Notice of him by the Lights at Peoples Doors as we came along; he had a black Complexion, and bushy Hair, and his Hat was flap'd ; and after he had robb'd me, I recollected that I had seen him twice or thrice playing at Cudgels at the Ring in Moorfields ; and next Day I saw him there again, and so I took a Constable and apprehended him.</p>

I went with him, he shew'd me the Prisoner, and I took him, and carried him to the King's-head Tavern ; there the Prosecutor desir'd me to search him, which I did; and in his right-side Coat-pocket, among some Goosberries, I found this Silver Buckle; the Prosecutor said, it was the Buckle that he lost, and that he had the Fellow to it.</p>

Then he call'd for a Quartern of Gin, and ask'd me my Name? I did not know what he meant by it; I was almost afraid that he intended to charge me with the Robbery, tho' as it happen'd he did not; but he pull'd some Silver out of his Fob to pay for the Liquor. I wonder'd how that Money escap'd the Hands of the Man who robb'd him.</p>

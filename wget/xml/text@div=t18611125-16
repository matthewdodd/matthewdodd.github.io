                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer of 4, Lothbury—I have em<lb></lb>ployed the prisoner as a porter—on Wednesday, 6th November, about 12 o'clock, I employed him to remove some property to Moorgate-street, among which there was twenty-four dozen files—I paid him for his day's-work, and on the next day I missed four dozen of the files—I returned to the office in Lothbury, and found two dozen in a desk where they ought not to have been—I had not placed them there—I afterwards saw the prisoner and said, "Where are the two dozen files?" holding the other two dozen in my hand—he said, I know nothing of them—I gave him in custody—they are worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>I supposed him to belong to the Society of Commissionaires—I was present before the Magistrate when the prisoner made a statement, on the day after he was given in custody—he said that he had left the files at a baker's shop—he did not say that he went back to the shop and got the files, and then found that the office was shut—he said that he left them at the baker's shop, and we should perhaps find them there—they were pro<lb></lb>duced at that time before the Magistrate.</p>

On the afternoon of November 7th, the prisoner was given into my custody, charged with stealing two dozen files—when Mr. Morgan accused him, he said, "I know nothing about it"—I took him to the station—I asked him where he lived, he said, 5, Alfred-place, Kent-road—I went there and found that there were four number fives, and that he did not live at either of them—I returned and told him I could not find it—he said, "You will find it No. 5, Alfred-street, Park-road, Peckham"—the one place is a long distance from the other—I went to 5, Alfred-street, Park-road, Peckham, to a room on the ground floor, and his wife brought me one dozen files, fastened up as they are now (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I got eight other files from a shelf in the cupboard.</p>
               <p>

Q.</hi> Was the place where you found the files about thirty yards from the Old Kent-road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Much more than that, some eight or nine minutes walk; not near Camberwell—I do not know anything of the Kent-road—I do not know that Park-road runs out of the Old Kent-road into Peckham—I could not find the place, and the prisoner gave me a more specific direction—I mean that it is eight or nine minutes walk from Alfred-street, Kent-road, to Alfred-street, Peckham—I do not know that part, though I know my way to it—the prisoner said that he had left the files at a baker's shop, but did not say that he afterwards got them from there, but could not deliver them as the office was closed; but his wife said so, and that when he left home in the morning he forgot to take them with him—he wears two medals on his breast—I did not take them away—I took some pawnbroker's tickets, but found nothing against him—I was in uniform—the prisoner did not tell me before I went to the lodging that I, should find the things there—he did not tell me that I might go and search; but I told him I should do so—it was after that he gave me the right address—he told me that they were at the baker's shop in Coleman-street, and I went there and found he had left some there and taken them away again.</p>

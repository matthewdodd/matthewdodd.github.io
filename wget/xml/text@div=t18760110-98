                  </hi>. I am clerk and manager to Arthur William Ellis, of the Chemical Works, Millwall—they are the premises of Messrs. Simpson and Payne—Mr. Ellis is a contractor—he contracts to make sul phate of ammonia and Prussian blue—on 6th November, about 12 o'clock in the day, a boy brought me a message, in consequence of which I went to the gate of the factory and there saw Colleman; I had never seen him before—he asked me if I left off at 12 o'clock—I said "No, not till 1"—he said "Are you Mr. Pallett,?"—I said "Yes"—he said he had been down to my father's at Woodford a few evenings ago, that he was speaking to him on a little matter, and he should like to have a little private conversation with me, and asked if I could appoint a place to meet him at 1 o'clock, which I did at the Anchor and Hope, Millwall—I went there at 1 o'clock—and found Colleman outside; we then walked on towards Limehouse—he asked me if Mr. Ellis had a patent for the manufacture of ammonia—I said I believed he had—he asked me if water was used with the ammonia; I said I did not know—he said he wanted the information for some French<lb></lb>men, and asked me if it was sold in a powder or liquid—I said in a powder—he said he would pay me for the information if I gave it to him—I said "You are asking me these questions, and I don't know who or what you are, and if I answer them I shall get myself into great trouble"—he asked me if I remembered a foreigner named Alexander being at the works about two years ago—I said I did not, as I had not been there so long—when I spoke about getting into trouble he said that he was a sworn interpreter and any thing I should tell him could not possibly be heard of by anyone again—he asked me some further questions about the Prussian blue; he asked me if Mr. Ellis made colours—I said yes he made several colours—he said "Any blue?"—I said yes, I had seen Mr. Ellis experimenting with blue—he asked me if it was sold in the powder or the liquid, and who were the buyers—I said I did not know—he then gave me half a crown and this card. (<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi> F. Colleman, interpreter, 3, Great Queen Street, Westmins<lb></lb>ter.") He had a small piece of paper in his hands when he was talking to me, nothing else; no pencil—about ten minutes afterwards he asked me the different ingredients that were used to manufacture blue—I said I could not tell him, as Mr. Ellis was so dose when he was experimenting that I could not possibly see them; he always put it down in a book that he kept for the purpose—he then asked me if I could possibly get hold of that book, and if I could take it to him he would take me to the Frenchmen and I should have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I said "I don't think I can, as Mr. Ellis generally keeps it locked up"—he then asked me to get a copy of it, to copy it out and take it up to him—I said I would and an appoint<lb></lb>ment was made for me to take it there on the following Wednesday, but</p>

               <p>if I could get it before I was to write to him and let him know that I had got it; but when I wrote I was not to mention what I had got, I was to say "I have got what you want" and if there was anything farther he would write to me and let me know what what was wanted—he said I was to address him as "Dear Friend"—I asked him if he had not better get the Frenchmen to write to me—he said "They won't be d——fool enough to do that"—he gave me the address of the Frenchmen, 5, Fitzroy Square, and said if I wrote to him that would find him—that was all that was said at that interview—I made a communication to Mr. Ellis that night; I told him what had transpired—he gave me certain instructions, and on 8th November I wrote to Colleman and on 10th I received this answer—I subsequently had conversation with Colleman about it. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Your letter addressed to me at 5, Fitzroy Square, has been duly handed to me. I would wish all communications to be addressed to my residence, 3, Great Queen Street, Westminster.

(<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi> It will take me a week to make a copy of what we talked about, as I can only get at it when the governor is out of the way, &amp;c.") I received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th November, appoint<lb></lb>ing a meeting on Monday evening.</hi>) In consequence of that letter 1 went up to London and went to Colleman's house, 3, Great Queen Street, West<lb></lb>minster, and saw him there—he asked me what I had got—I said I had got the index—he said "Is that all?"—I said "Yes"—he said "Oh, that is no d——use," that he had written to or seen the Frenchmen to say that I was coming up that night and bring ail with me—I told him it was impossible for me to do it in the time, to copy the whole of the book, it would take me a week or more; but if they pointed out from the index what they wanted I would get it for them—he then asked me what my charge was—I told him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get what they wanted—he said "Oh, that is nonsense, they won't give you no 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The Frenchmen are not so free in parting with their money as to give you 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that"—I said I did not mean 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for what I had got, that I wanted 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the index, before they had the index, and for two or three samples that I had, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more when I had got the copy of the book—he said they would not give so much as that, that he had spoken to his governor Mr. Smith, and Mr. Smith said that if they were gentlemen they ought to give me at least two guineas—I said two guineas would not pay me for the risk and trouble 1 was running, but I would take 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "Very well, I will tell them what you want"—he then took me to 5, Fitzroy Square; we went by omnibus—the door was opened by a female—Colle<lb></lb>man asked if Mr. Louis was in—she said no, but his nephew was—he said "He will do"—she then turned round and said "Oh here is Mr. Louis," and I then saw the prisoner Louis—Colleman said something to him in French, which I did not understand, and he bowed to me; I expect to in<lb></lb>troduce me—we then went into a billiard room there and waited there while they played a game—Louis then took me and Colleman up three flights of stairs to a room with a bed in it—I there saw Chavannes sitting in an easy chair—what then passed was in French—Colleman then asked me if I remembered a Mr. Alexander being at the factory about two asked years ago—I said I did not—Louis then went to the door and Alexander or Bobrownicki walked in—they were then all present—they commenced to</p>

               <p>the blue and the two liquids—they then commenced to question him about the nuke of Prussian blue, how much was made, and who were the buyers at Bradford, in Yorkshire, and also about the ten gallons of columb water—Rogers said he could not answer them in that way, he could not get at the different ingredients used without consulting Mr. Ellis' book—Bobrounicki then asked him in English if he could get Mr. Ellis' book—Rogers said he did not think he could as Mr. Ellis kept it locked up—Bobrownicki told him if he got that book and took it up to him on Wednesday night he would give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-Bobrow<lb></lb>nicki gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on this occasion, and Rogers, Colleman, and I then went downstairs and found three policemen at the door in plain clothes and Colleman was apprehended; he said nothing—Rogers, Colle<lb></lb>man, and I then went into the house again and the others were taken in custody—they had a warrant—a short gentleman, not one of the prisoners, asked me to give the money back which I had received—they were re<lb></lb>manded from time to time and then discharged, and then this bill was found.</p>

I have been in Mr. Ellis' employ about fourteen months—he is a contractor and works for Simpson and Payne—I was not aware that Bobrownicki had a patent in respect of this matter, or that rightly or wrongly he thought that Mr. Ellis was infring<lb></lb>ing it—I had two interviews with Colleman on Saturday and three after<lb></lb>wards, two of which were at Fitzroy Square—when I was first introduced to Chavannes and Bobrownicki and Louis I promised to bring a copy of the book for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a sample of blue was also to be brought—I do not know what it was to be put into; it is a powder—I was permitted by Mr. Ellis to make a copy of the index—I don't know whether the book is in his writing—I never looked through it—what I have seen him write was in English—it is what he writes down when be makes experiments himself—I remember being examined and cross-examined before the Magistrate, Mr. Newton—Mr. Ellis was represented by a solicitor—I mentioned before the Magistrate that I heard Bobrownicki say that if Rogers got the book and took it to him on Wednesday he would give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will not swear that, but I believe I did—I have seen Mr. Froggatt, she solicitor two or three times in the matter, three times at the outside—I never heard Chavannes or Louis speak a word of English—Bobrownicki speaks very broken English—he was at one end of the table, and I, Rogers, and Colle<lb></lb>man at the other—I took no sample on the last occasion; the only sample I took was on the 10th.</p>

                  </hi>. I now live at 6, Underwood Street, City Road—I am a house decorator by trade—in November last I had certain communications</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601100008"></xptr>
               <p>with Mr. Ellis, and in consequence of instructions from him on 20th November I went to 3, Queen Street, Westminster, with Arthur Pallett—I there saw Colleman—he asked me if I was ready to answer any questions that would be put to me by some parties to whom he was going to intro<lb></lb>duce me, respecting the manufacture of blue—I said "Yes"—he said he was employed by a person named Smith, of Ironmonger Lane, City, to make these inquiries on behalf of some gentlemen who were about to establish a manufactory of blue—on the way to the omnibus he asked me if I spoke French—I said no, I spoke Irish, by way of a joke—we went to 5, Fitzroy Square, to the third floor, and in a back room there I was in<lb></lb>troduced by Colleman to Chavannes, Louis, and a lady—Chavannes asked Colleman who I was, and Colleman said "I now introduce to you the principal workman at Mr. Ellis'" (that was said in French—I do under<lb></lb>stand French thoroughly) "who is competent to answer any questions that may be put to him respecting the manufacture of blue; he is well up to his work; he has not been there very long and consequently does not know any foreigners who may be employed there"—the female interpreted what I said to Mr. Chavannes, who was lying on the bed, ill with the gout—she went together with Mr. Louis to the door and then admitted Bobrownicki—he seated himself at the table, and pens and ink and paper were produced, and he began to ask me some questions about the manu<lb></lb>facture of blue—I tad tutored myself with a few answers to questions liable to be put to me—he asked me how many pounds of blue could be manufactured out of a thousand gallons of columb liquor—I answered "I think three-quarters of a hundred weight. I am not sure"—he then told Louis to bring him down two samples from the top of the cupboard, one contained in a glass and one in paper, and he asked me if I knew the nature of the contents—I told him that in the glass was sediment of manu<lb></lb>factured blue, but as to the nature of the liquid in the bottle I did not know—he asked me the names of the liquids contained in the two different bottles—there were two bottles, one containing a dark liquid; there were four samples altogether—he asked me if I knew what the liquids were composed of—I told him I could not get that answer without con<lb></lb>sulting Mr. Ellis' book—I first suggested the existence of the book—Bobrownicki asked me could I procure that book—I said I should have some difficulty in doing so as it was under lock and key—he said "I shall be here on Monday; can you procure the book by that time?"—I said "Yes"—he said "By what time?"—I said "By 6 o'clock on Monday evening"—I was then asked who were the purchasers of the blue and the prices Mr. Ellis sold it at, and so on—Bobrownicki asked what I wanted to procure the book and answers as to the information required, and I said 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not bring the samples with me;' Pallett did—four samples were produced to me, they had one of their own—I then went downstairs, and the prisoners were taken into custody—I was called up afterwards to in<lb></lb>terpret the warrant to them—Pallett introduced me to these men as the principal workman—Colleman did not.</p>

               <p>I could procure Mr. Ellis' book—I said it would be a difficult matter as I had no access to Mr. Ellis' book—I said I might perhaps obtain a copy and would endeavour to do so by Monday evening"—that meant a<lb></lb>copy of the information they required respecting the sale of the blue; the" prices, the principal customers, and so forth—I did not say it as put down there—when I talked about getting a copy, I intended a copy of some information not in the book; they asked me for the names of the customers, the purchasers of the blue, and the prices, and the copy I referred to there was as to that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturing chemist—I am a contractor with Messrs. Simpson and Payne under a seven years' agree<lb></lb>ment—I am not their foreman; here are my agreements—I have been. engaged there about ten years and a half—in April 1873 I took out certain patents for the manufacture of blue from ammoniacal liquor—these (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) are my patents—since then, in order to improve upon those patents, I have made certain researches in my business—I keep a rough experiment book which contains the results of certain experiments made subsequently to these patents—the book is in Court, in the hands of my private solicitor—it contains the results of researches extending over a considerable period and of very great value to myself—I was in the habit of using it almost daily for the purpose of consulting it and of jotting down the result of other enquiries; I kept it under lock and key, sometimes in my desk and sometimes I took it home to Woodford—Pallett was in my employ—I re<lb></lb>member his making certain statements to me early in November, in con<lb></lb>sequence of which I gave him certain instructions, and subsequently, after taking advice from my solicitor, I employed Rogers to act in concert with Pallet—neither Pallett or any other man in my employ would understand. the nature of the operations carried on by me, or be able to describe them without the aid of that book—in 1872 Bobrownicki was engaged at the works under the name of Alexander; I can't say when he left—he was there about eight months off and on—he would be aware of the existence of this book—he came there stating that he had a patent, which afterwards proved to be only a provisional patent, asking us to give him facilities at the works for practically demonstrating the value of it—he tried the patent—it utterly failed—my assistance was asked—I gave it, and his complete specification was patented through the knowledge he there ob<lb></lb>tained through me, which complete specification was at total variance with the provisional one—it lapsed because the stamp duty was not paid—the entries in my book had nothing whatever to do with that patent of Alexander; in the one air was used, in the other steam—Pallett, the gate-keeper, was the first who gave me information about the visit of Colleman to my place, and subsequently Pallett junior—I applied first to my private solicitor, who advised me to go to inspector Greenfield—he said it was not a matter that he could take up and recommended me to a private inquiry man—the book contains the groundwork of the patents that I am about to take out; more comprehensive patents—there are some entries in French; the rest of the book is chiefly written in English, and those parts I wish to keep secret are written in chemical symbols—I could not put a value on the book; it is one of considerable value to me—I have been paid some hundreds of pounds on these patents—it contains secrets known only to myself.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know a gentleman named Thomas Christie who carries on business at 155, Fenchurch Street—I do not know that in 1872 he was introduced to Bobrownicki; I have seen them in contact—I am aware that a provisional patent of Bobrownicki's in reference to the prepara<lb></lb>tion of ammoniacal liquid was registered in 1872—it was registered jointly in his name and Mr. Christie's—I am informed that in May, 1872, there was an arrangement between Christie and Messrs. Simpson and Payne for Simpson and Payne to work that patent—I cannot explain it—I am in the position of a contractor and, therefore, I don't know what Simpson and Payne do; all I know is from what I have heard—I was acting as con<lb></lb>tractor for them in 1872—I do not know of any private arrangement between Bobrownicki and Christie, by which, in consideration of Christie having advanced monies, Bobrownicki had agreed to assist in the working of that patent—I have been informed that in August, 1872, there was an arrangement by which a person named Fenner, Christie, and Messrs. Simpson and Payne were jointly to engage in working Bobrownicki's patent—I don't know it of my own personal knowledge—it was after that that Bobrownicki came to the premises and made certain experiments; that would be about June 1872, the entry in my book is the 11th—he was engaged experimenting there I should say three or four months, off and on—I was frequently ex<lb></lb>perimenting with him—the results of one or two of those experiments would be written down in my book—the only writing of Bobrownicki's in the book would be in reference to the first provisional specification—thereis writing of his in the book; there is the direction which I asked him in the first place, on 11th June, to give me, because I was satisfied the thing would not answer—there is the book, it will speak for itself; the pages that are gummed together I do not wish to be opened—I know nothing of Simpson and Payne, Fenner, Christie, and Webley meeting from time to time in reference to the working of this patent of Bobrownicki's—I know nothing except that I have seen Bobrowuicki, Christie, and Fenner together—sub<lb></lb>sequently to my indicting them for this offence I heard that certain pro<lb></lb>ceedings were threatened by Bobrownicki against Simpson and Payne; but I don't believe it—my patent was taken out in 1873 by Messrs. Bell, Crowder, and Greenfield—I never heard the name of Taylor, Howe, and Co.</p>

I am only a poor interpreter, and am paid for what I interpret"—I then went upstairs at 5, Fitzroy Square, and found the other three prisoners—I had the warrant read to them in French and told them they must consider themselves in custody—Chavannes was suffering. from gout, and I sent for a doctor and had him examined—I could not understand what was said, because some of it was in French, Boyle, who, understands French, will speak to that—I sent them all to the station except Chavanaes—I left him at the house in charge of a constable—at the time I took them into custody I told Bobrownicki that I wanted some papers that he had got, and he handed me some papers, and amongst them were two that had been taken to him by Pallett previously, relating to liquors—Colleman afterwards said to me that he should round on the whole lot of them, that his master was nearly as bad as the others for he had found him no counsel or bail.</p>

The real question was whether they intended per<lb></lb>manently to deprive the owner of the possession of the book, or whether it might not be likened to the case of a school boy surreptitiously abstracting from his master's desk a key to his lessons; could the boy in that case be charged with stealing the book? Here it appeared that what the defendants wanted was the information contained in the book, and although they adopted an improper mode of proceeding in order to obtain it, the question was whether their intention was to incite to the commission of a larceny of the book, and if not they could not be found guilty.</hi>

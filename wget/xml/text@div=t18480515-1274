                  </hi> I carry on business in partnership with my brother, at 80, in the Quadrant—we are hosiers and outfitters—ours is a ready-money shop. On 22nd Sept. the prisoner came and looked out some goods—he desired them to be sent home that evening, or early the next morning, as he had to go to the office—the goods he looked out were a shirt, a collar, one pair of stockings, one handkerchief, one pair of gloves, and one pair of drawers—nothing was said about paying for them—he was a complete stranger—he had just one change of things—I made up a parcel, and gave it so Shergold—I told him not to leave the things without the money—he took them that evening, and brought them back, as the prisoner was not at home to pay for them—I did not keep them till he called again—we should never do any</p>

               <p>business if we did sp—on the following morning Shergold took the goods, with the same directions—he was gone a long while, and returned without the goods, on that I went down to 17, Manchester-buildings—I could not find the prisoner, he was gone out—on the following morning, or the morning after, I received a letter from a wholesale dealer in the City—I went to Fludyer-street—I saw the prisoner in an office—I asked him for the money—he said he had friends who were Magistrates, and they told him it was nothing but a debt—I saw the prisoner three or four times a week after<lb></lb>wards—I was sending down continually for the money—the bill was sent each time.</p>

                  </hi> I am shopman to Mr. Marshall. On 22nd Sept. I received a parcel of goods from him to take to Manchester-buildings—I had directions not to leave them without the money—I god there about ten o'clock at night—I could not find the prisoner, he was not in—I did not leave the goods—I went about nine o'clock next morning—I gave the things to a servant—I sent them up with the bill—the bill was not receipted—then girl came down, and said he would call on Mr. Marshall—I said I was not to leave them without the money—after waiting some time, I went up myself— —I saw the prisoner, and told him I should be glad if he would pay me for the goods, as I had somewhere else to go to—he had the shirt on, he was dressing—he said if I would wait till he was dressed he would talk to me—I waited at the door, and when he came out to me I told him again I must have the goods or the money—he said I was not fit to wait on a gentleman; he should tell Mr. Marshall of my conduct—I still told him I must have the goods or the money—the wished me to take a reference—I said I did not want a refer<lb></lb>ence, I must have the goods or the money—he said he would not give me the goods or the money, he would see Mr. Marshall—I should think I staid three-quarters of an hour—I left him there when I went home—it was not my intention at any time to part with the goods without the money.</p>

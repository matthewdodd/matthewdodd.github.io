               <p>MR. MECHI. Wood told me he had been robbed of the property, and he supposed by Joseph Seager - he said he had sold him one knife for 6d.: the knives are mine - I had found some property before Wood told me of what he had done: I have not found any in consequence of what he told me; he said he had left the things at Mr. Hardwick's.</p>

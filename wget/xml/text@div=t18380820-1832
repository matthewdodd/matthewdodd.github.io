                  </hi>. I am valet to Sir Stephen Richard Glynne, of Berkeley-square. I know the male prisoner—he was out of place in July last, and was in the habit of coming to the house to assist me—on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 16th of July, he came to assist me—he was there daily—I kept the plate in the plate box in the hall—I had a silver candlestick in the plate chest—the table-cloth belongs to Lady Mary Glynne—it was not in my possession—I received information on Friday, the 18th of July, that some property had been found—the policeman produced two keys to me—he applied them to the boxes, the candlesticks had been in among other things, and they unlocked them with perfect ease—it was usual with me to keep those boxes locked—I kept the keys in my own possession—I never parted with them to the prisoner—I had the proper key in my pocket when the officer came-nobody had any right to the key of that box except myself—the two silver candlesticks are worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and are the property of Sir Richard Glynne—they are solid silver-T. Davis had been there on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday as the policeman came on the Friday—I had not missed any thing—I had seen the candlesticks about the 10th—I knew nothing of the fe<lb></lb>male prisoner till she was apprehended—I never heard the male prisoner say he was married—I have heard so from a servant in the house.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 19th of July, I was on duty about half-past three o'clock, in Arabella-row, Pimlico, and saw the female prisoner going along with a basket in her hand—I asked her what she had got in the basket—she said I might look—I looked, and found these two silver candlesticks, and a napkin, and two keys—she said one was the key of her apartment—the napkin was placed over the candlesticks—I asked her where she got them—she said, they were her own property—I took her to the station-house—she then said, she bought them at a sale at Brighton, and had had them twelve years—she afterwards said, she had had them two years-while I was waiting with her at the office, the male prisoner came and spoke to her, and I took him</p>

G. No. 4,"but I could not swear to the table-cloth—it appears the same pattern and description as the one I lost—I have not a doubt of the candlesticks—I can almost swear to them—they are two odd ones, and I have the two fellows with me—there is a different crest on each of them, one is a dove, and the other a griffin's head—I have known the male prisoner ten years, and never knew any thing against him—I would not have allowed him to be in the house unless I thought him honest-his father and mother lived on the estate.</p>

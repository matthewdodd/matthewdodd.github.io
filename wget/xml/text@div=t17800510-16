               <p>I am a constable. On the 2d of May Mr. Champion sent for me to take charge of the prisoner; he was gone to the India-house. I waited in the counting-house till he came back; then Mr. Champion charged him with the fact; he at first denied it, but when Mr. Champion mentioned the sugar and currants; he confessed taking them, and went down on his knees and begged for mercy. He said he hoped he would forgive him; that he never would be guilty of the like again. There was not any thing said to him to induce him to confess.</p>

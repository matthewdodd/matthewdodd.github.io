            . I am a patrol. On the 15th of October I was with Smith - I saw a cart with some hay, near the Fountain public-house, at Clapton; there were three horses, but no carman - we waited a few minutes, and saw the prisoner come out of the Fountain yard with a pail in his hand - he dipped four or five pails of water, and poured it into the trough for the horses - he then got on the top of the cart, turned back the tarpauling, and threw down a truss of hay - he got down, took it up, and went towards the stable with it - I went and took hold of him, and asked what he was going to do with it - he said to leave it till he returned from London - I asked if he had enough hay for his horses till he returned - he said he had- I said, "My lad, I think you are robbing your master"- I gave the hay to Smith, and took the prisoner, cart, and horses up to the watch-house - there was some hay tied to the side of the cart for the horses - Mr. Humphreys' name was on the cart; I got on the top of the cart, and found one truss with only one hand on it - Cowley said,"That is the bottle-truss; we must detain that" - I threw it down, and asked the prisoner where the load of hay was to go; he said, "To the King's Arms public-house, Leadenhall-market;" I took it there, and delivered thirty-six trusses of hay.</p>

I loaded his cart last Saturday week, in the evening, to go to town on Monday morning; I put thirty-six trusses into it, and one bottle-truss in the hind part of the cart - there was no other truss there - there was no other truss tied up in the yard, that I know of; I saw this hay at the watch-house, and believe it to be master's.</p>

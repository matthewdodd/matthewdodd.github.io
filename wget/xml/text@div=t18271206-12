On the 1st of November, Handly, the foreman, directed me to place myself in a stack of pipes, in the old metal shop, so that I was concealed; about ten minutes before nine o'clock, when the men were gone to breakfast, I saw the prisoner come into the shop, pick some metal off the ground, and put it into his bosom - there was not much - he did not take all that was there; he walked out; I came from my hiding place, and informed Handly, who went into the counting-house; I afterwards saw the prisoner come into the shop to his work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How long have you lived with your employers? A. Nearly three years; Handly put me in the lead; I looked through the crevices - it was old pot-metal, and other metal; there was a great quantity there - my masters' names are John and Robert.</p>

            . I am a clerk to John and Robert Warner, and have been so nearly sixteen years. On the 1st of November I placed Parker in a coil of pipe, so as to see who entered the shop; he afterwards made a communication to me, and I stopped the prisoner, who was down the yard, at the back of the premises - he merely went down the yard and returned; I said he had something about him which did not belong to him; he said, "I have;" I requested to see it, and he himself pulled it from his bosom - it was five pieces of metal of the same descripiton as that in our warehouse - it was given to the officer by Messrs. Warners; I believe it to be their's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had he been in your master's employ? A. Eight or nine months - they would not have employed him if his character had been bad; we have one hundred and forty men.</p>

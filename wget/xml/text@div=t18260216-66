            . I was in the tap-room of the Black Lion on the 7th of February, and saw the prisoner - he went away about half-past eleven o'clock at night; he had no basket with him then - next morning he came again about half-past ten o'clock - I saw him; he had no basket then - he went out about twelve o'clock, and brought the basket with him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming home through Bloomsbury-square - I met a man with this basket, who was quite intoxicated - he asked me to carry it for him, and he would give me 1s. or 1s. 6d., and said he thought he could help me to work the next day, if I would meet him somewhere; I asked him if he knew the Black Lion; he said he did, and I went there, expecting to meet him, but he did not come. I must acknowledge I pawned the saw and plane, thinking I should take the money which he had promised me, and get them out.</p>

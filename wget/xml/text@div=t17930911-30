               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of seeing any sheep on the 26th of June? - It was on a Wednesday, I worked for him then; he sent me one road, and he went the other, and I met him down at Turnham Green.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he coming from? - We came from market, from Hayes and Southold market, and we were to meet at Turnham Green, he said there were fifteen to go into Mr. Hartwell's house, and he put fifteen in, as I thought there were fifteen, and then he caught another, which he said was an odd one, and he forgot to mark it. I saw him put it in along with the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor, Mr. Owen? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner worked for Mr. Owen? - Not at that time, nor while I worked for him he did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Owen. Had he worked for you? - He had drove my things for three or four years for his master and himself; he knew my mark as well as I did myself, it was a ruddle mark down the head and over the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Palmer. Did I put any more than fifteen in? - I cannot say, I did not count them, but I thought that you had put fifteen in before.</p>

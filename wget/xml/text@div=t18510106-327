                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). I was fifteen years old last June—I live at 5, Brown's-buildings, with my father, who is a workman in the East India warehouses. I was in the service of Messrs, Wich, Newman, and Co., indigo brokers, as errand-boy—I had been nine months, or a little more, in their employ, before I saw the prisoner—I first saw him in Oct., when I was in Mincing-lane, with an errand-boy, named Frederick George Woodgate, who works for Milner and Co., of Hart-street, Crutched<lb></lb>friars—the prisoner said, "Boy!" and beckoned to me—I was standing leaning my back against the railings of the Commercial coffee-rooms—he had a basket on his back, which he mostly carries with him, strapped across his shoulders—I left Woodgate standing against the Commercial coffee-rooms, and went to him; he was on the opposite side of the street—he came halfway across the road, and I went halfway across, met him, and we walked back to the pavement where he was before—I left Woodgate—the prisoner said to me, "Boy, are you not in the indigo trade?"—I said, "Yes"—he asked who I was employed by—I said, "By Messrs. Wich, Newman, and Co."—he asked whether they were not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185101060006"></xptr>
               <p>some relation to Messrs. Wich and Gadsbury, of Great Tower-street—I said I believed they were—he asked me whether my master had any old indigo samples for sale—I told him no, my master always returned his samples to the warehouses—he stopped to consider, and I asked him what he wanted with me—he said, "Who do you let have your dust?" (meaning indigo dust)—I said I had no perquisites; it is sometimes the boys' perquisites—he said, "Then you get high wages?"—I said I did not, my wages were 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week when I was employed at sale times, which lasted a fortnight; and if my master wanted me on any other day he gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day for it—he said, "That is very low;" he knew boys smaller than me, and not so old, who got more money—I said, "Do you; I wish I had a better place, but the work is light, and my master is very kind to me"—he told me he could tell me how I could get more money—I asked, "How is that?"—he said, "Your master has a great many indigo samples down; if he has got 100 samples down, and you only take one square out of each, it only weighs one ounce, you will have 100 ounces, bring them to me and I will buy them of' you"—I said, "An honest penny is worth a silver shilling, and I will not do it"—at that time Woodgate came up and said, "<hi rend="italic">Wich,</hi> I am going" (we go by our master's names)—I said, "Good bye, <hi rend="italic">Mill,"</hi> that was his employer—he went through the sale-rooms which lead from Mincing-lane to Mark-lane—Barnett left me and followed him—I did not see whether he spoke to him; I was in a hurry—this was about half-past ten in the morning—I think there were sales going on; it was in the middle of sale times, but they do not begin until twelve—I had to take some samples from my master's to Mr. Milner to be put up in the sale, and I had to go to Messrs. Mason and Co., in Mincing-lane, to get some samples—the sale is on the second Tuesday in the month, and this was a week after they had begun—I saw him frequently between that time and 6th Dec.—I might have seen him to speak to him about three times a week, or more, but I shunned him as much as I could—it was only when I met with him coming out of a broker's sale-rooms that I used to speak to him—he addressed me; he always asked me if I had made up my mind—I saw him on Friday, 6th Dec, between Hart-street and Crutched-friars—that was not during the sale times; the sales were over about four weeks then—I was not in regular employ at that time; I had had no work the whole of that week—I was standing thinking, and he said, "What are you <hi rend="italic">breaking</hi> your head about, when the golden ball is so near your hand?"—I said, "Nothing"—he asked me whether I had made up my mind—I told him yes, and asked him whether I should bring him some down next morning—he said, "No, it is my <hi rend="italic">Shobbosh,</hi> let me see you down on Monday morning as early as possible"—I went to my master's on the Monday to see if there was anything for me to do; I called in every morning to see—I went about nine o'clock, or a quarter past; I do not think it was later—I took five pounds of indigo; I weighed it—(Barnett told me on the Friday afternoon that he lived at 16, Grace's-alley, Well's-street, Wellclose-square)—I took it from a chest under the large table in the show-room, put it into two brown-paper parcels, and put one into each pocket—there was no clerk there—I took it to Barrett's shop; he keeps an old clothes shop—there are clothes in the window, which was shut down—there is no appearance of any other trade—the door is half</p>

I make a mistake"—he gave me five shillings for it—I had not made any arrangement with him about it previously—next morning I stole 4lbs. more, out of the same chest, and took it to Barnett—he was standing at the door with a round cap on—it was about ten o'clock—the breakfast things were on his table, and he showed me a <hi rend="italic">meerschaum</hi> pipe—I asked him the price of it, and he said he would take 6lbs. of indigo for it; he would take the 4lbs. then, and trust to ray generosity to give him the other two—I said he wanted to make too much of a market of me, wanting six shillings for a pipe which I could buy for a half-crown any where—he pressed it upon me, but I got off it by telling him I did not smoke—he said it was a real <hi rend="italic">meerschaum,</hi> and very good, but it was not—he gave me four shillings for the indigo—his wife came out of the parlour, and asked me whether I could get her any saffron; I said I would see—she said, "Because I use it for colouring my soup"—I said, "What! instead of tur<lb></lb>meric?"—she said, "Yes"—saffron is 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb.—be said he would give me a very good price, fourpence an ounce—I don't know the price of turmeric—next afternoon I went to my master's—I had to clean the place up—I did not get any saffron—I looked in the drawers, and came across the cochineal drawer—I took 4lbs. of cochineal, and took it to Barnett—I said he must give me a good price, for it was very high in the market (the price in the market was from 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.; my master had sold some that morning at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)—Barnett gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb., telling me that it did not fetch more than half a crown in the market—next day I stole 5lbs. more of indigo, and took it to Barnett—he said, "You are going on anyhow; you are bringing it like a maid drinks"—I said I could not do any better; I was insolent to him, but I don't recollect the words I said—he said, "Watch it, how you are going on, for I will <hi rend="italic">split</hi>"—I forgot to mention that, when I was up at the court; I was flurried—on Thursday morning, Dec. 1st., I stole some more indigo from another box, called the square box—I think it was 10lbs.; I did not weigh it—I cut some slits in the lining of my coat, and put it between the lining and the cloth—I then went into the counting-house, and Mr. Appel the clerk laid hold of me by the pocket, and found what I had got—something then passed between me and my master, and while he went out for an officer I helped Mr. Appel to mark the indigo with "A," his initial—I then put them into the bags again—I left one bag there, and took the other, which weighed 6lbs., to Barnett (the bags were what I carried my ground-bait in when I went fishing)—the officers in plain clothes walked behind me—Barnett was standing at the door—I went in, took the bag out of my pocket, and gave</p>

               <p>it to him—he took it behind the counter, where the scales were usually kept and gave me four shillings, which I kept in my right hand—I only had one penny in my pocket and a pipe—I went out and took off my cap, which the officer had told me to do for him <hi rend="italic">to</hi> see which house I came out of—I gave the money to Trew.</p>

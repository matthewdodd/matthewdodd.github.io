               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300120"></xptr>Q. Was there any light in the room? - He had got a light in his hand; I had not the presence of mind to see then whether I was robbed or not; he said, how are you? that was what passed at the present time; in the morning when I awaked I found myself robbed of all my money, except half a crown, and sixpence, and some halfpence, which was twenty guineas, and a five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else sleep in the room? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find your breeches in the morning? - I found them by my bed side taken from under my bolster.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when you went to bed? - Under my bolster; I alarmed the house in the morning when I found myself robbed; I stated the business to the landlord what happened, and he told me that after I had gone to bed a man came up stairs, and the person came down again, and as such he suspected that this man might have robbed his house; I asked him why he did not stop that man? I told him he came up stairs, and came into my room; he said he came up for he thought the sheets might have gone off the bed; I asked him why he did not acquaint me of the business when he came into my room? he said the reason was that he was afraid that I should have no rest afterwards, supposing I found myself robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your money or note? - No, I came down in the morning, and when I was talking to him about the business, I told him I thought it was an odd kind of business, and he said he would go with me to seek about it, but I thought it was best to drop the acquaintace.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You are a carpenter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by these twenty-three guineas and five pound note? - I had it of Mr. Holland. I had saved it with him; I put all my money in my fob when I came from Southend.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in Mr. Holland's service saving this money? - Six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it you had left Mr. Holland? - About ten weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was you worth when you left him? - As nigh as I can tell I might have three, or four and thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay you any money at the time you parted with him? - I had twenty nine shillings and two-pence a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did Mr. Holland pay you the last week? - He paid me one pound nine shillings and two pence, the week's wages; I was foreman of the carpenters and joiners; he paid me not himself, but his clerk paid me this money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he paid you the money before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you live? - I boarded myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might your board and lodging cost? - Sometimes seven or eight shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you live on that? - Sometimes I had a pint or two; I was paid the first part of the summer for two extradinary days.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you applied to Mr. Holland? - I applied to Mr. Holland last Sunday, to state the business to him, and he desired me to go to Sir Sampson Wright; I saw Mr. Holland this morning, and he said he misunderstood me.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know what you said to Mr. Holland when you first applied to him? - I stated the business to Mr. Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask Mr. Holland whether you could or could not recover the money against the landlord of the house, in which you was robbed? - No, sir, I did not ask Mr. Holland about it; I stated the business to Mr. Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask Mr. Holland whether you could not recover the money? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300121"></xptr>Q. Did you say any thing to that purpose? it is last Sunday only; now I ask you if the purpose of your business to Mr. Holland, was not to know whether you could get that money of the landlord by an action? - Not to my knowledge; Mr. Holland told me to go up to the office, and he told me that I could take the common law, if I could not do any thing else in the affair, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never ask him whether you could ever recover or get any money of this man at the bar? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a single man or a married man? - A single man; I have got a mother to support.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you work with any body now? - I have got a rupture; I am waiting to go with a gentleman abroad. When I left that employ at Southend I went down to Suffolk.</p>
               <p>Q. So you was ten weeks out of employ? - No, I worked some few jobbs for myself at Suffolk.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the name of any one person that you have done any work for in the last ten weeks? - I did some work for

               <p>Q. Then on Thursday night it was you lodged the first time at this gentleman's house? - Yes, this second time. On Friday night I slept there again, and also on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sleep in the same room? - Yes; the lock and key was in the same state the first night as at the last, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to Mr. Husband? - I thought this Mr. Nicholson's name was Mr. Husband.</p>
               <p>Q. The first person you stated this business to was Mr. Holland. Now what was it you said to Mr. Holland? - I stated the business in what manner I had been robbed; Mr. Holland said to me, you must go up to Sir Sampson Wright's, and if you could not do any good there perhaps you may take the common law of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you told at that house, that there had been a man there that evening, that had bilked the man at the bar, and run away? - He stated that business to me in the morning himself, and I asked him why he did not speak to me?</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of enquiry did you make about this business? - When I came down I stated the business to the landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons there? - I don't know that there were any other persons there, but the maid, the mistress might be in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see a person in the house the over night, that very night? - Not that I suspected of any kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300122"></xptr>you spoke to them or not? - There might be another man.</p>

               <p>Q. Who had you the note of? - Of one of Mr. Holland's clerks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say that you had that note of one of Mr. Holland's clerks about nine weeks ago? - No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you say to Mr. Stirling, the attorney, Craven-street, that you took the note about five or six months ago? - I never saw the man to my knowledge in my life.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Can you swear you did not? it was but last Saturday, just a week from this day that you was robbed? - I might say I had the note, I cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>Q.This was on Thursday last you saw this gentleman. On your oath did not you say that you had that bank note five or six months ago? - Not to my knowledge, I might say it to some gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not you say so to that gentleman? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, man, you must know what you said the day before yesterday.</p>
               <p>Court. Swear Mr. Stirling, and ask him that question.</p>
               <p>- STIRLING sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw this man at Bow-street on Thursday last, I asked him if he could tell me the number of the note, in order that it might be traced; he told me then that he could not tell the number, that he had had the note between five and six months; I am very positive these were the words, and more than that I repeated them to Mr. Roberts, and several gentlemen that were in the office at Bow street. This was on Thursday in the morning.</p>

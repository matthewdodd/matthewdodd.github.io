                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Red Lion, St. George's-in—the East. On 28th June the prisoner came about half-past 8 o'clock in the evening—he asked for half a quartern of gin, I served him—he threw down a shilling; I looked at it, took it up, and tried it with my teeth—I told him it was a bad one, and he then threw down a half crown, and said, "Take it out of that"—I examined that with my teeth, found it was bad, and sent for a policeman—the prisoner walked out—I gave the policeman a description of the prisoner, and he went and brought him back—he was the same man—I gave him in charge, with the shilling and half crown.</p>

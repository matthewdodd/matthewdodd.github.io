My suspicions were excited by a person endeavouring to keep pace with me. I was going to look round at him, when he started, and ran by me. I immediately put my hand to my pocket, and missed my handkerchief. I ran after the man who had passed me. He turned up Brownlow-street, and as he turned I saw him throw my handkerchief down. Some persons who were coming down the street, put themselves in his way. He endeavoured to turn back again into Holborn - I laid hold of him, and took him to the office. Almost at that instant my handkerchief was put into my hand. I am certain he is the man who threw it away-nobody came between us all the time.</p>

            . I am the wife of James Dawes. I went out in the afternoon of the 14th of February - I had left the handkerchief, pocket-book, and money in bed with my husband - there were six sovereigns and a half in the handkerchief, which was wrapped round the pocketbook - I returned about seven o'clock, heard of this loss, and was three days and nights in pursuit of the prisoner; she did not return to the house at all - she had given me no notice whatever of her going - the man, she lived with, is still in our house; his name is William Williams - I found the prisoner in Giltspur-street Compter - my husband had been ill a long time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For what purpose did you go out? A. I went for relief, for some money; it was a gift which had been left by some gentleman for the poor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have represented yourself as a poor person? A. I could not consider myself very rich, having two children and a sick husband - I did not know what money my husband had got - I took the handkerchief out of the chest the day before - I gave it to my husband about an hour before I went out - I had kept it in my pocket till then, but never opened the pocket-book.</p>

            . I keep the Queen's Head public-house, Darkhouse-lane, Billingsgate. The prisoner came to my house on the 14th of February, and was taken into custody the same night - I think it was the 14th; she came about twelve o'clock at night, and asked for the Gravesend boat, saying she was going there; I told her there was a boat going about five o'clock; she said she had been robbed of a 20l. note, or had lost one - she appeared rather in liquor; I saw her take a 20l. note from her bosom, and twenty-two sovereigns and a half out of her pocket; I saw them, and counted them in my hand; when she asked for the Gravesend boat, I asked her what was the name of it; she said she wanted to go to an East India ship, and mentioned a name - I knew no such ship of that name, though I have lived at Gravesend twenty years - Manning, the officer, had brought her to my house at first to show her where the Gravesend boats went from, and when I saw she had so much money I told the officer I thought there had been a robbery committed, and we had better take the money from her and have her apprehended in the morning; she went to bed at my house; I got the money and note from her before she went to bed - it was placed in my hands; the next morning I had her taken into custody; my servant gave the money and note to Manning in the morning - he took her in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the name of the ship she asked for? A. The Hogarth, or some such name, an East Indiaman; I knew no such ship lay at Gravesend at that time - she was rather intoxicated; I mentioned my suspicions before her, before she went bed, and took the money from her - we bolted her into the bed-room, so that she could not get out; I left the money at the bar in care of my wife, to give the servant, who gave it to the patrol; they are not here.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the night of the 14th of February I saw the prisoner get out of a hackneycoach in Thames-street; the coachman asked, in her presence, if I knew where the Gravesend boats went from; I said from Darkhouse-lane; she asked me to show her the house; I took her to the Queen's Head, and told her they went from there - I left her there - I was called back in a minute or two, and saw her with a number of sovereigns in her hand - I asked where she got all that money, and said I thought she had more money than wit; she said she had more money than that; and putting her hand in her bosom, took out some loose papers, among which was a 20l. Bank of England note; she put her hand in her bosom again, and began to cry, saying she had lost a 20l. note; she said she had four, or more notes - I asked how she came by so much money; she said her father had sent it to her from Coventry, that she might appear decent to see her brother, who was then at Gravesend, at a ship - I counted twenty-two sovereigns and a half, and a 20l. note into the landlord's hands, and he put them away - the prisoner went up to bed before I left - I went in the morning, and took her to the Compter - I then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050009"></xptr>returned for the money, and the Alderman ordered it into the care of Brand the marshalsman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who did you receive the money from in the morning? A.

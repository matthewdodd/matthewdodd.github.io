               <p>about ten o'clock at night, the prisoner and another person came to my house—they called for a pint of half-and-half—I served them—the prisoner tendered me a sovereign for it—I said I could not change it, for I had con<lb></lb>verted all my silver into gold—he said, "Give me two half-sovereigns," which I did—I can swear that they were good—the other man said, "What is the use of that? I have some halfpence; I can pay for it"—he did pay for it, and then the prisoner returned me two half-sovereigns, and took up his sovereign—he had a cigar and went away—I put the two half-sovereigns in my left-hand trowsers pocket—I had two sovereigns there, but no other half-sovereign—I had no other half-sovereign in the house at all—about eleven o'clock that night I saw the prisoner being taken into custody, and I then looked at the half-sovereigns, and found one of them was bad—I can take my oath it was not one of the half-sovereigns which I had given him—I kept it by itself, and gave it to the officer the same evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cigar-dealer, and live in Camden-town. On 19th April, the prisoner came to my shop with another man who had a cap on—I did not take particular notice of the man—the prisoner asked for half an ounce of tobacco—he put down 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him it was a farthing more—he said, "Well, you must give me change for a sovereign"—he put down a good sovereign—the other man said, "Don't change; I have got some coppers"—he then took the sovereign up—he then said, "Never mind, give me change," and he gave me a bad sovereign—it was much lighter than the other—the one he gave me first was a good one, I am certain—when he gave me the other I went round the counter, and the prisoner and the other man ran off different ways—I ran and took the prisoner—I had the sovereign in my hand all the time—the prisoner wanted to snatch it from me, and the policeman caught hold of his arm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did the other man do in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He only said, "Don't change"—I did not take notice of him—he had a cap on—I am quite sure he did not do anything with the sovereign—it was the prisoner gave me the sovereign—I think the last was not the same by the feel—I did not observe of what reign it was.</p>

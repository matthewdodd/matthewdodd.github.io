               <p>TIMOTHY SULLIVAN sworn. - I am porter to Mr. Barnfield: Yesterday morning the prisoner came to my master's shop with a load of salt; I went into the warehouse, and brought out some hard soap; I put four cakes of soap down; and when the prisoner had done unloading his salt, he asked me to let him go to our back place; and while he was gone, I called the shopman down stairs to give him the money; he was paid, and went away; I missed the soap; I went after him, and charged him with taking a cake of soap of my master's; he asked me how I came to think of that; he came back with me to my master's door, and then he said he would give me the soap if I would not say any thing to my master about it; he then put his hand under his apron, and took out a cake of soap in two halves; I delivered it to the constable.(Thomas Sapwell, the constable, produced the soap.)</p>

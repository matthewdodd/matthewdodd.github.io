On the 5th or 6th of September I hired the prisoner to assist me in the bar; he left me on the Thursday previous to the 6th of November, and left his direction with my wife, at Mr. Barber's, a grocer, in Gray's Inn-lane. I went there on the 6th of November, with a constable - we waited till the prisoner came there, and I gave him in charge - he was searched. I went to the same place afterwards, and found this shirt, which is mine - it had my initials on it, but they are not here now; I had six of them, and this is one - it appears exactly the same to a thread. I missed it six weeks previous to the 6th of November - I have the other five at home.</p>

            . I made this shirt, and marked it, but the mark is not here now - I did not put any buttons to it. I received six shirts together in the course of the summer, which Mrs. Eade had begun, but gave them me to finish. I made four of them, and have got the other two now.</p>

            . My sister gave up this shirt to Mr. Eade - the prisoner had brought it up that morning, and said it was his dirty linen. I threw it on a box, and it remained there till the officer came; the prisoner had not been living at Mr. Barber's, but at Mr. Eade's - he had asked me to button it, and mark it for him, which I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How soon after it was left did the officer come? A. In about an hour; it was about six weeks before when he left it for me to mark and button, and it then appeared quite new. I do not think that it was possible that a mark could have been ripped out without some trace being seen; there is not the least trace of any mark there. I did not ask him how he got it.</p>

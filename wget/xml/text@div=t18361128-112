                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Thomas Kirby, a linen-draper, in Church-street, Shoreditch. On the 23rd of November the three pri<lb></lb>soners came into our shop together, and asked to look at some dresses—I showed them some—I saw Mack take a green dress off the counter, and</p>

               <p>put it under her cloak—I told her she had got a dress—she said she had not—Denton asked me to show her a remnant of print—I called my father, who sold them one, which Denton paid for—they then went out—my father went after them, and brought back Mack and Westbrook—I saw Denton run away directly my father caught hold of the other two—he afterwards found her and brought her back—my mother took Denton and Westbrook into the back room—Mack refused to be searched, and told my mother to leave her alone—I saw these two dresses drop from Mack's cloak on the floor—I picked them up, and my father delivered them to the sergeant who came in.</p>

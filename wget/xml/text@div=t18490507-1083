On 29th March, about nine o'clock "at night, I saw the prisoners and a boy named Pearce going into Leech's shop—Pearce had something on his shoulder, and Jeffs something in his arms, with a piece of rag over it—Hurd stood outside; Jeffs and Pearce went in—I asked Hurd what they had got—he said, "A lot of kitchen fat and lead"—I asked him if he was going to have half of it—he said, "Yes"—I asked where they got it from—he said he did not know—I looked through the window, and saw Leech behind the counter; there was a light in the shop; I saw Pearce turn some kitchen fat out of a bag into a scale—I went away, came back, and saw Leech bending some lead behind the counter, and saw him give Jeffs some silver and copper—Hurd stood with his back to the window—I told him Leech was giving them some money—he said, "How much?"—I said, "Silver and copper."</p>

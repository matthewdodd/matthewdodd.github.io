            , who is a baker, and lives in Broadway, Blackfriars. On the 22d of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for a half-quartern loaf, which came to 5 1/2 d., she offered me a shilling, which I refused, telling her it was very bad, and that if she came into my shop again I would send her to prison. Two officers came in with a woman named Brown - the shilling she offered me fell down from the counter, and they picked it up.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 22d of October I was in Aldersgate-street, and saw the prisoner within two doors of Spooner's shop, the cheesemonger - a woman named Brown was in his shop; Mr. Spooner was rubbing a shilling on marble. I went in, and had some conversation with him; the prisoner was walking backwards and forwards, and looking towards the window. Brown came out, and joined the prisoner immediately. I followed them to St. Martin's le Grand; they stopped, and looked in at several shops. I met Allen; we followed them to Warwick-lane; they stopped in a dark place there, and had some conversation together. Brown went into a baker's shop, and bought a penny roll, the prisoner waited for her about twenty yards off; they joined again, and I followed them to Broadway, Blackfriars - they stopped at the corner of Shoemaker-row, opposite Hawkes's shop, the prisoner went in, Allen followed her, and I seized Brown by both hands, and took her into the shop. In crossing the road I felt a bag in her left hand - she threw something from her right hand, which sounded like bad coin. I found a bad shilling in her pocket, and three good shillings, and three sixpences concealed in a bag - the good shillings were separate. I then searched the prisoner, and found 1 s. 1 d. in copper on her. I also found a bad shilling where I heard the money drop; I think more fell. I found about a quarter of a pound of soap on her, which had never been used. The bill was thrown out against Brown.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in Aldersgate-street. On the 22d of October, Brown came into my shop, bought a quarter of a pound of butter, and offered me a counterfeit shilling, which I refused. She went away, leaving the butter. Clinton came in in a minute after.</p>

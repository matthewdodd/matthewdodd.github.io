I cannot swear whether the box was locked or not; the wearing apparel in the box was all safe.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss the watch?</p>
               <p>Chantry. I missed it about the 17th or 18th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lodged with you?</p>
               <p>Chantry. About eight or nine weeks, and went away the very day I missed the watch. When I said I would go and fetch it down, then he ran away, and I found him in Broad St. Giles's on the 20th of May: I asked him how he came to take the watch? he said, he did take it, and had sold it to Mr. Cox's brewer, or cooper, where I found it.

The prisoner came to my house with this watch, and asked me if I would buy it; he asked me 50 s. for it; I bought it for two guineas: he said he sold it for need, wanting to buy some cloaths: this was two or three days before the prisoner was taken up.

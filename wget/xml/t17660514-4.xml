They could not pay the rent, I bid them get out; they locked up the door and took the key with them; after which I broke the door open, and found the bolster was gone, the bed had the feathers taken out of it, and a pair of new sheets were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lett these things with the room.</p>
               <p>Whitaker. I did, I found him the 4th of this instant May, and charged him with taking the things; at first he said his wife carried them away, and he did not know where she was. I took him before a Justice; going along, he owned he had been a partaker of the money made of the things; he confessed before the Justice, he pledged the sheets. I have never found any of the things.</p>

               <p>To his character.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Austin. I have know the prisoner 12 years, he has worked 6 years for us; my husband is not well, or he had been here. We live in Wood's-close; my husband is a salesman, and keeps carts; the prisoner used to go with them, go on errands, and do little menial offices about the house; sometimes he has been trusted with money 20 or 30 l. at a time; he is a very honest inoffensive simple man; I always thought him an honest man. His wife used to use the poor man very badly.</p>

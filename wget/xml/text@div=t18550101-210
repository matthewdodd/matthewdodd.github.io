On Saturday evening, 16th Dec., I saw the prisoner John in Mr. Chappie's shop—I watched him—he came out, and joined Jane—they went down the Edgware-road, to John-street, into Crawford-street, and on to Upper Baker street—John there went into a greengrocer's shop, and bought some potatoes—I saw him come out, and one of my fellow-constables went in—when John came out he joined Jane again—the other constable then came out of the shop, and he and I jointly took the two prisoners—I found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 3 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on John, all good, and he had a basket, and some herrings and potatoes—when he was taken he said, "Oh, dear, I have done it for life! but don't hurt the poor woman, for I have brought her into it"—I asked Jane where the stockings were that her husband had bought—she took them out of her pocket, and said, "Here they are"—these are them.</p>

I was near the greengrocer's shop in Baker-street, on that night—I saw John Jolly come out of the shop, and join Jane—I took Jane into custody—I noticed she had something in her hand—I asked her what she had got in her hand; she said, "Nothing"—she put her hand behind her, and threw a shilling on the ground—I picked it up—it was bad—this is it—I then opened her hand, and found one shilling, one sixpence, and 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the halfpence were good, the shilling and sixpence were bad—I took her to the station, and she took a canvas bag from her pocket containing seven sixpences, three shillings, and a half crown, all bad—when I took her she said, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Johnny</hi>, it is not my fault, you dragged me out"—and he said, "I ought to be hung."</p>

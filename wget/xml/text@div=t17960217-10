               <p>Q. Were they in the wash-house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of the Public-office, Worship-street: On Tuesday, the 19th of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, my neighbour, Mr. Gooch, came to my house, to tell me, that there had been three men at his house offering some copper to sell that he suspected was stole; I enquired which way they went; and I went directly towards Shoreditch church; and in Mr. Mason's house, who keeps an iron shop, I saw some copper in the scale; Mr. Mason would know where they got it, before he paid for it; the man, then, was running out of doors; I was coming in at the very instant, and caught him in my arms; that was the prisoner North, the middle man; I did not stand to talk with him, but gave him in custody to the man that keeps the Ship, who is an officer, and I went round the corner of Kingsland-road, and saw the stout man, Mills, skulking round the corner; I laid hold of him, and said to him, I have got your partner, I believe, you must go with me; I took him directly to the iron shop, where North was, and sent for the man who gave me the information, to know whether that was one of the parties concerned, before I confined him; he said, he was; then I handcussed them together; and went out, to look for the other man, just by Shoreditch church gates; I saw the other man, Fry, with a black bag upon his shoulder; I asked him, what he had there; he said, why my own property; says I, I don't know that; but, says he, I can prove it to be my property, and I can prove where I bought it; then, says I, you must go with me, and prove that before the Magistrate; and I took him, and put him in the watch-house; they were all put in the watch-house, and locked up, till the Magistrate sat; I have had the things in my possession; in the bag was part of a copper, and a copper pot without a handle.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the copper that was at Mr. Mason's shop? - A. I had that in another bag; he and I put it into the bag, in his own shop, out of the scale; that was a part of a copper, and a stewpan.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it been in your custody ever since? - A. Yes. (producing them).</p>
               <p>Simpson. This is my pot, here is a piece rivetted on the side; the stew-pan is knocked to pieces in such a manner, that there is no mark I can speak to; but I believe it to be my property.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Simpson. This is my pot; I cannot say any thing to the stew pan, it is knocked to pieces so, and there is no mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mrs. Simpson). What is the mark upon that pot? - A. A part of the side rivetted on.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a pot that has been mended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark of your's upon it? - A. No; it is a pot I have had in use a great many years, that makes me know it.</p>
               <p>Q.Any person that has a pot that has seen many years service, would have it mended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it a pot of the same size with that you lost? - A. It is; I have no doubt but it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this pot loose in the brick work? - A. No; it was a fixture.</p>

               <p>I went to the apartment, on Saturday, the 23d of January, of Mills, in company with Ray, another officer, belonging to the same office, between five and six in the evening, situated at No. 2, in the Causeway, Limehouse; we enquired below stairs for the name, and I found a dark lanthorn there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How do you know it was his apartment? - A. By the directions that Mills gave to the Magistrate; as soon as I got in the room, I found a dark lanthorn, and a bayonet was found, by Ray, and delivered to me.</p>
               <p>- FERRIS sworn.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday, the 19th, I searched the apartments of Fry and North; and in North's lodgings I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170016"></xptr>this dark lanthorn with a bit of candle in it; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Miils' defence. On Tuesday morning I was going to Barnet; I overtook Fry and North upon the road; they had just picked up those two bundles, and told me they were going to sell it; and they asked me, if I would go and have some beer with them; that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>North's defence. On Tuesday morning I got up and called Fry up to go to work along with me; going along the road, we saw two bundles lay in the field, by the road, and we took them up and turned them out of the bags, and we saw it was copper, and went to the first place we came to, to sell it: the man would not buy it, and we went to the next shop and the man stopped us.</p>
               <p>Fry's defence. We found it, going along the road to work, at Limehouse.(North called two witnesses, who gave him a good character).</p>

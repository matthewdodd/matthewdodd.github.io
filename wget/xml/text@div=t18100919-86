               <p>Q. In the month of August last, had you purchased any wine of your wine merchant - A. I had given orders for ten pipes of port wine to be delivered on the 16th of August, the ninth pipe was delivered, the cellarman bottled it and lackered it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who stacked it - A. Hughes, the cellarman of Messrs. Gray and Burcham, wine merchants. In consequence of information that the prisoner had been tipsey, I went into the prisoners room, I found a number of lacquered corks laying about, all of which seemed to be drawn with cork screws; I found a bottle of port wine in his room in the grate with a lacquered cork. I challenged him with having secreted it, he denied it; I searched further and found in a drawer that he used in his room another bottle of port wine, under the bed I found eighteen bottles of port wine, and nine more under the side of the bed. He then confessed that he had taken them, and hoped I would be merciful; I then desired to have his box searched, his box was locked, he refused opening it, upon which I told him if he did not, I should send him to the watch-house, lock up the room, and obtain a warrant, in consequence of that he opened the box, I found four bottles of Madeira wine, similar in flavour to that which I have, which I believe to be my own, I found a pocket-handkerchief belonging to me, and one to Lady Charlotte, one I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this you ordered two of your servants to set up with him that night - A. I did, and from information of others I saw more bottles.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Dennis gave me an old coat, after I had it a week or a fortnight, I was going to give the coat to some poor boy, I found that handkerchief in it, I put it into my box, I had not an opportunity of giving it to Mr. Dennis; I experience some consolation when I reflect it is not insinuated that I purloined this wine with intention to sell it.</p>

               <p>Q. Where had you been to?</p>
               <p>Hinchcliffe. I had been to a house of my father's at Epping, and I was returning home. I was stopt by three persons, one was shorter a good deal than the other two *; I could not tell whether he was a short man or a boy; one held the horse's head, and the others came one on each of me.</p>
               <p>* Earle is but about fourteen years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Who held the horse's head?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177210210009"></xptr>Hinchcliffe. One of the all ones; I fancy it must be Lewis. Then Murphy bid me deliver my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was Murphy?</p>
               <p>Hinchcliffe. I remember his person; I am very clear he is the man. I told him I had none, but I would give him my watch if he would not use me ill, I gave it him. It was a silver watch. Murphy held a pistol to my head, and said, might that be my destruction if I prosecuted them. I told them I would not, and then they all three made off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of Earle?</p>
               <p>Hinchcliffe. I think he was one, but I can't be positive of him; if he was he was on the other side of the chaise. I went home, and then I went to a public house where my father's men were drinking; I told them of it. Two of them got into the chaise and went back with an intent to be stopt, and if they were to take them.

            . I keep the Duke of Grafton's Head, a public house in Tottenham-court Road; when this happened, Count and Steadman came into my house; Count told me their master's son had been robbed, and asked me to go with them; I did; they were in a one horse chaise; I ordered my man to bring my horse out; I took a pair of pistols with me; and I went before them through the Turnpike. As I came up by Battle-bridge, near Grays-Inn-lane-road, I saw three men peeping through the rails; I went past them a good way; when I supposed I was out of their sight, I dismounted, pulled out a handkerchief, and tied it to my bridle, and led my horse, so that he was my screen. I saw Murphy, Earle, and Lewis together. I heard them talk how they would attack the chaise, which was then in sight; I was then about as near to them as the length of the Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they see your horse?</p>
               <p>Plenius. Yes, they might, I suppose; they took it to be a stray horse. I accompanied them in this manner thirty or forty roods; the chaise was in the new road, a good way off towards Paddington; one of them swore a bitter oath; he said d - n your eyes, there is a carriage comming, mind how you come on, the first that resists shoot him; they were on foot; they panted; Lewis went in the middle of the road, Earle went outside of the rails in the foot path, and Murphy about three or four yards before him; there is a Turnpike facing Grays-Inn-lane-road. I pulled off my handkerchief and mounted; I turned round the corner at the Turnpike house; the chaise was then about twice the length of this court distant; then Lewis laid hold of the bridle; Murphy went on the left side of the chaise, and Earle on the right side, and demanded their money or their life; I saw Steadman, who sat in the chaise, give Murphy a cut; Earle received a cut from Count, by which, he fell to the ground; he then said D - n you, why don't you fire? upon that, Lewis fired; they were all three in a heap upon the ground; I fired at Lewis immediately; when they found we had fire arms, they began to run; I bid Steadman take care of Earle, and I said I would pursue the others; I did: Murphy got under the rails into the field, so I followed Lewis; I threw him down with my horse; I kept him there till some of our people came up, and secured him; as soon as Lewis fired, he threw his pistol into the field; it was found there two or three days after; I took Lewis and Earle to my house, which is about a quarter of a mile off. I found some powder upon Earle; I asked Earle about the robbery that had been committed about an hour before; Earle said that he knew about it, but the man who had the watch was gone; that was what he said. This was Saturday night; it was about eight days after, when I saw Murphy; he passed the street at their examination; Hinchcliffe said, there is the man that robbed me; I told Mr. Welch what he said; I went out and brought him in; that was Murphy; I am positive he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177210210010"></xptr> is the man I saw attack the chaise; I charged him with the robbery; he said he knew nothing about it; I told the justice, if he was the person, he had a cut upon the shoulder; the Justice bid him pull off his great coat; he was very loth to do it; the Justice made him pull it off, and there was a cut through his coat and waistcoat, and also in his flesh.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Earle say any thing before the Justice about this robbery?</p>
               <p>Plenius. No: he said he had been at Bartholomew-fair, and the powder was to blow the sausage womens pans up.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Hinchcliffe; young Mr. Hinchcliffe came in on Saturday night, near eight o'clock, on the 5th of September, and said he had been robbed of his watch; Mr. Count and I went in pursuit of them; we called at Mr. Plenius in Tottenham-court road; he went with us; we apprehended Earle and Lewis; they were carried to Mr. Plenius's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing said by Earle or Lewis about the robbery?</p>
               <p>Steadman. No; Earle was that night; at the Middlesex Hospital (he was cut in his head so we took him to the Hospital) I said to him, you young dog where is the watch? he said the person that we did not take, had got it; I talked to him all the way to the hospital; he would not tell me any thing, till he came to the hospital; he bled pretty much, and was very sore; he thought he was dying I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about the robbery?</p>
               <p>Steadman. No; I believe Murphy is one that attacked us, I can't be certain of it, only that mark upon his shoulder, I am sensible I cut the man upon the shoulder; Count was with me when Earle spoke.</p>

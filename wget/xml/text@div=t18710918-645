I live at 200, St. George's Street, St. George's in-the-East, and am a tailor, outfitter, and boarding-house keeper—I have had business with Nelson—he is a boarding-house keeper—on Tuesday, 1st August, he brought me this advance note, marked "A"—he said he had a sailor shipped in that ship, and wanted me to cash the note for him—I said "All right, if the man goes in the ship I will give you the money," and I did give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he paid me off an account that he owed me, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for collecting it—he gave me an I O U for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that is the custom, in case the note should not be paid—when he brought the note to me it was properly signed—there was a mistake in the name of Nelson; it was spelt with "ie" instead of "e"—I made him aware of it, and he scratched it out—I can't say whether he wrote the other part—I went into my parlour to get the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and when I came out it was done—after obtaining the money he left—I saw him again next day, and said "I am under the impression that the man is shipping in another ship"—he said "Oh, no, the man is going in the ship; I shall take good care of that"—the I O U has not been paid.</p>

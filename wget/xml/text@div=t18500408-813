                  </hi>. I went upon a scaffold to the prisoner, on 2nd April, and asked him to furnish me with work—his answer was, "Go to b——, or else I will knock you off the scaffold"—I said, "That is more than you dare to do"—he moved away, and I followed him, and asked him whether there would be any chance of the men getting their money, and should I get my few halfpence—he then struck me, and I struck him—he got from me, picked up a brick, and threw it at me—it hit me on the forehead—I gave him in charge—I was taken to the hospital, and remained from Tuesday till Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Metropolitan Magistrates at Westminster Police' Court—on 1st June last I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at my Court—Realf; "Sir,—My object in sending you this letter is to put you upon your guard, and avert mischief. You have, some years ago, iniquitously and most unjustly condemned to a very heavy fine a very innocent youth; this was on a pretence of drunkenness, though at the evidence proved that he had not been drinking. Through this condemna<lb></lb>tion he lost a very profitable employment he had at the time, and has ever since been in difficulties, of which he is tired, and he has, therefore, taken the resolution of having his revenge upon' you, the cause of them. Yes, he is decided to have your life, unless you give him a fair compensation for all the trouble he has had through your injustice. My utmost has been done to calm him, and make him give up the idea of murder, but all has been in vain. To-morrow he is to leave for London, and if, in the course of next week, he does not find in one of the numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> newspaper an advertisement headed 'Compensation,' intimating your intention of giving damages for all he has suffered through your injustice, be has taken the catch that next Sunday you shall be dead. For your sake, then, heed this notice; save yourself by giving the justly-demanded compensation, or other<lb></lb>wise be will commit the deed. He is tired of the iniquities life your con<lb></lb>demnation has made his, and would prefer death. Suicide is a crime, he has often told me, but he would one day die by the hangman's help, and quite delighted to be revenged, and to have made you suffer for your base in<lb></lb>justice. I willingly would give you my name, to prove the sincerity of the notice, but your past behaviour to my friend shows you to be a dishonest old rascal, and I fear that if I did sign in name you would in a black<lb></lb>guardly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186910250082"></xptr>
               <p>guardly mannor, through foul means, use it to bring me before men of high authority, and oblige me to betray my friend that you may have him arrested and locked up, that you may save your mean self without giving any compen<lb></lb>tion for your base injustice. I, therefore, will end, and add that if you wish to live longer, the best is to give the said advertisement in the newspaper mentioned, and act fairly, without any treacherous, hidden intention, for which you would soon after suffer either directly or indirectly by the hands of your victim or of some of his friends, amongst whom is Your Forewarner, again advising you for your sake to notice this letter,' In consequence of that, I communicated with the police, and on the follow<lb></lb>ing day, 2nd June, by my direction, an advertisement was put in the Everything; <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>—this is a copy of it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Compensation.—Threats are quite unavailing, though if the facts are as stated, something perhaps might he done. What is asked?"—That appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard—on</hi> the 5th June, I received this letter, dated the 4th:—"Sir. This morning I have received a letter from the young man in whose behalf I have seat you my last, a also a number of the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard</hi> of the 2nd inst, the advertisement in which delighted me, in shewing that you are willing to compromise the matter in a friendly and honorable manner, which will prevent any unnecessary crime. My friend also expresses his satisfaction at hit finding it is thus. All facts are as stated in my last, but he thinks, that if you want convincing proofs to that effect, an interview would be more convenient. His financial less, all included, at the time of its occurrence, amounted to between: 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides the other damage he went through. At present, he is in very reduced circumstances, out of which, by a sum of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he could disentangle himself, and get in a position to earn respectably some money; a retribution to that amount, then, would satisfy him, for which, besides, he would ever be grateful, since it would put him in a situation to earn respectably his life, the only thing he longs for. Should you be willing to come to his terms, without further delay or intercourse, or should ye prefer an interview, to have convincing proofs of the veracity of the stated facts, please to let him know it by another advertisement, headed "Compensation," given before long in another number of the tame newspaper; and in the former instance you shall be respect<lb></lb>fully informed where to forward the said retribution, while in the second, my friend should wait upon you at the place and at the time appointed in the advertisement. He begged of me, in his letter, to send you all these particulars, because he told me he felt too nervous to write directly to you himself. I trust you will, in the present, find nothing offensive, and hoping that the friendly feelings, which at present seem to actuate you, shall not have altered at your reception of it. I conclude with the hope, that he and my friend, at present enemies, shall one day be good friends; and that then you will know who has been the party, who at present sending you his compliments, has taken the responsibility of Intervener in this matter,"—I received that also at my Court—the post-mark to both, is Jersey—I looked at the handwriting of the two letters, with a view of comparing them, and I have no doubt they arc in the same hand<lb></lb>writing—on 12th June, I caused another advertisement to be inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard</hi>—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Compensation. Facts should be given; an interview as suggested seems desirable, or references, will be at Freemason's Tavern, Great Queen Street, at 5.30 P.M., Wednesday next")—I next received this letter, with the post-master of</p>

               <p>Jorney, 13th June—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Sir. I have yesterday received a letter from the friend in whose name I have written; be expresses his surprise at seeing no reply in any number of the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard</hi> of this week, and damands me whether I have written to you according to his wish this week, or if I have sent ye my name and address, and received a direct reply. As this has not been the case, I beg of you on receiving the present to give without delay, in the newspaper, one of the replies demanded through my last letter, or if you find too high the damages demanded, through what ye offer. I would be sorry to see this other week pass on without a reply, became in suck a case I fear, from the content of the letter received as aforesaid, some mischief. If you have lost memory of the letter received by you on Monday last, I hope this one will refresh your memory. Com<lb></lb>pensation,' ye must not forget, is to be the heading of the advertisement, whatever may be the main part of it With complements, and the hope that this affair shall soon come to an end, believe me, air, yours; obediently, The Peacemaker")—I have no doubt that letter is in the same writing as the others—it was contained in this buff or brown envelope—on 16th June I caused another advertisement to be inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard,</hi> of which this is a copy (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Compensation. The appointment for the 16th instant is unavoidably postponed to the same time and place, Thursday, 17th instant")—On the 17th I went to the Freemasons' Tavern, between 5 or 6 clock in the afternoon, with Inspector Humphreys—I waited them some hours—no one came—I heard nothing more of the matter until 2 received a communication from Inspector Humphreys on the evening of the 27th Sep<lb></lb>tember, at my house—on the afternoon of the next day I received this letter at the Police Court, it bears the London pott-mark of September 28th—it came in this buff envelope, which seems to be of the same fabric as the other, and I have no doubt the handwriting is the sane as the other—I believe it to be the same handwriting, although I think the three former letters are in a disguised hand—I judge of that entirely from the appearance of the handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "6, Hawthorndean Place, Weft India Dock Road, Limehouse, 28th September, 1869.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). I received some information on Wednesday night, 28th September, in consequence of which I went to No 6, Hawthorne Place, Limehouse, about 10 o'clock—I had seen the letter of the 28th, with that address—I found the prisoner there, in bed and asleep—from what I heard I did not wake him—I left Constable Upson there in charge—I looked about the room in the presence of the landlady, and in a box there I found a quantity of writings, amongst others the manuscript produced—it is a portion of a dictionary—I also found in the same box two copies of the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard</hi> newspaper of June 12th and 16th, each <hi rend="italic">of</hi> which contain the advertisement headed "Compensation," one making the appointment and the other postponing it—they were the only two copies of the <hi rend="italic">Standard I</hi> found in the box—I also found in the box about a dozen of. these buff envelopes, of the same size and character as those containing the letter—I went again to the house, about 9.30 next morning, and then found the prisoner up and dressed—I told him that I should have to take aim, into custody for sending threatening letters to the Magistrate—he asked to. go upstairs—he was in the kitchen at the time—I went up with him into his room, where I had left him asleep the night before—he then opened his box, and I took first a small piece of paper—he said, "That is in my handwriting"—I said, "Well, I will take charge, of this"—he said, "You had better take more," and he gave me this portion of a dictionary which I have produced—he said, "That is in my handwriting, also"—I then left the house with him—on the way to the Court, he said, "I did not write the threatening letters to the Magistrate, the reason I wrote that letter to Mr. Arnold, was to tell him not to fear"—he afterwards. said, "About ten years ago I was fined about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Mr. Arnold"—after that he said that he had been writing a dictionary, and he had a great desire to publish it—he had paid, I think he said, a portion to a publisher, and he wanted some 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more before the publisher would take it in hand—he said the man that wrote the threatening letters resided at Pleasance Cottage, Jersey, and his name was Jackson—he was taken before the Magistrate the same morning and remanded, and eight days afterwards he was brought up for re-examination—I had in the meantime been <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Jersey to find Mr. Jackson—I found Pleasance Cottage, Mr. Jackson was</p>

I reside at 32, Lamotte Street, Jersey—I have lived there twenty-seven or twenty-eight years—I am a native of Jersey—I keep a boarding and day school—in 1866 I advertised for An assistant, and the prisoner came to me with testimonials—he was at my school for about a week—he had a fit, and I sent him home—about last Christmas he called on me with respect to a dictionary that he was writing, and asked me if I would subscribe—I said no, I would have nothing at all to do with him; and I have never seen him since—I believe his father lives in Jersey—I know nothing of these letters—they were not written by me or by my authority—I am about 6ft. in height.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lithographer, and carry on business at 25, Southampton Row, Russell Square—I have for some years made hand<lb></lb>writing a study—I have looked at the letter of 28th September (No. 4), and the envelope, and have carefully compared it with the other three—I have not the least doubt that they are all in the same handwriting—I have examined this portion of a dictionary with the admitted letters, and with the anonymous letters, and they are all in one handwriting—I am perfectly satisfied of it, without any doubt in the world—I can give very clear reasons for that opinion, if necessary.</p>

               <p>and plenty of material—it happened that I have been called and given an opinion, and another expert has given one directly the opposite—that is a very rare case—experts do not differ nearly so often as other professional men—I daresay it has happened two or three times to myself—I should say three times was quite the extent in twelve or fifteen years—these letters were first shown to me on Tuesday last, the three letters were put into my hands and another letter—the three were pointed out to me is being anonymous letters—and I was asked if the writing of No. 4 was the same—I was told what the person was charged with, and I knew I was to be called on the part of the Crown, to give evidence against him—I should like to give one or two of my reasons.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's statement before the Mcyutrava read at follow.</hi> "All I have to say is that I never had any feeling against Mr. Arnold. What gave so the idea of writing to him on the 28th was to obtain an interview with him, and to ask him if he remembered this occurrence of June, and he was not to be frightened; and I wanted to show him the papers I had that brought the circumstances to my mind, to refresh his memory, and to toll him to take no notice of these threatening letters, since I had nothing to do with them, and if he could not find the true author of them, he or I had been <hi rend="italic">chaffed;</hi> but not being able to find his private address, I came here and sought an interview with him, that I might expose, my mode of living, and having no weapons I intended no harm; besides which, I could have given him references to show I was not a man of a revengeful disposition; instead of receiving a reply I was taken up and charged, for wishing to relieve Mr. Arnold's mind. Yesterday week I wanted to explain all this to Mr. Arnold, but I was seized with a fit, and the consequence is I have been locked up a week, not knowing I could have bail, which bail I could have procured if I had been conscious when I was thrust into the prison-van, and taken to gaol"—(<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner took the envelopes and letters produced, and says,</hi> "They are not Mr. Jackson's writing at all, they have been humbugged."</p>

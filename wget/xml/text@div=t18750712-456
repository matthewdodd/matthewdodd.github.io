I am single—I keep the Brunswick Hotel, Hanover Square—on 17th June, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon the prisoner came and asked for a room—I let him the only one I had vacant; it was on the ground floor—he had a small portmanteau with him—there were six rooms on the ground floor appropriated to visitors, the other five were let, three of them were bed-rooms, they were let to a Mr. and Mrs. Roe, of Dundrum, Ireland—Mr. Roe is not here, he is nothing like the prisoner, he is very dark and has dark whiskers, his hair is nearly black and he has a great deal of it—there were no other persons on the ground floor—about 4 o'clock in the morning of the 18th, I was called up by Mrs. Bateman—I did not see the prisoner till about half-past 7 o'clock when he went out.</p>

I am a waiter at the hotel—I let in the prisoner on the night of the 17th about 11.55—he went to bed directly—I also let Mr. Bateman in—about 7 o'clock a constable came—just after I let the constable out at the front door, I saw the prisoner come to the front door to go out—I locked the door, and asked him in French if J could speak to him in his bed-room—I then asked him if he had been disturbed in the night—he said no—I said some one had been in the house, and asked him if he had been round about the house—he said no, he had been in bed all night—I said that Mrs. Bateman had found some man in her room about 4 o'clock in the morning, and from the description she gave of him, I came to the conclusion it was him—he got quite indignant of my accusing him of such a thing—I afterwards, with the constable, searched his portmanteau, and found in it a coloured shirt, dark holland drawers, and coloured socks. The shirt was a dark stripe, a dark mixture of tweed.</p>

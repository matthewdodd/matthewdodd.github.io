                  </hi>. I live in Castle-court, Westminster. I occupy the whole house—I have a wife, but no servant—I have one lodger—I went out on the 18th of March, at half-past eleven o'clock, with my wife—I fastened the door, and tied the back parlour window shutter with a string—I tricd the front door as I went out—I returned at a quarter</p>

               <p>before two o'clock, before my wife—I found my door wide open, which I had left locked with a latch key—it had been opened with a key—I went into the back yard and found the shutter down, which I had tied up—the string was left there, but it was undone—I saw Mrs. Agar, and in cones<lb></lb>quence of what she said I went into the bouse, and the pillow, pillow case, and bolster were gone—I afterwards missed a sheet and three wine glasses—I am sure those things were in the house when I went out—I helped my wife to make the bed just before I went out—the prisoner used to live at No. 14 in the same court, but was never in my house, to my know<lb></lb>ledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Great Chapel-street, Broadway, Westminster. I can see the back of Mr. Sheath's bouse from mine, quite well—on the 18th of March I saw the prisoner in the back yard of his house, between one and two o'clock, alone—I saw her take the shutter down and get in at the hack parlour window—it was open—in five or ten minutes after, I saw her come out again the same way, with two pillows and a bolster—she put them on the water butt in the yard, and went out at the back door—she went along the passage to the front door, and I did not see her afterwards—she could get to the front door inside—she had something white besides the other things, but I could not see what it was—I was up at my window at the time—I knew her before by sight, and am quite sure of her person—I said nothing to her—she did not use any force at all in getting the shutter down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furniture broker. On the 13th of March, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, a person (who I think to be the prisoner, but I could not swear to her) brought a bolster and two pillows, and asked if I would buy them—I asked what she wanted for them—she said 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked whether they were her own—she said they were—I said, "I don't know you; I will take your name and address"—she walked into the shop, and I took her name and address (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>) "Mrs. Marrabone, 26, Smith's-rents, March 13, 1837, bolster, &amp;c., for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I gave her two half-crowns and a shilling for it—I consider that is all they were worth—I think the prisoner is the person, but I cannot swear to her—I afterwards gave the articles to M'Carthy.</p>

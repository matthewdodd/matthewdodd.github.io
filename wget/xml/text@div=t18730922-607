                  </hi>. I am a corn merchant, in Upper Thames Street, in partnership with Mr. Sedgwick—the prisoner has been in our service three years as traveller—his duties were to solicit orders, collect moneys, and pay them in to us either the same day or the following morning—he was pro<lb></lb>vided with a book—this is it—there is no amount entered on 16th June as received from Mr. Riley—on 10th July there is an entry, not of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Riley—on 11th July there is no entry of 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Farmer—the prisoner has never paid me those two sums of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was in the service three or four weeks after 9th July—we then dis<lb></lb>charged him on discovering the first item of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I spoke to the prisoner about it, and he said there was some confusion in Riley's account—I after<lb></lb>wards discovered the other item, and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He solicited orders, and was paid a commission upon them when the accounts were paid in full—I first charged him with embezzling the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; at the same time I charged him with embezzling a sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that ought to have been paid in on 28th February, and we found</p>

               <p>a like amount entered on 3rd March, therefore we did not go into that—that was an amount due from a man named Dawes, who was paying by instalments—the prisoner had kept back that amount for three days—I don't know on what day he was discharged, I think it was the latter end of August—we theu wrote to his sureties for these two sums of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we afterwards applied for the 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not write, my partner did—I have only one partner, Mr. Sedgwick—he has a son who is a clerk, a young man, not our principal clerk—we have a stall at the Corn Exchange—we close there at 3 o'clock—it is a busy time at 3 o'clock—young Mr. Sedgwick is here—this memorandum book of the prisoner's shows the amounts of money received on various days—that book was taken from him when he was given in charge—he was not admitted to bail—we serve Mr. Maggs, of Dowgate Hill—our cash-book shows his payments—it is not here—any payments he would receive from Maggs should be in this book; the entries are in his writing, and are initialed—"W. K. S." are my partner's initials, "G. A. S." his son's, "J. S. S." our principal clerk's, and "P. S." another son of my partner's; he only assisted in his brother's absence, he is not regularly in our employ—every item received by the prisoner should be entered in this book, it was his own fault if it was not—he sometimes paid over money at our office in Upper Thames Street, and sometimes at the Corn Exchange—he had to solicit orders and we paid him a third of the profit upon such orders as he brought, together with a small salary—if there was a loss, his commission was deducted—our principal business is with corn dealers—the prisoner was town traveller, and had to go about to all parts of London—I heard that he called at the office after he was discharged, and my partner's son told me that he once saw him at the Corn Exchange—I never saw him, or I should have given him into custody—it was four or five weeks after he was discharged that he was given into custody—I gave him in charge—I met him in a court in Lombard Street, and he made some remark about his coming down to square accounts and so forth; however, I looked for a policeman, and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was the prisoner's duty to enter all moneys he received in this book, and when he paid in money to have it initialed by the person receiving it—we paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week salary in addition to a third of the profits—we found out this second item about three weeks after he was discharged.</p>

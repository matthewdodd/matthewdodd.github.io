               <p>Q. Why do you suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bevan. She us'd to come to my house for about a month before, and would usually sit on a bench in my passage, and say she was waiting for somebody: I went out on the 24th of May last, and saw the prisoner sitting there; my servant was then feeding the children with the silver spoons, and when I came home the spoons mentioned were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with your spoons again?</p>
               <p>Bevan. No, I never did, nor saw the prisoner 'till last Friday was a week; I ask'd her if she knew me ? she at first said she did not; but she soon own'd she had taken two silver spoons and gave them to a woman to pawn;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175902280003"></xptr> and if I would stay 'till next day at 10 or 11, she would go along with me and get them again.</p>

            . I have seen the prisoner several times at my master's, Mr. Bevan's house; I had been feeding the children, and had made use of both the silver spoons in the kitchen; the prisoner sat facing the bar; I washed the spoons, and put them in a drawer in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner so placed that she could see where you put them?</p>
               <p>Dun. Yes, she could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the drawer?</p>
               <p>Dun. No, I looked for them in about the value of ten minutes after she was gone, and I missed the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take them?</p>
               <p>Dun. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I us'd to chair for a midwife that liv'd near the prosecutor's; and when she was gone out she would not trust me in her house; so I us'd to go and stay at his house. I saw the spoons lying on the table and a tankard by them, but I never saw the girl put them into the drawer; I live just by, on Saffron-hill, and never absconded; had I been guilty, I should not have staid there. I was very much in liquor when he took me up, and do not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Q. to C. Dun. Was any body in your house at the time the spoons were taken?</p>
               <p>Dun. There were no body else but the people that belong to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was she in liquor when you took her up?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe she might be a little in liquor, but not very much.</p>

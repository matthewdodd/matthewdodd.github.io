                  </hi>. I am a gas-fitter, at 108, Fore-street, City—on 20th September, about a quarter to 9 in the evening, I was coming down Snow-hill with my wife and child—my wife was a few feet in advance of me; I had hold of my child's hand—I had my watch with me—as we came to the corner of George-yard, opposite a baker's shop, a man laid himself down across the pavement, with his feet in the gutter, and his head towards the shop window, leaving sufficient room for one person to pass between his head and the shop—the prisoner spoke to my wife; I came up at the time—he preteuded to be helping the man in the pretended fit, and as he spoke I heard a click, and saw my chain go—I turned round and said, "You vagabond" he said, "I have not got it, sir," and ran away through Fox and Knot-court into West-street—I did not lose sight of him a moment till I left him locked up—he ran into the policeman's arms—I am positive the prisoner is the man—I have not recovered my watch.</p>

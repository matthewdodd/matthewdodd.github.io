                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Chiswick—the prisoner was my servant. On the 16th of May I sent him to Strand-on-the-Green, to Mr. Jeffries and Mr. Heman with bills—he was to receive the money from them—he returned, and worked that week—on the 23rd I sent him out with bread, and to deliver bills again—he returned at half-past six o'clock—next morning I met him, and asked him where he was going, and he said he was going to send a man to do his work—he had not then paid me either of these sums.</p>

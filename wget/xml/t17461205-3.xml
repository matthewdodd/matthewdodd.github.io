            . What do you know of the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Starky. This Boy (the Prisoner) came into my Shop about Candle-light, and another Boy came presently after him; they asked for out of the Way Handkerchiefs; I am often attacked by them. I immediately suspected that they were Thieves. They asked for blue Birds-Eyes Handkerchiefs, which, perhaps, are not to be found in one Shop in fifty. They commonly ask for something that would puzzle our. They staid a little while, then went to the Door; and I stepped to the Door, upon the Rails I had some Handkerchiefs, and I immediately missed a Piece. One of the Boys being gone, I laid hold of the Prisoner, but he had not the Handkerchiefs. The Prisoner said, he knew nothing of it himself, but the Boy that was with him was whistling in the Street, and he would go after him; but I said I would secure him.</p>

            . One Thursday I was going by Mr Starky's Door; he told me, the Prisoner at the Bar had stolen some Handkerchiefs from him. The Boy cried, I asked him if he had any Money to buy Silk Handkerchiefs; he said he had not, but the other had, which he had received for his Week's Work: So he says to me, they are whistling in the Street, if you will go with me, I will take them both. Mr Starky did not know that there were two of them; so Mr Starky said, he had got him, and he would take Care of him.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner. What have you to say for yourself?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. A Lamp lighter in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields asked me to go with him to buy an Handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a banker's clerk, and live at Peckham. On 21st Nov., about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was going along the Old Kent-road—I had not observed the prosecutor's shop before, but I did on that occasion—while I was passing I saw the prisoner standing looking in at the window, and as I passed she turned round to watch me—I walked on, and in a minute or a minute and a half, she ran past me, carrying something in her arms—I ran after her, and after running 200 or 300 yards I came up to her and laid hold of her arm—she immediately threw these shawls down—I told her she must come back to the shop from which she took these shawls—she said, "I did not take them; I picked them up"—I asked her if she picked them up why she ran away so fast—she said she never ran at all—she was running; I was quite out of breath when I came up to her—I took her back, and the prosecutor gave her into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, carrying on business with my brother, in the Old Kent-road. On the evening of 21st Nov. the prisoner was brought to my shop, with these shawls, which had been hanging in the lobby—I had not sold any shawls of this description that day—my brother and two young men serve in my shop—I saw these shawls safe about two o'clock—neither of the persons in my shop sold so many shawls as these, if any were sold it would have been only one or two—they were tied in the lobby with a string.</p>

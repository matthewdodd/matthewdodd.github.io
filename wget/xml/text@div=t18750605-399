I am watchman at Brooks' Wharf, Upper Thames Street—a little before 6 o'clock on the morning of 12th May two barges called the <hi rend="italic">London</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Aldershot</hi> arrived there—Frostick had charge of the <hi rend="italic">London</hi> and Alford was in the <hi rend="italic">Aldershot</hi>—about four minutes after the barges came in, Rogers came to me at the top of the wharf and said "Watchman, I have <hi rend="italic">busted</hi> two buttons off behind my trowsers, would you be kind enough to tie them up"—I did so with a piece of string—I proceeded with him down to the wharf and he gave the men on board the barges instructions where to moor them—he is also a bargeman and foreman of the other two men—Rogers went on board the <hi rend="italic">London</hi> which was the nearest barge, but I did not lose sight of him—the barges were made fast and left in charge of their watchman and they left the wharf together—five minutes afterwards Alford came down to the wharf and went on board one of the barges—I saw the Detective Olley come down there about five minutes after Alford came down—he went on board the <hi rend="italic">London</hi>—I was on the wharf and saw him take Alford away in custody—he returned and I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Aldershot</hi> with him—he searched down in the cabin and in the water behind the pump he found three dozen pairs of gloves and three dozen bottles of scent.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I was near Brooks' what on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 12th May—a little before 6 o'clock I saw Rogers go along Thames Street down to the wharf—he stopped and spoke to the watchman, and I saw the watchman do something to his trowsers—I waited at the top of the wharf about five minutes when I saw the three prisoners, the watchman Baker, and the other watchman who was left in charge of the barges, come up together, to the King's Head and Lamb public-house where they stayed some little time—Baker came out first and went down on the wharf—the three prisoners and the other watchman came out about a minute after<lb></lb>wards—the three prisoners started towards Southwark Bridge—as soon as I saw that I crossed over the road to face them—Alford turned directly and ran down Brooks' wharf, Frostick crossed the road and Rogers proceeded on his way towards Southwark Bridge as fast as he could walk—I walked back and found Alford had run right down the wharf—I then followed Frostick up on to Southwark Bridge—as soon as he got there he ran across the road to. Rogers, who was on the bridge—as soon as they saw me Rogers began to swear about the other one staying behind and walked towards Thames Street again—I crossed in front of him—Rogers said "Good morning, sir," to me—I said "Good morning, I want to speak to you for a minute"—he said "I can't stop now" and he commenced to run—I said "You must stop."—he said "I shan't," and away he went as hard as he could run on to the bridge again—I followed him and he doubled back under my arms into Thames Street—he dodged me about in Thames Street till he got to Queenhithe where I overtook him—I caught him by the collar—we had a bit of a scuffle—two scavengers came to my assistance or I think he would have got away—he had a packet of a dozen gloves in his hand which he was about to throw away, but he did not—I took him to the station with the assistance of the scavengers, searched him and found another dozen—I asked him if he had got any more—he said that he had, and pulled out ten pairs and said that was all he had got—I found two pairs more on him, and three bottles of eau-de-cologne—I then went back to Brooks' wharf and saw Alford going along. Thames Street—I went after him and stopped him—I asked him if he had any gloves about him—he said "No"—I put my hand into his pocket and took out a pocket-book, and from his inside pocket a canvass bag—I took him to the station and searched him, but found nothing—I told him I knew he had had some gloves because I saw them in his pocket when he came up from Brooks' Wharf on the first occasion—I don't think he said anything to that—he might have said that I was mistaken, but I won't be positive—I searched the barge <hi rend="italic">London</hi> and afterwards the <hi rend="italic">Aldershot</hi>, in the cabin of the <hi rend="italic">Aldershot</hi>, under the floor in the water I found three dozen black kid gloves, and on a ledge just above three bottles of eau-de-cologns—I took them to the station, and Alford was asked whether he knew any<lb></lb>thing about them—he said that he did not—he gave his address to the inspector—I went there and found four packets of Berlin wool, twenty pairs of cotton gloves, and about 9 lbs. of composite candles—I took that property to the police-station and asked Alford how he accounted for the things being</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MOODY</hi>. I was not in uniform—Rogers lives in George Row, Bermondsey—he could go there from the wharf over South-wark Bridge, but I don't know whether it would be the nearest way—it was quite light at the time I saw him—I believe I have mentioned before to-day about seeing Baker, the watchman, come up the wharf—I heard Baker give his evidence to-day—I know Messrs. Wrightson's offices—they are opposite Billingsgate Market—I don't know what time they open—they are wharfingers, and those are the offices—I saw Rogers come up the wharf and go into the public-house with the others, but I had seen him before that—when they came out of the public-house Rogers walked as quickly as he could towards the bridge—I followed Frostick, and when I got on the bridge I saw, Rogers apparently waiting for him—Rogers called out to him that Alford had gone back to the wharf—I heard him say that—I did not say a word to Rogers about my being a police officer until the scavenger came to my assistance—at the station he pulled from his pocket the ten pairs of gloves, and I put my hand in and found the two pairs—I went to his house to make a search, but I found that Frostick had been there before me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. D. METCALFE</hi>.

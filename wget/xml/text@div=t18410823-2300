                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. John Powell, of Crosby-row. We dealt with Mr. Hayes, but do not now—I took in the bread—I always paid the prisoner regularly every day that he brought the bread—I do not re<lb></lb>member any particular date, but it was always paid regularly daily—if we had a quartern loaf on the 25th of January I paid for it—he was in the habit of bringing bread from the 25th to the 28th of January, and I am quite certain I paid him on every occasion—I generally took in a quartern loaf.</p>

He paid me money perhaps every day—some days he would say there was nothing paid—I looked through my accounts, and he has not paid me this—he has made Mr. Powell a weekly customer—these entries are made in his presence—I could not prosecute him before, as I never saw him after he absconded.</p>

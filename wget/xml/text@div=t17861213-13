               <p>Was it light then? - Yes Sir, it was moon-shine.</p>
               <p>Did you know her then? - No, I did not, she had a light coloured great coat on all over her; I thought it had been a man; I hallooed out and said, do you want to rob the house? and two patrols were going along, and they heard me, a nd came and stopped the prisoner before she got away from the place; then I came down stairs; we brought her in doors and went into the pantry, and found the pottage pot and saucepans all moved on the dresser; and two pottage pots, and two copper saucepans, and a tin cheese toaster, moved from under the dresser, and put in the sink under the window, ready to take out.</p>
               <p>Was the window shut or opened when you found it? - Wide open.</p>
               <p>Was the window large enough for any body to get out of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a casement window or a sash? - A casement window; and the pottage pot was put on the sill of the window, half in and half out; and her clothes were all smutty.</p>
               <p>Did you take such particular notice as to observe whether there were any marks that denoted her having been in the house? - There were some victuals eaten and drank.</p>
               <p>But I mean any marks of feet? - No, it was bricked on the inside; her clothes were smutted.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing else? - She was not searched till we came to the Rotation-office; I saw nobody else with her; she lived with us for a week about two months before.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Bensford a woollen-draper, No. 24, Ludgate-hill; he had a house in the country, in the parish of Wilsdon, near Mr. Oliver's house; I slept that morning at the prosecutor's; I was awaked in the night by a noise of somebody breaking into the house; I was alarmed about half after three in the morning; I heard the glass fall, and I came down stairs in my shirt, and saw the prisoner standing at the window; I immediately opened the door and clapped hold of her.</p>
               <p>Was that before the patrols came? - They were in the yard at the same time with the woman; I observed the casement window was broke in three or four places; some pieces of glass were broke out, and some hung in; and I observed one pot on the sill of the window, and the other lay by the sink hole against the window, ready for taking away; I observed the prisoner's coat was all smut.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether it was fresh? - Yes, I observed it was fresh; I put my hand upon it, and it rubbed off.</p>
               <p>Is there any house near that has a view into this yard? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you observe in the morning where the bar of the window was? - It lay down in the sink.</p>
               <p>How could this bar be removed by a person on the outside? - The casement opens on the outside; she opened the glass; it goes with a catch; she put her arm and unhasped it, and pulled it open; she got a thin bit of stick, which she said she found in the back yard, and there was a crack in the shutter that gives room enough to push up the bar; she owned the next morning in the tap room how she opened it; we asked her how she opened it.</p>
               <p>Did you charge her to tell the truth, did not you always advise her to tell the whole story? - I asked her myself.</p>
               <p>I suppose you told her it would be better for her? - Yes, we did.</p>
               <p>(The pots produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Should you have known that pot if you had not seen it in your house? - Yes, I should.</p>

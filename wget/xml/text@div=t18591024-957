At a quarter before eight o'clock at night on 17th October I was on duty in the Commercial-road—I heard cries of murder, and on going up I found a woman in Hungerford-street—she made a complaint to me that a man had struck her on the head with a poker, and I saw that she had a bump on her head—I asked her where the man was, and she said he was in the house, No. 12, setting the house on fire—I went in the house, and asked the woman to lend me a candle—I went into the back room where I found a lot of things blazing up against the partition—the room was full of smoke, and all the sashes almost out—two civilians went in with me—we put the fire out—I inquired for the prisoner—they said, "He is not here; he is gone"—I went and found him in a neighbouring house, and the woman that had been assaulted charged him with setting her house on fire—she said, "Fetch him out of the house, and I will appear against him"—I sent for another constable—I went in and asked the woman to lend me a candle, and she did—I went up stairs to the room where the prisoner was—I found him sitting on a chair—he said, "What the b—y h—I do you want here?"—I said, "I want you for assaulting a woman in the street, and setting the house on fire"—he rose up from the chair and said, "You b—r, I will assault you if you don't go out of my room"—he advanced towards me with this knife in his hand—he said, "Are you going out of my room?"—I said, "I shall not go out of your room till such time as I take you with me"—he came towards me with his right hand behind him, and just as I went to take hold of him he struck me in the eye with the knife, and stabbed me—the other constable, Carr, rushed forward to my assistance, and together we took him—I said to my</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, Shadwell—I saw the policeman Soley—I found an incised wound on the upper lid of the left eye, and a punctured wound on his nose—it was all done with one cut—the wound was just over the ball of the eye, and it had passed down to the cheek-bone—it appeared to me that the upper lid was taken down over the eye, and the instrument then went to the cheek-bone—it must have been done with considerable violence—it was a miraculous escape for the eye—it was in a very dangerous place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows:</hi>—"At 8 o'clock last night I was returning home, when I was called, by a woman who calls herself my mother, a b—y thief I asked her why she did it. She said, 'You won't let me see my children.' I said, 'You shan't see them.' She again began her abusive language, and while I was looking at her I was knocked down by my father, and while I was down, three sailors, as well as my father and mother, ill-used me, and I was glad to escape from them into my own house. While I was sitting on a chair, three constables came into the room. I asked what they wanted. They said they wanted me as a prisoner for abusing a woman. I said, 'Produce the woman that gave me in charge;' and I said I was the abused party, and they should hear it when I got a warrant at the police-court. The officer would insist on taking me. I said he had no right in my house, and I said I should not go with him. He struck me on the head with his staff, and before I could recover myself he struck me again on the left arm. With that I took hold of something that was on the table, I don't know whether it was a knife or a fork, and I struck at him. I thought it was wrong, and whatever I had I threw it on a dresser, and then put down my arm and said I would go quietly."</p>

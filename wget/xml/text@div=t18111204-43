               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar at all. - A. I saw him once before at Marlborough Street, I never saw him before it happened. On the 22d of November, I went to bed between ten and eleven, the housekeeper was in the house, General Bradshaw, the maid, and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the General go to bed. - A. He in general goes to bed about eleven, he was gone to bed when I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to bed did you take any notice of the windows and doors of the house. - A. I did not take any particular notice of them. - The maid is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she gone to bed at the time. - A. No. I got up in the morning and came down between seven and eight o'clock, when I came down I found the kitchen door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that door open into the area. - A. No, it is an inner door, I found it open and on my proceeding in the kitchen I saw two of the squares broke.</p>
               <p>Q. When these two squares of glass were broke was it possible for any person to put their hand in. - A. Yes, it was possible to be done. Any person putting their hand in at these panes might unpin the window and throw the sash up and get in, there were shutters to the window, the maid is not certain whether she fastened it when she went to bed. They were open on the inside. I then thought that somebody had been in the house. I went up to the maid and told her that the house had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the first up were you. - A. I was the first up. She said is it possible. I opened the area door. I found a man's shoe and a hat. And the things that are missing, when I see them, I can swear to them. There was missing a tea-pot, washed or plated, I am not certain which, five silver tea spoons, one pair of breeches, two pair of gaiters, one hat, and a clothes brush.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the hat and shoe. - A. I took them into the kitchen, I shewed them to the general, and he desired me to take care of them until the officer came. Craig the officer came a night or two afterwards to my master's house, the maid delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice the hat and shoe. - A. I did. I can swear that the same hat and shoe that I saw the maid gave to Craig, were the hat and shoe that I found in the area.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my beat is in Piccadilly, Albemarle Street, and Dover Street. On the 22d of November, I was going to call half past twelve along Piccadilly. I met the prisoner with a blanket rolled up under his arm, just by the New White Horse cellar, between Albemarle Street and Dover Street, he was coming as if from Hyde Park Corner, he had only one shoe on. I stopped him and asked him what he had got in the blanket, he had a hat on, he said they were a parcel of old things, he lived with Captain Warpole. I touched the blanket and a silver spoon tumbled out, and as he was stooping for the silver spoon the tea pot fell out.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a tea-pot. - A. It is plated or washed, I cannot tell which; at the time I thought it silver. I saw there was a gaiter or two hanging out, by that I took him by the collar and sprang my rattle, and then he chucked the blanket and the whole of the things down. I held him by the collar till I had a partner come up, then we picked up the things and the blanket.</p>
               <p>Q. Some of your partners came up. - A. Yes, one man came, his name is

            . On the 22d of November the prisoner came to my house at half after eleven o'clock and called for half a pint of beer. I am a publican. I live in Chappel Street, May Fair. I was in the act of shutting up my house, I told him to drink his beer and withdraw, he asked me whether General Bradshaw had a servant, he appeared to me to be a little in liquor, my wife told him that she did not know I then said why do you ask that question, he said he had a particular reason for asking that question, then said I, go to General Bradshaw's house and make the enquiry, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040032"></xptr>had no information to give him.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the police officers. - A. Yes. In consequence of the general's applying at the office, I was directed by the magistrate to go with Craig and look at the place. On the next morning the 23d we found the window broken as the servant has described it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say that after breaking the squares of glass a person might put their hand in and unpin the window and throw the sash up - A. Yes, they might very easy, and afterwards shut it down again. I have no doubt they got in at that window. The servant informed us there was a shoe and a hat found in the area of that house, we desired to look at it, one of the female servants there, said she was sure the hat belonged to one of the servants that did live with the general.</p>
               <p>Q. When you looked at the hat and the shoe did you compare the shoe with the prisoner's shoe. - A. I did afterwards. The man servant said that he had taken his hat and left his own. On Friday night the robbery was committed, on Saturday he was committed, on the Monday morning we went to the prisoner and examined the shoe that he had on. He had sold the hat when in prison to a fellow prisoner, he delivered up the hat, and the prisoner did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you that hat. - A. Yes, the prisoner told me who he had sold it so, and I called the man he gave me the hat in the prisoner's presence. The hat has been in my possession and Craig's ever since. I marked the hat before ever I gave it out of my possession. I can safely swear that this is the hat the prisoner said he had sold, which the servant said was his. This is the shoe I took off the prisoner's foot, the other shoe was given me by the other young woman in the kitchen and she put her mark on it. I have compared the shoes, they are fellows.</p>
               <p>- BENNING. This is my hat. I know it by a crack on the outside, and it has been slightly cleaned once. I know the hat by having it in constant wear. It is the hat I left in the kitchen the night before.</p>
               <p>- CRAIG. Q. You have heard Foy's account. - A. Yes, it is true, I kept this hat a little time. It is the same hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have lived along with different gentlemen in that neighbourhood for seven years. I went to General Bradshaw and left him at my own option. I went over to Ireland and came back, I was very bad and I went into the Lock Hospital. I came out one evening and got rather in drink, stopped out late, as I turned back I went into different houses to get a lodging, I was disappointed. I went down into this area, I saw the window shutter open, I shoved the sash up. I thought to lay there for the night, down the sash came, the glass broke, I will own it.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Benning.) Look at these things. - A. That is the general's tea-pot, the cloths brush is my own.</p>
               <p>FELL. That cloaths brush I took out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>BENNING. That book is my own. I can swear to the spoon, we missed five, we have only one; and I can swear to the gaiter, both pair of gaiters are mine; and the breeches are mine.</p>

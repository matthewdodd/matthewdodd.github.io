I was on duty on Saturday, the 3rd of April, and I saw the prisoner on Ealing Com<lb></lb>mon, on the Uxbridge-road—he was on the top of a cart of hay, and a little boy, six or seven years of age, was driving—a larger bulk of hay on the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's master, and hold some land at Ruis<lb></lb>lip. He was employed to take up a regular load of hay on Saturday—I did not see it go away, but the man is here who bound it—I saw the hay that was found, it appeared to be the same quality as my rick—I allow a bottle truss of 20lbs. for each horse—there were two horses—I should not allow a truss of 65lbs., one smaller one, and' a bottle besides—it was extra, and taken without my authority.</p>

I cut the hay in question—I loaded thirty-six trusses myself—I have seen the hay found on the top of the load, and weighed it—it was not mine—the prisoner asked me to lend him my knife—I left my knife with him—the thirty-six trusses was my cutting, the other was not, but it was all the same sort of hay.</p>

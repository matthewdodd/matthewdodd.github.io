            . On the 14th of this instant, the prisoner (whom I have known a year and a half) and another man, came to my house and called for a pint of beer; he desired me to go backwards, saying, he wanted to speak with me; then he ask'd me if I would buy any broken silver, he would sell it very cheap, it came from the Havannah; I said, let me look at it; he said, to tell you the truth, it is a tankard, and shewed it me; he said it had been twice advertised; I said, I would have nothing to do with it. When I went to draw him another pint of beer, I turned my head, and saw him take my tea-kettle, (which had not water in it, and holds about two gallons) and give it to the other man, and sent him on the out-side of the door with it. I was afraid of pur suing, having seen they had two pistols under their cloaths. I took the prisoner on the 16th, near Rotherhith church. I never got my kettle again. The prisoner did belong to the Gravesend press-gang.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence said, he went with a man that had got some plate to sell, and what that man did he knew not.</p>

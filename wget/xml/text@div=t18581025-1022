                  </hi>. I am a seafaring man, and am seventy-eight years of age, and live in Princes-street, Rotherhithe. On Sunday evening, 26th Sep<lb></lb>tember, I went into the White Lion at Rotherhithe, between 9 and 10 o'clock—I remained there fifteen or twenty minutes—I had a pot of beer—I had been drinking, but very little before—I had been with a friend having din<lb></lb>ner—I took my beer at the White Lion in the taproom—I saw both the prisoners there—I left to go home, and they would not let me—when I was within a few yards of my own house, I was laid hold of by them—they would not let me go in—I am sure it was these parties—I had seen them before—they took hold of each side of me—they would not let me go down in my own house—they dragged me down an alley and knocked me down—I was senseless for a few minutes—my landlord recovered me and brought me on my legs—as soon as I recovered, I said, "You rascals, you have taken my watch"—one of the prisoners was there when I said that—the other had made his escape, I believe—I can't say what was the value of my watch—it was an old family silver watch in a new case.</p>

I remember on Sunday evening, 26th of September, I saw the last witness in our taproom—he had a pot of beer—he stayed a quarter-of-an-hour or twenty minutes—the two prisoners were there while he was—I saw the prosecutor go out, and the prisoners followed him—the prosecutor appeared to me to have been drinking—I came out of the door just after him—I saw the prisoners had hold of him, about three yards from his door—he said "I want to go home," and they said "No, come along"—he ap<lb></lb>peared to try to get away from them—I saw them and him go post his own door—each of them had hold of one of his arms—they went down an alley—I followed them down, and when I got in I saw Moss knock the prosecutor down with his fist and take his watch—the prosecutor said, "You rascals, you have got my watch"—Moss made his escape on his hands and knees, and he got out into Church-street—Smith took hold of the prosecutor's right arm—Mr. Allen came down the alley—he took hold of Smith and sent me for a constable.</p>

                  </hi> I am a German, I, live at 32, Oval, Hackney Road, and am a boot finisher in the employ of Mr. Ayres—I was in his employ on 21st of last month; between 5 and 6 o'clock that evening, I left my home, I was going to Mr. Ayers shop to take out some more work-as I was passing three doors from my house I saw Richardson standing at a gate—I had seen him twice beford in Mr. Ayers shop—I don't know whether he was working for Mr. Ayers, I had never spoken to him before this night—he said to me "If you go in shop at Mr. Ayres and take out some more work I will kill you"—I said "I must see to get my living, I am not in the society, I can work for any shop I like"—he said "Of course, when any shop is in the strike, you can't work in the strike"—I then went home, I did not go in the shop any more, I was frightened—I worked for Mr. Ayers after that but I did not go in shop, he sent me some work which I did at home and he sent for it—I was paid by Mr. Ayres, I sent a lad for it; I live about 10 or 15 minutes walk from Mr. Ayres-before the strike I went to the shop myself every Saturday and got my wages; I can't tell for certain how many times I saw Richardson after this—I think I only saw him twice in another street—when I was going out from my house I had a man with me, because I was frightened to go by myself—I did not know that Richardson belonged to the union at the time he spoke to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, of 343, Hackney Road—on 21st September, the witness Lex, was in my employment, I can't recollect giving him out some work that morning, he had been working for me some time, I should think about eighteen months—he always fetched his work up to this bother, he brought it home and took it out as a rule, fetched his wages himself, up to five or six weeks ago, up to about 21st September; I do not remember whether he came to fetch his work on the evening of the 21st—he came on Friday or Saturday, I wont be sure which, and made a complaint to me-since then his work has been taken to him and fetched away, and his money sent to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced) is my</hi> son's writing, I believe it to be his, I have never seen it before—my son is here, I know a man named Matthews, I have known him two or three days from this date, I heard that he was engaged in a strike case some months ago, he came and told me—the is not a witness in this case, if he is, it is to describe the picketing that is still going on—why this paper was written out I don't know-no interview took place between me and the witnesses in these, two cases in my drawing-room this morning-Matthews came to my place this morning, and said "You are being served very badly"—I said "If you are wanted will you prove the picketing that is still going on"—he said Yes," and I have not seen him since Lex was there, but he did not hear what was said, and Morgan was there—there was reaily no meeting, I did not sit in my drawing-room, and I had no conversation with any of them particularly—I was in my drawing-room this morning, and Lex, Morgan, Matthews, and my son were there—this paper was not shown by me to Matthews, I saw nothing shown—I believe Richardson, is secretary to the Bootmakers' Union, Matthews was only to prove the picketing that is still going on—the 21st. September, was not spoken of in my hearing, nor the time, between 5 and 6 o'clock, nor were the words mentioned "If you take any more work I will kill you."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The picketing is still going on more strongly than <hi rend="italic">ever</hi>, and has been going on for six weeks, interfering with my workpeople, I shall be ruined if it goes on—I have seen Richardson come in the morning several times, and he seemed to tell the man what to do for his day's work, and then go away; I have seen him with the man half an hour in the morning, and then the man has paraded in front of my place all the day; there has only been one man at a time picketing, then there was a relief, they parade up and down two houses past my house' this way, and two</p>

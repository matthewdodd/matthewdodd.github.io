             and another; they told me that Kelley had said, I was a dishonest chap, I did not get my living by work. I gave the prisoner a punch of the head as hard as I could; he laid down and cried, with his hand to his head; I walked away. In about five or six minutes the prisoner came and throwed a handful of mud in my face; he drew a case knife, and cut me between my back and my loins; I bled a good deal, and laid by for two days. I went to a surgeon. The prisoner was taken up about an hour afterwards; he has been in jail ever since.</p>

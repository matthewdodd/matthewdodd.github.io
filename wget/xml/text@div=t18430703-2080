                  </hi>. I live in Fox head-court, Quaker-street, and am fore<lb></lb>man to Joseph Harris, who has a warehouse in Stepney parish. On the 16th of June I left the warehouse safe at six o'clock—I went again about eight next morning, but did not notice any thing till I was told a person had been found in the back premises—I then examined and found the tiles had been taken off the roof of the house so that anybody of the prisoner's size could get in—I missed upwards of 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and copper, and a dressing-case—this is it—it is mine, and was taken out of a desk, which was not locked.</p>

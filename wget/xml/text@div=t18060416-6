               <p>Q. What colour was she. - A. A bay mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you halt at the entrance of the farm yard. A. I alighted in the farm yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tye her up, and where. - A. I hung her up inside of the gate, on the paling.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a stick with you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the stick. - A I laid it on a seed scuttle, close to the mare's head.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go. - A. A very little way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty yards. - A. It might be more than twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do. - A. I put a bush into a hurdle.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you left the mare before you found she was gone. - A. In about five minutes I looked to the place where I had left her, and I found she was gone, I looked into the road, I saw a man on her, she was upon the full gallop, as fast as she could go.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man any thing in his hand who was riding her. - A. He had a stick.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing with the stick. - A. Beating her on the right side, to make her go as fast as he could; I went to the seed scuttle, to see if the stick was gone as well as the mare, that was gone; I went into the road to see how far the man was gone, he was beating her then: I went into the plow field, and took a horse out of that field, and rode after him, and at the King's Arms, Palmer's Green, about four or five miles off, I found the mare, she was standing at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner at the bar there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What past between the prisoner at the bar when you came there. - A. He was talking to a man of the name of Baker when I got to him, I heard him say he would not take a farthing less for her, but he would not mind spending a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon hearing of that, what did you do. - A. I catched hold of his collar, I said, You are the villian that stole the mare out of my yard, he stood for a second, and then he said, I did not steal your mare, I found her on the road, I said how came you by that stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the stick that you put in the seed scuttle. - A. Yes, he said he found the stick in the stirrup; I had laid it in the seed scuttle; he said he was sorry for what he had done, if I would go to Islington, where he lived, he would give me a guinea for my trouble, if that would satisfy me; I told him that was more than I dare do, it was not in my power to let him go; then I sent a man for a constable, and just at the constable's house he said if I would let him off, he would give us a guinea a-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the saddle and bridle of Mr. Vaughan's. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw a man riding the mare very hard, he was beating her very unmercifully. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear that he was conducting himself as though he was perfectly sober; how did he appear. - A. I cannot tell, I am not acquainted with the man, I never saw him before.</p>

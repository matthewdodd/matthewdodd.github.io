            . On the 6th of August, in the evening, the prisoner pledged these spoons with me for 4 s. On the 4th of November she came again, but having seen an advertisement, on the 8th of August, of a chest and such spoons, I asked the prisoner if these spoons were her own. She said they were. I secured her, and took her to justice Fielding's, where she said she had bought them of an old cloaths man; but she made an attempt to run away.</p>

               <p>I told him I was sent with them to pawn by a young woman, who said they were her own; she lives in St. Giles's: I believe she is an honest body, but I have not seen her since. Please to ask the prosecutor if I said I bought them.</p>

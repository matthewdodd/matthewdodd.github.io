            : On Friday, the 19th of June, between twelve and one o'clock, I was coming from the back part of the shop, I saw the prisoner crossing the street with a bundle of our paper under his arm; I immediately called to out lad; he instantly ran after him, and stopped him just before he got to the pavement on the opposite side of the street; I attempted to take it from him, but the prisoner let the paper fall upon the ground and ran away; our lad took up the paper and brought it to me; I was standing just outside the shop door; our lad then instantly pursued the prisoner, not losing sight of him, down Threadneedle-street; the lad came back with the prisoner, followed by a crowd of people; seeing a crowd of people assembled before the door, a constable came into the shop, and and I gave charge of him, and he took him before the Lord Mayor.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010058"></xptr>WILLIAM WOOLLARD sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Gardiner: on Friday the 19th of June, my master called me to go after the prisoner; I saw him going across the way, he dropped the paper from under his arm; I was close to him when he dropped it, my master was standing just by the door upon the pavement; I picked up the paper, and gave it to my master; I then went after the prisoner, down Threadneedle-street; I kept pursuing him, and holloaing out, stop him; he was stopped about the middle of Threadneedle-street; I never lost sight of him after he dropped the paper; I laid hold of him, and brought him back to the shop; a constable came past, and he was given in charge, and taken before the Lord Mayor; the paper was tied up in a bundle, and put by itself.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of paper was it? - A.Demy marble; I know it to be my master's paper, I could distinguish it from twenty more, it was so remarkable.</p>
               <p>Gardiner. If it had been tied up in a bundle, as paper commonly is, I dare say I should have suffered him to pass; but it being such remarkable paper, I knew it immediately to be mine. (Francis Bailey, the officer, produced the property, which was identified by Mr. Gardiner.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This gentleman first said, I was not the person, and told me to go about my business; he asked me my name, and where I lived and he took it down; he told me he would call upon me, and then the constable came in.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you take down his name, and place of abode? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mean to let him go? - A. I cannot say I had quite made up my mind whether to let him go or not; he begged very hard, and said he was very sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt of his being the man? - A.None upon earth.</p>

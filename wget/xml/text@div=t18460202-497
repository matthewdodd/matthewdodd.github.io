                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Frederick Collins, of Nos. 21, 22, and 23, Sloane-street; Johnson was in our employ; Broom is a hawker. Johnson had no authority to sell him goods on credit—I should not have allowed anything of the kind—from something that occurred on a day pre<lb></lb>vious to the 28th of Jan. I desired Felling and Evans to watch his proceedings when he came again—on the 28th of Jan. I received a communication from Pelling, in consequence of which I followed Broom from the shop, and gave him into custody—when at the station he took from his pocket a brown paper parcel containing about 2,000 needles—I also saw one pair of braces and three pairs of stockings taken out of his pack—I believe them to be our property.</p>

Mr. Neave. The door was locked with two locks, where I left the tools, there was a dead wall, nine feet high before the yard. On the 26th of October, when I came back to work, I found the door loose, both the locks wrenched off, and in that yard which the work shop is over, there were laths, one was broke out, so as for a person to get in, out of this shop I lost the several tools mentioned in the indictment.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Leonards, Shoreditch, on the 25th of October about twelve at night, I saw the prisoner going along with a bag, I said what have you got there to which he said he had got his tools, I put my hand behind him, and found he had a saw between his coat and waistcoat, I asked him why he carried it so, and not in the bag, I took him to the watch-house, at the watch-house he said the tools were his own, that he had been at work at Bethnall-Green, and that he had been drinking with a partner, which made him so late home, I looked at the things, there was T. F. upon the plane, and that being a different mark to what he told me his name was, I suspected him. I asked him where he lived, he said at No. 110, in Skinner-street, whereas, No. 69, is the highest number there.</p>

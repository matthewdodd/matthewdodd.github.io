                  </hi>. I live in Whitechapel. On 18th Oct. I was on the Half Moon—there were ten or twelve people there—a friend of mine left the house, about a quarter to twelve o'clock—Hess took him by the arm, and asked where he was going—he said, "Home"—Hess said, "You must not go home yet;" and pushed him back towards the room—my friend had had a little too much—he said he would not go back—I said to Hess, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself"—he said it was nothing to do with me, and began upon me—I and my friend went out, and Hess and his company followed us—there was a noise, and the police separated us, and sent us home—we went in-doors—I live next door to Hess—I closed the door behind me—in about five minutes I heard a noise outside my door—it kept on for about ten minutes—my brother came in and said something, and I went out to give the prisoner in charge—he stood before the door as I came out—I said I did not want to be aggravated any longer by him—he came close to me, with his hand up, as if going to attack me, and I said I would fight him in the English fashion—he said he was content—we closed, but I do not think I struck him; I might have pushed him—he fell down beside a wagon in the street, and one or two of his friends seized hold of me—he got up, then let go of me, and I was ready for him again—I attempted to strike him, but he struck me in the head several times with some instrument—the blood came, and I became insensible.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a boot and shoemaker; we live at 11, Butler-street, opposite Mr. Werner. On 29th Oct. I heard a noise in the street, at a little after eleven o'clock—I opened my window, and saw the policeman putting Werner and the prisoner in—Werner went in, but the prisoner stood between his own door and Werner's after the prisoner left—he said something in German, and made a noise at Werner's door—in about five minutes Werner opened it, and went up to him, talking to him in German—a</p>

               <p>wrestle began, and Werner fell against a wagon, which was standing there to be repaired—for anything I know his foot might have slipped—his wife came out with a candle in her hand, and did what she could to stop it—the prisoner got up, and two men, who had laid hold of Werner, let go, and the prisoner caught Werner's head in his left hand, and stabbed him with a knife, which was in his right—I saw the knife by the light of the candle, but his wife let the candle fall then—I cannot say how many blows he made, as I went for the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a German, and live at 17, Plough-street. I saw Werner and Hess frighting—Hess's wife came out with a candle, by the light of which I saw a knife in Hess's hand, and saw him stab Werner in the head with it, with his right band, with his left arm round his neck, holding his head, and pulling it towards him—I saw the blood run down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon, at the London Hospital. Werner was brought there, bleeding—I found eighteen or twenty wounds on his head, some punctured, some incised, some cut across the head, and others contused—there was very little danger, but fever or erysipelas might have ensued—some must have been struck with the handle of the knife, and some with the blade—they were on different parts <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the head, but none on the face—if the head was held by the left hand they were all such wounds as the right hand would inflict—some were simply scratches—he was in the hospital four days—he was not in danger all that time, but had to wait, as there is only a certain day to discharge patients.</p>

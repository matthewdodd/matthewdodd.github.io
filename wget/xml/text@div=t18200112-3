            . I am a patrol on the Foundling Estate; Bernard-street is on my beat, and in the parish of St. Pancras. On the 4th of January, about a quarter past six o'clock in the morning, I was passing Mr. Pugh's house - it was quite foggy and dark. I observed that one of the wooden panes on one side of the scullery door appeared to be out, which made me think somebody was about the place. I went down the area, and found the scullery door partly open - the watchman was coming down the street; we found the area gate unlocked. I told him to keep the gate fast while I went down the steps; I was going down, and found the prisoner coming out of the scullery door. He said he had got up too early to go to work, and that he met two men, who told him to come down to such an area, where they would find plenty of grub, and they would share with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him - A. No. Before I took him away I found a sack with five dishes, part of three half-quartern loaves, a piece of beef, two pieces of cheese, a piece of dried salmon, a quantity of butter, and a small pan of kitchen-stuff, all tied up in the sack which was in the scullery.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the scullery immediately underneath the step of the street door - A. Yes, it is part of the area, which is enclosed. The kitchen door enters into the scullery, and the scullery door into the area.</p>

            . The scullery is immediately under the step of the street door; one door leads into the area, and the other into the kitchen. On the night of the 4th of January, when I went to bed, I made the doors fast - I bolted the door leading to the area, at the top and bottom. About six o'clock in the morning, the watchman called me, and I found it open; a pane of wood, which was safe when I went to bed, had been taken out; a man could put his body through, and unbolt the door, top and bottom. I saw the sack with the things in it - I had left them all safe - the sack was not there the night before; thirteen plates were tied up in a handkerchief under the sink - I had left them in a plate-rack. I am certain I fastened the doors, and the area gate was locked; the door leading to the kitchen was not opened. Last night I found these things in the water-cistern in the scullery - here is a skeleton key, which opens the area gate easily, also a bottle, a steel, and a flint.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The evening before, I had some words at home, and went out; I fell in company with two young men at a public-house, and told them I was out of work. They said if I would meet them at the corner of Bernard-street at six o'clock they would get me work. I met them; they sent me down to the scullery for the bag. The patrol came and caught me on the steps.</p>

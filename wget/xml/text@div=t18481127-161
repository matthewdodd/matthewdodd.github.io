                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 181). About half-past six on the evening of 22nd Nov. I was in Sloane-square, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner coming up Simon-street with this pillow.-case—he went to a marine-store shop—I went to the window, and saw him taking this horse-hair out of this pillow-case, and putting it into the scale—I went in and asked where he got that hair—he said, "Out of some old chairs"—I asked where the chairs were—he said he broke them up a long while ago—I said I would take him to the station—he said if that was the case, he could show me the old chairs—he took me to Messrs. Mitchell and St. John's back warehouse, in Simon-street—there were no chairs there, but I found an old horse-hair mattress, which had several holes, and a quantity of horse-hair taken out.</p>

I was with Tewsley—I saw the prisoner putting the horse-hair into the scale—he then took us to the back of the premises in Simon-street—I then took him to the front of the premises, and he acknowledged to Mr. Mitchell and Mr. St. John that it was the first time he had taken any, and he did it merely to get sixpence—I took him to the station.</p>

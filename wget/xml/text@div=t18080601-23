            . On Friday the 13th of May I went to Somerset house, from the prisoner's house; I boarded with him.</p>

               <p>Q. How much did you owe him - A. I believe that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010020"></xptr>was all, to the best of my knowledge; the next morning a young woman came and asked me to take a walk with her; I left a two pound note and a prize ticket in the prisoner's drawer, in his room where he slept; that was about ten o'clock in the morning; I went out with this young woman, and when I came home again I went to the drawer to look for my two pound note, it was gone; the prisoner was then setting in an arm chair; I said Mr. Tomling have you got my two pound note; he gave me a great many abusive names, and got up and knocked me down, and then his wife got up and knocked me down, tore my cap, and my handkerchief; then I went to Worship street, there was no magistrate sitting; I came home to the prisoners place, the door was padlocked: I went to the White Horse facing the prisoner's house; the prisoner was sitting there with a pint of beer and a pipe; I said Mr. Tomling have you got my two pound note; he told he had not, d - d me several times; Mr. Bridges the headborough came, he told him if he had got the young woman's note to give it her; he said he had got no two pound note nor the worth of a two pound note; the officer took him to the watchhouse, searched him; in his left hand breeches pocket he found the two pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the note again did you know it to be your note - A. All that I know it by, is it being a new note; I cannot swear to the number.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer - A. Yes. On the 14th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was sent for to the White Horse in Wheeler street; when I came there the prosecutrix gave me charge of the prisoner; in his presence she told me she had lost a two pound note; he said no such a thing; I told him if he had got the note, he had better give it to the prosecutrix; he said he had got no notes; I took him to the watchhouse; after having him there a little while, I searched him; in his left hand pocket I found this two pound note; he was very tipsey when I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know this is the note that I took at Somerset house by the marks here; there is a wrinkle in the paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When she went to the navy office to receive the money, my wife went along with her; she received nine pounds odd, she gave her the notes to bring home; when they got home and had a mouthful of victuals, then she wanted to know what she was in my debt; fourteen weeks I supported her, besides money that I had laid out for her at different times, that made the whole six pounds thirteen shillings and seven pence halfpenny; she said she could spare me no more than five pounds; I told her I did not desire no more at. that time, because she would want some money to buy a few clothes to make herself decent to get herself into service; she has informed your lordship that she paid me a five pound note; she had no five pound note amongst them; she was paid in three two pound notes, and three ones, she paid me two two pound notes, and a one pound note I went over the way to pay a score at the public house, I paid the landlord a two pound note and a one pound note; and the other two pound note was to take some things out of pawn, that I had pledged to support her before she went away; she had been drinking gin; then she went to her landlady where she lodged to pay her; she paid that woman a two pound note, she I believe paid it in a mistake for a one pound note, and after she recollected herself, she went and got it changed; she kept drinking that night, went to Well street playhouse, came home with a soldier; she went out and got more gin; the next morning she came again at six o'clock, then she was so drunk that she began to cascade over the bed. A young woman of the same fraternity as herself called upon her, they set off together, and went drinking at the public house; she came to me about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was over the way at the public house having a pint of beer; she said Mr. Tomling I want my note; I said what note, I never saw the note; she said I will have it, if you have not got it Mrs. Tomling has; I said I cannot tell what she knows, I thought the woman was joking; the officer was dubious of taking the charge, he thought it was all fun that was going forward.</p>

I live at 1, Guraby's Buildings, Broad Street, Lambeth—on Sunday afternoon, 26th October, I was with some boys outside Albert Buildings, when I noticed the prisoner and a woman pass—I then noticed a lot of boys running to Boyce's dust yard—I ran after them to see what they were going to do, and when I got there I see the prisoner come out from behind a cart—he was the other side of the yard—he searched for a stone and picked up a brick, and threw it at the deceased, who was standing on the wheel—there was also a boy in the cart—it hit the deceased on the back of the head and knocked him down off the wheel—the prisoner said nothing and walked away—when he threw the brick he was 15 or 20 yards off—I don't know whether he saw the hoy fall—it was light—I don't think he did see it hit him, because there were carts in front—he could have seen him, but he turned round and walked away—it was not quite half a brick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the deceased walked a few steps and began laughing—he did nut seem much hurt, and we all laughed at him—he couldn't cry, he was half laughing; but when he was walking out of the yard some blood ran down from the back of his head on to his coat—he went up to a con<lb></lb>stable on the Albert Embankment—that was about 100 yards from the yard.</p>

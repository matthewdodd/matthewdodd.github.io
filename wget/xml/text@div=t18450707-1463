                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Paxton Jarvis, of 59, Cadogan-place, in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner, Wilmot, about two years, by having taken apartments in her house for my son—his widow and children live in her house now—she has been in the habit of visiting me at my master's since Jan. last, and brought my grand<lb></lb>daughter to see me—on Sunday evening, the 15th of June, I missed six dessert-spoons; five gravy, and a table-spoon; a soup-ladle, and one pair of asparagus-tongs, from the side-board drawer in the dining-room—it was never locked—I had seen them safe on the 17th of April—I had been to the drawer since, but did not examine the articles—the prisoner had visited me the evening before I missed the articles—she came on the Saturday evening to ask if she could do anything for me—we both went out at the street door together, and parted at the door about a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening—I locked the street door and left nobody in the house—I went towards Sloane-aquare, and she towards Knightsbridge—I was absent from a half to three quarters of an hour, then returned to the house—everything appeared as I had left it—I did not go into the dining-room that night—I missed the articles on Sunday morning, and gave information to the police and to my master—the prisoner called, I think, on Monday morning, to pay me a trifle of money—she had borrowed of me, but I did not tell her of my loss—I gave information to the police on the Wednesday by direction of my master—I waited till he came to town—I do not re<lb></lb>member the prisoner calling again till the Saturday evening—I taw her on the Sunday night, and she agreed to come on Monday to help me, which she did—she was assisting me in the drawing-room, and in conse-quence of something which happened I sent for a policeman—while he was gone for, the prisoner went down stairs with me, and wished to go home—I begged her to stay to have lunch—when the policeman came I men<lb></lb>tioned the articles I had missed, and she said she had returned and entered the house at the back door with a key, when she found I was gone a sufficient way, and went into the dining-room (having heard me say, when master was robbed before, it was a mercy the plate was safe,) that she took the articles, and she, with another person, erased the crest on those articles which had crests, and pawned them—she offered to go to another room with me and begged the policeman should be sent away—she threw herself entirely on my mercy.</p>

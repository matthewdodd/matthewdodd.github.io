                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Owen Jones, of Argyle-street, Regent-street. The prisoner is a carrier, and was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to the house—on Monday, the 8th of Dec., about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, I gave him a box of linen to take to Charles Parsons to be washed—I wrapped 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. up in a pieee of brown paper, and put it in the centre of the box, with a bundle of clothes upon it—the box was not locked, but was corded—there was a sixpence, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece, and penny among the money—I do not recollect the other coin—I delivered the box to the prisoner himself—I told him the money was in it—I had been in the habit of doing it before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Parsons, a laundry<lb></lb>man in Garrett's-lane, Wandsworth. I received a box from the prisoner, on the 8th of Dec, about half-past ten o'clock at night—he was going, and I asked him to wait while I uncorded it—it was corded, but not locked—he said he did not think there was any money in the box—money usually came in it—he was in the habit of bringing the box backwards and forwards—he said Mrs. Jones was not at home, it was too late that night to call again, and he would call next day—in a minute or two after he was gone I uncorded the box and emptied the clothes out, but found no money—next morning I took the clothes to wash—I never found any money—my husband was present when I uncorded the box.</p>

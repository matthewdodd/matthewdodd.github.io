               <p>My husband was a coach strap-maker, he died on the 14th of October, I was robbed on the 15th.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner your servant? - No; as she was coming down the street, she was told Mr. Millan was dead, and had left me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250169"></xptr> with four small children and down-lying; and she said poor creature I will go in and see them; and she cried over my babes and cried over me; but in the afternoon a club society, which my husband belonged to, came and gave me five pounds, four guineas and a half, and five and sixpence in silver; I had but ten-pence in halfpence, which was all the money I had before; I was very ill and went to bed; and when the club men came and knocked at the door, they came to the bedside, and paid me the money; I counted it over, and put it in my pocket; she said, she would stay with me all night; my husband lay dead on the table, and it was very shocking; she sat down in a chair, and my apron hung over the chair; and she took up the apron, and said, I will wrap up this apron under your head, to raise it; I said, never mind, but she would put it under my head, and at the same time she took my money; she sat down a few minutes; then she said, she would go home; I said, no, do stay; she would not; I got up, and locked and bolted the door after her; and when I got up at past five, I had but a guinea and half, and five shillings and sixpence in silver, and eight pennyworth of halfpence; nobody was in the house.</p>
               <p>How old is the eldest of your children? - Turned of seven; and all girls; I enquired after her; the prisoner was apprehended on the Monday.</p>

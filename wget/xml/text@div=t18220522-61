            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 16th of April I searched a house in Dartmouth-street; the prisoner was in the back room, sitting by the fire at tea with a woman, I said nothing to him, but proceeded to search; while I was searching he came up stairs, and said it was proper that the woman who was with him should see the warrant; I shewed it to him, and said I would read it, if he thought proper; the woman looked at it, and the prisoner said he was satisfied, it was all right, and went down stairs. Under the bed in that room, I found three pictures tied in a blue table cover; I took the woman to the office, leaving the prisoner in the room. Pople brought him to the office in half an hour. He said he knew nothing of it, nor did he know they were in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The warrant was against the woman - A. Yes; I understood she occupied the house, but found he was her husband; he keeps a carpenter's shop, in Rose-street, Long Acre; the wife carries on a broker's shop at this house.</p>

            . I lodged at Mrs. Turpin's, Dartmouth-street for sixteen months; she managed the business, and the prisoner kept another shop in Rose-street. The room the goods were found in had been let to one Brown for three weeks previous; he left without notice on the Sunday before they were found. I let him the room for Mrs. Turpin was ill at the time, and I minded her shop. He said another young man was to sleep with him.</p>
               <p>Q. On what occasions did the prisoner come to Dartmouth-street - A. He slept at home sometimes, but not for three or four nights before the Saturday - he came home to meals.

I was reading in the newspaper at the public-house that a man was taken about some pictures, and one of the people said that was Mulberry's name.

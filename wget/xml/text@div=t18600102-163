               <p>Waller n, boot and shoemaker of Woolwich—on Monday raorniug, 12th December last, the prisoner came to the shop: she said she wanted some boots for Mr. Vant—she did not say what boots—she said Mr. Vant was a draper at the bottom of the street—she did not say anything else, only that he was not particular what boots—she said that Mr. Vaut had sent her; that was all—I gave her three pairs of boots, because I believed her statement about Mr. Vant to be true—she did not say in whose employment she was.</p>

I live in High-street, Woolwich—on Monday, 12th December last, the prisoner was not in my service; she had been—she left, I believe, in February, 1859—I did not give her authority on 12th December, or any other day previous to that, to go to the shop of Mr. Waller to get any boots—I had not given her any authority to apply for and receive the boots—there is a Mr. Vant—she is not here—I can answer that she had not authority from her, I had not seen her at my house, and she had not been there—she was not in the habit of coming—I have not seen her have any conversation with my wife since she left.</p>

On 12th December, from informa<lb></lb>tion I received, I went to a house in Warwick-street, Woolwich, and found the prisoner in the front room; she was at that time fitting one of the pairs of boots on—I looked on the bed and saw the other two pairs lying there—I took them up and told her that she must consider herself in custody for obtaining the boots under false representations—the prisoner stated that she had been sent by Mr. Vant—she said that she was very sorry—I then took her to the station—on going there I asked her how long she had been out of Mr. Vant's service, and she said some months.</p>

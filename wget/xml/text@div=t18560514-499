               <p>morning, on 1st May, I saw a van belonging to the Great Northern Rail<lb></lb>way Company, in King William-street—the prisoner was in that van in a stooping position, which induced me to watch him—I saw him take out of his pocket, under his waistcoat, this hammer (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—he next proceeded to prise up the lid of the top box—there were two boxes—after he had raised the lid and released the nails, he lifted the lid up and took a salmon out, and placed it under some straw—he lifted the lid of the same box again and took another salmon, and secreted it in the same place—after" he had done that he nailed the lid down again with this hammer—he then got down and got on the driving box, apparently going to drive off—I told him I wanted him, and he must come down—he said, "I am going to deliver these goods at the South Eastern Railway station, and must go"—I said, "Yon must go with me; I must deliver you and the goods at the police station"—he got down, and I said, "How about these fish?"—he said, "For God's sake, don't say anything about it; if you do I am a ruined man"—after some little time I got the assistance of a brother officer to take charge of the van, and I took the prisoner—in going along, he said, "For God's sake, take no notice of it; I will give you a sovereign or anything"—I said if he would give me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I could not do it—in going along, he said, "I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will give you anything in the world"—he was taken to the station, and while the charge was being booked, he took this hammer out of his pocket under his waistcoat, and said, "This is what I opened the box with"—I found the salmon secreted in the straw under the tarpaulin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at the Great Northern Railway. On 1st May, the prisoner drove a van from there—I checked the goods that he took out that morning—he took three boxes of salmon—they were in a good state when he left the station—they were for Boulogne.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a van boy in the employ of the Great Northern Railway. Between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning, on 1st May, I saw the van which the prisoner drove—amongst the goods were three salmon boxes—I noticed that the lid of one was a little loose—it was open about half an inch when he left the station—they were to be taken to the South Eastern Railway—the Van stopped at London-bridge, and the prisoner told me to go down to the market to see whether there was any ice—I went and was</p>

               <p>away about ten minutes—when I came back I missed the prisoner—I went towards the South Eastern Railway, and as I was going over the bridge, a man told me he was gone to the station—I went to Seething-lane station—I found the van there—I looked round, and the boxes were all nailed down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know that drivers of vans take hammers and nails with them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never heard of it—I once saw a lid come off at the South Western Railway, and the prisoner sent me for a stone to drive the nails in—I have not seen that he has carried a hammer and nails since that—I think this box had been used several times before—the lid that came off before might be with the jolting of the van—we were going to deliver this van at the South Eastern Railway—nothing happened to the other boxes—I do not recollect the prisoner saying that Mr. Phillips, a fishmonger, had desired him to see if there was any ice—I went down to Billingsgate market—I have seen packages open at the Great Northern Railway station, and the prisoner has sent me for a hammer to knock them down—I think it was of the smaller box that the lid was loose—to the best of my recollection, the smaller box was on the top.</p>

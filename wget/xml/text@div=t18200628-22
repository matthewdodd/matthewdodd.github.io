I came out about a quarter before six o'clock, the women followed me out, and hustled me in the passage; when I got about five steps from the door my pocket-book was taken - Brown took it out of my pocket. I caught hold of her, a number of men came round and kicked me - I almost got my brains knocked out. Crispin was in the passage; when I came out he caught hold of me and said,</p>
               <p>"Let the woman go, or I will knock your eye out!" - I was obliged to let her go. Crispin kept holding me to stop me from pursuing her.</p>

I had been to an auction by the Tower; we dined together afterwards, and stopped at the public-house till twelve o'clock, I then walked part of the way to Highgate, as we had some business to settle. I left him between two and three o'clock, and as I returned I went into this shop, which I thought was a public-house - I had been with no women. Some women spoke to me in Webb-square, I do not know whether they were the prisoners or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you had lost a 20 l. note - A. No. The coffee-shop man stood at the door when I was robbed, and would not assist me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. Were you in company with two girls in Wentworth-street - A. No, on my oath I was not. I was perfectly sober. I went to no house in George-yard. I called for a watchman, but could get none.</p>

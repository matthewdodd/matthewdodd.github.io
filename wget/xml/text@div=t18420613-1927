                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Evans; we live at Chelsea. On Wednesday morning, the 1st of June, the prisoner came to see one of my lodgers—I saw her going up stairs, and asked who she was going to—she said, "Mrs. Donohue"—I said she was not at home—she went up stairs, and returned in two or three minutes, then went away, and returned in twenty minutes or half an hour—she then went up stairs and stopped four or five minutes, then came down and went away—when she came first to our house she had something in her apron, but she appeared to go away the second time with a larger bundle than she brought in—it was then between eleven and twelve o'clock—I went up between two and three, to my bedroom, which is adjoining the lodger's room that the pri<lb></lb>soner went to—I missed a bonnet, a towel, five caps, and two collars, which had been hanging outside my bed-room door—I had seen them safe be<lb></lb>tween ten and eleven the same morning—these produced are them—this bon<lb></lb>net is a tuscan bonnet, but it has been cleaned since it was taken from my house—I know it is mine—this is the lutestring that I lined it with—these are my collars and caps—they are my own make, and I can swear to them. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

                  </hi>. I live in George-street, Chelsea, and keep a straw-bonnet shop.

On the 25th of August, about a quarter before ten o'clock in the forenoon, I was up in the back bed room with my mistress, whose name is Rosa. I heard Harrison, my fellow-servant, scream out. I went to the front room, looked out of the window, and saw her in the front garden holding the prisoner by the tail of his coat. I ran down immediately, but he had then escaped and got into the street. I ran after him, crying</p>

               <p>"Stop thief!" until I lost sight of him. I then waited until two men, who pursued, brought him back, and in consequence of what Harrison said, I asked him where the spoons were? he said he had not got any. I returned home and searched the cupboard; two desert spoons were gone; I saw them taken from him at the watch-house; they were up the sleeves of his coat. There is a front garden to the house. The street door was latched, but not locked. I am sure it was latched ten minutes before, when I went up stairs with my mistress.</p>

            . I am a servant to the prosecutor. I was sweeping the parlour, and heard, as I thought, the rattling of spoons. I looked round to the parlour door, and saw the prisoner on the second stair. I went and seized him by the collar, and asked him what he wanted? he said he had come to do a job. I asked, what job? He said he had seen my fellow-servant, and she told him to go up stairs, and that his master was waiting outside. He went out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160071"></xptr>street door, which was open, and seeing the gate open, I rushed by him and shut it, and held it fast. He tried to escape over the railing, I seized by the tail of his coat. He then struck me over the left side of my face with his fist. I then called for assistance; he escaped over the rails; my fellow-servant then came to my assistance. The cupboard the spoons were in is in the passage, by the side of the parlour door. I had been in the parlour about ten minutes. The street door was shut then I am sure, and nobody came in, to my knowledge, after I saw it shut. He must have opened the front gate also, for my fellow-servant had come in five minutes before, while I was in the parlour, and she shut it. I opened the door to let her in, but that was not the front door. The prisoner came in at the side door; that was also shut, but has a latch outside, and he went out at the side door; it opens into the washouse. There is a door which shuts the passage from the washouse, and he came in there. He came first into the washouse, and then in at this door; the washouse door was open.</p>

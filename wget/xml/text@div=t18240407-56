            . I live in Charterhouse-street. On Sunday evening, the 29th of February, I was standing in the <placeName id="t18240407-56-crimeloc316">aisle of the chapel, in Barbican</placeName>

I turned round, and saw the prisoner walking out of the chapel - and missing my handkerchief, I followed him, and saw him put it into his hat on the steps. - He crossed the road - I followed and secured him. He denied it, and said he had nothing in his pocket. I told him to take off his hat. He did so, and gave the handkerchief to me, and said he could not tell how it came there, he thought it must have been by accident.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you miss your handkerchief yourself - A. Yes, I felt it taken - nobody stood near me except some children.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the chapel, where I generally attend, and after some time I came out. The prosecutor followed, and asked if I had not a handkerchief of his - I said, No, for I had come out without one. One of the young chaps who stood behind the gentleman must have put it into my hat.</p>
               <p>MR. CORRIE. I saw him put it into his hat as he went out.</p>

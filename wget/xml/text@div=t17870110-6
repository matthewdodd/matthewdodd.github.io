               <p>You said, I know you well? - I did my Lord; it was very bad conduct, but I was frightened; I went to put my hand into my pocket to give them what I had, and the prisoners Marshall and Ball pulled me on the ground.</p>

            ; and as I say, I saw Marshall was the person that carried the cloak from me; I saw him tear it off myself, and carry it over his arm down the place where they first came from, when they first rushed upon me; the rest ran back the other way, the way that I had come; my little girl cried murder, and a man was coming past, and he ran after them but he could not catch them.</p>
               <p>Then they did not take your money at all? - Nothing farther, only took my cloak.</p>
               <p>How long might this be a passing? - I believe to the best of my knowledge it might be about a minute and a half; it was a very short time.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the prisoners before? - I had seen them at a public house.</p>
               <p>Did they know you? - They knew me well.</p>
               <p>No person passed during the time? - None; I saw five very clear, but I had not an opportunity of seeing the faces of the other three; I saw the faces of these two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Ball's Counsel. I should think from the expression you must be very much frightened, or else you would not have used the expression, you knew them? - I certainly was.</p>
               <p>You was more frightened at the knife? - I was more terrified because I knew them.</p>
               <p>How old is your little girl? - She was fourteen the 6th of last December; she is my apprentice; I have had her two years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Marshall. Ask her where she spent her evening that evening? - I spent my evening at Limehouse, with my child and apprentice girl.</p>
               <p>I suppose he means to ask you whether you have been drinking at all? - I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see any of these people afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you do in consequence of this? - I knew Marshall so well that I went the next morning and had him taken up; I was certain to him.</p>
               <p>Was Marshall the only person that you charged then? - Marshall and the other; I did not recollect his name till I saw his face.</p>
               <p>Then it was against Marshall and another that you made your charge? - I said at the office that it was Marshall and a man that I knew, but I could not tell his name.</p>
               <p>How came Ball to be taken up? - I saw him at the same house, at Jones's, where I always used to see them both together in company; he was taken up at a public house; I said, that was the man. I understand that they have some witnesses that will swear false; therefore I beg you will enquire into their characters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are they going to swear about any conversation with you, who is that somebody? - One that has been subpoened, that has been persuaded to swear false, his name is Blagh; I do not see him at present.</p>
               <p>Have you had any conversation with this Mr. Blagh about this thing? - No further than I heard him say at a public house, that Marshall's father should desire him to say that I was at his house twenty minutes after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Who is Mr. Blagh? - He was at the door just now; as I was going down Gravel-lane after I had been spending the evening, I went past Mr. Blagh's house, Mrs. Blagh said she had had a great loss, she had lost a bushel of apples; I said, I was sorry for it.</p>

               <p>Of these five men that were there none of them offered to meddle with you, did they? - No, Sir, I looked back ever so many times to see if there was any body coming, but they were all upon my mistress.</p>

               <p>Did she give you any other description of him? - No, she did not; Orange knew him from the description she gave, wearing an oil-skin hat, a smart lad, with swarthy complexion, and that she had seen him frequently, and that he frequently went to that public house; on the 28th, I went and took up Ball's girl that he keeps company with, and took her before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>From your reckoning time, and your observation, was it a quarter before eleven? - That was the time upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was not later in the evening? - That was the very time.</p>
               <p>Did he go out again in the course of that evening? - He did not as I saw; he must have gone through my apartment; I was up till half after eleven.</p>
               <p>What character does this boy bear? - As for me I give him the best; he never wronged me of any thing.</p>
               <p>Court. How many people might lodge at your house at that time? - We have three or four lodgings to let; we let the apartment to Ball's mother; she took the apartment; different people lived in the other apartment; one Mr. Gill had one of the apartments.</p>
               <p>How many apartments have you? - Four.</p>
               <p>Were they all let at that time? - All.</p>

               <p>Are Fothergill, or Gill, or Banks married men? - All of them married men.</p>
               <p>What time did Gill come in that night? - I really do not know it is quite different to where I live<note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> apartments<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100011"></xptr>to themselves, but this young man and his mother come through mine.</p>
               <p>You said before you had a great many lodgers, and you took particular notice when they came in? - My husband was sent for out, and I was waiting for him to come home.</p>
               <p>What time did this young man come in the night before? - I really cannot be particular; but he came in a very good time of the night before with his mother; I cannot be particular to the time.</p>
               <p>What reason have you then for being so particular to this night to swear to a quarter of an hour? - I have very great reason, because I was waiting for my husband to come home; the watchman always calls the half hour.</p>
               <p>But not the quarter? - I was waiting for my husband to come home, for I always go to shut the door after him.</p>
               <p>What night was this that he came home a quarter before eleven? - The 26th.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was the 26th? - Because it was the Tuesday night.</p>


               <p>But there was a Tuesday the 19th you know; are you sure it was not that Tuesday that was the 19th? - No, I am sure it was the Tuesday after Christmas day, for this night his mother and I were talking by the fire, and she was waiting for him to come in.</p>
               <p>She waited for his coming in several nights? - I cannot be positive to any other night.</p>

               <p>How came you to be so particular about this 26th of December? - Because it was a boxing day, and I thought I would stay up till all the three families were in; I was not out all day.</p>

               <p>Was not you up on the Monday? - On Monday I did not see him; I left my own door open, when I saw him go up stairs, and I shut the street door, and bolted it to go to bed; that was about a quarter of an hour, to the best of my opinion, after he came in, it was about a quarter after ten; he came in between nine and ten; my room door was open to see if any body was going out again.</p>

               <p>Did you ever in your lifetime do that before? - No, but I did it for fear they should go out, and I should have to get up to let them in; I do sometimes keep my door open to see if they go out again; I remember it because it was a boxing night; I know

             sworn.</p>
               <p>All that I know is this, that the night after Christmas night, Mrs. Millard was at my house when I went home, which was about half an hour, or forty minutes after ten; I cannot say to a few minutes, and she stopped there some time, and asked me to have something to drink; she went home, and as soon as she was gone, the watchman went past eleven, that is all I know about it; I keep a fish shop, and green stall; she was at my house when I went home, which was forty minutes after ten.</p>
               <p>You do not know how long she had been there before? - No, I found her there; she stood when I came home against the counter in the shop; I have known her for some years; I was acquainted so far as in business.</p>
               <p>Who was with her in the shop when you went in? - My wife and my two children.</p>
               <p>Any body else? - Not to my knowledge, only people coming in occasionally in the shop to buy what they wanted.</p>
               <p>She had nobody with her? - No person that I know of.</p>
               <p>You did not see an apprentice girl with her? - Oh, I ask pardon, I did see one child, that I forgot.</p>
               <p>What was the conversation that passed between you? - That she would treat me with a drop of something to drink; and my wife says to her, another time will do as well, for my husband wants none, and I do not; she took some money out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100014"></xptr>her pocket, in order to send for something for me to drink; some of the money dropped on the floor; my wife lighted her to pick it up; she went out of the house directly, and I went to bed; this was all that passed.</p>
               <p>This is a very small matter to take up twenty minutes in passing? - That is all I know.</p>
               <p>How long do you think she might be in the shop before she went away? - About ten or fifteen minutes, I cannot say to a minute.</p>
               <p>How long was it after she went that you heard the watchman? - Just as she got out of the door, he went eleven.</p>
               <p>Did she appear to you to be in liquor? - I cannot decide upon that, to be sure any person might drop money through their fingers.</p>
               <p>Did she appear to be in liquor? - Not to my knowledge; I have known her many years, both on the other side of the water and this; what she drinks, I cannot pretend to say; I heard of this robbery, it was two days after my wife had half a a bushel of apples stolen out of the window; it is a place that there is no scarce of robberies there, my Lord.</p>
               <p>But when you heard of this robbery being committed before eleven, you knew it could not be? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you take upon you to swear with positiveness, that the watchman was going past eleven? - If they are erroneous, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Might not the watchman be calling half past ten? - If they do not do their duty; the watchman said past eleven, I was sitting on the bedside when I first heard him.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell me you heard the watchman as she was going out of the door? - I was sitting on the bed instead of a chair, before she went out.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner Marshall? - Yes, by sight, I have known him about three months, by going to the house where he used, but no particular acquaintance; I never saw any harm of him in my life.</p>

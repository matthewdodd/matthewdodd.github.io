I desired them to go to a publick-house adjoining; I went and tendered the letter of attorney, where the prize-money was paying; and I returned to the prisoner, whom I found with the woman; and I told him to call on me at the Artichoke, and bring the woman with him; the prisoner agreed, but the woman refused, saying she was a servant, and would call another day.

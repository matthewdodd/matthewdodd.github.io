Last Friday night week I was in company with another officer—I passed by the prosecutor's shop, which is near the Alfred's Head, at the end of London-road, about a quar<lb></lb>ter-past ten o'clock—as I was passing by I saw a dog eating something—I turned my lantern on, and found several joints of meat concealed under some straw under the shop window—the shutters were put up—the meat was on the pavement—in about five minutes I saw the two prisoners come out of the shop, and look up and down, as if looking for somebody opposite—Atfield asked me if I had seen <hi rend="italic">Carotty Jack</hi>—I think they knew me—they were Mr. Lamb's servants—when I returned, there was a third person in their company—I went to the Alfred's Head, and remained there some time—they all three kept walking up and down for three quarters of an hour, and then went into the Alfred's Head—I in<lb></lb>formed a brother constable of it, and saw them looking now and then out<lb></lb>side the door, to look for somebody—the third person passed us several times, and joined them in the Alfred's Head—we went into an opposite shop; and in about ten minutes the third man ran by, and not seeing us he went to the Alfred's Head—they all three came to Mr. Lamb's shop; the prisoners stood before the third man, and concealed him with their aprons, while he took the meat—we ran across, and the man dropped the meat, and I took the two prisoners into custody—the meat was shown to Mr. Lamb afterwards—I believe the third man got from my brother officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher. The meat in question was shown to me, and I knew it to be mine—there were three pieces of beef, and one piece of mutton, twenty-one pounds altogether—the prisoners were both in my service as journeymen—I had opened this shop only a week—they had not been longer in my employ—I had another man and a boy, but they slept in the house—the prisoners slept out of the house—I had a violent cold, and had gone to bed, desiring them to shut the shop up—the policeman rang me up in the middle of the night.</p>

             a lath-render and dealer in coals: Two of my shop-mates and I went to see the Tower one afternoon, and upon our return, a little after ten o'clock, we met with the prisoner and two other girls, in Queen-street, Lincoln's-Inn-fields; the prisoner laid hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking? - A. I was quite sober; four or five of us had had as many pots of beer; she gave me a great invitation to go home and stop with her, and I was foolish enough to take her persuasions; her lodgings were <placeName id="t17970215-31-crimeloc164">No. 7, in Parker's-lane</placeName>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Bow-street: I searched the prisoner's lodgings, but found nothing; I took her about six months afterwards, at a public-house in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. That gentleman and two others came up to me and two more girls, and asked us if we would have any thing to drink; I being very cold said, yes; we went down to a wine-vault in Drury-lane, and had several glasses of rum a-piece, and then we came home, and we all parted rooms, and that gentleman went along with me; upon that, when he came into my place he asked me what he should give me; I asked him what he could afford, and he said sixpence; with that I told him I could not go for sixpence, and so I took the candle to come out again; then says he I will give you a shilling, and then I have got a shilling to spend; we all six came out and went to this public-house again, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and had two or three more glasses of rum and a glass of shrub a-piece, and then we went home again, and all parted rooms; he said he would stop all night, and I asked him for some money; he said he had been drinking in the afternoon, and left his money, and if I would stop till morning he would pay me; I told him I did not like to trust him, for he was very rough, pulling me about; he wanted to pull off my clothes by force, and I would not let him do that, and saving your presence he was sick all over me; I was glad to get out of the room; as to the watch and money, I never saw it at all; he said he had but one bad shilling and a few halfpence left.</p>

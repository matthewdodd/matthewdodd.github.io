               <p>WILLIAM JEFFERYS sworn. - I drive a cart for my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you taken up for this? - A. Yes; and was discharged: On Wednesday night last, a little after seven o'clock, I drove the cart into Bouverie-street from Old-street-road, my father was not with the cart; the prisoner appointed to meet me in Bridge-street, Blackfriars; he met me there, and shewed me into Bouvrie-street, he was a stranger to me; he told me to turn the horse's head round, and then the prisoner, and two more, put a piece of oak into the cart; a gentleman came up, and they all three ran away; he sent for Mr. March to take care of the cart, and detained me; Mr. Goodman came, and said that was his wood, and that I had no right to take it away; I saw the prisoner again the next morning, at the Compter.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MARCH, sen. sworn. - On Wednesday evening, about half past eight o'clock, I was sent for by Mr. Haylett, who keeps the Black-lion, in Water-lane: I took the last witness into custody, and I took the cart and the timber into Mr. Haylett's yard; in consequence of information, I took a person of the name of Josselin into custody, and sent them both to the Compter; they were taken the next morning before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER JOSSELIN sworn. - I deal in coals and wood, in Old-street-road, near the turnpike at Shoreditch Church: I hired Jefferys's cart to fetch away this wood, which I was to buy of a man of the name of Creed, I know nothing of the prisoner; I went into Water-lane, but could not find the place, and I then went home; after I had been home some time, I was informed that the boy, and the horse and cart, had been stopped; and I was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JEFFERYS, sen. sworn. - I let my cart to Joffelin, and sent my son with it.</p>

               <p>LYON SOLOMONS sworn. - I am an officer: I apprehended the prisoner, about ten o'clock last Thursday morning, in Old-street-road; he had another man with him, but he ran away.</p>
               <p>Goodman. The timber is not here; I knew it to be mine by a mark that I put upon it when I bought it; I had not given any body authority to take it away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was employed by two coalheavers to help to load the cart, I did not know the men; I lent a hand to put three pieces of timber into a cart, I know no more about it; it is very common at the water-side for us to lend one another a hand. <rs id="t18010218-41-verdict228" type="verdictDescription">

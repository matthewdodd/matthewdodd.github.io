Ward told her to go away, and said he did not want anything to do with her—we then walked away and she followed us still—when we got to the corner of Sloane-street, we were going to say, "Good-bye;" she gave Ward in charge to a policeman, and said he had taken her half-crown; he was so flurried he could not speak—he had had a drop to drink; not out of the way—I came back again, and then this policeman met another and he took him to the station—I went to Mrs. Benson's to see if she could prevent him being locked up, but I could not get back in time; he was locked up all night—I went up before the Magistrate the next day for him.</p>

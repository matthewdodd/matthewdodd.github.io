The prisoner was a customer, and in consequence of suspicion, two gentlemen who frequent the house, watched him. On the 4th of November, as he was leaving the house, I caused him to be stopped - I said, "What have you got here now?" he put his hand to his pocket, and said, "Only a tumbler," and gave it up; he had been in and out two or three times that day - it was in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not charge me with having taken a magazine? A. I told you that the night previous I suspected you had taken one; you produced the cover of one to me - it was taken from your pocket at the watchhouse; my waiter said he gave it to him, and I was satisfied - I could not have sworn to the tumbler if it had been out of the house; I marked it at the watch-house - I shewed the Magistrate that mark.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was desired to watch, and laid hold of the prisoner at the time, and Mr. Williams asked him what he had got - he said a glass, and that he took it to take medicine out of; he did not say it was not Mr. Williams'.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you remember his charging me with taking a magazine? A. He said he missed books and glasses - you produced a book at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in a long address, stated that he was in the habit of making extracts from different publications, and about ten days previous to the transaction in question the waiter had given him the magazine cover as a cover for his book, and this, from its similarity to a magazine, might be mistaken for one, and caused some gentleman to inform the prosecutor he was in the habit of taking magazines - that the glass was his own, and was in his pocket for the purpose of taking medicine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MR. WILLIAMS. Q. Have you other glasses of this size? A. Yes, and some larger and well cut - most of those are gone; I have lost seventeen or eighteen, besides cruets, and a table-cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lost several since my committal? A. Not one.</p>

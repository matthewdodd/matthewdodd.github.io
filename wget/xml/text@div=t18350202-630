               <p>colour manufacturer—the prisoner came to me early in January, (I had known him before,) and said he wanted some samples of colour—he said he could sell a great quantity of colour—I said I should be very glad if he could, and asked in what way he proposed to sell them—he said, "I will sell the colour for you, Sir, and give you an opportunity of receiving the account; or I will give you security to the amount of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I said I would rather decline his selling, and my receiving the account; I would prefer his security—he came again on the 10th of January, and wanted a sample of blue, at about 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound—he said he should want 5cwt. for Messrs. Wrench and Co. London-wall—I gave him a sample, and told him, that of that quality, I had only one cask, which was about 2cwt. and a quarter—he went away—I received this note about two o'clock, but I do not know the prisoner's writing—about four o'clock, a man came for a cask of blue which Mr. Tindell had ordered—that was the substance of the note—I had spoken to the prisoner about this cask, and I kept it till two o'clock, at his request—I refused to deliver the cask at four o'clock to the man who came—he waited, and in about a quarter of an hour the prisoner came, and asked me to give him the weight of the cask, which I did—it was 233lbs.—he said he wished I would make up a paper parcel of 35lbs. more, which would make up 2cwt. and a half—I told him I could not, I had no more of the same description—he then stated, that he had not got the bill in his pocket—I considered this blue was for himself—he had men<lb></lb>tioned the house of Wrench and Co. as the house to whom be had sold it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the false pretence which induced you to part with this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had talked to me about giving me security, and I was desirous of having security—he said he had given Wrench fourteen days credit, and he would give me an order upon Wrench and Co. to receive the money in fourteen days—I understood I was to have the order at that time when he had the blue—it was in consequence of that statement I gave him the blue—he stated, he had not got the bill in his possession, but he could get it in twenty minutes; and as it was getting very late, it being then half-past four, he would feel obliged if I would allow the man to take the cask to Wrench and Co.'s, as he believed they were desirous of shipping it that night—he had at first proposed that I should go to Liverpool to see his uncle—I declined that, and he then laid he would give me a bill for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his intended father-in-law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it in consequence of the statement about the order that you gave him the blue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he would return in twenty minutes, and would then give me the order on Wrench and Co.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that an order for you to receive the money instead of the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was what I understood.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he return in twenty minutes, having had the blue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not—he asked me at the time the blue went out of my premises, to allow him a halfpenny a pound, which was what he should get by it.</p>

               <p>had promised me the 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill before, but I did not receive it till seven days afterwards, on the 17th of January—the cask of blue was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had before that had goods to the amount of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at this note, and tell me when you sent this to the pri<lb></lb>soner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is dated Thursday evening; I believe that was on the 15th, five days after this transaction. (<hi rend="italic">Reads</hi>)—"I am desirous that you should call upon me, and pay for the goods you have had, or else give such reference as will give satisfaction. Punctuality is the very hinge of business."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And on the 17th he sent you a bill for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes; but I had not had the order—he had goods after the blue transaction, but I did not know how this was—he did not come to me after he had had the blue—he wrote me a plausible letter on the 14th of January—the 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill would more than cover the blue transaction and the other, but I am not satisfied with the bill—I do not think it is good—it is not due yet—if it should be paid, I shall take legal advice to know whether I might deduct the money for the blue.</p>

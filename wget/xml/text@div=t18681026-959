                  </hi>. I am a labourer employed by Mr. Blake, of Blue House Farm, Merton—on 24th September I was at work there—there were some stacks on the farm—about 2.30 I saw the prisoners in the road, about 300 yards from the stacks—they came from Barnes station towards the Blue House Crossing—the London and South Western Railway runs across the road there on a level, and there are two gates, the West Barnes Crossing and the Blue House Crossing, about three-quarters of a mile from one ano<lb></lb>ther—the prisoners came to within 150 yards of Blue House Crossing, and then turned bock towards the stacks—after they had been gone about 7 or 8 minutes I saw smoke ascending from the stack nearest to the road, about 5 yards from the fence—I ran towards the stacks, and saw that they were both on fire—I saw the two men in the road, and followed them—I saw no other men there—I overtook them on the Merton Road, going towards Lon<lb></lb>don, about a mile from the stacks—I told them I wanted them to stop, as I thought they had set fire to Mr. Blake's haystacks—they said they were willing to stop—there were hay-seeds on Henderson's coat and cap.</p>

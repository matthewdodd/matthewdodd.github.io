               <p>Do you know whether that was his brother's writing or your writing? - No, it is not, it was not accepted by the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long have you lived with Mr. Buckley? - Two years, the 4th of next June.</p>
               <p>Mr. Buckley is in a great way of business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many clerks does he keep? - Only me and his brother, I was never allowed to accept any of his bills, but his brother does, by procuration, sometimes accept bills for him.</p>
               <p>How are you employed in the house? - As clerk keeping his books; and going out with bills for acceptance.</p>
               <p>How many offices have you in this house? only one Compting-house.</p>
               <p>Is not the Compting-house divided into several parts? - There is a partition lately made, Mr. Buckley sits on one side of the desk, and I on the other, the partition does not separate us.</p>
               <p>Does Mr. Buckley do much of the business himself, or does he leave it chiefly to his brother and you? - He does it chiefly himself.</p>
               <p>Who takes the accounts mostly? - I take all the accounts of bills, I keep them myself, go with them for acceptance, and bring them back, they go chiefly through my hands.</p>
               <p>The writing part of the business is done chiefly by yourself and his brother? - Yes, in keeping the books, and entering the bills.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Buckley does not write much in the compting-house? - Not in entering bills, but accepting and addressing bills to his bankers.</p>
               <p>You do not of course often see him write? - Frequently see him write some business that we contract together, I am obliged to see him write his name, for instance, at the Custom-house, when he contracts for wool; Mr.

               <p>Was the bill, at the time it was presented, the same figures and words you see there? - I cannot say as to this number, I do not know it was there, for any thing I know this bill came to me in the same shape it is now, except the indorsement.</p>
               <p>Court. Where has it been ever since? - I paid it away to a gentleman in the city, and it came back to me from that gentleman I paid it to.</p>
               <p>Is that gentleman here? - No, I indorsed it before I paid it, my indorsement is here now.</p>
               <p>Was you paid any part of the 60 l. or 70 l.? - I had this bill for 28 l. part of it.</p>

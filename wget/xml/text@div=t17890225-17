At the time we were in the room, Mrs. Almet says, I have lost a prayer-book, she said it was almost a new one, and that she should know it again; for where she had teached the children their catechise, there were the marks of her thumbs, she see the book when she came before the magistrate; the woman was discharged at the request of the prisoners; Houghton said she only came to nurse the child.</p>
               <p>Court. Did one of the crows match to some of the marks, and others to the other marks; or did they all match to one mark? - One of the drawers that is here matches exactly, and several of them I tried there; there is the picked point where they put in the crow. I examined the door of Mrs. Allmet, there appeared marks of violence, as if by some instrument, but these crows did not match.</p>

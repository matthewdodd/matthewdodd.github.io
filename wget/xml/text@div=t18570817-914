On 21st July about a quarter past 1 o'clock I was at home at dinner—that is my usual time to dine—I know Thomas Evans, one of Mr. Wild's men, I have seen him here to-day—on that day I saw him driving a horse and cart about a quarter past 1 o'clock—he came from Union Street into Red Cross Street—that would be coming from Mr. Mynn's place—he turned to the right out of Union Street; he afterwards turned to the left—I saw three pockets of hops in the cart—the name on the top one was "W. &amp; H. Palmer" some part of the name was sewn in—I could not see the name on the other two which were below, it was downwards—he went in the direction of the prisoner's house—when I last saw the cart it was about fifty yards from the prisoner's house—I did not watch particularly where it went to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Mynn, I have charge of their store in Coppin's Yard. On Tuesday, 21st July, there should have been 164 pockets of Gibbs's hops—I believe they are Mid Kent—there were twenty-one pockets of Palmer's East Kent—I left them all right a little before 1 o'clock—it was five minutes before 1 o'clock when I got to the Town Hall—I locked up the store and went to dinner—I returned from my dinner at 2 o'clock, I found the store locked up as I had left it for any<lb></lb>thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185708170125"></xptr>
               <p>that I could see—about a quarter past 11 o'clock the next day I set the pockets up in their place and missed two of Gibbs's and one of Palmer's—I communicated it to my master—I then examined the premises—I tried the boards all the way round, and about three boards below the pockets where I was tapping three boards fell down—the adjoining pre<lb></lb>mises are Messrs. Duncan and Jarman's—the boards made a hole sufficiently large for one or two men to go through, it was the width of a doorway—if a man got in that way he could undo the bolt of the door—I had bolted the door and went out at a little door afterwards—anybody who got in at that hole could easily open the great door—when I left to go to dinner I fastened all the doors, I bolted two doors and locked one—I knew the prisoner by working in the yard, that is all—I have lived up the yard for two years—the prisoner has never worked on Mr. Duncan's premises while they were there, but he worked for Mr. Capp, who occupied part of Mr. Duncan's premises before—I cannot say how long ago—it was last season—when Mr. Capp gave it up, Messrs. Duncan and Jarman took it—I have got samples of hops of Palmer's and Gibbs here—I had taken samples out of Palmer's and Gibbs' before—to take a sample we cut the bag down and take the sample out with a pair of clamps—the hops are packed very tight to form a solid substance—when you cut the piece it is like a slice, and that is brought down to the warehouse as a sample—when we sample hops we fill up the hole in the pocket with hops as near the same quality as we can—in sampling these pockets I put in some hops of a different kind—we generally fill up with trimmings, and with others of the same quality as near as we can get them—in sampling these I had not got enough to fill with the trimmings; I had some that had lost their colour which my go<lb></lb>vernor did not know anything at all about, and I put them in—that will enable me to speak to these pockets—I have some samples here—here are two of Gibbs's, and here is one of Palmer's—these were taken out of the pockets before the 21st—they were taken down to the counting house; I had a sample from each pocket, 146 samples—I have samples of the hope that were found at the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> But the hops found at the prisoner's were not marked either Palmer or Gibbs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—they had been unjacketed, but I took samples of those I supposed to be Palmer's, and those I supposed to be Gibbs's.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>some Palmer's, and others—Gibbs's and Palmer's are to a very great extent sold in the market: I know Gibbs's are very largely—I suppose Gibbs's are Mid Kent—Palmer's are East Kent—that I have no doubt about—these hops (<hi rend="italic">Looking at some</hi>) are Gibbs's—I know them to be Mid Kent because I have seen them in the pockets—I never see them but in pockets—every pocket is sampled, and I fill up in the way I have told you—I should do so if I had not enough trimmings—no one was with me when I tilled up these holes—these samples I should say, have been drawn for six months—every pocket when it comes in is entered in my master's books—I know that the prisoner deals in hops in a small way—I have never been to his place in Red Cross Street only when we went to these pockets—in the lower part of his house there is a pressing machine, I do not believe there are any scales or weights—it has been called a kitchen—there was no cooking—there might have been if afire place had been put there—I found only the pockets of hops and a press there—I did not go into the upper part—I knew a man who used to work on the premises—they tell me his name is Ross, but I could not swear to him—he worked in Mr. Duncan's yard—the foreman of the warehouse took the samples six months ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hop merchant in the Borough—I have one partner—the business is carried on in the name of Mynn Brothers, and Company—I have a warehouse in Coppin's Yard—I know a carman named Wild, he used to do our business—Coppin's Yard is a large place, and has stables at the other end, and there are several warehouses and counting houses—Mr. Wild's stables lead out at the other end—there is a thorough—fare for foot passengers—I do not know whether carts can go through—I think they can—carts stand in the open yard—there are several generally there—I had at the time of this robbery a quantity of hops in my ware­ house—Mr. Duncan's warehouse joins mine—I had some Mid Kent hops in the name of Gibbs, and some East Kent hops in the name of Palmer—they had, on the outside of the pockets, the names of Palmer and Gibbs—in the course of trade persons who deliver hops give delivery orders—on the carman taking them, he takes the order and gets it signed by the person to whom he delivers them—I had not sold any of Gibbs's or Palmer's hops this season; not since Oct. 1855—we might have sold a few in Nov. 1855—we purchased them in Oct. 1855—I heard of the stealing of these hops and went up the yard, and saw Mr. Wild's foreman, and made some inquiry—I saw the boards and the hole—there is not the least doubt that that was the way by which my warehouse had been entered—in consequence of what was told me, I went, with an officer, to the prisoner's house, I think about 3 o'clock, on Wednesday, the 22nd—it is a private house—the door was open, I went in—the prisoner came into the passage to me, and I asked him if he had been receiving any hops—he said that he believed some hops had been brought there the day before—I asked him how it was that he had them left there, and who sent them there—he said he was coming to dinner, and he met a man who asked him if he would allow him to leave three pockets of hops in his house—I said, "Of course you</p>

               <p>know who the man was"—he said, "No, I do not know him at all"—I said, "You have seen him before, I should think?"—he said, "Well, I might, I do not know that I have seen him before"—I said, "Should you know him if you saw him again?"—he said, "I might, I do not know that I should"—I said, "It is very odd that you should receive hops from a stranger in that way; of course, you know whose cart brought them, and the carman"—he said, "No, I never saw them at all; neither the carman, nor yet the cart, or the hops"—that he was sitting at dinner, and some one said, "Here are some hops come"—they were brought in, and he did not see anything about them—I thought he said they were put in the passage or the yard—that he then went away from dinner, and when he came back in the evening, his wife said that some one had come with a truck and fetched them away about an hour after he had left—I asked him to go with me, and I went up stairs to the bed room, where I found five packages of hops, which had been put in loose—they were not our's—I went into the lower part, the kitchens or cellars—one room opens into another—in one room I found two of these pockets, and in the other room, the door of which was open, the other pocket—I cut down the side of the first two pockets, and said to the policeman, "These are our hops"—they were Gibbs's—I opened the other pocket, and the hops exactly corresponded with Palmers', but they were not in the same packages—if they were our hops the coverings had been changed—they were very nearly the quantity that I had lost—they will all lose a little—they were worth about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in. changing the covering, it is not necessary to take the hops out—you can rip the covering down the side, and take it off without disturbing the hops—the two pockets of Gibbs's hops are of very superior quality—I have seen the prisoner in that yard at different times—I did not know his name—I do not know Ross—I never heard his name to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember that the prisoner told you that the man who asked him to let the hops remain was named Boss? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most distinctly he never mentioned the name—he did not say that the man told him he had bought three pockets cheap, and would he let them come to his place for an hour or so, as he was going to send them in the country that afternoon—he never said that he bought them at all—he said some one would come and take them away—he said nothing about buying—he never said a word to me about the country—he allowed me to go in, and I went all over his house—of course, he gave me every facility to look over his house—when I said the hops were just like mine, he went and fetched an invoice from the other room—he did not offer me a bundle of invoices, only one—it was about three or four pockets of hops, and two ends—he did not offer me other papers, only this one, the invoice and the receipt, which is in the hand of the policeman now—I did not hear anything of a man named Northfield—one of these pockets is marked "Chambers"—there are several persons named Walton, in Kent—Walton's are a very good class of hops—I have been in the hop trade about nine years—there may be a difficulty in distinguishing some hops without seeing them in the pockets—a good judge can tell what class they are—it is very difficult to distinguish them, unless</p>

On the morning of 21st July the prisoner, whom I knew, called at our ware­ house; he said be wanted an empty hop pocket—he said, "I bought one of you some time ago, marked Walton; that was a very good one; I should like another like it, of the same mark"—I said, "As to what marks I have got I cannot say; you may go and look at them"—we went into the room, and the first pocket I laid my hand on was one of the mark which he had mentioned—he said, "That will do," and paid me for it, and took it away—I can tell that this pocket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one that has passed through our house, but this black horse has been stamped on it since—I have seen the other pocket, marked Walton, outside; I believe that is the one that I sold the prisoner before—I have seen the samples taken from the pockets found at the prisoner's house, and compared them with the samples taken on the prosecutor's premises—I have been in the hop trade twenty-one years, and have had great opportunities of looking at hops—these so exactly correspond that I should say they must be the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long is it since you sold the first pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might be six weeks, or two months—Walton may grow 200 pockets, more or less—I have not sold to the prisoner several of Walton's pockets within the last six months, to my knowledge—he is a dealer in hops and in pockets—I would not undertake to say that I have not sold him three or four pockets within the last six months—he never exchanged a pocket in his life—it is not a very difficult matter to identify some parcels of hops when out of the pockets—it would be difficult to identify some, most un<lb></lb>doubtedly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant, M</hi> 29.) On 22nd July I accompanied Mr. Mynn to the prisoner's house—the prisoner did not mention the name of Ross in the house, but he mentioned the name of Ross or Robinson when he was in ray custody, on the road to the station—Mr. Mynn was not present then, he came to the station afterwards—when I got to the pri<lb></lb>soner's house, I saw him in conversation with Mr. Mynn, in the passage—I heard Mr. Mynn ask him if he had not had some hops brought there within the last few days—he said, at first, that he had not—some further conversation passed, which I did not exactly catch—Mr. Mynn turned round to me, and said, "I believe the hops are in the house"—I then asked the prisoner if he had got any hops, or received any hops lately—he said, "Yes, I have got several pockets; I am a hop dealer"—I then said, "Did you receive three pockets of hops on Tuesday?"—he said he did not recol<lb></lb>lect,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185708170129"></xptr>
               <p>at first, and afterwards he said, "yes, I believe there was some came in yesterday, three pockets," and that they came in during the time that he was at dinner—I said, "Did you purchase them, or did you know the man that sent them?"—he said, "No," he understood they were taken away from his house about an hour after he had left from dinner—he said he did not know the person that brought them—I asked if he knew Evans, the carman—he said, "Yes, Tom Evans. I know him"—I said, "Did you not help him to unload the hops when he brought them I"—he said, "No n—I said, "Then, if he says you did, he is a liar?"—he said, "Yes"—I after<lb></lb>wards assisted Mr. Mynn in searching the house, and found some hops up stairs in the bed room, and three pockets down below; two in one room, and one in the other, which I took possession of—I went with Mr. Mynn and the prisoner to Mr. Mynn's counting house, and then took the prisoner to the station, and as we were going, he said, "As I was going to dinner yesterday, I met a man whom I have known trell for several years, who asked me to allow him to leave the hops are my house; I did so, and the hops were brought while I was at dinner, and I was informed by my wife afterwards that they were fetched away about an hour after I was gone from dinner; that a man fetched them away in a truck"—he said it was a man that he had known a great number of years—I asked him the name, and he said a man of the name of Ross or Robinson—I cannot recollect which, I did not catch it—I know a man of the name of Boss, and I know a man of the name of Grubb—I have known Ross to be in custody on suspicion of stealing hops—I have been using the utmost diligence in tracing out Ross—I have not been able to take him into custody—I was close upon him at one time, and he got out at a back door, and left his coat and his boots behind him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you with Mr. Mynn the whole time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Mynn went in the passage, and I went in at the door—it is a kind of lodging house—it was while the prisoner was going to the station that he told me about Ross—he did not in the first instance mention Ross or Robinson before I took him to Mr. Mynn's, not in my presence—he said a man that he had known many years—I did not hear him say he had known him by sight—he said a man of the name of Ross or Robinson—the prisoner was very ill; we were obliged to take him to the hospital.</p>

On 21st July I had occasion to be in Red Cross Street, on business, at a little before 3 o'clock—I met a young man named William Cohen—I knew nothing of the prisoner before this, nothing more than going through the Borough—I knew him by eyesight, but never spoke to him to my knowledge—I get my living by buying sacks—I spoke to Cohen for three or four minutes—after I left him I came a little further; I stood opposite the prisoner's house, and saw two men drive up in a light cart to his door—as soon as they drove up they got out of the cart and went into the house, and I saw them bring out a pocket of hops—they went in again, and brought out another, and they went in again, and brought out another—after they had got the three pockets in the cart, they got into the cart, and drove off towards Union Street—they went in that direction—I could not see whether they turned right or left—I saw nothing more of the cart—I saw about this robbery, in the newspaper, nine or ten days afterwards, and I came over and told Mr. Evans that I saw two men drive up to his house—he did not require me to appear till the present time.</p>

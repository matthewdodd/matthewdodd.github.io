               <p>I belong to the Rotation-office. On Thursday night, the 14th of June, about half after two o'clock, Fish and Hopkins brought Mahen to the watch-house, with the bag of things, and the stitch of bacon. Mahen said Jones was concerned, and had the watch. In the evening, the prosecutor and Dempsey came to the justice's; she mentioned the marks of the things before she saw them. Dempsey said he had lost a blue great coat; I remembered Mahen having one on that did not seem to fit him; I went to the New Prison, and took the coat off his back. We took Jones at his lodging, on the Tuesday following. I asked him what became of the watch they took from the place where they got the bacon: he said it was gone to hell .</p>
               <p>JONES's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going to work early in the morning; I saw Mahen standing at the corner of an alley with the bacon and bag of things: he said he was going to Whitechapel. The watchman came up, and asked him, where he got that property; he said he found it: they stopped him, and I went to my work.</p>
               <p>MAHEN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I got up early on Friday morning, to go to work; and in Farthing-fields, I found this bacon, and bag of things. I told the watchman, when they stopped me, that I found them. They said, I must go to the watch-house; I said, I would not, and ran away. They pursued me, and took me: Jones is very innocent of the affair.</p>

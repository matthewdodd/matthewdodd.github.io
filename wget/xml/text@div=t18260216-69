            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Oxford-street. On the 16th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner pawned a pair of woman's shoes, in the name of Mary Regan, for 1s. 6d. - she came again in about three quarters of an hour, with another pair - this excited my suspicion, and I stopped her- I asked where she got them - she said they were her sister's, who lived at No. 10, Oxford-buildings - I told her to go and send her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went for my sister - she was gone out, and I did not return till the officer came for me.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner on Friday, the 24th of January - I told her I wanted her to walk with me, and she said, "What is it for? is it any thing about the shoes?" I said it was - she said she took the shoes, but was in a state of intoxication at the time; I took her to Mr. Patisson's shop, and sent for Mr. Palmer; he could not say whether he had missed any shoes, but he swore to their being his.</p>

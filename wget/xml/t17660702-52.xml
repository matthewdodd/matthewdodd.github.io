               <p>Q. How do you know she ever did that?</p>
               <p>Hewson. She sometimes said to me she would go to my pocket for my key; I had used to say she had no business with my pocket; I was sick in bed, so bad that two people were obliged to get me out; but I have seen her go to my pocket many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you seen the ring last, before it was taken away?</p>
               <p>Hewson. She took it out of the drawer, and put it on her finger; on every finger she had a ring; she spread it about in the neighbourhood, that she and I were married.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, whether you and she are married?</p>
               <p>Hewson. Not I, Sir.</p>

               <p>Hewson. She kept one ring, and I ordered her to put it back again.</p>

               <p>Hewson. From a drawer, and she would not put them in again. I found the ring upon her finger; I had turned her away about a fortnight; she would not part with the ring; I took her and the ring before the Justice; (the ring produced and deposed to.) It was my wife's ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you never give her that ring?</p>
               <p>Hewson. No, I never did in my life.</p>

My father had bought me two new shifts, one I had on, the other was in the wash; the prisoner took away one of them, and had got my ear-rings in her ears.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given her any authority to wear them?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. No, never none at all; she had cloaths and things to wear of her own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the ear-rings in her ears?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. I did; she took them out of her ears before the Justice. I had been out about three weeks, and when I came home, that very night she was turned out. She had the shift on her back, and owned to it before the Justice that it was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is your father?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. He is sixty-four years of age.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these ear-rings your property?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. They are, I bought them with my own money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any such ear-rings as these?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. She never had her ears boarded in her life before the Saturday I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to have these ear-rings in her ears?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. She did as she would with my father, because he was sick in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these ear-rings in your father's custody?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. They were. </p>
               <p>Q. Was this with your father's knowledge?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. I cannot tell; I have known her to go and lie with my father when he has not wanted her; he did not want any woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your father give her some cloaths after your mother died?</p>
               <p>M. Hewson. My father was not to allow her any wages; he was to find her cloaths, she agreed to that; he gave her mourning and second mourning, or he lent them to her while in his service; she gave it out that she was married to my father.</p>

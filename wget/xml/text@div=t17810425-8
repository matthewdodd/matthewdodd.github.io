Mrs. Graham came to me from Islington, and gave me some information, in consequence of which I went on the Tuesday to Islington; I got a constable, and took up Mrs. Mills; she lodged an information, that she purchased the curtain of the prisoner, Drury; my clerk, myself, and another person, went in pursuit of Drury; we found him coming out of his lodging on the Wednesday morning, the 7th; we brought him to the justices in Litchfield-street: they examined him where he got it; he said he bought it of a woman in Mr. Molding's house, who keeps the King of Prussia's Head at Islington; Mr. Molding came up in the evening, and contradicted all he said.</p>

            , on the 26th of February; I gave him 27 s. for it; I had known him many years; he had been a servant to Mr. Skinner; I did not suspect but that he came honestly by it, as he was a broker who bought and sold at sales; he came two or three times to offer the curtain to me; I mentioned it to Mrs. Graham, who is a broker a few doors off, and she desired me to buy it for her.</p>

               <p>- GRAHAM sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a broker's shop at Islington, a few doors from this woman's house. I wanted a single curtain to match some chairs; I bought this of Mrs. Mills; I never saw it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250011"></xptr> till I had paid two guineas and a half for it; it was a pig in a poke; I found the right owner, and he had it; she had it a week in her possession before I had it of her.</p>
               <p>She says you employed her to buy it of the person? - No such thing; I went to ask her for it; she said, more than that, after the woman had bought it, tell the woman now she has given two guineas and a half, it is worth 5 l.</p>
               <p>How did you know it was Mr. Pitt's? - I saw it advertised; and I went immediately and let him know of it.</p>
               <p>To Mills. You said that Mrs. Graham desired you to buy it for her? - The prisoner offered to sell me a curtain; I said it did not suit me. Mrs. Graham found he had been to me to sell it, and as I did not want it, she desired I would buy it for her; he would not sell it to her, she knew, so I laid out my own money to serve the prisoner, and to serve Mrs. Graham: she never came near me; he came to me on the Friday following, and asked if she had come for it; I said, no; he bid me not let her have it under two guineas and a half; she sent this cook's-shop woman for the curtain, and brought me two guineas and a half, and I sent the curtain by the woman.</p>
               <p>What time of the Monday did she come for the curtain? - I think between eight and nine at night: she read the advertisement, and sent for the curtain. I was to account to him for the two guineas and a half when I sold the curtain.</p>
               <p>You had not bought it of him, but given him 17 s. and he ordered you not to sell it under two guineas and a half? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Graham. You had read the Daily Advertiser before you bought the curtain? - No; I had not; I was going to cut the curtain up, as it answered the purpose I wanted it for. My daughter said, O mother, don't cut it up, it is advertised.</p>
               <p>To Mills. What reason had you to say she had read the advertisement? - Several of the neighbours in the One Tun heard her read that advertisement, and she said she had found a thing worth five guineas, and went to this cook's-shop woman, and desired her to buy the curtain for her, but said, Don't say it is for me.</p>

The prisoner brought the curtain to me about the latter end of February, and asked me if I wanted to buy one; I said, no: he wanted me to shew it to my wife; she was busy; he said he gave two guineas for it and some other things at a sale; I said he might leave it for her to see it, and I would give him a guinea; he did; he came in two or three days; my wife did not want it; he paid the guinea, and took it away; that was about four or five days after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - Three years: he is a broker: he always bore a good character.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am a broker. I wanted to buy a jack; he had two in the sale; I saw they would not do; I left the sale, and went about some other business: some time after, going to Islington (Molding's is a house I generally call at) there was a woman in the room facing the street had some things to sell, wearing apparel, and this curtain; she asked me a guinea and a half for it; at last we agreed for 22 s. I asking Mold ing to lend me a guinea, he did, and I left the curtain with him; I called on a Mr. Brown; he went with me; I called for the curtain; he looked at it, and bid me 18 s. for it: the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250012"></xptr> next day I called upon Mrs. Mills, and I sold it to her for 1 l. 6 s. 6 d. about a fortnight after that I was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>To Molding. Did he buy the curtain of the woman at your house? - Not to my knowledge; I was in the bar.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his borrowing a guinea of you to pay for it? - He borrowed a guinea in the way I mentioned: he brought it to the bar.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the man coming to your house with him? - Yes; about two days after.</p>
               <p>What did he offer him for it? - I think 16 s. or 17 s.</p>
               <p>Was there a woman in the house at the time he brought the curtain to you? - I do not know; I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Did you see him come in? - I do not know that I did; he might be in before I saw him.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

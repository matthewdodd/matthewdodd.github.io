               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Delaport. Yes; I have reason to know him, I have lost several quantities of hair, and out of that box I am sure I lost a pound and an half.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to mistrust the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Pris. Co. I happen to know something of this affair; the prisoner was committed on suspicion of stealing a quantity of human hair, value 10 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Delaport, what did you charge him with at first?</p>
               <p>Delaport. I thought they were not stole then , but afterwards I found they were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. The prisoner brought me some hair to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Smith. Seven years, the first parcel of hair he brought to me, was the middle of January, and he brought another parcel the beginning of May last .</p>
               <p>Q. And did you buy both those parcels of hair of him ?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give him for the first parcel in January?</p>
               <p>Smith . I paid him 5 l. and for the other in May , I paid him 4 l. 19 s. 6 d. and he said that the hair he brought to me, was the hair of a perriwig-maker , who was under necessity; and he brought another parcel in July, and said it was the same person's goods; I thought then, that that perriwig-maker could not be in being then, for they seldom stand so long under such circumstances , and I had matched hairs several times at Mr. Delaport's; he offered me some hair of 5 s. an ounce, and Mr. Delaport would not sell it under 12 s.

I am a Journeyman to Mr. Delaport , Mr. Smith came in about the 20th or 21st of June last, to my master's shop to buy some hairs, and he was asking what price such hairs were, and he said 12 s. an ounce; he said he had several parcels of that sort, that did not cost him so much money , and I said they were my master's hairs I went home as fast as I could and got two or three bits to match them; and I said to the prisoner, these are my master's property. Mr Smith had not paid him for the last parcel of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120037"></xptr> hairs, and he ordered him to meet him at the Gentleman and Porter , at Temple Bar, to receive his money; and when Mr. Smith saw him, he said you must produce the man you had those goods of; and he said, you know Mr. Smith, I cannot produce the man; I said Mr. Herbertson, do you know nothing of these hairs, and he said he did not; then said I, you are going to receive money for my master's hairs, and he could not give any account how he came by them.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know them to be Mr. Delaport's hairs ?</p>
               <p>Brown . They are his hairs , and there was a servant of Mr. Delaport's , that run away when the prisoner was taken up, and I believe they were both concerned , for they kept company together.</p>

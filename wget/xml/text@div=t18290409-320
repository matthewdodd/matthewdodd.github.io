            . The goods were delivered to this order - the prisoner produced this order to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you quite sure goods were delivered to this order? A. The goods were fetched from the wharf - I do not live there; I asked the prisoner if they were to be sent, and he said No, the party would send their own cart to fetch them; he had no hand in taking the goods away, that I know of.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner give you this bill of 18l. 5s. 6d. in part of payment? A. Yes. When Mr. Hipkiss came to London, I saw him frequently on the subject of these bills; I went with Mr. Hipkiss to present this bill for payment - it was refused; I am not quite sure whether we saw the prisoner on the road, or whether he went with us, but I had a bag with some tea in it, which I gave the prisoner to hold, and he waited in Compton-street while I took the bill - when I came out I told him that they knew nothing of any such parties; he said he knew not how that could be, because there had been a bill paid there; I think I left him then, but I saw him several times afterwards - I believe he frequently came to Mr. Hipkiss' inn. and he once or twice called on me; I said to him,"These bills stand in a very awkward state;" he said he would pay them this time and that time, but he never did.</p>

            . I lived at No. 35, King-street, during the whole of 1828. I believe the prisoner's brother, whose name is John, lodged with me about fourteen or fifteen months, but not in 1828, it was in 1827; I never saw the prisoner himself there.(Bill read as in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The moment Mr. Hipkiss waited on me I went with him, and had I had the least suspicion of these bills being forged. it is not likely that I should have gone there; my reason for saying I would pay these bills, was, that I considered myself in some way responsible for the loss occasioned by my brother's conduct.</p>

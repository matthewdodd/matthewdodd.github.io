                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Finsbury-square, in the parish of St. Luke, Old-street—it is my dwelling-house. On the 2nd of March the pri<lb></lb>soner came down the area steps—I happened to be in the kitchen—he said he had come from Mr. Walker's for some jobs to be done—I understood him to say to looking-glasses—I said I did not know Mr. Walker, and I had no jobs of that kind—he went away, and in ten minutes came back again with the same story, and went away again in the same manner—I saw him three times that day—I did not see him the next day, but on the next day I missed the spoons, after I had received information—we counted them up immediately</p>

               <p>the prisoner had left, on the 3rd of March, and missed them—they had been safe just before dinner, at four o'clock, and they were missed about five—I think them worth about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I missed six forks and two spoons—I have no doubt the prisoner is the lad.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Miss Beaumont. On Monday, the 2nd of March, I saw the prisoner in the kitchen, between eleven and twelve o'clock—I was not in the kitchen when he came in, but I went in while he was there—he said he came from Mr. Walker's, a looking-glass maker's—I saw him again on the Tuesday, the 3rd of March, about five o'clock—he came from the area steps, and said he had come from Mr. Walker's again, and my mistress had desired him to come—Mrs. Mapleton, my mistress's sister, who was there, told him he must be mistaken—he went away, and in about half an hour came again, brought me a note, and said, "I think I am right now"—he asked to take the note to my mistress—I left the kitchen, and carried up the paper—when I came down he was gone out of the kitchen—I went out, and he was running out of the area gate, and holding up the left skirt of his coat, as if he had something heavy in his pocket—I ran to the top of the area steps, and observed him run down Chiswell-street—I returned into the kitchen, and missed five forks and two spoons which I had left on the dresser just before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was coming up the City-road; I was looking in a shop window, and a lad asked me if I wanted a place; I said, "Yes;" he said, "Will you take a message for me to Miss Beaumont's?"—he said, "Say you came from Mr. Walker, a looking-glass frame-maker, in Tabernacle-row;" I went, and Miss Beaumont did not know Mr. Walker; I went and told him; he told me to go and say I could not be mistaken, he had done jobs for her before; I went and told her, and she told me to come again to-morrow; he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., told me to see him again the next day and he would get me something better to do; I met him, and he sent me with the same message, and a letter; when she went up stairs, a man came down and said here was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for me, and told me to go up the City-road.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Danford's. I left my younger brother in the shop on the morning of the 14th of September, between half-past eight and nine o'clock; I returned in about a quarter of an hour, and missed a bundle of barber's weaving silk from the shelf - I sent round to different trades-people about it; my brother is not here. In consequence of information I went to Mr. Hudson's, in Porter-street, between one and two o'clock, about one hundred and fifty yards from our house, and saw the silk on his counter. I afterwards went to the prisoner's house, with Laing; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130154"></xptr>not at home - we went again, and saw him; I asked if he had sent Laing to sell the silk; he said he had - I asked if he was in the silk line - he said not particularly, but that he had received this silk from his brother, at Sheerness, about a week before; he keeps a kind of curiosity shop, in St. Martin's-court. Here is the silk - it was made for us, of a size which is scarcely ever used - it was only made in July; we had a small quantity made about six years ago; here is some brown among it, of the same sort, which we bought in the City some years ago - there are two or three different sorts, made by different makers; the parcel lost consisted of all these different sorts - I have not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How old is your brother? A. Thirteen years - I cannot say that he did not sell it. I did not say what I wanted the first time I went to his house - I think the silk was produced to him. The Magistrate admitted him to bail, and when the officer told him to come he came; I did not hear him say that his father had bought it in his absence, and he had mentioned his brother to keep his father out of trouble; he and his friends have been to beg me to keep out of the way.</p>

            . I am a hair-dresser - the prisoner came to me last Friday morning, to my house in St. Ann's-court, and asked if I wanted any weaving silk, I said, No - he asked if I could tell him where he would sell it - I said, the hair merchants were the most likely people; he said he knew none of them, and if I would endeavour to dispose of it, he should feel obliged. I took it to Mr. Hudson's, and the witness came in and asked me the price: I said 22s. - he asked if I could not take less; I said, No, that it was not mine; he said he should like his father to see it, and then claimed it; I took him to Russell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew him? A. Yes; he is a neighbour - he brought it openly, and did not desire me to keep it secret; he hears an honest character, and has lived there four years.</p>

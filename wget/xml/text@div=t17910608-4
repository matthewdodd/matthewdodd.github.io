               <p>I am a publican. On the 8th of June, about eight, Mrs. Simper's people came to breakfast, and about a quarter after eight Mrs. Simper's little boy informed me, and I went and saw the prisoner with two spades on his back, in a field adjoining the garden, about half a quarter of a mile from the garden, walking very fast towards the garden; I said, my friend, where are you going with those spades? he said b - r your eyes, if if you do not let me go, I will cut you down. Me and one East, the foreman of the garden took him into custody: I have kept the spades from that time to this.</p>

               <p>The two spades I took from the prisoner I gave to Mr. Price, I received them at the Rotation, and gave them to Mr. Price, and brought them here to-day from Mr. Price; they are the same that were taken from the prisoner; there are two notches on them, which I made, I took them from the prisoner about an hundred yards from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080006"></xptr>my mistress's house, going towards Limehouse; I officiate for Mr. Simper; the prisoner did not come to work that morning, he wanted to go to work at eight; I said, James do not go to work till nine; he said, I do not mind an hour; he went and had some breakfast, and then went and took the spades: he was watched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were the spades concealed or on my shoulder? - On his shoulder; he took another person's jacket, and left his coat; when we went up to him I said, you villain, where are you going to? he was in the regular foot-way, I saw him come over the fence, and Mr. Price was very nigh him.</p>
               <p>Whether I changed any money with Price, after he took me into custody? - He gave me sixpence, and I gave him change.</p>

               <p>I went to work, I never staid five minutes; in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour her other people went to breakfast; there were four people digging, two of them took their spades, the fourth was left in my charge; if I had lost it I must have been answerable for it; I pulled off my coat, it was nearer the house than where my work was, I thought it safer there than where it was; the foreman, Mr. East, had told me two or three different times, that they had lost tools out of the ground, therefore I took them with me for safety; I went in my shirt sleeves, I had money due to me from my mistress, wages, and I would hardly have gone away so.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. East. Do you know these spades? - Yes, by the marks upon them, J. S. in several parts.</p>

             is a housekeeper, a carpenter and joiner, a journeyman; I have known the prisoner a long time; I went to his mistress the day afterwards, and I asked her whether she would appear and speak in his behalf; Mrs. Simper said she lent him the spades, I can take my solemn oath of this; I heard of it, and I went to know whether or no he was taken and I asked her whether she did not lend him the spades; and she told me yes, and he comes of very honest parents.</p>
               <p>Did she say she lent him the spades that morning? - No; she only said she lent them to him.</p>
               <p>She did not say she lent them to him that morning? - No; she said she lent them, that was all; I have known him thirteen years. he served his time to Captain Barrer, to the seas, and was cast away on board the Old Kingston.</p>
               <p>Have not you mistaken her; you are a little deaf? - No, Sir, I have not; I was very near to her, and I took particular care; I never was before any body till now; my father married his mother, that is all the relation I am; that is no relation at all.</p>
               <p>Does he live in the house that you live in? - No, he does not; I live in Old-street-road, at No. 2, I sells a little tobacco; he lodges at Mile-end, at the Brewer's Arms: it is a great way off.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Simper. When did you see this woman? - This woman called upon me past nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>And did you tell her you lent him the spades? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What did she come about? - To beg of me to be merciful to him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say to her that you lent him the spades, or any thing like? - No, Sir, no such word.</p>
               <p>Did she appear deaf to you? - No, Sir, she did not; she told me she was his sister, and lived at Hoxton, and she begged of me not to appear against him, and not to bring him to justice.</p>
               <p>Then do you mean to say, that what she has sworn is false, that you never did say so? - If I was to say that I did say so, I should tell a falsity.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing that could be mistaken for that? - No, not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was round the world with Captain Cook, and I worked hard for Mr. Hobcroft, and he told me he would have come; but these gardeners and gardenesses hang all in a gang, so that they are obligated<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080007"></xptr>to prosecute right or wrong; they do not stand upon any favour.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any public-house nigh on the road? - There is one about a quarter of a mile nearer, the Britannia, going to Poplar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was my meaning to go to the next public-house to get a pint of beer, and return to my work like an honest man; I left money in my mistress's hands.</p>

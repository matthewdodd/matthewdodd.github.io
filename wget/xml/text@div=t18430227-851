                  </hi>. I am the wife of Rice Giles Higgins, of No. 12, New<lb></lb>castle-street, in the parish of St. Clement Danes—it is our dwelling-house. On the 11th of Feb. I had a bag containing half-crowns, shillings, and six<lb></lb>pences—I cannot say how many of each—I put the bag into a drawer in my room—I locked it, and took the key in my pocket about ten o'clock in the morning—the money was then safe—my husband asked me for the key at twelve, and soon after I found the bag and money was gone—I immediately went into the kitchen, and asked the prisoner, who was our servant, if she knew anything of it—she said she did not—next morning, Sunday, I got up, and called her as usual, and when she went down stairs I followed her, unknown to her, and watched over the kitchen stairs—I saw her take a light, and go into the yard, then return to the kitchen—I listened for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, till I heard a clink of money in the kitchen where she was—I then went down, and asked her what she was doing, what she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270032"></xptr>
               <p>had there—I looked into the sink, and found some papers, which I am cer<lb></lb>tain were what some of the money had been wrapped in—she was at the sink—I looked into the grate, and discovered a black bag, which she had taken out of the kitchen drawer—I had seen her open the drawer, and take something out, which I supposed was the bag—I afterwards found the original bag which the money had been in, in the sink—I had not left the kitchen when I found it—I found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in that bag, and all the rest was in the black bag in the fire-place—that was my little girl's school bag.</p>

HAKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had the prisoner been in your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was with me five or six months—I discharged her, and took her again, being distressed for a servant—a gentleman, his wife, and two children, lodge in our house—I do not know what the gentleman is—his wife is an actress at the Olympic, and has a good income—they have a little girl in the daytime, but no servant who sleeps there—the kitchen is under ground—the money had been in the sitting-room on the first floor.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HAKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were you when your husband asked for the key? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the kitchen—I ran up stairs directly—the prisoner was in the kitchen with me—my husband called over the stairs for the key—I did not observe the prisoner at that time—when I returned to the kitchen, I laid hold of her arm, and said, "For God's sake, give me the money"—she said, "I know nothing about it"—I was up stairs from eleven to twelve o'clock, and my hus<lb></lb>band was in his school-room—I did not see the prisoner at all during that hour—I cannot say whether anybody called between eleven and twelve, as I was up stairs—I went to bed after the prisoner—when we missed the money, I sent for a policeman, who searched the kitchen—I searched the upper part of the house myself—the policeman offered to search further—I did not think it necessary—he searched the prisoner—he merely felt her—I never told him to search for a key—I asked her for her keys—I thought that sufficient—I tool two keys, and returned them to her—I tried if they would fit my drawer—she said neither of them fitted my drawers, and they did not—I did not ask to have the keys of the other lodgers—they have access to the place where the property was found—there is no lock to the kitchen door—the sink was searched, and no<lb></lb>thing was found there—the policeman who searched is not here—my husband was not present at the search—he was at his school, at the back of the pre<lb></lb>mises—it is a boys' school—they are from ten to fifteen years of age—they go through the back yard to the school—they would have no means of passing where this money was—I rang the prisoner up on Sunday morning, and she brought the plate into my room—that was not her ordinary custom—she generally kept it down with her—I required her to bring it, on account of a house being robbed—I was in bed—she left the basket in the room—I did not wait to dress myself—I followed her down immediately—it was about ten minutes to seven—it was scarcely light—the kitchen is under ground, and is not very light.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of Bishopsgate ward; I produce two blankets and a sheet; I saw the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street, about twelve o'clock on Wednesday the 23d; it is about half a mile from the house of the prosecutor, Mr. Wright; I then saw her turn up Sun-street; I perceived she had a bundle in her lap, I asked her what she had got there; she told me two blankets and a sheet; I asked her where she was going with them; she told me to Fore-street to pawn them; I then asked her who she brought them from; she told me her master in Bethnal-green; I then stopped her on suspicion of stealing these things, took her into a public house, and asked her to be honest and tell me how she came by them, it would save me a great deal of trouble; she told me she got them from a house in Bethnall-green in Old Nicholas-street, from the house of the prosecutor; I then put her into the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q.Did she tell you the number? - She did not; I went into one or two houses before I found out this man's house; I went in and asked the man if he lost any thing? he told me No; then he went up stairs and found there were some blankets and a sheet gone; I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please your worship that there day that the blankets were taken from this man's house, I was coming down Old Nicholas street, and I met a woman, and she asked me to pawn these two blankets and sheet; I took them of the woman; I was coming up Shoreditch and up Sun-street, I met the officer, and he asked me how I came by them? I said, a woman had given them me and asked me to pawn them.</p>
               <p>Court to Sapwell. Did she say any thing to you about the pawning of them? - She told me that she was going to pawn them for her master when I first stopped her.</p>

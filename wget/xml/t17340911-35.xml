            , Constable. I found these Handkerchiefs and Stockings, and this Hat, and 2 Guineas and a half, and 2 s. upon the Prisoner at the Castle and Faulcon; from whence I carried her to my House. She deny'd that she had any more Money, and charged 2 others of her acquaintance, with being concern'd with her. But in half an Hour's time there was a Box dropt under the Table where she sat, and the Dog got it in his Mouth, and plaid with it. It was taken up, and 14 Guineas were in it She own'd the Box to be hers.</p>

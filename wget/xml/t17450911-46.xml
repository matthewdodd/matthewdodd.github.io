            , [a Clerk of the Bank.]</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you receive this bill?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. I received it the 24th of May last.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it delivered to you by?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. By Mr. Sawbridge's servant. I believe for him and company.</p>
               <p>Q. What office are you in ?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. I am in the bill office .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any short entry of it when you received it?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What book is that?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. This is Mr. Sawbridges's book, I entered it here. May the 24th 1745. Bank bill due the 31st. 20 l.</p>
               <p>Q. When the bill is not due, is it your method to enter it short first; and when it becomes is due to enter it as cash?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. Yes, when it is not due we put it into one of the columns of the party's book who keeps cash with us; and when it becomes due it is entered into another column as cash.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you do with the bill then?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. We put a number to it that we may know it again.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the number of this bill?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. It is Z 199.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you an officer in the Bank ?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner one?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you do with the bill after that?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. It is put into a particular drawer that is kept for these bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deposit this bill into that drawer upon the account of the Bank?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. I cannot say that, for sometimes I am not the last in the office, and the last person in the office generally does that. I put it into a drawer in order to be put into the other drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the Prisoner a key to that drawer?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you all keys to it?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you heard any thing of this being missing?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. About a week or ten days I believe.</p>

            . Look upon that bill, and see whether you know it or not?</p>
               <p>Greenough. I know it very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner ever produce that bill to you?</p>
               <p>Greenough. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell what happened upon that occasion?</p>
               <p>Greenough. On the 30th of May the Prisoner delivered that bill into my hand. When he delivered the bill to me, I said, Mr. Scruton , this bill is not due. He said it is a customary thing among us to oblige one another to pay a bill before it is due, if we want cash. He said he received it from a friend, and that his friend was going out of town. I knew it was a customary thing, and then I looked to see if it was regularly endorsed. I found it was not endorsed by his friend, so I desired he would order his friend to endorse it; he said his friend was gone to the tavern to drink a glass of wine, and he would endorse it for him; so I said he might witness the bill for him.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the words he wrote upon the bill?</p>
               <p>Greenough. Witness R. Scruton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him write it?</p>
               <p>Greenough. He turned his back to me and wrote it. I cannot say I saw him write it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at it, is that Scruton's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Greenough. This I take to be Scruton's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not there some words wrote over Mr. Sheppard's name?</p>

               <p>Greenough. Yes, the words are received the contents.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the Prisoner's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Greenough . I do believe it to be so .</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then?</p>
               <p>Greenough. I cancelled the bill, and gave him a ticket to receive the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it was Mr. Sawbridge's bill?</p>
               <p>Greenough. No, I did not.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Scruton the Prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Collyer. Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Collyer, you applied to him, and told him there was a Bank Sola bill that was missing, did not you?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I did so.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I can't tell exactly, but I believe it was between the 15th and 20th of June last; I was informed by one of my brother officers that there was a suspicion of indirect practices in the Prisoner, and I found 20 l. missing in a person's account. I told him of it, and said it was his business to place it to account, or he would suffer by it; he said he had a friend who was out of town, but he would be in town in two or three days, and then he would replace it, but that person never came.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say in excuse of himself?</p>
               <p>Collyer. He said he had made a mistake in that bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say that his friend was out of town, and would be in town in two or three days, and when he came to town he would bring the money and place it to the proper account?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174509110039"></xptr>Collyer. He did so.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have gone off, could not he?</p>
               <p>Collyer. He might have gone off indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not he have gone off with two thousand pounds of the Bank's, if he would?</p>
               <p>Collyer. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not he have gone off with a thousand pounds?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have gone off with five hundred?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I believe he might have gone off with five hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, if he had had a mind he might have wronged the Bank of more?</p>
               <p>Collyer. Yes, to be sure, in that time he might have had an opportunity of doing more mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever tender the money to you?</p>
               <p>Collyer. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have received the money of him before this transaction?</p>
               <p>Collyer. Yes, to be sure I should, not knowing of any fraud.</p>

               <p>Q. What security did he give?</p>
               <p>Collyer. He gave a thousand pounds security.</p>
               <p>Q. As you are an officer of the Bank, would you have compounded this fraud?</p>
               <p>Collyer. No, indeed I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not take it to be a fraud?</p>
               <p>Collyer. No indeed, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think he was an honest man?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I always look upon a man to be honest, till he proves a rogue.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you, whether a person may not take out a bill, and make use of it upon occasion?</p>
               <p>Collyer. No, Sir, I have not known it done these 36 years.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man of substance was to make use of a note of 20 l. should you take him to be a felon?</p>
               <p>Collyer. That I must leave to the Directors of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this thing, did you think he would have committed a felony?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I cannot tell what to say to that, for it is impossible to find a man guilty of a thing, 'till the fact is proved upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you reckon that a person who makes a mistake ought to be deemed a felon?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I cannot see how that can well be.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sawbridge. Will you tell us how you came to find out, that you had not credit given you for it by the Bank.</p>
               <p>Sawbridge. I had credit given me for it by the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. to Collyer. How long was it before you found it out that the note was missing?</p>
               <p>Collyer. It was full a fortnight after he had received the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner deny that he had the twenty pounds?</p>
               <p>Collyer. No, he said he had it, and that he would make it good.</p>
               <p>[Mr. Collyer said, the Prisoner had a good character before this.]</p>
               <p>The Council on each side having gone through the examination of the witnesses, the Council for the Prisoner insisted on a point of law, relating to the meaning and construction of the word imbezzle, and that the Prisoner did not come within the intent and meaning of the act of parliament; which being fully argued on each side, it was the opinion of the Court that the Prisoner was within the intent and meaning of the said act.</p>

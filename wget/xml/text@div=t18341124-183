                  </hi>. I am a housekeeper, and Jive at No. 67, Newington-causeway, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington, Surrey. On the 17th of September I went to bed about twelve o'clock at night—I saw the doors fastened, and the windows also—between one and two o'clock in th'e morning I was awoke by a ringing at my bell, and knocking at the door also—I called to know what was the matter—they</p>

               <p>told me to come down directly, for my premises were entered by thieves—I went down, opened the street door, and went out—I found a shutter-box, which is in a line with my shop window, was broken open—the lock was broken—the box holds my shutters in the daytime—it was empty that night, but it had been locked up—I looked into the shutter-box, and found a hat; and in that hat a blue bag—I told the policeman, and gave them to him—I do not know which policeman I gave them to—it was one of the two policemen—they had the prisoner Paine down on the pavement at that time—I examined the lock of the shutter-box with the key I lock it up with, and found the key would not act—the lock had been picked, or something—the key would not turn it—one end of the shutter-box communicates with the inside of my shop window which holds the silver goods—a person could get through that end into the window—I am a silversmith—they could get into the shop window from the box, and so into the house—the shop is part of the house—no property was moved at all—the inspector has a plan of the premises.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you open the shutter-box from the outside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With a key—the shutter-box was made after the house was built—the shutters rest against the wood work, which is the lining of the box, in the daytime, not against any window—the win<lb></lb>dow is on the right hand of the shutter-box—there is a wall at the back of the shutter-box—the left hand side of the box is wood pannelling, on the right hand side is the window—the window is all glass—there is a door which locks with a small key—it is a glass door—that is inside the shop—it was secured by the shutters outside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When a person has got into the shutter-box, what have they to do to get into the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To cut through this end into the window—they would have to cut through a wood pannelling, on the other side of which is a sheet of iron, which I put up for my own security, which they were not aware of—it was a plate of sheet iron—the shutter-box partly projects from the house like a watch-box.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There is no possibility of getting from the shutter-box into the house, except by cutting through the pannelling and the sheet of iron? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, neither of them were cut—the box locks outside—it is merely used as a shutter-box.</p>
               <p>—I am a policeman. The shutter-box is outside, and attached to the house—it cannot possibly be called part of the house.</p>
               <p>(The Court ruled that this was not an entry of the dwelling-house.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in George-street, New-road, and am a tailor—the prisoner was in my service, and worked on my premises. I had a cloak to dispose of—he said his father-in-law, Gale Jones, wanted to pur<lb></lb>chase a cloak, and would I allow him to take it to show him—I said, "Yes," that the price was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he must bring me the cloak back or the money—some time elapsed—I then spoke to him about it—he brought it back I think twice, and about three weeks afterwards he said. Mr. Gale Jones was prepared to pay the money, and he took it again—in about a week, as he did not bring it, I told the prisoner I should call on Mr. Jones—he begged I would not till he returned from his dinner—he went and did not return, but sent me this letter, and the duplicate of the cloak, by a boy—the letter is his writing—(<hi rend="italic">read.</hi>)</p>
               <p>" <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR</hi>,—I am ashamed to write to you, but I am compelled to let you know the truth at last I had your cloak for the purpose of making up a sum of money, with the expectation of redeeming it again; but being disappointed, I cannot see you myself. If yon had put it off, I might have redeemed it by the middle of the week, for Mr. Jones never spoke to me about it, that is the truth of it. I have deceived you about it all this time, but I hope you will pardon me, as it was done without any meaning of cheating you in any way whatever, for what I owe you I will pay you by so much per week or month, for I have got into debt without my wife's knowledge—she knows not that I am in debt to you, and that is the cause of my doing what I have done. I will give you by writing the manner in which I will pay you, or I will gel the cloak before next week is out, if you will trust to me. I know not what I am doing at the present mo<lb></lb>ment; I can't come to work again when you have lost confidence in me.—<hi rend="smallCaps">G. ROBERTS</hi>.—This is the ticket of it; I will get it or pay you for it by this day week. Pray pardon me."</p>

                  </hi>. On 1st November, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I met a woman in the Coach and Horses public-house, High-street, Woolwich—she induced me to go home to her room in Arden's-lane, and then asked me to give her some money to pay her rent—I gave her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., she went out, and returned with the three prisoners, who said te me, "Out you go"—I said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240138"></xptr>
               <p>"Stop a minute; I know you three"—I said to the woman, "You give me my money, and I will go"—they knocked me down on the bed, and rifled my pockets—two of them got their hands over my throat, and very nearly strangled me—one had his hands over my eyes, so that I could not see who picked my pocket—the prisoners then went out—I followed them, and they gave me a punch on the head, and run away—I lost sight of them—I had seen them before about town, and gave information to the police—I saw them at the station about two hours afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Needham.</hi> You called out, "That is them" before you saw us. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You came out of the cell one at a time—you were called out by your names—I could see others in the cell—I did not see you with other persons—I said before the Magistrate that another man came to turn me out—I told him he had no business there, and he went away; but you were the first man that came into the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Burley.</hi> The constable has often threatened to do for me, and bring something against me. You said that there were more men in the cell; there was only one man, and he was lying on a sack blind drunk. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am sure you are the three men who robbed and assaulted me—I have known Needham fifteen years, Smith two or three years, and you two or three years.</p>

I took the prisoners on the first charge, and the prosecutor called at the station and complained; the cell-door was unlocked, and he was shown the prisoners—there were two other men in the cell—he said, "I do not want to see any more; I know them well by sight"—there was gas alight—I have not been threatening to do for the prisoners, or put them away.</p>

I went out on the 17th of this instant and left my watch hanging in the kitchen. I was sent for and told it was gone, and that there was nobody in the house at the time it was taken but the prisoner. I went to inquire at Mr. Brown's, a pawnbroker on Snow-hill, where I found my watch. The prisoner was taken by one of my men, and I carried him before Justice Bury, where he owned that he stole it from off the nail in the kitchen, and carried it into Field-Lane; that he gave it to another man, who carried it to a pawnbroker whose name is Brown.

            . I was eating my supper at a publick house last Sunday was se'nnight. Sanders's wife came and beckoned me to the door. I went, and there was the prisoner, who desired I would pawn this watch. I took it and went to Mr. Brown's at the Three Balls, on Snow-Hill; he asked me what I was to have upon it, and I said a guinea; he asked who was the master of it, and I saying it was not mine, he desired me to bring the master of it, and he might have the money. I said I did not know where to find him; the watch was stopped. I came out at the door where the prisoner and his wife were standing. I told them it was stopped, so we went away. I know nothing how he came by it.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Messrs. Richardson and Stevenson, in Bishopsgate-street; they are brandy-merchants; I have seen the prisoner before; I cannot tell how long; he followed me with ten gallons of wine from my master's cellar to our shop; nothing particular passed at that time.</p>
               <p>On the 3d of May, tell us what happened? - I went to dinner about a quarter before two, when I came back, Mr. Richardson ordered me to take five gallons of brandy to Mr. Gurney's in <placeName id="t17860531-28-crimeloc167">Rose-alley Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Had you before he fired this pistol offered to strike him or hurt him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Had any body? - Not to my knowledge; I lived three years with the prosecutor; I had seen the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did not you know he was an excise officer, or a custom house officer? - I had seen him about six months before, in my master's shop; I did not know at that time that he was an <rs id="t17860531-28-deflabel168" type="occupation">excise officer</rs>

               <p>What made you recollect him again? - Because I had seen the man several times in the street since that.</p>
               <p>And did not you know he was an excise officer before this time? - I could not know by any experience, because I never saw his deputation.</p>
               <p>Was the other man dressed in his regimentals? - I was told he was a soldier by several people; I cannot say their names.</p>
               <p>How many? - I cannot tell how many.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you received this information before the accident of the pistol going off? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was it ten minutes? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Might it be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour? - I cannot tell; I was told by a porter that he was a man that used to go with other people and take people's loads.</p>


               <p>Which man first told you that he came to see what you had about you? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did not that man long before the accident of the pistol, say he was an excise officer? - He did, he said he was an officer; I told him if he had a mind to seize the liquor on my head, he might; it was not my place to take it off; I did not like to give my master's property away.</p>
               <p>Why not submit it to inspection, that would not be giving it away? - I did not chuse to take it off my head for any man.</p>
               <p>You say Gurney never received any of this commodity without a permit? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How came you to carry this without a permit? - The truth is, Mr. Gurney<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310048"></xptr> has casks in the cellar and cocks in, and we take his liquor in the pots, and pour it into his casks.</p>
               <p>A very considerable time passed between you and the officer, he desiring to see this liquor, and you would not let him? - I told him if you have a mind to seize it upon my head, says I, I will not take down for you; I have no permit about me.</p>
               <p>Why would not you satisfy his curiosity? - I know very little of these things.</p>
               <p>Why had you any reluctance at all to shew the officer what you had about you? - I said, I would go back to my master with this liquor.</p>
               <p>When this brandy fell down between you, did not it go the greater part of it over the prisoner? - I cannot tell that it might go over him.</p>
               <p>Did you make no resistance to the officer? - I made so far as this, I took hold of the door, and he collared me, and tore my jacket, and then he gave me a push, and down went the can.</p>
               <p>Did not you attempt to get away? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What did you say to the prisoner? - Nothing at all, no farther than what I have said before; I had my head down looking at the brandy; when I first saw the pistol; I said, you have done a fine job, have not you? when I heard somebody cry out mind, I turned round and saw the pistol, I dropped down.</p>
               <p>Did the man say nothing to you? - I had no hand upon him to my knowledge, we were very near together.</p>
               <p>He could have hardly missed his mark? - He did miss it.</p>
               <p>But if he had any purpose of shooting you he might? - It was a mercy to me that he did miss it, it was no thanks to him.</p>
               <p>Did not he desire you to take care, for he was armed? - Not to my knowledge, I believe I had some of the brandy upon my shoes.</p>
               <p>Did not you swear pretty lustily upon that occasion? - I did, because some of it went over my shoes; I did swear pretty lustily.</p>
               <p>You did swear pretty lustily? - I do not understand English pretty well.</p>
               <p>Did not you swear pretty lustily when this brandy went over you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Just now you told me you did? - That I did swear!</p>
               <p>Did you bear yourself quiet and peaceable? - I will say again what I have said before, I take my oath here upon what I do say; I do not suppose there is a man that ever heard me swear for some years together.</p>
               <p>Did not you vent some terms of anger against the man? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Why did it become necessary for this man to stand upon his defence against you? - That I do not know, there were a good many people about us.</p>
               <p>Were the people there who had given you the first intimation about this soldier? - They were not.</p>
               <p>Do you know them? - I cannot say I do; I took it as I was told, that he was an officer.</p>
               <p>But were not these men that told you this, a part of the mob that surrounded you when this accident happened? - They were not.</p>
               <p>How do you know? - Not according to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How many people were there? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was there any one there besides the soldier and officer? - I believe there was, I cannot tell how many; I did not come on purpose to number the people.</p>
               <p>Were there many people in the house? - I cannot tell how many, there were people in the house.</p>
               <p>How many within a moderate guess? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>I want to know how many people were there? - It is a question that is impossible for me to answer, I cannot tell how many, I would not affront any body.</p>
               <p>Take care you do not affront that oath that you have taken, was there one, two, three, six or a dozen? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen M'Gowan before? - I have.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310049"></xptr>Upon what occasion? - In company with Mr. Gibbs the excise officer, they made a seizure upon me before and used me pretty ill; but I think this is another matter.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think that is evidence, no violence committed at another time, can have any thing to do on this occasion; can it be evidence to state what this man had done before at another time and to another man?</p>
               <p>To witness. Had you struck this man before he fired the pistol? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Had any body else struck him, or offered any violence? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you know Mr. Chapman, he is a surveyor of the excise? - Yes, I think I do.</p>
               <p>Did you ever talk to him about this accident? - Yes, I believe I did, and so far as I can remember, he told me to be as merciful as I could to the poor man; I said, Sir, I must speak the truth, as I spoke before at Guildhall when he was committed, as nigh as I can.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Mr. Chapman that you was convinced at the time that the pistol went off by accident? - I will take my oath a thousand times I did not.</p>
               <p>To any body else? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever say to any body, that the pistol appeared to you to have gone off by accident? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you at the time, that it had gone off by accident? - It did not.</p>

               <p>I am surveyor of the excise; I have known the prisoner two or three years as an officer of the excise; he has conducted himself in that employ always as a good officer in the discharge of his duty; and particularly by a mild disposition to my knowledge, since I knew him, that character he deserves of me ever since I knew him.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of Parry who prosecutes in this business? - Yes, I have known Parry for some years; I have held a conversation with him on this subject, I think it was the 6th of May.</p>
               <p>What did he say of the transaction then? - He said so far as this, that he did not see any thing of the pistol till after it was fired; that was the whole purport of what passed between us.</p>
               <p>You have known Parry, you say, sometime? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am an excise officer.</p>
               <p>Do you know Parry who prosecutes this indictment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you reason to know what sort of a man he is, when he meets with excise officers? - I have reason to know by the usage I have had from him in seizing some liquors, that was about six or seven weeks ago; I made the seizure at the right hand side of Middle-row, Holborn; he was carrying some liquor for his present master, he resisted me very violently. I have known the prisoner these three years.</p>
               <p>In his duty as an officer, how has he conducted himself? - I never saw him any otherwise; he and I have been together many a day; whenever I have been with him, he gave me the preference to do as I thought proper, he never went rashly; I never heard any other of him, than a humane good sort of a man.</p>
               <p>I believe it is very common for you to go armed? - More does, than go without.</p>
               <p>You know M'Gowan? - Yes, he has been employed by the commissioners in the business.</p>

               <p>I was in company with the prisoner when the prosecutor was carrying this brandy on his head, he was coming across the street, the officer followed him in, he got as far as the bar, and he looked under his left hand and saw the officer, and he asked him if he had a permit, he immediately answered, d - n your blood what is that to you? accordingly the officer said, he would be satisfied before he would go out of the place; accordingly the man said, did he know who he was; and the other told him he should know before he went out; the man that had the cann on his head, went towards the back door, that goes through; the officer immediately got with his back to the door, the man came towards the bar again; all this time he would not suffer the officer to look at it, and the officer stood over his head and reached out his rule, and tasted the brandy, and told him not to go out till he was satisfied; all this while he made opposition, and would not suffer the officer to examine; then when the prosecutor said, have it he should not, he would lose his life first; the officer stood at the door, and was trying to keep him from going out; when he could not, he kept hold of the cann with his right hand, and wanted to drag him from the door; in consequence of this the porter gave him a blow, and struck the officer and brought him with his knee to the ground.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to swear that he struck the officer? - Yes, I do mean to swear it; the officer fell down upon his knee, he recovered again, and the man struck at him again; the man said, if I cannot get it out from you, I will throw it a-top of you, and he took it and poured it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310051"></xptr> over the excise officer, and it ran down in this manner, and he says to me, what are you about, cannot you assist me in my duty; I went and took the cann off the man's head, and saved about one half of the liquor; then immediately he told him he had fire arms about him, and he caught hold of him, and said if he had not the liquor, he would use him as he pleased; the man made a blow at him, the prisoner stood by, and missed the blow, and the pistol went off at that time.</p>
               <p>Could not the prisoner if he had been determined to shoot at him, have shot him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Parry make use of abusive language to the prisoner? - He did, he d - ned his blood, and said he knew he was an impostor; he told him at first, if he had not a permit, he would seize it for the King; when he found he could do no more, he was determined to spill the liquor; when the liquor was all running over, it was not till then that he produced the pistol; and even then, Parry aimed a blow at him again; he said d - n you, if I cannot get it from you, I will throw it over you; he held it on his head, and fell a tapping it upon his head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Then he did not throw the cann down? - No.</p>
               <p>Then he threw the liquor over his head and the cann? - He said, he would keep the liquor on his head, but he kept the cann on his head, the cann was taken off by me, he did not throw it down at all.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Merricke there? - Not till it was all over; I did not see a man there but the waiter, I have since found the man to be the waiter; I only saw one man in the passage, and he was a little way off; the man that was shot, was within two or three yards; upon my oath, I did not see any one to my knowledge, but one.</p>
               <p>Did not you see the man through whose coat the pistol went? - No, not till I went to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Then you mean to swear that he was the only man that was there? - I saw never a man but the waiter, the porter that carried the liquor, and the prisoner; if he had been there, I must have seen him.</p>
               <p>Have you given the same account before the Alderman, that you have to day? - I thought it a folly to speak of this before the Alderman, when there were so many people to speak against him; I can give you a very sufficient reason for that.</p>
               <p>Did not you say before the Alderman, that the pistol was held within three inches of his body? - No, I could not tell him.</p>
               <p>Did not you say before the Alderman, that Parry would have been shot if he had not bobbed down, did not you say before the Alderman, that you stooped to avoid the ball as well as Parry? - I never stooped at all, nor I never said I stooped.</p>
               <p>Was the pistol within three or four inches of his body? - I told the Alderman, I did not know how near it was.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that Mr. Parry struck the officer? - Yes, Sir, I do, a second time he struck him.</p>
               <p>Court. Then do you mean to say that there was not a number of people in this publick house? - There is a partition goes between the entries, between the taproom, and the partition door; for that reason, I could not see what was in the taproom.</p>

               <p>I was at Gurney's house; I did not see Parry come in with the liquor; I saw him after he was in the passage; I heard some dispute happen when I was in the taproom, I heard some few words, and I came out to see what was the matter, and there was a man standing with a cann on his head, and there was an excise officer asking him what he had got there; there were some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310052"></xptr> few words happened between them, but what they were I cannot say really; I went to the company again, and after I had been in a few minutes, I heard the porter say, I wish you a good day, or something to that purpose; I came in and saw the porter going towards the door to go out with the liquor on his head; the prisoner stood with his back against the door and insisted he should not go out with the liquor, and then the prisoner caught hold of him by the coat, in that struggle the cann fell down on the floor, off his head, I am clear in that.</p>
               <p>You are clear that in that struggle the cann fell off his head? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Is M'Gowan there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not let him go out of Court, I shall want to ask him some more questions presently.</p>
               <p>Jones. I cannot recollect what was said, after the cann fell down, but the porter said something, and in an instant the pistol went off and the porter dropped somehow.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing before the pistol went off? - No, I cannot be certain with respect to that; the pistol went off, and I felt a shock just by my hip bone, I looked down and found the ball had passed through my coat.</p>
               <p>You saw the porter attempt to go out? - The person who received the ball and several others were in the passage.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did the porter strike the officer or not? - I am upon my oath, and I did not see him lift up his hand against him.</p>
               <p>Could he, without your seeing him? - I do not think he could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did the prisoner draw back, and stand at some distance from him, and did Parry make a blow at him before the pistol went off? - No, Sir, the prisoner could not draw back, because his back was close to the door and therefore he could not draw back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. In the first place you was in the tap-room, and only heard what was going on in the passage? - I could not see the first beginning of it.</p>
               <p>At the time you first went into the passage, they were squabbling together? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>How many people were in the tap-room? - I did not count them.</p>
               <p>Were there any other people in the passage? - Yes; the person that received the ball stood close to me.</p>
               <p>Did he go into the passage before you came out of the tap-room? - I believe he was before me in the passage.</p>
               <p>How came it that you returned into the tap-room again? - I might want to drink some beer; I never was in a Court before; I cannot say any other reason, that might be the reason.</p>
               <p>Then you heard something again, being in the tap-room? - I heard the porter speak the words, to the best of my knowledge, it was good bye.</p>
               <p>Did not you know at that time that the prisoner wanted to examine the contents of the cann the man had on his head? - I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Was not M'Gowan at that time between you and Parry and the prisoner? - Yes, he was.</p>

               <p>Was not he close up to Parry in the very act of taking the thing off his head? - He was very nigh.</p>
               <p>How came it that you are able to speak so exact? - I have no interest in it, only real facts; I did see the porter attempt to pull the door open; I believe there were some words.</p>
               <p>Was not the prisoner then persisting in seeing what he had on his head? - I did not see the liquor run over him.</p>
               <p>Was he wet at all with the liquor? - I do not think the liquor fell upon him; I was frightened enough at the same time; this was after the ball I thought had wounded me.</p>
               <p>Did not you see that man wet with the liquor? - I saw him so in the tap-room, but I cannot say that the cann fell upon him; I cannot tell you how he came wet.</p>
               <p>Was not M'Gowan close up to Parry, attempting to take this thing off his head? - He was almost close to him; I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310053"></xptr> say he attempted to take it off his head; it came down with the struggle; the prisoner caught him by the coat, as the man was attempting to pull the door open.</p>
               <p>Court. If I understand you rightly, when the porter was attempting to open the door, the prisoner prevented him, seized him by the collar, and in that period of time the cann fell to the ground, and that was before the pistol went off? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Whether the pistol was wet by the cann falling off, or any other way, you cannot say? - I cannot.</p>

               <p>You was at Mr. Gurney's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Tell us what was the first you saw of this transaction? - I was coming out of the cellar, and the first I saw was this Parry come in with this cann on his head; I saw two men follow him in; I did not know his business, nor any thing of the kind; I heard the prisoner ask him what he had got; Parry said, it was a matter of no consequence to him; the prisoner said, I will soon know, pulling out his gauge; says he, you have spirits; says Parry, I cannot stay to hesitate the matter with you, I must go about my business; he went to go out of the passage; the prisoner followed him, and brought him back again, and told him to set the liquor down; he said he would not; he said they might take it off his head if they wanted it; they staid some little time, I cannot be exact to the time; then he made a second attempt to go out, and the prisoner went under his arm, with the can on his head; the prisoner had his backside against the door, and told him he should not go out; as far as I could see by where I was standing, the man that was with him tried to take the can off his head, and they spilled the liquor between them, but whose fault it was, I cannot tell; as soon as the liquor was spilled, Parry went down to the ground, and said, you have done a pretty job; the cann fell quite to the ground; before the words were out of Parry's mouth, the prisoner put his hand into his breeches pocket, and took out a pistol, and he fired in so short a time, that I could hardly turn my head round; I heard a man say, I am wounded; I made answer, and said, if you are wounded, I have the ball; it went in here, and was extracted from here. (Shews his side.)</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did Parry strike the exciseman at all? - He did not; he could not, without my seeing him; I am sure he did not, upon the oath I have taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How far were you from him? - As nigh as I can guess, about half a dozen yards; it is a narrow passage, and three people jumbled together in this passage seemed to me to occupy the whole breadth; the prisoner stood against the door; Parry stood towards the right-hand wall of our house, and the other man stood against the left-hand wall, and between me and the prisoner I saw M'Gowan close up to the man, attempting to take the thing off his head.</p>

               <p>Then, you must have stood between these men and the waiter? - No, Sir; the waiter was a little to my right hand, nearer to the bar, then I was close to Winkett in the passage.</p>
               <p>Was you between the waiter and the man? - No; if I had, I must have received it before the waiter; I stood in the passage, and Mr. Jones was opposite to me; the waiter was rather with his back to the bar; he could not have any more view than what I had; Mrs. Gurney had the view herself, for if she had not been pulled away, she must have received it, in the room of the waiter.</p>

               <p>I was present, and heard a noise at the bar; I went out to see what was the matter, and there was the officer and the porter standing, with the liquor upon his head; I heard the exciseman ask the porter if he had a permit; he said it was no business of his, he should stand there as long as he pleased; he stood there five or ten minutes; then he went back to the door, and the exciseman followed him; I saw him take a pistol out of his pocket, and present it to the porter; the porter immediately fell down, and the pistol went off.</p>
               <p>Before the pistol went off, had he struck the officer at all? - No, he had not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. From the particular circumstances of the case it becomes us as counsel for the prisoner, to offer some idea by which this could have amounted to no higher a crime than manslaughter, if it could have amounted to that, in case death had ensued in consequence of this transaction: My Lord, I take it that the crime of murder is only then compleat; when there is a time for the mind to operate and discover its malignity, amounting to what the law calls malice prepense; the other definition that of manslaughter, is that which arises from sudden provocation, from a natural gust of passion, without any antecedent malignity of the mind; if therefore there be clearly before your Lordship on the evidence a situation where the man is only acting in the discharge of his office, not betraying any of that malignity, but provoked on the sudden, and on that sudden provocation he acts, and death follows his act, then it will amount to the crime of manslaughter; we therefore contend, that if death had ensued, the circumstances of this transaction would not have betrayed any of that deeper malignity, that the circumstance of firing, would have been that energy of the mind arising from a sudden gust of passion: your Lordship has very well said already, that the circumstance of having the pistol about him, does not raise any imputation at all upon him; being therefore proved to have had a reasonable cause for the commencement of this transaction, going on in the execution of his authority, and being resisted, and this liquor being proved to have come over him, a cause arises for that resistance; and that accident might very well provoke a sudden gust of passion; if death had ensued, that sudden gust of passion would have taken out the deeper guilt of murder; if there be an accident in the case, and the pistol had gone off by accident, he will not be guilty even of manslaughter; if the Jury are convinced that it went off by accident, then there will be an end of the charge altogether; but supposing it should happen that more credit is given to the witnesses for the prosecution than to M'Gowan; even in in that case the witnesses on the part of the prosecution cannot have established any other crime than that of manslaughter, supposing that there should ultimately be such contradiction; still there will enough arise out of that evidence to build substantial circumstances upon, that the man was acting in the execution of his duty, that he was resisted, that there was every degree of resistance made to him, namely as to the search, under this resistance, there is a cause for the mind to grow more and more enraged, than if there was no obstruction made to the execution of authority; and there is the other accident in, of this liquor being thrown over him; M'Gowan says, who is the only witness that could know any thing of that transaction, that it seemed to be done on purpose; then that accident would assist the idea, and I should think that the present instance could by no means have been carried further than manslaughter if death had ensued.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow spoke on the same side.</p>
               <p>Court. I am clearly and decidedly of opinion, that there is nothing in the objection, and I shall give my reasons in my address to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the prisoner is indicted for an offence that is made capital by an act of parliament, he is indicted, for maliciously and wilfully shooting at

            , that is the short charge in the indictment, and that is the description of of the offence from which the legislature of this country has thought it proper to take away the benefit of the clergy to any person that shall willfully and maliciously shoot at any person in a dwelling house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310056"></xptr> or in any other place; the offence is wilfully and maliciously shooting, and it is necessary for me to state first to you, what appears to me to be clearly law on this act of parliament; the offence is described in very few and very clear words, and this clause in the act of parliament, is one instance, among many, how much preferable the short, clear, distinct definitions of offences which we meet with in some acts of parliament are, to the very perplex ones you meet with in others; I cannot explain it more clearly than in very few words of the act of parliament itself, it is maliciously shooting at a person; now it is upon the word maliciously, which is the very essence of the charge that I ground the opinion which I have declared, and from which, nothing as yet has induced me to depart; which is, that no shooting under this act of parliament; where death does not ensue, will be a capital offence within the act of parliament which would not have been murder if death had ensued; that I conceive is a principle that clearly follows from the word maliciously rightly understood; an accidental shooting is not within this act of parliament, because it is neither done willfully nor maliciously; a shooting in the heat of passion upon such ground of provocation as the law makes allowance for, is not within this act of parliament, because it is not a malicious shooting.</p>

On the 28th of March, about eight in the morning, I was in the window putting goods in, I saw the prisoner come and stand before the window, and with an instrument which I saw in his hand, he pressed against, one corner of the glass, and broke it; I immediately, left the window, went into the street, and caught him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any instrument on him - A. The constable did.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not taken any thing, had he - A. No; he turned his back as soon as he had broke the glass, and walked off.</p>
               <p>THOMAS - . I am a constable. I searched the prisoner and found this pair of scissars on him; they are separate, the rivet is out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a lamp lighter; I brought the scissars with me to be rivetted; that gentleman catched hold of me about three doors from the place, he said he could swear to me because I had a white apron on; I was searched, and a pair of scissars was found on me; I was sent on board the tender, I was not fit to serve his Majesty, I came back and had another hearing and was sent here.</p>

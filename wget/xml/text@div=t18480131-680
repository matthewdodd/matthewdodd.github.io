               <p>Wardour-street, Soho. On Thursday morning, 13th Jan., about eight o'clock Charles Everard came to our shop and purchased a loaf, and some tea and sugar—he tied them in a bundle which he had with him, and he asked if I would allow him to leave it for a few minutes, which I did—he did not come for it, and I called in an officer—there were new coats in it, besides the tea, sugar, and bread—Charles came about ten o'clock at night—Wells took him and the coats.</p>

I was called to Garratt's—the bundle containing the coats, tea sugar, and bread—was shown me—part of the binding in the coats had been cut away—I went home, put on a plain coat, went to the shop, and waited—Charles Everard came about ten o'clock—I heard him ask for his bundle—he was told to come into the parlour for it—I shut the parlour door, and put my back against it—I told him I was an officer, and asked what the bundle contained—he said, "Coats"—I asked what he was—he said, "A tailor"—said, "I suppose you made these coats?"—he said no. he bought them some time since of a man he did not know—I asked him where he lived—he said with his father, but his father knew nothing of the coats—I took him to the station—in going along he said it was no use concealing it any longer, he was found on him, which has been given up—I went to 62, George-street, Hampstead-road, and found two more coats there—one of them had Mr. Bax's label on it—on 17th Jan. I went to the Yorkshire Grey in Piccadilly, and saw Ann Pollard—she gave me this coat—the label appears to have been <hi rend="italic">recently taken off it</hi>—I went to thomas Everard's house, beckoned him out, and said he must consider himself my prisoner—I asked him if he had been to Mr. Dawson's, in Piccadilly, and said, "You know the suit I am on"—he said, "I do, the suit of my brother Charles"—I went to his house again on the 14th, and found a coat there without a label.</p>

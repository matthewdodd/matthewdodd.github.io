About six or seven o'clock in the evening of the 13th of March, the prisoner came and demanded two baskets and a bag that I had on the Saturday, belonging to Mr. Wright, and they were delivered to him—he took them away—the two baskets were marked with the name of Wright, in red letters, and the bag and cloth had the name in full in red letters—he wanted a leg of pork as well, and as he was going away, he said his master had told him to get 2lbs. of tobacco, but he had not told him where; and I sent him</p>

Mark! Mark!"walked on, and did not stop—he said, "That is my partner; we get our living by selling things about"—in searching him I found this bill of the tobacco.</p>

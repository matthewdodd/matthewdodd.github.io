                  </hi>. I am the wife of Septimus Johnson, of King-street, Golden-square. The prisoner lived with me about two months, as servant of all work—I went up stairs into my bed-rooms, after a fit of sickness, and saw the prisoner's box stand open—I saw in it my silver thimble, which had been lost ever since Christmas—I looked further, and saw a spoon marked "J. L."—I found my necklace, which had been taken out of my box in September—the prisoner was going away, and I let her go, but told her I should not pay her wages till I looked over my things—I and my husband looked, and missed a great many things—she came again for her wages—I called her into my bed-room, and asked her if she could give me any account of my things taken in September last—she said she knew nothing about them, and she wished God might strike her dead if she did—I said, "Will you allow me to look into your box?"—she pulled up her gown to search for her key, but I had locked the room where her box was—I then found these things in her box—part of them are mine, and part are Mr. Long's.</p>

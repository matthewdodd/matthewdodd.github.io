                  </hi>. I am a picture-frame and window-blind maker, and live at Mr. Fisher's, 118, Strand, with my wife and family—we occupy the basement, and my wife acts as housekeeper—Mr. Fisher does not live on the premises—Mr. Stennett, Mr. Fishers foreman, his wife and family, occupy the fourth floor—the first floor is used by Mr. Fisher as a show-room, and the second and third floors are let as offices to Mr. Cooper, an engineer—the access to those floors is by a private door in Arundel Street—inside the shop there is a staircase, leading up through the show-room to Mr. Stennett's apartments on the fourth floor—there is no door out of the show-room on to the staircase leading up to the second and third floors—the entranoe in Arundel Street communicates with the shop as well as the private part of the house, but has no communication with the show-room—Stennett closes the shop at night—about last January Campbell came into my rooms to take possession as a broker's man under a bill of sale—he was paid out on the 12th or 13th January—I saw him two or three times in the street between then and October last—on the 18th October I was at home and received a message, in oonsequenoe of which I went out and saw Cambell standing in Arundel Street, and we went into a public-house in Arundel Street, where I saw Wickham and Scott, whom I had not seen before—Campbell asked me about some picture-frames—he then said, "If I were living in that place I would not be short of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with all that stuff about"—I don't know that the others could hear—they were about three yards off, and he spoke in an undex<lb></lb>tone—he asked me as to the means of getting into the show-room, and</p>

               <p>the premises to see which was the best way of getting into Mr. Fisher's shop—I told him I did not know; I would try and take him over—I asked Wickham, "What are you going to do with the gimlet?"—he said, "It saves a lot of trouble and time"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "We bore a hole in the doors or shutters, and then place a waxed end through the hole and tie it to the lock or bolts"—we then left the Bird-in-Hand and went towards the Strand—Wickham and Campbell together told me they were going to do a <hi rend="italic">job</hi> in the Strand—I saw them across the Strand towards the Lyceum Theatre—I reported all this to the police the same night—the next Friday I went to the Howard Arms, in Arundel Street, and met Campbell—I left him at the Howard Arms—I then went down to Fisher's and let Campbell in, and sent my wife out a few minutes after—we had some conversation about picture frames—I then took him up to the second floor and showed him the par<lb></lb>tition dividing off the show-room—after a short time he went out, after making an appointment to meet me at the corner of Newcastle Street—at the time I was showing him the partition there were two constables, Scandrett and Chamberlain, concealed—I then went out and met Camp<lb></lb>bell at the Spotted Dog, at the corner of Newcastle Street—we then went to Theobald's Road—we went from there to the Bird-in-Hand, Long Acre—we waited outside a short time—Wickham and Scott came up, and Campbell told them he had been over the place, and he explained the premises to them—while this was going on Scandrett passed us and went into the public-house—he was in plain clothes—we all four went into the public-house and had some beer—they were suspi<lb></lb>cious of Scandrett, and Wickham said to Scott, "Follow him and see what he is; I don't like the looks of him"—Scott went out, and shortly after returned, and called out Wickham—Wickham went out, and was gone about five minutes, and returned and said they did not think he was anything, meaning the police, he did not look like one of them, and I told them that if they thought it was a policeman I had better get away—they said, "No, it is all right"—I told them I felt very fidgety, and thought I would go home—after Campbell explained to Wickham, Wick<lb></lb>ham said, "Can you get us the impression or the room-door key, if you cannot, the street-door key?"—I told him I did not know, but would try—Wickham then said, "We trust you in everything, and if you put us away, what benefit would it be to you? you will ruin me, as I have been away before; I have been convicted in the name of Wilson"—I told him I should not put him away—he said if I did it would be the 
death of him—Wickham said, "I have been had up on suspicion of stealing Captain Bonham's jewels, about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, and I knew nothing about them; we done a job some time ago at Stevens's, in the Strand, in the same line as Fisher, and there was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward offered for that, and they never found us out"—Campbell asked Wickham if he had any money to pay for a drop of beer, and he said, "No, but I will go and get a drop of beer, though," and he went into the Bird-in-Hand and got a quart of beer on credit—Wickham said, "We must do that house in Garrick Street, as we must have some money somehow or other; we are depending upon that for our Sunday dinner"—I made an appoint<lb></lb>ment with Campbell to meet him at Garrick Street on Saturday at 12 o'clock, to give him an impression of the key, if I could get it—on Saturday I went to the Bird-in-Hand with Campbell, and met Scott there—Wickham</p>

               <p>came in afterwards and asked me if I had got the impression of the key—I told him no, but I thought I could get it by night—he asked me what time, and I told him not before 9 o'clock, during the time my wife was cleaning—on Saturday night I met Scott at the corner of Rose Street, and we went to Garrick Street—Wickham and Campbell came' up and asked me if I had got the impression of the key—I said "Yes," and I gave it to Wickham, and he gave it to Campbell—Camp<lb></lb>bell said, "It will do first-class." (<hi rend="italic">At this stage of the proceedings Wickham pleaded guilty as an accessory before the fact.</hi>) I had several conversations and meetings with Campbell, Scott, and Wickham before the premises were attempted to be broken into—during some of these conversations a man named Jingle was mentioned—he is the prisoner Gurner—I saw Gurner on Monday morning, the 25th, at about 12 o'clock, at the Bird-in-Hand—the landlord said to Gurner, "How are you getting on, Jingle?"—shortly after Scott came in and spoke to Gurner; shortly after him came Campbell—then I heard Campbell tell Gurner that "Joe" wanted to see him—Gurner said, "I thought he would be here"—he then went away—on Monday night I saw Gurner at the Bird-in-Hand with Campbell and Scott—I was introduced by Campbell to Gurner—Campbell said, "This is a friend of ours, he is all right"—Gurner said, "That is all right as long as I know who is present"—Gurner then said, "Do you Know if the job will go off straight?"—I said, to the best of my knowledge I thought it would—Gurner then said, "I hope it will, as I have done lots of jobs for 'Joe' before, and do not wish to get myself into trouble"—I told him I thought it would be all right—on Tuesday, the 26th, at about 12.30, I went to the Bird-in-Hand again, and saw all the prisoners—Gurner said to Wickham, "Do you know when you will want me?"—Wickham then said, "Meet me here between 6 and 7 o'clock without fail to-night"—Gurner then left—we met again about 4 o'clock at the Drury public-house in Catherine Street—Jingle did not come in—I saw Jingle again on Wednesday, about 6.10 a.m., at the corner of Wych Street—he was with his Hansom cab; they just came out of the public-house as I got there—Campbell and Scott were then in the custody of the officers inside our premises—I said, "Make haste, they are waiting at the door for you"—Wickham then said, "What the d—and hell are you out here for?"—I said that they were getting anxious—Gurner then said, "Have they got the things ready?"—I said, "Yes"—Wickham then said to me, "Go on indoors"—I then went indoors and took up a bag that had been prepared before by the police inside, and I placed it in the cab which had followed me down Arundel Street, two doors past ours—Gurner was driving his cab—I put the bag in, and Wickham went and rapped at the private door, and said, "Come out, you b—fools"—Scandrett and Gregory then ran up and secured them—directly I put the bag in the cab Gurner drove off towards the Embankment—Wickham said, in the presence of the other prisoners, the stuff would be divided—Wickham said if I got into trouble he would engage Mr. Keith Frith to defend me—during this time I was daily in communication with the police.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi>). I, with two other police sergeants, kept observation on Mr. Fisher's house on the night of the 26th October—at 5.10 a.m. on the 27th I saw Gurner on St. Clement's cab-rank with a hansom, No. 8037—I said to him, "Drive me to Shoreditch Church"—he said, "Take the first cab"—I said, "There is no hansom there"—he said, "I don't want a job"—on leaving him, I saw Wickham coming round by the churchyard on the west side of the church—I watched him and saw him go up to Gurner—Gurner got down from the cab, and they stood in conversation for about ten minutes—I then saw Wickham go round the churchyard on the north of Mr. Fisher's house—he returned some</p>

I am a dressing-case maker of 188, Strand—Neate and his wife live in the basement of my house, and the fore<lb></lb>man, Stennett, at the top—about the 18th October Neate communicated to me some proposition which had been made to him, and I sent him to the police-station at Bow Street, and he from time to time informed me what was going on—in the shop is the most valuable property—there are dressing-cases there of the value of £70 to £80, the value consisting in the gold and silver fittings—on the 26th October I was with the police, and saw the place where the panel was cut out—the shop com<lb></lb>municated, so that a person could get to the show-room from the first-floor—the tools found do not belong to me.</p>

I have pleaded guilty to this indict<lb></lb>ment—I know Gurner by being at public-houses with him in the evening—the cabmen from one end of Lone; Acre to the other go to the Bird—I n-Hand—I never told Gurner that I wanted to carry away stolen pro<lb></lb>perty from Mr. Fisher's house—I engaged him to take some luggage to the Bail way Station—he asked me when—I told him "Late in the evening or early in the morning"—arrangements were made for him to be on the rank about 6 a.m.—I did not mention the station—he said he would take the luggage, and I said I would let him know when—he was to be at the hotel in Arundel Street directly after 6 o'clock, but he did not know what for—he was only there as a hired man, as an ordinary cabman would be—on Monday night I introduced him to Neate, and told him he was a friend of ours—he said "How is this job going on—are you going to have me straight or not?" I said "Yes, of course we will engage you," and he asked me when it would be—I told him it would be at six o'clock in the morning, when we arranged to take our things away—he was never present at any interview when the burglary was arranged—on my oath he did not know anything about it, nor was he promised any share of the proceeds.</p>

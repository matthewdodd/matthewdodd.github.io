                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, of 17, Tower Hill, in partnership with Mr. Koch—in January, 1879, Ruppert was introduced to us, and we appointed him our traveller—he was to receive 5 per cent, commission, on cheap wines, and 10 per cent, on expensive ones, to be settled weekly—he tot introduced customers for small orders, which were paid for, and subsequently a number of other customers—we supplied them with wine to the amount of about 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. entirely upon his orders—he said that he had been 18 years in London, and knew the trade perfectly well, and would introduce good people—he said he was a Belgian, and the father of many children, and though poor he was honest, and he wanted to do the best he could for their support—he introduced a man who I afterwards found to bo Reid, as Smith Brothers, of 39, Wilson Street, Finsbury, and wines were supplied to him under that name—Ruppert said that Smith Brothers were very good people, the old partner hud just died, and that Mr. Smith kept a very good account at the bank, as I could satisfy myself—the first wine I supplied was on 28th March, 1879, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards sent more, which came to 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash for six orders; on 3rd April 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on 17th June 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 21st June 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and afterwards there was a balance due on the last order, which I received in cash—Ruppert introduced me in May to Miller and Co., 21, Northampton Square, Clerkenwell; he said they were large merchants ex<lb></lb>porting beer, and showed me a label with "F. Miller and Co." on it—he said that Mr. Miller was a very respectable man, and that he would guarantee the payment for any transactions; I supplied Miller with four parcels of wine amounting to 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and on 31st May I received 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by cash for the early order; he gave mo a draft for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is. on 2nd July, which became due on 10th August; I renewed it, and it was subsequently dishonoured; I have never been paid anything—I had no idea that Miller had been convicted—Ruppert introduced mo to Taulegne on 19th December, 1878, and said that he was doing a largo trade, buying wine, flour, and corn, and was carrying on business at 26, Lisle Street, Leicester Square—Taulegne ordered goods, and gave me a draft on De Courty; he subsequently took it up by the payment of the money, and I returned him the draft—on 18th February, 1879, Taulegno was supplied with 10 hogsheads of wine, value 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was a cash transaction; Ruppert said that as Taulegne paid me the first account it would undoubtedly turn out a good transaction—he said "I have</p>

               <p>seen Mr. Taulegne in the City; he is ready to give you an order, and he will come to<lb></lb>morrow to taste the hogsheads in the docks"—he did come with De Courty, who he introduced as "my friend"—I went with them to the British and Foreign Wharf, where they tasted the wine and bargained for it; there was a difference of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per hogshead, and Taulegne said he would let me know next day, and two days afterwards he said that he would take the wine for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash—I made numerous applications for payment, but he never paid me—I brought an action against him, and obtained judgment, but never received anything—I had ascertained that he was trading under the name of Blachere—on 22nd August Ruppert introduced to me an order from J. Lyons, of 56, Trinity Square, Borough, diamond merchant—I supplied 1 him with a small sample case of Margeux—I sent it by my carman, and received on 30th September an order to supply J. Lyons, through Ruppert, with one hogshead of claret for cash—I gave Ruppert the delivery orders on the British and Foreign Steam Wharf and on the Hermitage Bonded Vaults, and received an invoice; the transaction was strictly cash—I told Ruppert not to part with the receipted orders till he got the cash; no wine was delivered on that order, and in August I received this order (<hi rend="italic">This was in French, signed by Ruppert, requesting the witness to stop the delivery of the hogshead, as he had lost his pocket-book, containing the order for it and the invoice.</hi>) That is in Ruppert's writing—I stopped the delivery at the wharf, and on 18th October Ruppert said that Lyons had come from Newmarket Races, and was ready to take the hogshead and pay cash for it—I gave him another delivery order—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and removed the stoppage, and the wine was duly delivered—I afterwards received this post card in Ruppert'a writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was in French, and stated thai Lyons would start for Newmarket again on Monday morning, and would be back on Thursday.</hi>) After that I tried to find Lyons everywhere, but could not; the wine was not taken away, I stopped it—I was afterwards shown the order at the wharf, and the J. Lyons had been altered to L. Lyons. (<hi rend="italic">This was endorsed "Please grant one order in my name, A. Taulegne"</hi>) That is in Taulegne's writing—Ruppert gave me this card: "J. Lyons, dealer in all kinds of jewellery, 56, Trinity Square, Borough"—on 18th February Ruppert brought Humphreys to me and introduced him as the manager of a large concern, "The London and Suburban Coal Supply Association, Bishopsgato"—Humphreys gave me an order that day for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was paid by a cheque on the Birkbeck Bank—he subsequently ordered wine of me to the amount of 98<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., out of which he paid 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have never received the balance—on 31st March he gave me an order for 60 cases of claret, amounting to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he gave me this acceptance at two months—that was not paid; I took it up myself; I have never received any more money on it—Humphreys gave me these cards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in December last I found that that wine was pledged with Mr. Brown, of Leicester Square—on 23rd January Ruppert introduced me to Grouer, of 12, Clarence Street, Greenwich, who gave me two orders, one on 23rd January for a case of claret and one on 22nd February for a dozen of champagne at. 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the duty was not paid—I supplied him altogether with wine to the amount of 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but have never received the balance, although I have endeavoured to obtain it—on 14th May, 1879, Ruppert introduced me to Michaelis, of 75, Little Britain—he said he was agent for three or four respectable firms in Berlin and Vienna, that his principal busi<lb></lb>ness</p>

               <p>was for toys, but he bought wine—I received an order from him for wine amounting to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I sent the goods to him; he paid me 6?., leaving a balance of 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Ruppert also introduced to me an order from a person named Whitehouse, of 65, West India Dock Road, who he said was ft gentleman doing an extensive trade in the docks, shipping goods abroad—I supplied Whitehouse with goods amounting to 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19S; I received 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and there is a balance of 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due—I received acceptances from him, one of which he met; the others were dishonoured—he told me that his name was Cassabianca, but I only knew him as White-house—I know Whitehouse's writing—Ruppert introduced me to 46 direct customers; 21 of them have paid something, and the others have not paid, and he introduced me to 20 indirect customers, six of whom have not paid—on 6th December, 1879, I went to 6, Lant Street, Borough, in consequence of information—there is a very large warehouse there, with "G. de Courty "on the door—I looked through the window, and saw a lot of my wine—there was nothing on the door about what business was carried on—I was able by looking through the window to make this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the numbers of the cases, on an envelope—I had supplied some of those cases to Michaelis and some to.

Lyons, they were not able to act upon it; that was found at Taulegne's, also this book in which reference is made to Galway, Whitehouse, and others, and about half the entries refer to what is called "a secret account"—the name of De Courty does not appear in the book at all—it extends to September, 1879—there is a letter from Messrs.

Lyons—there was a stop on that wine—there was something wrong about the initial and the endorsement—it had been altered—we sent for Mr. de Tracy and showed him the order—I afterwards met Taulegne in the street—he said it was very strange that our people would not grant the warrant, he could not understand why, as he had been down there and shown the receipt of Mr. de Tracy as the wins was paid for—he offered to show it to me, but I said I did not want to see it as he had shown it there—on 27th February, 1879, I issued to Taulegns five warrants for two hogsheads on a delivery order, and on 1st April I issued warrants to Humphreys for cases of wine, the numbers of which ran from 51 to 100—the numbers of the warrants were 24454 to 24458—they woe five warrants for 10 cases each—that was wine of De Tracy and Koch's—they are endorsed by J. Humphreys and H. E. Dangerfield—those from 24404 to 24409 are made out in the name of Julius Mœunsh—they refer to six hogs heads of De Tracy and Koch's wine, ex Bitterne, and they are for one hop head each—I have the documents here signed by the defendant's carman, who took away the wine—I have a number signed by William Taylor De County's carman; one receipt for three cases and one for 10, one for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 60, all delivered to De Courty's carman—they would amount to 117 cases—I have a warrant here relating to five cases of brandy in the name of Michaelis, ex Kestrel, dated 15th April, 1879, deliverable to Russell and Co., and endorsed Russell and Co., and Charles Lamb—Michaelis's name does not appear on the warrant.</p>

I took possession of a very large quantity of papers that were found at De Courty's—it took me seven or eight nights to go through them—there were also books—all the books are here—the majority of the documents were found in Lant Street, but some at Union Court—I know nothing personally of there having been a fire in Lant Street—I was never there—it was so stated—I don't know that there was a restaurant underneath—the books show evident traces of water—I think I have put in all the papers that were found—I have no recollection of a bill of Mr. Singer to De Courty for truffles and other things amounting to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave the defendants' solicitor access to all the papers—I have simply extracted those I thought material to the case—my original instructions were to prosecute in all cases where I thought there was evidence, but as the matter proceeded I thought the case of De Tracy and Koch was so extensive that it was better to try that first; therefore I sorted out the papers that bore on that case, but I sorted a large number with a view to possible other proceedings, some of which I have here—I was searching for materials for the prosecution, not for the defence—there are invoices, and a vast quantity of letters showing orders for goods—there are a few entries of several bottles of wine sold at the time in one of the books, many of them showing that they were De Tracy's wines; many are only for a few shillings each—I don't believe there are entries to the amount of hundreds—in the scribbling diary there are entries of transactions with Sorrenberg—those appear to be advances on goods—there are several cheque books and two bankers' pass books, one in the name of Norris and one in the name of De Courty—one is of the London and County Bank, beginning February 24th, with cash 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

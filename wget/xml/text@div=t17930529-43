               <p>I live with Mr. Middleditch; I was sent from my master's shop with this box to Snow-hill; I had only one box, there was another small box in the inside of it; I found it rather heavy; when I came to Cheapside I met a carman, and I asked him to let me pitch it behind his cart; I put it in the tail of the cart and walked behind; when I came almost as far as St. Paul's Church I asked him how far he was going? he said, to the bottom of Snow hill; when I was in <placeName id="t17930529-43-crimeloc235">Newgate-street</placeName>

I gave him the best directions I could; he then slips round and takes the box out of the cart, I did not see him take it from the cart, but I saw him with the box and saw him drop it; I was pointing towards the way the young man should go, in the mean time he slips round me and took it off.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he got from the tail of the cart when you first see him? - Not a great way off. I cried stop thief! he had the box on his shoulder, almost close by me, and he ran away, and I ran after him, and he dropped the box at Butcherhall-lane; then I took up the box and the people pursued after the man; I was going away with the box, and thought I was very well off with it, but they took the man and the people made me come up to him, I dare say I was very nigh a quarter of an hour before they brought the man back; I am sure that is the man, it was between eight and nine o'clock; I saw him very plain, I am certain he is the man, I am positive; I am sure it is the same box</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask him whether he did not quit sight of me in the course of that time; the story he told at Guildhall was, that another person was amusing him. - You are the man that asked me the way to Leather-lane, and nobody else.</p>

               <p>I was coming up Butcherhall-lane, between eight and nine o'clock, and just<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290093"></xptr>as I got opposite the prisoner he threw the box down, and I ran after him, and I never lost sight of him, he went into Cary-lane, he was taken there; I was the second or third that got up to him and brought him back to give him into the custody of Mr. Dempster, and we went directly to find the box; I am certain he is the man that had the box; I never lost sight of him; he said, damn me, if I knew you was so near to me I would have stuck a knife in you.</p>

               <p>- DEMPSTER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; I know nothing but having charge of the prisoner; I secured him, but did not examine him; I had much ado to get him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think it was Saturday morning last my wife told me that Mr. Pigeon had been with her, and when she came down to me she told me she said that Mr. Pigeon did not wish to say any thing against me, as I was a poor man, he would settle the matter for two guineas; says I, I have no guineas to spare, so I will take the chance.</p>
               <p>Court to Pigeon. What are you? - I am out of employ at present; I was a clerk and warehouseman to a wholesale linen draper, I never saw the woman except at Guildhall, nor him neither, before I took him. When I came to find the bill I did not know the way to apply, in which time the bill was found. When I came on Thursday morning his wife sent several people to me to make it up for two guineas; and because I would not take it the prisoner's mother-in-law came and abused me very much: I told her if she did not desist I should certainly complain of it when I came to give my evidence.</p>

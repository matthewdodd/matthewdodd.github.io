On the 16th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop - I was engaged with a gentleman; Mrs. Kipling and her brother were behind the counter - the prisoner spoke in French, I understood him. He asked to look at some black silk handkerchiefs; I directed him to go to Mrs. Kipling, but told him in French that we kept no black handkerchiefs, but had plenty of coloured; he went to Mrs. Kipling, and she showed him several coloured ones. After pulling them about for sometime, he objected to the colour, and said he wanted some with more blue in them; my customer left, and I then bent all my attention to him. He offered 12 s. for two, which we refused - at last we agreed for 12 s. 6 d.; he pulled out a double Napoleon, I think, and wrote on a piece of paper that it was worth from 35 s. to 38 s. - I thought it was worth 33 s. 3 d. Mrs. Kipling's brother went to the jeweller's, and brought word that it was worth 34 s. - I said we could not take his money. He desired they might be put by, and he would bring a person in the evening or next day, who understood English; he left the shop, and in about five or ten minutes we missed three silk handkerchiefs - no other customer had come in in the mean time - he never called again. I saw him the following week at Guildhall, and the handkerchiefs were produced; I had the other four in my possession, and they corresponded exactly - the piece contained seven.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was not a very common pattern - I have no private mark on them.</p>

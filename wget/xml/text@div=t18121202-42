            . I am one of the marshalmen. On the 23d of November last, I was going by Messrs. Wilson and Hodgkinson's; I observed a man standing at the prosecutors house; as I passed him I thought I knew him. I turned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the house - A. Opposite of Fleet-market, the corner of the King's Arms gateway. I came back again, and was quite sure he was the man that I saw in company with a man, the week before last, at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. You came back and suspected - A. Yes, and in consequence of that man's appearance I went into the shop, I watched that man a considerable time, before I went into the house, and informed them what I suspected. I, in company with Mr. Minshall and Wilson, went into the warehouse. The gentleman that is here, told me to mind how I came down, and as he just got down, Mr. Wilson ran against something, which turned out to be the prisoner. He said, who is that, and held the lanthorn up to his face. This was a little after six o'clock. He said, holloa, who is that. The prisoner said, me. Mr. Wilson said, who. He answered, Adams. What are you doing down here. The prisoner seemed very much confused, he muttered something. He seemed desirous of saying something, but did not say it. I spoke to him, and said, you have got cats eyes you came down to work in the dark. He said, he had knocked his light out. I said, we have got one, we can find it if you had one. Mr. Wilson said, where is your lanthorn. He said he had not one. I said, where is your candle. Then after a second or so, he said he had no candle. I said, I thought it looked a little awkward, or singular. I observed him rubbing his hands on his cloaths. He had an apron on. I asked him, what was the matter with his hands. He said, nothing. I laid hold of his hands, and showed them to Mr. Minshall. He said, they were all over verdigrease. I than begged Mr. Minshall to hold him still, and I would apprehend the other man. When I returned, Mr. Wilson said, his suspicious were satisfactory. He took me to the further part of the warehouse, where the verdigrease was deposited, where the bag was deposited tied up up with this string, and when I got to the place where the verdigrease was deposited, this bag was a foot and a half out of the hole. There is a little plank to keep it in. This bag was a foot and a half from where the general bulk was. The prisoner said, he knew nothing of the verdigrease in the bag. Nothing more passed untill he came into the accompting-house. I then asked where he lived, and some one in the accompting-house took it down, I live in Thomas's-court. I told him, I had travelled in those errands, and begged he would not give me a wrong direction, to where he lodged at that time. I went there. He had left that lodging; and when I came back, I said, he was a scoundrel to send me there; he said, you fool, did you think I was going to send you to a right place. I said, now I have a worse opinion of you then at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form any judgment, from the appearance of his hands that you saw that night, being all over verdigrease, to you did it look as if it was recently so - A. Yes. When I got him in the coach I saw he was a strong fellow, and very saucy. I said, I am afraid you are an old thief. He said, I knew you as soon as I saw you come down the cellar; poor Bill for that. That was a man that I convicted the sessions before last. His name was

I said, how do you know that. He said he was in court. He then said, you think to get a forty pound of me, do you. I said, it is not in a dwelling-house; the biggest rogues get the best luck. He said, you will get nothing by the prosecutors. He said, I have done nothing; I know nothing about the bag. I said, I do not say you did. He then said, if you behave like a gentleman forty pound will be no object to me; that is more than you will get out of the prosecutors. I told him, he had better say no more about it. Then that part of the conversation dropped.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Messrs. Hodgkinson and Minshall. The prisoner was their porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the evening of the 23d of November go down in the warehouse in company with the last witness and Mr. Minshall - A. I did. It was about six o'clock. I was lighting Hawkins down, he being a stranger, and as I was lighting Hawkins down I heard something at the bottom step. I cried out, holloa. Going a little further I perceived it was the prisoner, with the light that I had. I asked him what he was doing there in the dark. He said, he had knocked his light out. He immediately was rubbing his hands upon his apron. Hawkins said, halloa, what are you doing of, and desired him to let him see his hands. On my looking at his hands they had verdigrease upon them. It was fresh as if he had been recently handling verdigrease; quite recently. I then proceeded further in the cellar. I looked for his light; no candle or lanthorn was to be found. On my coming to the place where we keep our stock of verdigrease I perceived that bag tied up. I felt of that, and I observed there were four sacks of verdigrease. This is called a sack of verdigrease. It is in leather. We never keep them in these bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout was that bag laying - A. I have measured the distance. It was about four feet and a half from where the stock was kept. On Mr. Minshall coming into the cellar I observed to him that it was tied up, I have no doubt to convey away. We told the prisoner of it. He said he knew nothing of it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these four bundles - A. About fourteen or fifteen pounds.</p>
               <p>JURY. Does that canvas bag belong to the warehouse - A. Certainly it does; there is the name of Wilson on the bag. It belongs to the proprietors<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020031"></xptr>of the house. I heard the conversation pass in the coach, that Hawkins has been stating.

I told another person to go down, and to look after this candle, thinking that he might, to secrete himself, have throwed it somewhere, and that an accident might happen by fire.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On that evening I had just been up five pair of stairs, craneing goods up with a candle and lanthorn. I came down stairs, and went into the cellar, to fasten the cellar windows. I put my lanthorn on a sulpher cask. I thought I heard my name called, I was going up the cellar stairs. I believe I went up two steps. I met Mr. Wilson, and the officer, and Mr. Minshall. He asked me, what business I had there in the dark. I went down with a light. My light went out. He said, it looked very comical, and took me to the verdigrease heap. He said I see what you are, your countenance looks like a thief. The officer said, let me look at your hands. One hand was a little verdigreasy; he did not look at both. Mr. Wilson said, I know how your hands came so, you have been putting this verdigrease into the bag. I said, I had not. He said, the man that had been convicted of stealing verdigrease, was waiting out of doors for me to bring this to him. I said, no, I had no knowledge of the verdigrease at all.</p>

             three or four months, or perhaps six months - I knew him before this happened; I understand he is clerk to Mr. Price, an attorney, whose chambers are above mine; I have seen him go up towards those chambers, but never saw him enter them. The prisoner was my porter - he came to me in November, and left about the middle of February; I put money into his hands from time to time, to make small payments for me; he rendered me an account from time to time; I have not got the last account that he rendered, as it is in a book which he kept himself; when the money was nearly expended I examined it, and gave him back the book, with a further sum - the last time he brought it to me to be examined was the beginning of February - I examined it, and returned it to him; I have seen it since, in his hands - it is still in his possession, as far as my knowledge extends; when he brought me the book to examine he gave me vouchers for his payments. When he brought it to me in February there was a charge for money paid to Braznell - he gave me this voucher (producing it) to support that charge; it corresponded precisely with the charge in the book; I had employed Braznell to do some work for me. I have since paid the money to Braznell, myself, about the 14th of 15th of February, which was before the prisoner left; he absconded on the day that Braznell applied for it; I paid Braznell part that day and part the next - I only paid part before the prisoner left, I told him Braznell had applied for it - he stopped the whole of that day, but did not come next morning - he was taken up nearly a month afterwards, I think on the 14th of March; I had not seen him during that time - there was nothing due to him the last time I settled the account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there no some account running between you and the prisoner? A. Yes; I had struck a balance at the time this voucher was given - I did not owe him any money at the time he went away; there was no book debt due to him; I had not sufficient silver about me when Braznell called, and only paid him part. I had no character with the prisoner - his mother lived as laundress in the house for ten or twelve years. I knew him for three years, and had a good opinion of him.</p>

            . I am a smith and bell-hanger - I cannot write, nor read writing; I had done some work for Mr. Arrowsmith. The prisoner came to me about the middle of February, and asked for the bill; I told him I could not write, and should be obliged to him to sit down and write it for me, and I would tell him what the materials were - he did so, and I told him to put down a new key to the back door, 1s. 6d. - opening the wine-cellar door, with eight inches of iron, 2s. - repairing a winetruck, 8s., making together 11s. 6d.; he wrote that, as I suppose; he put the bill into his pocket, and took it away; he did not pay me the money. I went to Mr. Arrowsmith for the money, about a fortnight afterwards; he paid me 5s. and 6s. 6d. the next day.</p>

            . I was fourteen years old last month, and am clerk to Mr. Price. I attend at his chambers in the Adelphi - Mr. Arrowsmith's chambers are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050014"></xptr>in the same building, below Mr. Price's. I have known the prisoner since November last, and knew he attended Mr. Arrowsmith's chambers - his mother, who is a laundress, and lived in the same building, used to get me my dinner; one day, when I went down to dinner, he was down stairs, and asked me to copy a bill for him, which he produced; he said it was in his own hand-writing, that the man and his wife could neither read nor write, and it would not do for him to give a bill in his own hand-writing, as Mr. Arrowsmith would know his hand-writing; I wrote the bill for him (looking at it), this is all my writing; the words, "Settled, J. Braznell," are my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that on it when he gave you the bill to copy, or did he tell you to add it? A. As far as I recollect that was on it - he asked me to write it, and I thought it no harm.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I apprehended the prisoner in Adam-street, Adelphi, at his mother's, on the 14th of March; Mr. Arrowsmith told me he was there.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mr. ARROWSMITH. Q. You said the prisoner absconded? A. He did - I was there later on this evening than usual, and saw him; I sent after him, but he would not come in - I sent some people to secure him till I could procure an officer - that was the first time I had seen him after he left me; he gave me the bill produced at the chambers. I saw this amount entered in his book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at his mother's the night you saw him? A. She is laundress at my chambers.</p>
               <p>The forged instrument was here put in and read, see indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When Braznell asked me to make out the bill I did not do it with intent to defraud Mr. Arrowsmith; I wrote it according to his direction, and went away with it, telling him I would call and pay it on Saturday; I went to receive a cheque of 41l. odd, for my master, and laid the money on the desk, with the book for him to examine, and the bill pinned in it; 1 intended to take the money to the man on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

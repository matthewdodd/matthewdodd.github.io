On the 9th of November, he came to a person's house where I deal, and in my presence offered to sell him two hundred sacks of flour, and to deliver seventy-three sacks<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040023"></xptr>by water at my warehouse. I agreed to supply the sacks, he accompanied me to my warehouse, and went in my cart with me to the Basing-house, where the sacks were put into a cart in our presence, to be taken to Waltham Abbey, and to be returned on the Wednesday following full. I saw him on Monday, he said the sacks were filling, and would be in the barge in due time. Nicholls and I said we should come down to Waltham market on Tuesday; he told us not to come, but we went and could not find him. We went to the mill and found the sacks were not there. I saw him that afternoon and charged him with deceiving me, and asked where the sacks were; he said, at the mill; I said they were not - he persisted that they were, but I said I should get an officer unless he told me where they were - he was taken to Edmonton, and said they were at Crouch's, and there we found them. I was told in his presence that he had obtained one pound on them, having sold them, as his own before I had delivered them - he admitted that he had done wrong.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You found them at Edmonton, which is in the road to Waltham Abbey - A. It is; we were in his company at the Red Lion public-house, Waltham Abbey, we sat down and took a meal together as good friends. I made no offer to drop the matter for 5 l. 15 s., nor was any offer made in my presence.</p>

            . I live at Edmonton, and am a miller. Three bundles of sacks were brought to my house. I never counted or opened them. I contracted for fifty or sixty of the prisoner's old sacks, the price was to be settled after they were examined - the business was first mentioned five weeks ago last Tuesday; he said he had some sacks which he should like me to buy. I was not at home when they were brought. I advanced him 1 l. on them, on Saturday evening, the 9th of November, and on Sunday morning called him over, and said,</p>
               <p>"Corney these are not your sacks," he said, they were not, but his would be down in a day or two. I consider by that that he meant to exchange them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They were left in pledge, till he supplied those you were to buy - A. I rather think it was so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In the course of your business do different people's sacks get intermixed - A. They do.</p>

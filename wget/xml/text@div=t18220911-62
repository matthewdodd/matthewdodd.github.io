The prisoner came up, and gave me a gentle tap with his left had, and snatched at my watch - the chain broke, and he got off with it, and the seals. I pursued him, and by Perkin's-rents he escaped. On the 13th, I saw him at Queen-square, and am sure of him - I was perfectly sober. I had been to the play, and went into the shop to have some soup.</p>

            , Esq. I was with the prosecutor on the 9th of August; I had been to the play with him. I saw the prisoner put his hand on the prosecutor's breast, and snatch the seals with his right hand - he snatched with violence, but did not strike with violence. We pursued him, but he got off. I never saw him before; he was in custody on the 13th. I am sure of him; it happened under a lamp.</p>

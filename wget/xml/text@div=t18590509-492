                  </hi>. My husband keeps a fruiterer's shop in Earl-street, Hoxton—on 1st April the prisoner came and asked for four oranges; they were a penny each—he said he would give a halfpenny each—I said, "No; that is less than they cost"—he said, "I will give twopence for the three"—I said, "You have four"—he gave me a half-crown, and said, "I will have them"—I gave him two Queen's shillings and twopence—he said, "You have taken a penny apiece"—I said, "Yes; you agreed to that"—he said, "I shall not have them; give me my half-crown back"—he put down the four oranges, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—one of the shillings was one which I had given him, and one was a bad one—I am sure of that, as I gave him two Queen's shillings, and he gave me back a George the Third, and left the shop directly—I bit it, and gave it to my husband, who went after the prisoner, but could not see him—I saw my little girl put it in a box by itself—it remained there till the 13th, when I gave it to a constable—on the 13th my little girl brought me a good florin—I went into the shop and saw the prisoner there—I knew him again directly—there were four lemons on the counter; the price of them was fourpence—I gave him a Queen's shilling, which my little girl made a mark on, and a fourpenny-piece and fourpence—he turned to go out, and then turned back and said, "You have taken a penny apiece"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Your little girl agreed with me for a halfpenny"—she said, "No, Sir; you told me to take fourpence from the two-shilling piece"—he said, "Then I shall not have them"—I gave him his two-shilling piece, and he gave me a George the Third shilling, instead of my new one, and eightpence—he left the shop, and ran when he got outside—I called my husband, who went after him and brought him back—I said, "You are the man that passed a bad shilling on me to-day, as you did a fortnight ago"—he said, "No; you are wrong"—I said, "You are the man that came in for four lemons just now"—he said, "Yes"—he had snatched the bad shilling from my husband in Gloucester-street; and when he came back he said, "This is the same one you gave me; search me;" giving me a good shilling—I said, "That is not the one you snatched from my husband; you have changed it"—it was a Victoria shilling, and rather new—my husband said, "I think you have it in your mouth"—a policeman came, and said, "Put out your tongue"—my hus<lb></lb>band then said, "You have swallowed it"—he pressed his handkerchief to his throat, and said, "No, I have not; and I have nothing in my mouth."</p>

                  </hi>, I am barman at the Railway Hotel, Bedford-street.

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Railway Tavern, which is opposite the Railway Hotel. On 29th July, I saw the prisoner about 20 minutes before 2 o'clock—there were two men sitting by the side of her—I was not aware whether they were together—the prisoner had a quartern of gin, and tendered a sixpence to the barmaid—I heard her say, "This is a bad six<lb></lb>pence," and she showed it to the elder barmaid—the prisoner laid down another which was equally bad—they were both on the counter together—I went to the bar, and began to question her—the two men came up, and one of them put down a sixpence out of his pocket and said, "Is this good?"—I said, "Yes"—the barmaid then asked the prisoner if she would have the gin—she said, "No"—I asked the prisoner if she had got any other money, she said, "No"—she said she got the money in Holborn—she took the two sixpences away with her when I turned them out of the house.</p>

On 29th July, a little before 2 o'clock I took the prisoner—I asked her for the two bad sixpences she attempted to pass to Mr. Foster—she gave them to me—these are them—I was then called to the Railway Hotel and the barman gave me this sixpence, which be said he had every reason to believe the prisoner had passed there—I asked the prisoner if she had any more money and she gave me these two shillings wrapped in paper, she said she picked them up in Holborn—I took her to the station—she gave her address No. 5, Turville-street, Holborn, which is false—it is an empty house, nobody living there at all.</p>

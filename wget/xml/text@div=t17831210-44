             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was walking near Shoreditch Church, in Kingstand Road, I met the two prisoners at the bar, on the 7th of November, about twelve o'clock at noon, I passed them at first: I recollected they had been in my custody before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You know you are not to tell us that? - I am telling you the reason why I stop them.</p>
               <p>But you are not to tell us your reasons. - I am not talking to you, I am talking to my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit to your Lordship, that this man who is an officer of justice, is not to tell us his reasons, why he stopped them.</p>
               <p>Court to Yardley. You knew them before and therefore you stopped them? - Yes, they are mother and daughter, I asked the young one what she had got in her lap, she said, she was moving from the other end of the town, and had taken lodgings in Kings-land Road, I then asked the mother whether she knew it to be a fact, that the daughter was moving, she said it was a fact, and she was assisting her. I then insisted upon knowing what she had in her apron; there I found two gowns, and a scarlet cloak, and a sheet; I carried them before Justice Wilmot, the young one (Slade) said, she had fetched them out of pawn in Oxford Road, I then asked the Magistrate leave to enquire into the facts; in the mean while the prosecutor's wife came up to the office, wringing her hands, and saying they were robbed, I told them to make themselves easy, I shewed them the things, and the woman said they were hers.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there any other things found but these? - No, they were in the prisoner Slade's lap, and this key I found on her, which opens the prosecutor's door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How do you know that, did you ever try it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then do not tell us any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was present when it was tried in the door? - The wife.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Eggleston. Did you go with him when he tried that key? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Yardley. What did you do with the key you found on the prisoner? - I delivered it to one of our officers, he is not here. I received this key from him.</p>
               <p>I want to understand a little further about this key, whether you are entitled to introduce it, in the manner you have done, to the jury; you having found a key on one of the prisoners, delivered that key to one of your officers, who is not here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100079"></xptr>Who was he? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>You have now a key in your hand which has been delivered to you by somebody. - Yes.</p>
               <p>From whom did you receive it? - I cannot recollect.</p>

               <p>So that you do not recollect to whom you gave that key, nor from whom you received this? - I do not, I know it was a very remarkable key.</p>
               <p>By what was it remarkable, Sir? - It was worn with rust.</p>
               <p>Now I want to know, Mr. Yardley, whether in the whole course of your life, as a thief-taker, you ever knew a key identified in such manner; is it by a key being worn with rust, Sir, that you affect to identify it in a court of justice? - There is not a doubt in my mind.</p>
               <p>It is not your saying bluntly here, that there is not a doubt in your mind, that will induce the Court or Jury to believe it: by what marks. Sir, will you make the Court and Jury believe that that is the key which you took on the woman, which key you gave to you do not know who, and have received a key from somebody you cannot describe. How will you make us believe it is the same key?</p>
               <p>Court, looking at the key. It is a very remarkable key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Not, my Lord, because it has been eat up with rust.</p>
               <p>Court to Yardley. You gave it to one of your officers, you cannot recollect which, to go to try the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards was the key returned to you? - In the course of three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you take particular notice of the key, and observe the wards and the shape of it? - I have not a doubt of the key.</p>
               <p>But answer my question. - I did, because it was an old worn out key, I thought there was not such another.</p>

               <p>Did you examine the wards, and the shape? - I cannot take upon myself to say as to the wards, but I know it was much eaten with rust.</p>
               <p>(The things that were produced deposed to by the prosecutor's wife.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you remember any circumstance of a key being given to open the door with? - I know Yardley gave me a key to try to open the door, I am sure of that; I tried it, and it opened the door readily.</p>
               <p>Was the key you opened the door with, the same you gave to Yardley again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Yardley. Was the key you gave him to open the door with, the same you found on the prisoner Slade? - It was.</p>
               <p>You have not changed it; - I could not, I had none to change it with; I know I gave it to one of our officers, but whether I gave it to the woman I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it not changed when you gave it to the officer? - I am sure it is the same key.</p>
               <p>Was it out of your sight? - It was in a box, but I am sure it is the same I gave the officer.</p>

               <p>Yardley. There was a deal of other property in the house, tea chests and other things; I sent another officer to her room with the key.</p>

               <p>Did she seem to know the woman that she bought the things of at all? - I cannot say, the woman asked her a guinea and an half, and she had her twenty-eight shillings.

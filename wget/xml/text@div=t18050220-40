               <p>Q. Did they both continue in your employment down to the 28th of January? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. On that evening did Mr.

                  </persName>
             bring in any bag of feathers into your warehouse? - A. He came and gave some information, but did not bring the feathers; I saw him on the 29th, when he sent the bag of feathers by his porter; I believe one of the bags is the property of me and my partners; the feathers in these two bags were of various sorts, but principally Hudson's Bay feathers.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this did you cause the prisoners to be apprehended? - A. Yes; I went with my solicitor on Wednesday to the Mansion-house, and on Thursday morning we had them apprehended at our warehouse; they were taken before the Lord-Mayor, and the bags likewise; after they were examined before the Lord-Mayor, Holmes said, I could not discover the loss; they found these there, and they were not taken down in stock, they were drivings.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these drivings in this paper? - A. Yes, they are worth a penny a pound, they are the mere refuse of the feathers; there is a larger refuse, called strippings, worth about the same value.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the feathers which you had before the Lord-Mayor, which Mr. Smith had brought you, at all like strippings or drivings? - A. Not at all; I should not hesitate giving two shillings a pound for them of any merchant, mixed as they are; Hudson's bay feathers are worth three shillings and threepence a pound, if they are not mixed.</p>
               <p>Q. After this examination before the Lord-Mayor, did you proceed to examine your stock to see if there was any deficiency? - A. Yes; we took stock on the 15th of January, and after the examination before the Lord-Mayor we took stock again, and the deficiency was between seventy and eighty pounds, but we deducted something from that, because a quantity had been cured - about twenty pounds, which is included in the first statement; then it makes the deficiency about fifty or sixty pounds. Mr. Smith brought us from forty to forty-five pounds, and a third at least, if not half, is Hudson's bay feathers, and we found a deficiency of twenty-seven pounds of Hudson's bay feathers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Drivings and strippings we understand to be the refuse of the feathers, and are never for sale - they are perquisites for the men? - A. I believe it is the case with some persons to allow it to the men, but we do not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you keep a feather warehouse in Goswell-street? - A. Yes: On the evening of the 28th of January the prisoners at the bar brought two bags of feathers, and said they were drivings; when I looked at them I asked them if they were their perquisites; they said they were; I said, if it is a perquisite, it is a very good one; I said, what do you ask for them; they said, tenpence a pound; I knew Branbeed perfectly well, he worked at Messrs. Kent's, but the other I never saw in my life; I said, they are pretty good, I will give you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200039"></xptr>nine-pence, the bargain was struck directly; we weighed them, the gross weight, with the bags, was fifty-six pounds, and then I said, what must we take off for the tare of the bags; Holmes said, I believe they must weigh ten pounds; I said, that is forty-six pounds, and forty-six pounds I paid for: I gave one pound fourteen shillings and sixpence to Holmes; he gave me change for a two pound note; I said, I am in a great hurry, I cannot empty them now; Holmes said, never mind bags, we have more bags than we know what to do with.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you suppose to be the value of them, when you bought them? - A. I looked upon it to be the perfect value of them at the time, from one bag, I never examined the other, I was in a great hurry to go out; I said, if they all answer to that I will give nine-pence a pound; I knew well that they were no drivings.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you give information to Messrs. Kent and Luck? - A. I was going to the other end of the town, but I thought it was necessary to go there first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. These they said were drivings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Branbeed before? - A. Yes; Holmes I had never seen; I have bought old drivings of Branbeed before, off old beds when he has come from gentlemen's houses.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a perquisite that is allowed? - A. I allow it to my men, some do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they come to dispose of it, as they told you? - A. I knew it was no drivings.</p>
               <p>Q. And, knowing this, you gave nothing near the value of them? - A. Quite the value, if they had been all like them I took out; when I came to examine them, I found Hudson's-Bay feathers in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never opened the bag till after they were gone away, therefore, you took them, hoping they would turn out a better bargain? - A. I thought they were both alike, they said they were. (The bags of feathers produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor, looking at them.) Are they at all like drivings, or strippings? - A. They are not drivings nor strippings, the two samples are nearly of the same value; they are worth about two shillings a pound.</p>
               <p>Holmes left his defence to his Counsel.</p>
               <p>Branbeed's defence. When Mr. Holmes came to work at Mr. Kent's, he told me he agreed with him for a guinea a week, and he was to have the perquisites of the drivings from the feathers; I told him there was no such thing allowed since I had been there; he told me he agreed with him for it; I said, I was sure he was mistaken; about a fortnight after he had some, he asked me where I sold mine, that he allowed me; I told him at Mr.

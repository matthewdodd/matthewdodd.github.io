I returned between four and five - he was gone, and had left the key with a woman down stairs. About nine o'clock, as he did not return, I examined my box, which was still locked, but the hasp had been wrenched off, and nailed on again; I missed a sovereign and 20 s.: the prisoner is a <rs id="t18250519-62-deflabel374" type="occupation">carpenter</rs>

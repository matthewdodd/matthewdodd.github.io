                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Joseph Harvey. The prisoner was in his service on the 10th of Jan. as a salesman—he had been there from two to three months—Mrs. Clark was a customer of ours—it was the prisoner's duty to receive sums of money, and to pay them directly to the cashier, and then to tell me of it, that it might be placed paid in the book—he did not tell me, on the 10th of Jan., that he had received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mrs. Clark—on the 16th he came to me, and said, "I have made a mistake, I wish you would put it to rights for me; I received the money from the customer in Surrey-street, Strand; and though I ought to have made it paid in the book, I omitted to do so; I wish you would do it for me now"—I said, as I had no doubt he had paid the money to the cashier, I would do so, and asked the amount—he said 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but he had only received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that he had received it on the 11th, and paid it to the cashier on the 12th—he did not say which cashier—I then made inquiries of the cashier—the prisoner keeps a book in which he writes the various amounts he receives during the day—I referred to it on the morning of the 16th, after he had spoken to me, and found that no such sum had been entered—in the afternoon of the same day I found it had been entered—it had been interlined betwixt the two days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the upholstery department at Mr. Harvey's. On the 7th of Jan., I had some work to do at Greenwich—the prisoner gave me a brown paper parcel, and told me to deliver it to Mr. Richards, of Greenwich—I gave it to my man—he brought me back 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I paid to the prisoner, on Monday the 9th, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning—I said I had got some money for him—he said, "What is it for?" I said, "For the parcel you gave me to take to Greenwich"—on the fol<lb></lb>lowing day, Tuesday, he asked me if I recollected what money I paid him the day before, as he had put it into his pocket with his own money, and did not recollect it—I told him a sovereign, a half-sovereign, a half-crows, and a sixpence.</p>

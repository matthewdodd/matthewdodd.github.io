On Friday, the 17th of August, the prisoner came there about half-past one o'clock; he went up stairs into the coffee-room; I asked if he was going to dine; he said No, he was going to wait a little time; he asked for a paper, but there was none; he asked for a glass of sherry, which I went down and got him; I thought he was looking at the tables, and before I went for it I counted the spoons - one table had four on it, another three, and another two; when I returned with the sherry I counted them again, and they were right; I went down and told Mr. Gibson; I went up again, and then one of them was gone - the prisoner was then coming out of the room; I said, "I must detain you;" he said, "For what?" I said, "For a spoon;" and he produced it.</p>

            . I was dining at this coffee-house; Sargent went down; he came up again, and accused the prisoner, who seemed in great trepidation, and took up the newspaper, and, after perusing it for a moment, he was endeavouring to take something from his pocket, and then on a table, on which I had seen but three spoons, I saw four; one was a different sort to the others; I will not swear he placed it there.</p>

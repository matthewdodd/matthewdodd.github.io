                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Potts, a proctor, and have been so eleven years. In 1840, the prisoner Fletcher came to our office—I think it was in July or August—he was accompanied by an old lady—he said he wished to give instructions for letters of administration to the effects of John Stewart—I had never seen him before—I asked who he was recommended by—he said that he had known Mr. Potts, or something to that effect, I do not re<lb></lb>member exactly the answer—I do not think he told me his name at that time—he told me that the elderly lady was the sister of the deceased—he gave me instructions to prepare the necessary documents—there if a form of affi<lb></lb>davit kept printed, called the Stamp-office form of affidavit, which is necessary to be deposed to, before letters are granted, and in which there are blanks for the name of the person deceased—I made inquiries of him to fill up the blanks in that form of affidavit—this is one of the forms in blank—I took one for the purpose of receiving the instructions—this was done in the presence of the elderly female—she did not say anything, or take any part in the matter, that I remember—she heard what was passing, she sat in the room—I pro<lb></lb>ceeded to prepare the usual warrant, in which the relationship of the proposed administratrix would appear—one of the necessary pieces of information is the situation of the party deceased, whether bachelor or married—Fletcher told me what the deceased was—it must have been stated to me at the time—this is the affidavit which I filled up from Fletcher's instructions.</p>

               <p>to Mr. Potts—Fletcher said he believed there was no will—he under<lb></lb>stood there was no will—I forwarded the draft of an affidavit to the elderly person, Mrs. Stewart—I prepared and forwarded that by Fletcher's direction—the affidavit was drawn in the first instance by instructions given by Fletcher—that was objected to by the registrar as insufficient—other facts were required, and then Fletcher, on being applied to, sent Mr. Barber-Mr. Barber was informed what was required, and from him we received writ<lb></lb>ten instructions, which I have—this is the draft of the affidavit I prepared, and which was objected to, and afterwards perfected, as in red ink, but it had been submitted to him several times—there are other alterations made in black ink—those were the first—the subsequent ones were in red ink—those alterations were from instructions received from Fletcher, and afterwards from Barber—these are the written instructions I received from Mr. Barber—the draft of the affidavit appears to be signed "Elizabeth Stewart" and "T. Griffin"—the draft came back to me in this state—there is the word "approved" above the signature—I required to have the signatures of Stewart and Griffin to this, being a very peculiar case, and the instructions not being given very fully—I had no instructions furnished to me, which I can produce signed, or any document emanating from Griffin or Stewart—I required their signatures to the draft, being a very peculiar case, and in order that we might be sure the parties were cognisant of the fact; and more particularly because the re<lb></lb>gistrars in general, will not look at any draft-affidavits unless they can ascer<lb></lb>tain that the parties will really swear, in order that there may be no perjury—they will not look at it until it is sworn, unless under very peculiar cir<lb></lb>cumstances; and I therefore produced this signed—I think Fletcher brought it back, "approved," with these signatures upon it—I then took it an approved, to the clerk of the seat, and afterwards, by his direction, submitted it to the registrar, as is always the case—the affidavit was no at that time perfect—I afterwards received the draft back from the clerk of the seat—it was objected to from time to time; at length it was perfected—the registrar directed appli<lb></lb>cation should be made to the clergyman, having been informed this box was in his possession, to ascertain whether any will was contained in the box; and that. the answer should be submitted to him, the registrar—an application was made to Mrs. Stewart for that purpose—I think a letter was written—this is the letter I wrote—(<hi rend="italic">This letter was dated</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th August</hi>, 1840, <hi rend="italic">signed Frederick William Potts, and directed, Mrs. Stewart, 1, Southampton<lb></lb>terrace, Southamp­ton-street, Camberwell, and stated that the draft, approved by herself and Grif<lb></lb>fin, was not deemed sufficient, and requesting her to write to the clergyman of Great Marlow, for further particulars about her brother's property, to inquire whether there was any will, and to forward the reply to him, Mr. Potts</hi>)—after I had written that letter, Fletcher called again—he was informed of all that that letter states—it was gone through with him, and he went away, if I recollect, promising that the application should be made to the clergyman—I do not think he said any thing about his attorney on that occasion—I think it was on a previous occasion, when application was made to him to amend the affidavit, stating that certain amendments were required, he said that be would send his solicitor, Mr. Barber, a very shrewd, clever man—that was before I saw Mr. Barber at all—Mr. Barber then called—the circumstances were all detailed to him—I am not aware that he took any notes in writing, of the information I gave him—Mr. Barber, when I had told him this, said he would furnish me with the necessary instructions—Mr. Potts, upon seeing Mr. Barber there as a solicitor, said, he was very happy to see a professional man, he had not the pleasure of knowing Mr. Fletcher, and asked him who he was—he said he was a man of high respectability and large property, or some<lb></lb>thing to that effect—a day or two after, Mr. Barber called again—he brought</p>

               <p>a paper which I have got—that was on his second call—a letter was produced, I think, on another occasion—when he came in the first instance, it was explained to him what was required—he then brought the written state<lb></lb>ment, and, I think, this letter, with a burial certificate—this is the letter Mr. Barber produced on that occasion—the burial certificate was afterwards annexed to the document, as also the letter, but the clerk of the seat did not consider it necessary to remain, and it was disannexed—then the affidavit was prepared, produced to the clerk of the seat, again laid before the registrar, and afterwards sworn—thus is the affidavit—I was not present at the swear<lb></lb>ing of that last affidavit that I am aware of—I have no mark I can speak to—it is not necessary for me to be present—a letter was written to Mr. Barber upon that—a certificate or certificates of baptism were also brought, I am not certain which—they were brought at the same time with this statement, by Mr. Barber—they were annexed to the affidavit.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">A certificate of baptism of John Stewart, son of Robert and Jane, of the parish of St. Marylebone, on</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th of April</hi>, 1761, <hi rend="italic">born on</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th April, was here read; also of Elizabeth Stewart, the daughter of Robert and Jane, on May</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1763, <hi rend="italic">born April</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd.</hi>)</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The written instructions furnished by Mr. Barber were as follows:—</hi> "Mrs. Stewart states, that she was informed of her brother's death through the kindness of an intimate friend of her late aunt's, who resided in New York, in America, who came over to Bristol with her in May last, of the name of Jones, in consequence of his having business in London. He promised her that he would go down to Great Marlow and see her brother, and take a letter to him for her, which he did. On his return, he informed her that her brother had been dead ever since March, 1827. Mr. Jones called on her about a month since, and informed her that he was then going back to America, and she had neither seen or heard from him since. Mrs. Stewart was informed by her late aunt, that Mr. Jones was formerly a captain of a vessel trading from New York to Bristol, but that he is now a gentleman of independent property. Her late aunt, Elizabeth Stewart, with whom she (Mrs. Stewart) had been living at New York, had frequently told her that her brother John had about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the sinking fund in the Bank of England, and also that he had money out on mortgage, which she has every reason to believe is true.")</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—"Lincoln's Inn, Nov. 6, 1840. Re Stewart, deceased. Sir,—We have no desire that your client should be driven to the expense and inconvenience of filing a bill. Our only object is to be satisfied, on the part of Mr. Strode, that Elizabeth Stewart is the sister of the intestate. When this is accomplished we shall afford every information in our power. At present, certainly, it appears to us, from the copy of affidavit, which is all that we have had produced, that she has not made out her relationship. We shall be glad to have satisfactory answers to the queries you required us to put down in writing when you were last here, and which we then requested you to procure for our in-formation. Yours, &amp;c, <hi rend="smallCaps">PICKERING, SMITH</hi>, and <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMPSON</hi>. Mr. W. H. Barber."</p>

               <p>this charge—this statement is in her handwriting—I communicated the statement to Messrs. Freshfield's office, by desire of Mrs. Dorey herself—the had some time before expressed great anxiety to make a statement, and put the prosecutors in possession of all the facts she knew.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The following extract from the statement was here read</hi>;)—"It is new about fourteen or fifteen years since I first became acquainted with the prisoner Flet<lb></lb>cher, who was then living in the London-road, and practising as a surgeon, having a chemist's shop there; I was then residing in Portland-street; I cannot speak with certainty of my age; to the best of my belief, I was about eighteen or twenty; both Fletcher and his wife expressed a great partiality for me, and I became a frequent visitor at their house. They introduced me to a Mr. Stokes; and represented him as a gentleman holding a situation in the Bank of England. Some time after my intimacy at Fletcher's, Mr. Fletcher and Stokes solicited me to go to the Bank; they said, if I would only sign my same and address for them as a bondswoman, they would and did give me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I wrote more than signing my names and went to the Bank, I think more than once, with them both, and to the Commons'; I did not understand the business at all; Fletcher and Stokes took the money in their possession, that was paid at the Bank, and afterwards went to an inn, with a Mr. Pizey, (or Pizley,) who acted with them at the Bank, Mrs. Fletcher, and myself; after a long conversation between Fletcher, Stokes, and Pisey, the latter left us; we then got into a coach, and returned to Mr. Fletcher's residence, in the London-road. I gave the money I received from their, to my mother; I was at that time living with her, also my sister Mrs. Saunders, and her husband; neither of them knew that I had any money at all given to me by Fletcher; I remained on terms of friendship with Fletchers, for some time; I cannot speak of dates with any certainty, but I know it continued up to the first Christmas following the trial Mr. Fletcher induced me to enter against Mr. Taylor, for breach of promise of marriage.—After exchanging visits with them, Mr. and Mrs. Fletcher said to my mother and myself, they could do much better for us than my being in the Pantheon. On our inquiring how, they said that Mr. Fletcher had a friend in the Bank of England that enabled him to get money, and he could get some for us; we again asked, in what manner, but they did not explain, beyond Mr. Fletcher observing to my mother, that if she would place herself under his instruction and direction, he would do well for her, and asked her if she would do as be wished in, every thing; she said she would, after Fletcher saying he would guarantee that she should do nothing but what was right; Fletcher, after this, explained what he meant by saying there were a great many sums of money in the Bank of England without any claimants, which was in the hands of the Commissioners, and as there were no relatives. left to claim it, it belonged as much to the public as to them, therefore he would represent her as a relation to some person deceased, who had left money unclaimed, and one of the clerks, who stood high in the Bank, would supply him with all the information requisite to take the money; Fletcher then men<lb></lb>tioned the name of Stewart, and said, that a man of that name had been dead some years, and left a sum of money, which by my mother being represented as Stewart's relation, could be easily obtained, but that she must place herself entirely under his direction, and leave her home for a short time to go to a lodging winch he would prepare for her; my mother assented, and promised to do as Fletcher directed. He asked, if I knew of any friend that would take care of any letters that might come through the post, directed to a Mr. Jones; I mentioned Miss Hawkes, and afterwards asked her, if she would take care of such letters, if directed to her care; she said the would, and the letters she brought to me, I gave, unopened, to Mr. Fletcher; I do not, on ever did know, their contents; I went to—the Bank of England with Mr. and Mrs.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184404080060"></xptr>
               <p>Fletcher; Mrs. Fletcher waited with me in the Rotunda, while Mr. Fletcher went to look for his friend; whilst he was gone, the gentleman passed us; when Mr. Fletcher returned, Mrs. Fletcher told him Mr. Christmas had passed us, and we pointed to the office he went in; Fletcher went after him; after being absent some time, he returned, and we left the Bank together, Fletcher observing, I might be sure the gentleman I had seen would not risk the high situation he held, by giving information for him (Fletcher) to act on, if it were not legal. Fletcher took a lodging for my mother, at a shop in Southampton-place, (or terrace) Camberwell, in the name of Stewart, and my mother went and lived there in such name, and I, by Fletcher's direction, visited my mother as her niece. He said, he would not do any thing for me, if I did not give up my business in the Pantheon; that if I would do so, he would establish me, with his daughter, in some first-rate business at the West-end; I consulted with my mother about it, and she thought it best for me to do as he wished; therefore, I disposed of my stock in the best manner I could, and quitted the Pantheon, relying solely on Mr. Fletcher's promise of doing better for me. To revert to my mother's case, Fletcher expressed his regret at not having a person at command, who would say, that he or she had for a con<lb></lb>siderable time known my mother as Miss Stewart, and sister to the deceased, and, in other respects, to establish my mother's identity as such; on my asking him how he did not know of such a person, he said the fact was, he had employed all the persons he could in that way; that during the period of our not being on friendly terms, he had two rich cases, in one of which he was the principal, and, in the other, he had only a share, but that he realized a large sum of money by them; that a man named Briggs, and his wife, were the parties employed to take the cases; Fletcher said he had taken lodgings for Mary Briggs the wife, and mentioned those cases, to assure my mother that she was not endangering herself in any way. On my mother saying to Fletcher she knew a poor man, a tailor, that was much reduced in circum<lb></lb>stances; he said, tell him you will give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to identify you as Miss Stewart, and sister to the deceased Stewart. He (Fletcher) wrote out an account for my mother, to make herself perfectly acquainted with, and desired her to give it to Griffin after she had done so, that he might know what to say as to the particulars of the matter; at the same time, he said, she was to strongly impress on the mind of Griffin a belief, that Stewart was my mother's family name. Mr. Griffin lived in Duke-street, Grosvenor-square; my mother subsequently saw Griffin, the man now in custody on this charge, and made the proposition to him, which he accepted; she told Fletcher, that Griffin was quite willing to the proposal; he (Fletcher) then said, that was all he required, as Mr. Barber and himself would manage all the rest; I cannot say how long the case was in hand; Fletcher was fearful my mother would not live to go through the business; he took her medicine nearly every morning; she was then seventy-one or seventy-two years of age; I do not know of any other inquiries made, respecting the case, but those I have stated. The money was obtained, and Fletcher gave my mother between 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her trouble; I heard nothing further of the matter, except that the legacy duty was not paid, although it had been invested in the hands of Barber, the solicitor, to do so at the time. An official communication was made to Griffin, some time after, from Somerset House, upon which he came to me to know what to do; I said he had better take it to Barber, the solicitor; I gave him half-a-sovereign for his loss of time. Previous to my mother quit<lb></lb>ting the lodgings at Camberwell, Mr. Fletcher said he should not consent to my mother's returning again to Rathbone-place; therefore, much against her inclination and my own, I took a lodging in Tottenham-court-road; I do not recollect the number; it was a carver and gilder's shop, on the right-hand side</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184404080061"></xptr>
               <p>of the road from Oxford-street; I am the only person that visited her, while the remained there; she was so unhappy, I told Fletcher I should have her home; he reluctantly consented, after she had been there about a fortnight or three weeks. In Stewart's business, I gave to Mr. Griffin ten sovereigns; I took them to his lodging in Duke-street, and gave them into his own hand; five from Fletcher, and five from my mother. Soon after this, I removed from Rathbone-place, to live in Tottenham-court-road; the Fletchers were then living in Southampton-place, Camberwell; I spent much time with them; he was our only friend and adviser; he frequently said he interested himself as much in my welfare as he could do for his own daughter."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now during the whole of those two months was Mr. Barber absent for a day from the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On one occasion he and I were at Rochester together, with the exception of that one day he certainly was not absent from the office during the whole of those two months—Mr. Barber's effects have been sold since this, both at his private house and his office—they were sold to defray the rent—Mr. Bramhall has conducted his defence gratuitously—several other friends have supplied funds to pay counsel's fee.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During the time you were absent from Mr. Barber's, did you not say to Mr. Hartung that if you chose you could hang Mr. Barber? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, no—I heard, through Mr. Barber, that such a statement had reached his ears, I was disgusted at it, and immediately wrote to Mr. Fresh field, emphatically denying it, that it was a gross falsehood—I believe somebody had told Mr. Barber—I heard it at the Mansion-house from Mr. Barber—I most certainly swear I did not make that statement—this is not the only transaction with Mr. Fletcher relating to the proving of wills—there are several others relating to the same business as the wills, relating to unclaimed dividends—there have been three of these transactions besides this, which form the subject of other in<lb></lb>dictments—there was another before, I think, or very nearly contemporaneous with this, which has not been made the subject of an indictment—those were the only ones that I am aware of—Oh, by the bye, I beg your pardon, there was another; there was one in which Mr. Bramhall, my present employer, received about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from unclaimed dividends, for which he was very thankful—that was an affair between Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Barber—Mr. George Robins, the auctioneer, was the party who died, leaving the dividends unclaimed—altogether there were three transactions besides this, forming the subject of an indictment—there was one, I think, before, or if not before contemporaneous with these certainly; and there was another, Robins' matter—I do not know at this moment of any other—that is six, I think—Mr. Fletcher was concerned in all those—there were others besides, in which Mr. Fletcher has not been concerned, I believe—I do not know when they began—I mentioned that because you were so anxious in your inquiry, and Mr. Barber's instructions are, that every thing should be stated—he has not given me instructions as to the manner in which I should give evidence—I have been instructing Mr. Wilkins in this case—Mr. Bircham became a partner. either on the 17th or 21st of Dec, 1841—Mr. Barber generally came to the office of a morning about a quarter past nine—he was generally there before anybody—up to the latter end of Nov., his office was at his residence, 52, Nelson-square—just at the time of my leaving him, he changed his office to Tokenhouse-yard—when I returned to him at the beginning of 1840, his office was in Tokenhouse-yard—he continued to reside at 52, Nelson-square, up to his apprehension—his office hours at Tokenhouse-yard were from half-past nine; he staid till half-past five, himself, and I was generally there till half-past six—I lived with my father at that time, on the Buildings, at Apothecaries hall—he has been there thirty years—I did not live in Nelson-square, but I used to be there about three nights a week, and spend the evening with him; to read and write, and enter up his diary—he had no family at that time that I know of—I have continued my intimacy with him up to this day—he has, I think, two children, but I do not know that they are his children, by any means—I never heard him say so, it was only from popular report I heard it—they never lived in the house with him—I was not aware of his having two children; it was too delicate a subject for me to talk to him about—I am perfectly aware that no birth ever took place in his house.</p>

               <p>very angry with Mr. Barber, because he sent him in rather a heavy bill—he has often said he would like to hang Mr. Barber—I never said I could hang him—there were all together six of these transactions—the one not the subject of an indictment was a claim of about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the representatives of a person named Smith, in which Messrs. Lawrence and Blenkiron, of Bucklersbury, were concerned for the parties—Mr. Barber merely gave the information through Mr. Fletcher—the other matter, which we called in the office "Robins's matter," was a claim to about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unclaimed dividends, standing in the name of Mr. George Robins—Mr. Barber communicated with the trustees, and I believe the property was recovered—Mr. Bramhall has frequently told me so—he got his information from Fletcher in that case, and the money has since been paid into the Court of Chancery—I used to go home three evenings in the week with Mr. Barber, to read letters that came, to draft answers, make up the diary, prepare business for the following day, and take his instructions upon those matters which I was attending to, which I could not consult him about in the office from the hurry of business.</p>

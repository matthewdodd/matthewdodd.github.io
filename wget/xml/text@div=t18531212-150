                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and reside at East Greenwich. On Friday evening, 2nd Dec, I had a silver watch in my waistcoat pocket, secured by a guard round my neck—I had it safe about 9 o'clock—I got very tipsy, and do not recollect anything after that till I found myself, at 6 o'clock, the next morning, in the station-house, amongst some prisoners—I am not aware that I had been in the prisoner's company that evening—where I last recollect having my watch was at Mr. Andrews'—I had it not when I awoke in the station-house—I have since seen it—the policeman showed it me—it is mine—I am not aware that I gave it away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 36). On 3rd Dec., about a quarter past 12 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Greenwich-road—I saw the prisoner—he was running towards Woolwich, in a direction coming from. Deptford—I had not known him before—nothing passed between us at that time—I went on round my beat, and in half an hour afterwards I saw him again on the Greenwich-road, against Blue-stile—he inquired of me the way to Deptford—he was walking, and was in company with another soldier—I told him to keep on the north side of the road; it would take him to Deptford—they left me, and crossed from the north side of the road to the south side—I went down the road after them, and in about ten minutes I fell in with the prosecutor, lying on his face on the foot pavement—I turned him over—he was senselessly drunk—this portion of a watch guard fell from his neck—he was taken to the station—I could find no watch upon him—I followed the prisoner and the other soldier up the New Cross-road, and took them to the station—the prisoner was asked if he had a watch about him—he said he had, and that a man gave it him that he had been drinking with, I</p>

               <p>and he was going to return it to him again—he produced this watch—the prosecutor was not capable at that time of understanding anything—when he became sensible, I showed him this watch, and he identified it—the prisoner was asked if he knew who the man was that he was drinking with—he said he did not know his name, but he knew him by working in the Dockyard—he was told he was charged with stealing this watch, and he said Mr. Cribb, the landlord of the public house where he had been drinking, would clear him of that, for he was present when the man gave it him in his house.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Iron-founders' Arms public house, at Greenwich. On Friday evening, 2nd Dec., I saw the prisoner and another soldier, and the prosecutor, in my house—the three of them came in together, about 11 o'clock—the soldiers appeared to be quite sober—I did not observe the prosecutor till I went into the tap, when he called for a pot of half and <hi rend="italic">half</hi>, I which was drank amongst them—he was a little intoxicated—he paid me 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., instead of 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for it—he said he worked for Mr. Joyce, who is an engineer, at Greenwich, and he would pay me the odd halfpenny in the morning—they were in the taproom when they had the half and half; they then came to the bar, and had half a pint of gin, which they drank amongst them—that did not improve the prosecutor—I let him have it because I thought the soldiers were capable of taking care of him—the soldiers ordered the gin, and paid for it—they seemed to be taking care of the prosecutor—he had a watch in his hand, which he was swinging about in a very careless manner—it had a guard chain to it, which was off his neck—I asked him to leave it with me, to take care of till the morning—he refused to do that—this prisoner and the other soldier assisted him, and put the guard round his neck, and put the watch into his pocket—they all went out of the house together, about 20 minutes or half past 11 o'clock—the prosecutor was very much intoxicated—he was assisted out by the prisoner or the other soldier.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my parents in the Greenwich-road. I was-standing at the door of my father's house on Friday evening the 2nd Dec., about 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor—the prosecutor wanted to go into a tobacconist's, or to North Pole-lane—he did not say so, but he pulled to go that way, and the prisoner would not let him—the tobacconist's is at the corner of North Pole-lane—the prosecutor was pulling to go that way, the prisoner said, No, come along mate, put your arm round my neck—he did so, and they went together in the direction of Deptford—the prosecutor appeared very drank, I did not perceive that the prisoner was intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an optician, of Newgate-street. I have two partners—on 26th Dec. the prisoner came, about seven o'clock in the evening; he wanted some electrical machines; I showed him several; he selected one, the price of which was fifteen guineas; he selected some other articles, to the amount of between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he gave his name as Mr. Winterbottom, 8, Bryanston-square; he ordered them to be sent on Saturday morning, to that address; he then said he wanted some spectacles, and pointed to some in the window—he selected a pair of gold folding spectacles, at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I will not say whether he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185102030043"></xptr>
               <p>asked to take them, or whether I asked if he would take them; he did take them—if he had not represented that his name was Winterbottom, and that be lived in Bryanstone-square, I would not have let him take them—he said he had a friend residing with him, who wanted a pair of spectacles, and was unable to come out; and he would be glad if we would send a pair or two for his friend to select from—he desired a separate bill to be sent with them, as his friend would pay for them at once; and he said, "I will send you back a check for the amount of the things I have ordered for myself"—he came again on Friday evening, and said the things were not to be sent on Saturday, as he should not be at home; but they were to be sent on Monday; and he requested. to be shown the spectacles which we had looked out for his friend; they were shown to him, and he said he should like to take them to his friend; there was some little hesitation about it, from his saying at that time Mecklenburg-square; but he immediately corrected himself, and said Bryanstone-square—he was allowed to take them—they were worth three guineas—I went next day to 8, Bryanstone-square, but did not find him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Wood—I was present during part of the time when the prisoner gave the order on 26th Dee.—I was present when he came next evening. On Wednesday evening, 22nd Jan., I went to Mr. Maw's shop in Aldersgate-street—I saw the prisoner there, and heard him give orders for a number of surgical instru<lb></lb>ments—he gave his address "Mr. Pettigrew, No. 6, Bryanston-square," and ordered them to be sent there—he wanted to take a few things with him—I went into the counting-house and spoke to the assistant, and he declined letting the prisoner have the goods—when the prisoner went out I followed him, and said, "Mr. Winterbottom, I believe"—he said, "No, my name is not Winterbottom, it is Pettigrew; I live at 6, Bryanston<lb></lb>square; what is your business with me?"—I told him I lived at Mr. Wood's, and that we had an order for him in the house, and should like to see him on the subject—I have not the slightest doubt that he is</p>

             (police-constable, G 161). I took the prisoner Clark, and found at her house thirteen pair of shoes - I showed them to Mr. Pitman, and while I was doing that Rowland came in - Mr. Pitman showed the shoes to him, and asked if he knew them - he said he did, and they were Mr. Pitman's property - I then asked Rowland if he recollected my speaking to him in Castle-street, about a fortnight before - he said he did not - I then asked him if he did not go to No. 5, Friendly-place - he hesitated some time, and then said he did - that was where Clark lives, and where I found these shoes - he said he went there to see Mrs. Townsend, which is the name Clark went by.</p>

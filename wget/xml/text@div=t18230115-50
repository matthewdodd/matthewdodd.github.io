On the 10th of July, two gentlemen came to my house to dinner - I went up stairs about one o'clock in the afternoon for a table cloth, and found my bed room door ajar; my wife had locked it; it was not forced. I went down and complained to my wife about its being open, and at two o'clock I went up to my box, which stood in the bed room, and found the lid forced open, and the lock hanging to it - I had not noticed the box at one o'clock; but had been to it for money at eleven, every thing was safe then; I locked it again, and locked the door. I missed all my property except a bad shilling. 343 l. 12 s. 2 1/2 d., was stolen - I had counted it the evening before, and entered the amount in my book, which was taken with the money; but I had a memorandum of it on my slate. I had the numbers of two of the notes on the slate, and every thing, but have left them at home. The reason I speak to the money is, because the night before being club night, I was at leisure. It consisted of three Spanish dollars, two hundred and twenty-three sovereigns, which were in one bag, they were my own property; a 40 l., a 10 l., and two 5 l. Bank notes; the 10 l. Bank note belonged to a club which is held at my house, and the 40 l. Bank note belonged to another club; I am responsible for them. The others were my own. I had the numbers of the two 5 l., and the 40 l. notes on my slate; I copied them from the slate at Bow-street. I went to Bow-street immediately, and gave information. The prisoner was apprehended on the 29th of July, and detained for six weeks, and then let out on his own recognizance. I traced a 40 l., two 5 l., and a 10 l. note to him - he stated that he took them of another person, and when that person was taken, we could not find the prisoner - a warrant was issued against him; he heard of it, and surrendered to me.</p>

On the 11th or 12th of July, I met him in Castle-street, Leicester-fields, as he was coming to my office - he asked if I could get him change for a 40 l. note, which he gave me, and I got it changed at Mr. Smith's, a publican, at the corner of Earl-street, Seven-dials - I should know it again by my name and address, which I saw him write on it; the prisoner stood outside, I gave him the change - I was well known there. I met him again two or three days afterwards, in Great or Little Newport-street; he asked me to get him change for a 10 l. note; I changed that at Burohell's in Little Newport-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not he get change as well as you - A. I do not know how that was; he was not so well known as me. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150028"></xptr>should know the note again - I did not know where he lived.</p>

I was apprehended, and afterwards discharged, but recollect nothing about being told to come again if wanted. I was out one day, and met a man who said two gentlemen wanted me, and in Macclesfield-street, I met Ingram's brother, who said Tom was taken in Sloane-street, and if I came forward, I should hang him; they promised me a pound a week to keep away, and bought me some shoes, and took me from house to house till night, and then lodged me at a baker's in Whitechapel, where I remained eleven days; the woman wished me to leave; he took me to his sister's at Shackelwell - she would have nothing to do with me. I was taken to Backchurch-lane, and remained there till the 5th of January; when he came, and said he had quarrelled with his brother, and I might go where I pleased, and on the Monday I surrendered.</p>

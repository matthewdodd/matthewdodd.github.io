About 6. 30 p. m. on 18th December I saw a barrow, with a bale of goods on it, outside the Duke of Wellington public-house in Shepherd Street, Spitalfields—it was covered with an overcoat and this bag—I watched it about 10 minutes—the prisoner looked and then ran and laid hold of the barrow—a woman standing near said "Here comes the <hi rend="italic">copper</hi>," meaning the policeman—the prisoner ran off with the barrow—I ran after him, and lost him in a court in Flower-and-Dean Street—I saw him again on 5th January in Flower<lb></lb>and-Dean Street—I took him and charged him with stealing a bale of goods on 18th December—he said that he was in the country—at the Court he said that he was at Barking Road.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 91). On 18th December I was on duty in Commercial Street, Spitalfields, at 6. 30 p. m.—I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—the prisoner passed me—I pursued him some distance, when the other constable overtook me—I saw the barrow containing a bale of goods, and took it to Commercial Street, and it has since been identified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. You told the inspector that you had sprained your ankle—I have not arranged this matter with the other myrmidon of the law—I saw you on 18th December and on 5th January, when I appre<lb></lb>hended you—I did not say at Guildhall that I saw you five or six times between those dates.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I did not see the prisoner at all between those dates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I am innocent. The evidence of the prosecutors rests on the statements of the police-constables. One of them says he saw me on several occasions between 18th December and 5th January, and did not take me in custody. I can prove an <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi>, and that I did not leave my lodgings on the 18th or 19th, and that while working at Leytonstone I sprained my ankle and remained at home two or three days. The coat was left behind by the thief, and they tried to squeeze it on me, but it would only go to my shoulders with great difficulty, which is suffi<lb></lb>cient proof I was not the owner of it. This is the first charge ever brought against me. I have been engaged as a bricklayer, and support an afflicted father who is now on his deathbed. Through want of means I live in a poor neighbourhood, and am surrounded by thieves, though I am not a thief nor the companion of thieves.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Henderson, an outfitter, in Tottenham-court-road. On the 25th of June I was returning from Chalk-farm tea-gardens, a little after ten o'clock, in company with a young man I had met in the gardens, who was quite a stranger—when I got into the second field, about twelve yards from the bridge, the</p>

               <p>prisoner came up and laid hold of my black handkerchief which was round my neck—he pulled it into a sort of knot, and said, "You b----if you don't give me your money, I will choke you"—I then gave him my red purse with white stripes to it, containing the money stated—I gave it him while he had hold of my throat—I got away from him, and he said, "You b----you have a watch, I willl have that too"—I then ran away—I lost sight of the young man who accompanied me from the gar<lb></lb>dens, and have never seen him since—I ran to the road—the prisoner followed close after me—a gentleman and lady were going by in a four<lb></lb>wheeled phaeton—I stepped on the step, and begged of the gentleman to drive on—the prisoner then came up to the phaeton, and tried to pull me back—the gentleman struck him with the whip, and tried to pull me went away—I rode to the York and Albany public-house on the Phaston, and gave information at the station-house there. On the Monday I was called to the station-house between ten and eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner there—I recognised him directly as the man who had attacked me—it was about tweilight when it happaned—there were no gas lights in the field.</p>

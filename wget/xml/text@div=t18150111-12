            . I am a watchman of St. Andrew's Holborn, On Saturday morning, about a quarter before three o'clock, I stopped the prisoner, in Holborn on the opposite side of the church; I asked the prisoner what he had got; he answered a trunk he said it was going into Essex, he was going to take it to the coach, I told him I would not let him go without seeing the box; I found no direction on the box; I took him to the watchhouse. He burst out crying; he said for God's sake do not stop me, I have got a good master. He had been three years and a half in his place, he put his hand into his pocket; he said here, my friend, there is a bottle of good old wine; let me go. I said he was my prisoner he could not go; I delivered him up to the constable of the night at the watchhouse. I saw the portmantau contained twelve bottles of wine, five new napkins an old glass cloth and the butlers apron, he had a bottle in each of his coat pockets; he said his master lived at No. 22, Montague-street Russel-square.</p>
               <p>- SMART. I was constable of St. Andrew's last year, The prisoner was brought to the watch-house by Chapman; he delivered to me a portmantua; I have had it ever since, the contents were twelve bottles of wine, five towels, an old glass cloth; he had a bottle in each pocket, The prisoner told me the wine was his perquisites the clothes belonged to his master. He seemed very much troubled about leaving his place. I told him it was my duty to keep him in custody.</p>

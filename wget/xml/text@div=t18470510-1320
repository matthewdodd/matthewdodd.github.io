On the evening of the 23rd April, about a quarter before nine o'clock, I was in Wellington-street, Dock-head,—I saw Robinson coming in a direction from the Greenwich railway with a quantity of hoop iron on his shoulder—I followed him to the prisoner Gutteridge's ware-house, in Jacob-street, Dock-head—he threw the iron down at Gutteridge's warehouse door—he then went to Gutteridge's private house, about three doors from the warehouse—he went inside, and staid about two minutes—Gutt<lb></lb>ridge then let him out—he fetched the iron from the warehouse door, and Gutteridge let him into the private house with it—he remained there about five minutes—I then saw him come out without the bundle—he went on, and</p>

               <p>I passed him under a gas-lamp—he was in the act of counting money—he went on, and I followed him to the King's Arms public-house—Whitlamb there spoke to him, and asked if he had taken any iron to Gutteridge's—he said he had, and he fetched it from the foundry, by the King and Queen, Rother-hithe—(that was a different direction to that in which I had seen him come)—I took him into custody, and handed him to a constable on the beat—we went to Gutteridge, and asked him if he had sent a man to the foundry—he said, "No"—I asked if he had bought any iron—he said he had, about a week ago, of a man with a smock frock—I asked if he had bought any iron since—he said he had not—I asked if he had received any that day or night—he said he had not—I said I should search the place—I went through to the back door, and opened it—I saw the bundle lying at the door—I said, "Mr. Gutteridge, here is some iron here"—he said, "That is the iron I bought a week ago"—I searched, and found no other iron—I believe that was the iron that Robinson had had—I then took Gutteridge to the station—I saw Robin<lb></lb>son there—I asked Gutteridge if that was the man he had seen a week ago—he said he believed it was—before we took him he said he had bought the iron of a man, and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a pint of beer, and the man asked him more than old iron price for it—that he bought it of a short man with a smock-frock on.</p>

               <p>I went on Monday, 1st December, to the prosecutor's premises, and examined them—to the best of my judgment the entry had been effected from 11, Winchester-court—that is a three-roomed house—they had forced two pieces out of the door at the top of that house by a centre-bit, then got over two roofs, forced the trap-door, and cut the string of the skylight, and so got in, and they had left in the same way—here is a correct plan of the premises prepared by an architect—Monkwell-street is a very narrow street, not above six yards wide, including the foot pavement it may be eight yards—there is not room for two cabs to pass—I received, from Mr. Wallett, this rope ladder, found in the warehouse, by which the thieves roust have let themselves down—on 6th December, I went with Baker and Ford, two other officers, to the prosecutor's warehouse—I there saw Hornby—I told him I was a detective officer, and he must consider himself in custody on suspicion of being con<lb></lb>cerned, with two others, in committing the robbery at the premises of his employers, stating the date and hour—I told him I was about asking him a question, he might do as he pleased about answering it, it might be used in evidence against him—I then asked him to account how he spent his time on Saturday evening, the 29th, from 6 o'clock up till 10 on Sunday morning the 30th—he said he went home to his lodgings, at Mrs. Dow<lb></lb>ney's, in Green Arbour-court, Bell-alley, Goswell-street, about 6 o'clock, and he never came out above once during the night, till 10 or 11 the next morning—I then took him to the station, placed him in the yard with six<lb></lb>teen or seventeen others of different ages, dresses, and size, and Miss Towne immediately recognised him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at a coffee-house, 5, Brunswick<lb></lb>place, East-road, City-road—I recollect both the prisoners being there on 29th November; they came, I should say, about half-past 12—they were in the shop having coffee—they left close upon 8 next morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the name of this coffee-shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The Albion; it is a night-house—I don't know that it is frequented by ques<lb></lb>tionable characters; there are some of all sorts—I can't question the cha<lb></lb>racters of the people who come—I serve them—I don't know that the house bears a very bad repute in the neighbourhood; I don't go out of the house to ask about that—I am the only waiter—Mr. Brewer is my employer; he was in the parlour on this night—I have to take the orders and serve the customers—I can't say whether Mr. Brewer was in the shop when the prisoners came in—there were several others sitting in the same box with them—I don't know where Monkwell-street is—I was first spoken to about this about four days after the affair—they came to me and told me I should be called upon to go up, and prove that these two parties were in the coffee-room at that time—two policemen also came and questioned me about it—I don't think it was more than four days afterwards that I was spoken to about it—I would not be certain; I am sure it was before the next Saturday night—I don't know the young man's name that came; I had never seen him before—I did not ask his name—he said the two parties that were in our house on the Saturday night had got into a scrape about some silk in the City, and would I go and prove that they were there, and as I knew they were there, I said, "Yes"—I had seen the prisoners at our place several times before—I went before Alderman Hum<lb></lb>phrey, but was not examined—I did not state that I was there to give evidence for the prisoners, because the Alderman said he should send them for trial, and there was no occasion for any witnesses—Mr. Lewis was there as attorney for the prisoners—I am able to say that the prisoners remained at our place from half-past 12 till 8 without leaving—they went into the yard about half-past 7 in the morning, and Merritt and another began tossing, and I put a stop to it directly, and said it was not allowed—we always clear up the shop about ten minutes to 8, to get ready for the day business, and request those</p>

               <p>who are there to leave—the prisoners were there when I said that Mr. Brewer attends to the customers if I am out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it a week, or only three or four days after this night that the person came and spoke to you about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did not appear any more to me; I would not swear it was not a week.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the person say he wanted to know whether you remem<lb></lb>bered the prisoners being there on Saturday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was the last Saturday the prisoners were playing draughts, and a game they call <hi rend="italic">cottam</hi> daring the night—they were in the habit of spending the night in our shop—no females came in with them—females will come in as well as men, but they don't stop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 30, Mate-street, Bethnal Green-road, and am a silk manufacturer—I know the prisoners—I remember seeing them on 29th November, at the Albion Coffee-house, from between 12 and 2, till about 8 in the morning, when I left them there—they were in the house during all that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where is your silk manufactory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My father manufactures silk, and I help him—I sometimes stop out all night—I was first spoken to about giving evidence the week before last, when I was told the prisoners were in custody—I was not before the Alderman—it was Henry Gidgings who spoke to me—he is a waiter at the Sekforde Arms, Clerkenwell—I was at his house, and he told me about it—I have not known Hornby long—I have known Merritt about two years—I don't know how he has been getting his living—I was at the coffee-shop from 2 till 8 without leaving once.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at 15, Twister's-alley, Bunhill-row—I know Merritt—I never saw Hornby before, that I know of—I saw Merritt on the evening of 29th November, at the Albion Coffee<lb></lb>shop, at a quarter to 1 in the morning—I think he came in after me; I don't know when he came in—I was in the kitchen, and he remained there till half-past 7 in the morning, when I left—I saw a man with him, but I cannot recognise Hornby.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you examined before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was first spoken to about being a witness about a fortnight ago—Williams, the last witness, told me to come and give evidence—the Albion is not more than ten minutes' walk from Monkwell-street—I know it was the 29th that I saw Merritt there, because I was told they were had up for a robbery that night—I was told that two days afterwards.</p>

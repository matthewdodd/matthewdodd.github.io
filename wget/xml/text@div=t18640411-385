                  </hi>. I am employed by the Mint to look after bad money—about half-past 11 on the morning of 26th March, I was watching in Dean-street, Westminster—I saw the two prisoners there; I knew them before—they came towards Parliament-street from Dean-street, across the Broad Sanctuary to King-street—I was not in King-street; I would rather decline saying where I was—I ran round Parliament-street and procured the assistance of McKay, who was on duty in that neighbourhood—at the corner of King-street and Downing-street we met the prisoners—Hines was carry<lb></lb>ing this black bag and Benson was walking close to her, apparently in close conversation—I had seen them before they came into that neighbourhood; I had not seen them together before that day—I endeavoured to take the bag from Hines; she resisted me—before that I said, "My name is Brannan," and that I was employed by the solicitor to the Mint to look after such as them, as extensive dealers in counterfeit coin—we pushed them into Down<lb></lb>ing-street, and I succeeded in taking the bag from Hines—I opened it, and found two paper packets; one contained ten half-crowns, and the other, six florins, separately wrapped up in paper, all counterfeit—there were also two half-crowns in the bag loose, one good and the other bad, also a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and threepence in copper—McKay took Benson in custody, and we took them to the station—when there Hines put her hand into her dress pocket—I seized it; in doing so the pocket turned inside out, and from it dropped soother counterfeit half-crown—when the prisoners were in custody at the police-court, on Saturday, 20th March, Benson called me inside the prisoner's room and said, "Mr. Brannan, if I get over this I shall never touch one of these things again; I can't deny but she does these things"—I said, "Pray don't talk to me about the case, because what you say I shall have to repeat in evidence against you"—she said, "You found nothing on me; I am not a happy woman"—when I first saw them they were coming from a public-house—I would rather not say which.</p>

               <p>on this morning, and Mr. Brannan asked me to come and assist him—I took charge of Benson—we took them into Downing street, and Brannan looked into the bag—he has given a correct account of it—we took them to the station—no bad money was found on Benson; she had one shilling and two-pence in coppers, good money—I was close by when she spoke to Brannan but I did not hear what passed; they were speaking very low—I had not seen the prisoners before that day.</p>

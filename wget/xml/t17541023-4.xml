The Constable and Mrs. Reason brought it home 3 or 4 days after. She told me the prisoner had sold the body of it to her husband. We took the prisoner up, and had him in at Mr. Palmer's, a wine merchant. There, upon being charged with the fact, he confessed that he did it, and that he was alone when he did it</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he explain what he meant by the words did it ?</p>
               <p>Gerrard. They talk'd of nothing else but the Tankard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reason. On the 21st of Sept. about 4 in the afternoon, the prisoner came to me and asked me if I would buy a bit of old plate? There was another person with him who stood at the gate. The prisoner pull'd out of his apron an old body of a tankard, and said his father was dead and left it between his sister and him, and bid me be exact in setting it down, that he might not wrong her of a halfpenny. I asked him where he liv'd. He said he was a neighbour, and served his time to a carver. I bought it of him. In the evening I saw an advertisement concerning it; then I went to one Mr. Norden, and he and I went about to look for the prisoner. I found him on the Tuesday after. He persuaded me to let him go to his mother. I took him there. She gave me my money again, and I let him go, not knowing the consequence. There he took me aside, and said he took it himself, and that no-body was with him at the time. After that he was taken again, and brought before Mr. Fielding: there he attempted to impeach one Gentery, upon which Gentery was taken up; but did not say Gentery was concerned in this, but in other robberies. Gentery wanted to be admitted an evidence; but they neither of them would make an ample confession, so the justice said they should both be tried.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the tankard body old or new?</p>
               <p>Reason. It was an old bruised battered thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Reason. I am a silversmith and sword-cutler.</p>

            . I am a goldsmith. I bought the cover of a tankard on the 21st of Sept. but can't say who I bought it of. I believe the prisoner is the man. He told me he serv'd his time to Mr. Gibson; and appeared a creditable man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give per ounce?</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. I gave 4 s. 6 d. per ounce, in the whole 25 s. There is no hall mark upon it. When first he came to me, there was a lame man with him who had a crutch.</p>
               <p>The cover is shown her.</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. I believe that is it, but I don't swear it, for it has been out of my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner tell you his name?</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. He told me his name, but I have forgot.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak positively to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. Upon my oath I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner like the man?</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. I think he is.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the cover out of your custody?</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. Mrs. Reason and the constable, and the prisoner's mother, came to me and paid me my money again, and took the cover away. I thought they had made it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be the cover?</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you it in your custody?</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. I believe I had it till the Wednesday after.</p>

            . I am the constable. I was ordered to search Mr. Reason's house, with a search warrant, for the body of a tankard. Mrs. Reason told me she could have me to a place where the cover was. She then took me to Mrs. Reculus's for the body of the tankard. After that we went to Mrs. Montgomery; there lay the cover in the show glass. Mrs. Reculus paid her 25 s. for it. This is the cover, it has been in my custody ever since. Mrs. Reason there compar'd the body and that together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body delivered to you at Mrs. Reculus's?</p>
               <p>T. James. Mrs. Reason might bring it from her own house for what I know; I did not see it before she took it out to try if the cover fitted. We went before justice Fielding, and he ordered the tankard into my custody. I was at the taking up of the prisoner, which was about a week after, at his mother's house. He voluntarily owned to me, he unhappily did this fact by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words he made use of?</p>
               <p>T. James. He said he took it from Mr. Gerrard's at the King's Arms in Compton Street, from off a little shelf in the bar. He mentioned

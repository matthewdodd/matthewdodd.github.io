            . I am a butcher, and live in Lower Chapman-street, St. George's in the East. On the 9th of April, between ten and half-past ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and bought a loin of lamb, which came to 3 s. 8 d. he paid me a 1 l. note, I called my wife down, she gave him change. I asked his name - he said</p>
               <p>"Jessee Wan," which she wrote on it in his presence - (looks at one) - this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. This was on Sunday morning - A. Yes, my shutters were up, but the door was open. I saw him at Lambeth-street on the Thursday week after; I said I could not exactly identify him, as he stood there, until I spoke to my wife.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. How was he standing when you said you could not identify him - A. In the lock-up place,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170039"></xptr>which has no window. When he was before the magistrate I had no doubt of him.</p>

            . I am a plumber, and live at No. 17, Langdon-street; the prisoner used to come there to see Brown. On the 13th of April, about twelve o'clock at night, I saw him at the Roebuck, public-house, he came in, and gave the watchman some drink. I said, here is Brown's friend, who can give us information about him. He said he knew Brown. We went out - he said,</p>
               <p>"Has Brown been robbing or murdering?" I said, I dare say you know what he has been doing. My wife came over, and asked him if he could tell us about Brown - he answered her as he did me. I said he had been detained for passing forged notes. My wife asked him if he was with

             the night before - he said he was. When we got opposite my house, he said he knew Brown's niece and nephew, and he would go to them and be back in two minutes. I said he should not go - he said Not go! I said No, unless I go with you. He ran from me a few yards, and I collared him, he collared me, and threatened to charge me with false imprisonment if I gave him in charge; we struggled from one end of the street to the other. I gave him in charge to the patrol - it was a rainy night. The prisoner was quite sober. We were proceeding from my house towards James-street.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 11th of April I heard the cry of Patrol! in Langdon-street, and found Snow and the prisoner struggling together; Snow said he thought Dudfield was concerned with Brown in passing the notes. I said you may depend upon it he has brought no notes here, it is of little use taking him. He collared Snow, drew him towards the house, and said they would have something to drink. I took him to the watch-house - seven-half-crowns and about sixpence in copper, was found on him. I then returned to the spot where I first saw them struggling, and there found a piece of brown paper rolled up corner ways - it was very wet, and contained two 5 l. notes - (looks at two) - these are them.</p>

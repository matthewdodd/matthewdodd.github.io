               <p>PROSECUTOR. She was not sent to Bridewell through me: I was at work at the Bell; she said I should not work there, and came and broke the windows, and was sent to Bridewell; for that I paid for the mending the windows and to get her out of Bridewell.</p>
               <p>What did you want him to help remove your chest for? - For fear I should lose my things; it was my chest of cloaths.</p>

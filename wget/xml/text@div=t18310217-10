No - the door between the parlour and the shop is never fastened; this leads from the parlour into the passage - I cannot say whether that had been fastened or not; I went into the parlour, and missed two great coats, which I had seen hanging there the evening before, and a pair of Wellington boots were missing from the shop; I found the lock forced off my desk, which was perfectly secure the evening before, when I went to bed: I missed some gold coin from the desk - I know I had left some there the evening before, but I do not know how much; I missed a tea-spoon, which I have one here to compare with - I missed a coral from the parlour - one bell was broken off when I had it, and the coral part was broken, it was perfect in other respects; I saw the prisoner again on the Sunday evening following, but not before; I spoke to him on the Sunday morning at the station-house, where he was locked up, but I did not see him - there was a partition between us; nothing material passed - I saw him in the evening, and said something about his not being prosecuted; in consequence of what he said I went with the officer to a jeweller's shop in Barbican kept by Mrs. Moseley, and found my silver spoon - he directed me to that shop; I saw one of my coats at Worship-street office, not at any place he had pointed out - that was the best coat of the two, and was worth 35s. or 2l. - it cost me 3l. 10s.; the other was worth 12s. or 14s. - I do not remember what it cost; the tea-spoon is worth 2s., the boots 18s. or 1l., and the coral 12s. or 14s.; I cannot tell how much money there was.</p>

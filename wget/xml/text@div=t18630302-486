                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, at Stutley-terrance, Camden-town—on 12th February, about a quarter to 4 in the morning, I was rung up by a policeman—I got up, went down, opened the front-door, and let him in—we afterwards went into the yard—the police<lb></lb>man looked in the dust hole, which is a kind of shed, and there found the Prisoner; I saw him bring him out—I had gone to bed at half-past 1, but at a quarter to 1, I went into the back premises and fastened it up—the house was all right—there was no one in the tap-room—the prisoner was not intoxicated—the glass of the fan-light over the back-door was broken; it was quite sound when I went to bed—the steps were in the yard when I went to bed; I found they had been moved and placed close to the fan<lb></lb>light, so that anybody at the top of those steps might have broken it—I had</p>

               <p>locked the parlour-door over night outside—I found that had been cut away to enable him to get the lock back, but he had not cut away sufficient to do so—he must have got into the parlour through the window; and as he could not open that door, he must have got out of the window again, and then broken the fan-light to unlock the top-bolt of the back-door—the parlour-window was open—no property was missing on this occasion—the house had been entered on the Sunday previous, and somebody had evidently been in the house on this night.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, S</hi> 428). I was on duty at half-past 4 on the morning of 12th February, in Buck-street—I heard a smash of glass at the rear of the Buck's Head public-house—I ran to the wall and listened a second or two—I examined the wall, and found marks and fresh scratches on it, indicating that some one had been over; my brother-constable, Woolonugh, came up—I heard some one moving at the back of the pro<lb></lb>secutor's premises—I got up on the wall—Woolnough went and rang the bell, and the prosecutor came down; and while he and Woolnough were in the house, I saw the prisoner come from the prosecutor's back-door and go into the dust-hole and conceal himself—we brought him out, took him to the station, searched him, and found on him a piece of candle, several silent-matches, six keys, and a pair of scissors broken, with the rivet out—they would be serviceable in pushing back the catch of a window, and the marks inside the parlour-door were such as would appear to have been made by such an instrument—the prisoner was perfectly sober—all he said was that he had never been there before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On the morning of 12th February, I heard the smash of glass, and ran to the corner of Buck-street—I rang up the prosecutor, and went through the house with him—I then went to the dust-hole and there found the prisoner—I asked what he was doing there—he said, "Nothing"—he was under the steps leading from the back-door to the yard, in a heap of ashes, partly sitting up in them; his feet and legs were in the ashes, and he was half covered up with them—he was not the least the worse for liquor.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant, S</hi> 34). My attention was drawn to the house on 12th February, about 9 o'clock in the morning—on turning over the dust where the prisoner was found, I found this mortised chisel and three wax-matches, which would burn for about half a minute—I found marks up the outside wall, as if the bricks had been scraped, and also on the wall under the parlour-window—on the window-sill I found dirt and footmarks, and on the seat under the window inside—I found a portion of the woodwork of the parlour-door cut or scraped away close by the lock—it was not cut enough to get the lock open—as long as that door remained shut he could not get into the rest of the house.</p>

The words have all been put into the witnesses months by the counsel; I am as innocent as any of you; the candle I was obliged to use in my work, and the matches I use being a smoker.</p>

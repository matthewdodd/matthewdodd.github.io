                  </hi>. I am a slop-cutter, and live in Manchester-street, Waterloo-town, Bethnal-green—I am a married. On the 12th of December I found myself in Wentworth-street—I was in a state of intoxication—I cannot say what time it was—it was after seven o'clock at night—I cannot say, how I got into a house in Wentworth-street, but I recollect being in a house, and the two prisoners were there—Blake called a woman, named Simpson, and asked me to give them some money, to get something to eat and drink—Simpson was to get it—Blake called her "mother"—I gave her some coppers out of my pocket—when she was gone, I fell asleep, and when I awoke there was no light in the room—my bat was off my head—I could not find it—on looking across the room, I saw there was a bed<lb></lb>stead, and heard persons talking below stairs—I threw myself on the foot of the bedstead, thinking some persons would come up, and this Hannah Simpson came up stairs—I jumped up and caught her hand, and she was taken up—she said, if I came on the Monday evening, she would point out the person who robbed me—I got up, and got home as well as I</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. On the 14th of December I was on duty in Wentworth-street—I overheard Simpson charging Blake with having robbed the man—Simpson said she had been charged with it, and suffered for it, and she was determined she would tell of Blake—Wood was not there at that time—I went to a house, where my brother officer took Wood—she voluntarily admitted to me, that she had taken the watch out of the man's fob, and given it to a man named <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>—and she said so be<lb></lb>fore the magistrate—Blake said, she said, she had nothing to do with robbing the man; she only had half-a-crown of the money.</p>

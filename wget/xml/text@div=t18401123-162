On the 11th of November, I had a carpet worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the door of my shop—I saw it safe there about six o'clock, when I went out—when I came home, about seven o'clock, I missed it—my wife and boy were in care of the shop—I have an idea that I have seen the prisoner lurking about the road, but not on that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the Thames-police. On the 11th of November, in consequence of information, I was at the house of one Stanley, a barber, in Brick-lane, searching the house, with a search-warrant—between six and seven o'clock, I was sitting in the back parlour, and heard a knock at the back door, like a person's knuckles—the door opens into a yard communicating with the next house—I opened the door and found the prisoner drawing this carpet through the passage—he was stooping down, and pulling it through the passage, close to the door—he said, in an under tone, "Is he at home?"—I said, "Yes, walk in"—I took hold of his collar, and pulled him in—I was not in my police-dress—I asked where he got it from—he said two gentlemen in black had hired him to bring it to a barber's shop, and had given him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he should not know them again if he saw them.</p>

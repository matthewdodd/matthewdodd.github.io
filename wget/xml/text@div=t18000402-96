               <p>MARY LOCKE sworn. - I am the wife of Thomas Locke, who keeps <placeName id="t18000402-96-crimeloc524">the Bell, in Warwick-lane</placeName>

               <p>THOMAS LOCKE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I keep the Bell in Warwick-lane: My wife shewed me two shillings, which I knew to be bad; directly after that,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020087"></xptr>Elton came in, and tendered 2 shilling for a glass of gin; I told him it was bad; they seemed to be all exactly of the same make; I said it was a bad one, and he without putting his hand into his pocket to feel for more money, put a good one into my hand; he went away, and I followed him, and saw all the three women prisoners standing together at the corner of Rose-street, in Newgate-market; and when they got towards Giltspur-street from Newgate-street, they all joined company and conversation; they all went to the door of the constable, who keeps a public-house near the corner of Hosier-lane; they staid there in conversation I suppose a minute; they left that house without going in; I went in and enquired for an officer, and he said he was an officer; I took him with me, and we watched them to another public-house in Hosier-lane, kept I believe by a Mr. Pettit, the Coachmaker's-arms; I saw Mincher and Elton standing at the door; Ladbroke took them into custody, and I went into the house; the prisoner Dunn had a screw-box in her hand, and a shilling lying before her upon the barcounter, of the same make; Dunlap was standing by the side of her; then they were taken into custody; I delivered the two shillings that my wife gave me, to the officer; I marked them with the letter I before I gave them to him.</p>
               <p>- LADBROKE sworn. - I am an officer: (Produces the two shillings.)</p>
               <p>Locke. These are the two that I delivered to the officer, which I received from my wife.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Locke. The same shillings that I gave to my husband, I received from the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Ladbroke. I keep a public-house the corner of Hosier-lane: I went with Mr. Locke and apprehended Elton and Mincher at Mr. Pettit's door; the other two were in doors; I waited till Mr. Locke brought them out; I searched the man and the woman that was at the door; I found upon Elton one shilling, and as soon as I laid hold of it, I said, this is a bad one; and he had some small change in his pocket, which I knew was good, which I returned to him, there were about eight or nine-pennyworth of halfpence as near as I could guess; Mincher had a sixpence and some halfpence, altogether to the amount of about one shilling and sixpence; the other two I did not search till I got them to the Compter; Dunlap had change, in halfpence, to the amount of nine-pence or ten-pence; they were good, and I returned them; upon Frances I found about eighteen-pence, sixpence in silver, and the rest in halfpence; they made use of very ill language, and said they would go along with me, but I should not find any thing about them; and some person holloaed out that I had not got the right of the swag; but it being dusk, I could not see who it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. WILLIAM PARKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. These shillings are both counterfeit; they are both newly coloured, and both of the same manufacture.</p>
               <p>(Ladbroke produced the shilling he found upon Elton.)</p>
               <p>Parker. This is a counterfeit of the same manufacture; they appear to be all alike; they have not been in circulation since they have been coloured.</p>
               <p>Dunlap's defence. I took it in the street; I go out with a barrow of cats and dogs' meat; I took it of a footman, but I do not know the family he lives in.</p>
               <p>Frances's defence. I was very much in distress, going to the parish to get some relief if I could; my child was crying for bread, and I was crying, and a gentleman in Smithfield gave me that shilling.</p>
               <p>Mincher's defence. I pledged an apron for one shilling and sixpence; and received that shilling at Mr. Berry's, upon snow-hill.</p>
               <p>Elton's defence. I had taken that shilling over night; I did not know it was a bad shilling.</p>

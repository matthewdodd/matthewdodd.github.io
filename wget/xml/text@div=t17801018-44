               <p>I am deputy to Mr. Marshall, at the Bill of Middlesex-office, Clifford's-Inn. On the 4th of April last, Collins, and Roberts came together, late in the evening, after office hours, in Hillary vacation, to make an affidavit, and have a bill of Middlesex signed on that affidavit; I administered the oath to Collins; the affidavit was reduced to writing; this is it (producing it) I asked him if it was his hand-writing? He said it was. I asked if the contents were true? He said they were. Roberts appeared to me to be the attorney, but I did not ask him whether he was an attorney or not.</p>
               <p>Did he sign any thing? - I did not see either of them sign any thing, I signed my name after it was sworn.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt these are the two men? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>(The affidavit read.)</p>
               <p>Court. This affidavit appears to be the affidavit of

               <p>Roberts appeared as an attorney, did he say or do any thing? - Yes; I told him he must pay expedition money because it was after office hours. Roberts hesitated, and said Jones was a poor man and could not well afford it.</p>
               <p>Did he call him by the name of Jones? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Afterwards Roberts paid it? - He did.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Do not you remember exceeding well it was all the money he had in his pocket; that he paid the shilling out of his pocket; and you remarked it was a large sum of money to be owed to him? - I did. I remarked it was a large sum of money to be owed to such a man as that. He said it was a large sum, but that the defendant was able to pay it. I said it was a pity he was not willing. Collins said he would make him willing.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Who paid the shilling he or me? - To the best of my knowledge you paid it; it was to you I directed my discourse.</p>
               <p>Roberts. It was a publick business, I do not know that I did not pay it? - Whether Jones gave it to him, I do not know; I was within the desk; they were behind the rails.</p>

               <p>Court. You say you know the warrant was made out, how do you know if you did not see it? - By the mark which is made on the bill as having a warrant made out; besides that, I saw the warrant.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am bag-bearer and porter to the sheriff's office. Roberts, the attorney, as he pretended to be, knocked at the door with his knuckles a little before seven o'clock in the evening. The office is shut at six. When I opened the door he said, Mr. Thomas, cannot I have a warrant this evening? I told him no, he could not after the office was shut, without paying extra for it. He said he would pay any thing extra because the man he was going to arrest was going off, and he should lose the debt. He asked me then what the warrant would come to? I said half-a-crown if it was a common bill of Middlesex. He said it was. He said he would go to the Apple-tree ale-house , in Cursitor-street; that his clients were there, and would let them know and get the money, for he had not the money with him. I told him he must make haste because we had but one gentleman in the office who signed warrants, and he would be gone. He came back directly with the half-crown in his hand to have the warrant made out. I let him into the office.</p>
               <p>Did you see him get the warrant? - I carried it to the Apple-tree to him. Mr. Cater signed the warrant at that time; he gave him the writ and paid the money and went away, and desired me to carry it to the Apple-tree ale-house to him.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Burchell. Who has the writ? - It has been in my custody ever since; we file them regularly in the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thomas. Mr. Cater filled up the warrant, and when he came to look on the back of the bill for the indorsement, there was no sum nor date, there was only T. Parry, I think on the back of it.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Burchell. T. Parry is endorsed on the back where the attorney's name is usually endorsed? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thomas. Mr. Cater looked at the two shillings and sixpence, one of the shillings was bad. He said there is no endorsement on the back, take the half-crown back to the gentleman at the Apple-tree, and the gentleman must go without it, I cannot stay any longer. I took it back with the half-crown, and said Mr. Cater could not stay any longer, he could not have it done. He said, for God's sake let me have it done, for we shall lose the debt, you shall have a good shilling in a minute. He told Shears he must give him a good shilling for the bad one.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180054"></xptr> Shears gave it him, and then he gave me the two shillings and sixpence. He called for a pen and ink to write the endorsement. Roberts was very drunk when he wrote that endorsement on the back. I saw him write it, and then we came back together for the warrant.</p>
               <p>Was he in liquor when he first came to you? - Very much both times. Mr. Cater asked him what officer he was to have it made to; he said Armstrong. He was told Armstrong was gone to Ireland. He said he had an order from his clients not to put Clipson's name to it, but he might put it; it would do. He told me then as soon as he had got the warrant I should go down to the Apple-tree to produce the warrant, and tell them he had paid the half-crown, else they would think he had sunk it. When I got the warrant I went down to the Apple-tree ale-house , Roberts was sitting at the door waiting for me; he desired me to come in and said I will shew you the person you are to give the warrant to, he is one of my clients. When I went in, he pointed to Shears, and said, there give it to him. I could not see his face then for his hat was flapped over his eyes, and Collins's hat was the same; they were both sitting down by the fire; it was rather dark. I gave it to Shears. The boy brought a candle in for them to look at it. He desired the boy to take the candle away for they did not want any candle at all. When Shears looked up and told the boy to take the candle away, I saw his face and knew him; he had been at the office before to offer himself for an officer. He took the warrant and stooped down by the fire side and read it by the light of the fire to Jones; then he said well, now you think this will do, this is all right.</p>
               <p>What name did he call the tall man by when he mentioned him? - He did not mention any name, but said it will do. Jones made answer, "I don't know, you know best, if you think it is right; I suppose it is all right; I shall leave it to you."</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of these men before? - Yes, Shears came to offer himself as an officer; I had seen Roberts before.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any doubt whether any or all of these men were at the Apple-tree? - They were all there.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt as to the person of either of them? - No, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Shears. At what time was the warrant made out? - I carried it to the Apple-tree a little before seven o'clock on the 4th of April.</p>
               <p>Was it not day-light then? - Not where they sat, they sat by the fire.</p>
               <p>Jones. Do you think I was in liquor when you saw me at the Apple-tree? - I do not know; he hung down his head more than either of the other men.</p>
               <p>Jones. Do you know whether I was asleep or awake at the time? - I know you was awake, I saw your eyes open.</p>

               <p>Roberts. Whether I was not very anxious to have Armstrong's name to it? - Armstrong was the person whose name was pitched upon to be put to the warrant.</p>

               <p>I am a wine merchant in Coventry-street. On the 5th of April I was arrested for eleven hundred pounds, at the suit of one

            .</p>
               <p>Was you indebted to that plaintiff, or to any person of the name of Jones, in the sum of eleven hundred pounds? - Not to any one of that name, not a shilling; I do not know any person of that name, but one in Oxford-road, and he is indebted to me; to him I am not indebted, nor ever was. I saw Roberts three or four days after at Hicks's-hall, acting as an attorney, he was taken up by Clipson on my application and carried before a magistrate. He said before the magistrate he was an attorney, and had done what was right, and to shew his innocence he would produce the plaintiff, or to that effect. He said his name was Roberts, and that he officiated for some person of the name of Parry, who was a gentleman in the town of Danby , sollicitor for the government there. I understood that he was his clerk, and Parry had given him authority to use his name.</p>
               <p>He admitted that he put the name T. Parry on the writ? - He did. In consequence of his information Jones was taken into custody. The constables went after him and brought him to the tavern where we waited. Upon my seeing Jones or Collins, I asked him if he knew me? He said no, but he supposed I might be the defendant. He said he was very sorry for what he had done, and exclaimed in the most poignant manner against Shears, who he said had taken him in.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not relate any thing he said relative to Shears or Roberts , except they were present? - Roberts was present I believe; but I am certain. Previous to my having seen Roberts and

                  Collins

             I should have mentioned that I saw Shears; I took Mr. Berry, the attorney along with me to Cock-lane, where it was said Shears, the timber-merchant, lived, and I found him at home.</p>
               <p>When was that? - The day of the arrest.</p>
               <p>How did you get discharged from the arrest? - I put in bail immediately. I was not taken out of the counting-house.</p>
               <p>What passed between Shears and you? - I must rather relate a conversation between another person and him in my presence: the attorney, Mr. Berry, of Meard's-street, Soho, asked him if he had not given a writ , or which way he came by the writ that was given to Clipson? To which he replied, that writ was left at his house by a stranger.</p>
               <p>He asked him how he came by the writ against you? - Yes. Shears said, what is there any thing amiss? Mr. Berry gave him to understand there was, and asked him how he came to get possession of the writ? He said that having been an officer in the Marshalsea-court , it was not generally known, but he was one yet. Mr. Berry gave him to understand that if he could find the party out and give him notice about it that he should be rewarded for it. He promised he would, and that he would see the man that night.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not relate what he said after that promise of reward.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect what Collins said to you? - I have it under his hand, and in several ways acknowledging his guilt. When they were before Justice Addington or Justice Wright, Roberts said he wished to be understood not to have any knowledge of Collins, but only by the name<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180056"></xptr> of Jones. Collins insisted upon it, that he knew him very well, and gave me this paper (producing it) to shew me what a rascal Roberts was; it is a paper of Robert's handwriting, to shew that he knew that his name was Collins.</p>
               <p>Do you know it to be his hand-writing? - I believe so; there is a person who will prove it.</p>
               <p>When it was shewn to Roberts, did Roberts acknowledge it to be his hand-writing? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Did you ever shew it me at all? - No; from the first moment he was apprehended, he said he was made the tool of Roberts and Shears; that they knew what he was about, but he did not know himself.</p>
               <p>Did he say that in their presence? - In the presence of Roberts.</p>
               <p>What did Roberts say to that? - I do not recollect; I know nothing more but apprehending of Collins at Guildsord , after he was discharged on account of not being indicted.</p>

               <p>"Roberts, at chambers, Barnard's</p>
               <p>"Inn." It was a memorandum for Collins to meet Roberts on this business.</p>
               <p>Where did Roberts live? - No. 19, Seacoal-lane; he was found there when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>There is no date to this paper?</p>
               <p>Mr. Robson. He gave it to me on the 7th of April.</p>
               <p>Roberts to Mr. Robson. I believe the first time you saw me was at Hicks's Hall, on the 7th of April? - Yes; I do not know that I ever saw you in my life before.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Whether he saw any temerity or fear in me, such as guilt would produce? - I think I did.</p>
               <p>How came Jones to be called Collins? who mentioned the name first? - Upon applying to the Middlesex Office, I had a description of Jones and Roberts; I went to the Prothonotary's Office , to enquire if they knew any such person as had been described to me. One of the Marshalsea officers said,</p>
               <p>"Good God! that must be Collins and red-faced Roberts." On requesting of the Prothonotary to know if Collins had made any affidavits in their office, he said he had. I begged to see the affidavits. He took down the file and shewed me, and on comparing the hand-writing -</p>
               <p>Court. You must not mention that.</p>
               <p>Roberts. When I was taken to Litchfield-street, Clipson was treated indignantly there, and kicked out of the office; they would not take his oath.</p>
               <p>Court. If you mean to impeach the character of Clipson as a witness, you must not examine any witnesses to what other people said, but call the persons who said it.</p>
               <p>Roberts. When you and I parted at the end of Bow-street, did not you give me a direction to your attorney? - Probably I might, I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Did not you desire me to ask Jones how or wherefore he formed this conspiracy? - I think it is very likely; I do not remember it. I rather think I did.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Did not you promise to reward me if I found it out? - Probably I might, I wished very much to investigate it to the bottom.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you offer this man any reward? - I was very wary what I said, I thought some of the persons would turn cat-in-pan, and tell their employers.</p>
               <p>Did you offer him any reward if he made any discovery? - I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Did he make any discovery? - Never any.</p>
               <p>Roberts. I did make a discovery, I sent him a letter, and he called twice at my lodgings in consequence of it? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Consider what a situation I am in here for subornation of perjury, for God's sake do not be guilty of it yourself. Did you receive a letter from me? - More than one.</p>
               <p>Roberts. You know my hand-writing I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180057"></xptr> suppose whether it is similar to the letter you have produced?</p>
               <p>Court. He does not know that the letters come from you.</p>
               <p>Roberts. I gave him an account in writing according to his own desire, and made every discovery that was in my power.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you in consequence of any information received from the prisoner, make any enquiry, and did that enquiry lead to any discovery? - I have never been able to make any discovery from any information I have received as yet.</p>
               <p>Did it lead to any enquiry or discovery? - None but what would have come out without it,</p>
               <p>Did that information prove to be true? - No.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Your counsel says there was a conspiracy against you, I wish to know if you could find any traces that I was concerned with those parties? - I do not know that there were any conspirators besides these parties.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Whether we were acquainted? - I have every reason to believe you did know both the other prisoners; Sheers and he were acquainted.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Did not you call twice at my lodgings? - I think I was twice at his lodgings; I never had any interview with him.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Do you bear the expence of this prosecution?</p>
               <p>Counsel. It is nothing to you whether he does or not? - I am a member of a society; we have certain rules by which we engage to each other in certain cases to be at a common expence; I expect this will be at the common expence.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Very well, I much admire it and think it is a very good one! Did you ever see Mr. Murrell, a constable at Islington, who had me in custody , while I was seeking after Jones? - I think the last time I saw him was the night this indictment was found.</p>
               <p>You saw him at Islington? - I think I saw him once at Islington.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him I had done every thing in my power? - I do not recollect; when he was apprehended I did not know but he might have been deceived.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you recollect whether you said so? - I rather think I did not; I think my ideas at that time were very well fixed.</p>
               <p>Roberts. You said in your evidence that I gave you directions where Jones was to be found? - You did.</p>
               <p>Where was it? - You went along with the constable.</p>
               <p>Roberts. I repeat the question again, where I gave the direction to find Jones? - All I know is, that he offered to take him to the plaintiff, and the constable , and he, and I do not know whether Clipson did not go; several persons went together, but I was not present.</p>
               <p>Roberts. I should be glad to ask Storey a question. When did you see me write? -</p>
               <p>Storey. In Mr. Robson's counting-house, on the side of the desk I write on.</p>
               <p>Mr. MOYSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I believe you was present and heard some of the prisoner speak of this transaction? - Mr. Robson is a member of the society I am a member of, he came on Wednesday night and complained of this matter, we agreed to prosecute if we could find the persons. I was present when Roberts gave the directions to find Collins; that was before Justice Blackborough in Clerkenwell; he said he would go with the constables to the plaintiff. He said he could find him. We desired that if they found him they would come to the Jerusalem tavern , Clerkenwell, and we would be at the tavern to see them. Neither Mr. Robson nor I went with them. We went to the Mansion-house to hear the the examination before Mr. Alderman Kitchen; on our return we found Roberts, constable, and Collins together at the Jerusalem tavern. When Mr. Robson came in he went up to Collins, or nearly to him, and asked Collins if he knew him? Collins said he did not know him; but he said I suppose you are the defendant. Roberts and he were close together. Mr. Robson then asked him if he owed him any thing? Collins said no, he did not. Mr. Robson then asked him if he had not sworn to that debt of eleven hundred pounds , by the name of

               <p>All I have to say is, I was entirely innocent in the matter; I did not intend to injure Mr. Robson; I told him I would endeavour to give him every information in my power. I never intended to prejudice or hurt him. Sheers said it was only to do a friendly action for him, it was only to lock up a person for an hour, that no harm would come of it. I did do it I acknowledge. I am very infirm, I hope it will not affect my life.</p>

               <p>I am not guilty wilfully or intentionally. If they have deceived me I cannot help it. I had no malice against Robson. There is no evidence that I ever received a farthing for it. To my sh ame I was much in liquor at the time. I gave every information I could; I gave directions for the constable to find out Jones. I went to two different houses in the court, but could not find him. At last we found him at No. 8. The girl said that he went out at six in the morning. I went into the garrett and found him in his shirt hid in the chimney; I pulled him out. I gave Mr.

               <p>Mr. Robson. I believe I asked Sheers if he had made a full discovery of the other conspirators, and who it was that employed him? To which I think he gave me some strange answer, very unsatisfactory; that he would not squeak, or something of that kind, and that I had ruined him.</p>
               <p>Shears to Clipson. You know I was a Marshalsea-court officer; whether it was not usual to share the profit?</p>
               <p>Clipson. Yes, it was; I have executed several writs he brought in, in the Marshalsea-court, and the Sheriff's-court too; I used always to allow him half the profit.</p>

               <p>You understand my question; are you in his service now? - Yes, every day, when I am in his labour.</p>
               <p>What do you do for him? - I load and unload, pack and repack silk, and carry money out and bring money in.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You said you was servant to Mr. Fletcher? - Yes; Mr. Fletcher is Mr. Peach's clerk; he pays me my wages; I am a ticket-porter; I have done nothing for any body but Mr. Peach and his family a great many years.</p>
               <p>You are not a lawyer or writer? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the reason of your knowing Roberts so much in his profession? - I had a matter in hand eight or nine years ago; he undertook it, and went through it very judiciously; he gives his total labour away almost to serve other people.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I suppose then he is a gentleman of fortune, and practices law for his diversion? - He has been in prison these four months; the distress he has been in would make the stoutest heart in this court to melt.</p>
               <p>Are you sober? - Really, verily, and truely.</p>

               <p>Roberts. I will call Mr. Kirby , the keeper of the Compter, to prove I was the only person that refused to take the advantage of being released by the mob; he has known me three or four years.</p>

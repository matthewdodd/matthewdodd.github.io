                  </hi>. I am a rope-maker, and live in Blue Anchor-road, Rotherhithe. On 29th Jan. I had my fowls locked up all right in my rope-yard about three o'clock—next morning, about seven o'clock, I found the place had been broken open and ten fowls were missing—I went to a dung-heap and found three of the fowls deposited there—I let them remain, and gave notice to the police—they sent two officers to watch till the evening—they came in the evening with the fowls and the prisoner.</p>

I received information that these fowls were in the dung-heap—I concealed myself till half-past six o'clock—I saw the prisoner come to a gate opposite where the fowls were—he waited till some people had passed; he then got over the gate, and went to where the fowls were deposited—he stooped down, and went round the dung-heap—I lost light of him for a minute—I then saw him go to the gate and get over—I took him—he had a bundle under his arm—I asked what he bad got—he said he did not know—I said, "You may see what they are, they are fowls"—the legs were sticking out—he then said he had found them—I said I must take him to the station—he dropped a pair of shoes from his hand—he had his own shoes on—I told him about the fowls being stolen last night—he said he was not there that night, he was in Covent-garden till eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

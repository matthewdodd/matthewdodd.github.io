                  </hi>. I carry on business in Bridge-street, Backfriars. The prisoner had been my servant, and left about two months—he had no right on my premises—on the 3rd of November, I saw him walking out of my yard, with a hamper on his back—I opened a window, and asked my man who it was—he said, "Benjamin"—I said, "What has he on his back?"—he said, "A hamper"—I said, "Call him back"—he did not come back—I came down, and followed him into the street—he was in the act of opening the hamper—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Bring it back"—he brought it back, and opened it—I saw this halter and two plates in it, which were part of a service, of which I have lost a hundred pieces, and a stone bottle.</p>

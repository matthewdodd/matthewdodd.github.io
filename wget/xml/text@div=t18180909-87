On Saturday the 1st of August I saw her in the field, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon. She could not get out of the field, it is not likely, the gate was fast. Next morning, between six and seven o'clock, I missed her. I saw her again on the Tuesday following, the 4th of August, at Hackeny, in the custody of Garva, and am certain she is mine. She is worth 10l. I know the prisoner Lawrence, he lived about a mile from me. Burgess lived about the same distance. I never saw them in company together.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On Sunday the 2d of August, about four o'clock in the morning, I took the prisoners into custody. I saw them come over Lcc Bridge, they took the towing-path; they were both riging on one mare, with a sack on its back. I asked where they were going, they said they were going home to Shadwell. I asked what was in the sack, they said it was corn for the horse; I found it was poultry. I took them immediately to the watch-house.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090041"></xptr>Q. Did not they say anything about the horse - A.Lawrence said they found the horse grazing as they came along, and took it to carry the fowls on-both agreed in this story; at the watch-house they said they took the fowls from Mr. Walker's.</p>

            . I am constable of Hackney. The prisoners were brought to me at the watch-house, with the mare and the sack, which contained the poultry. I asked where they got the mare? they said they saw two bargemen riding her; that they drove her away, and then they took her to ride. I shewed the mare to Mr. Field, he recognized her immediately.</p>

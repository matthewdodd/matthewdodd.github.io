Simpson come from Pye—gardens, and go into the stable, and afterwards I saw him looking out of the door of the loft.</p>

I must do justice; I must call Mr. Kennard, the clerk"—I called him up, and made some communication to him—Mr. Sells was called—before he was called Jacobs told Mr. Kennard be was very sorry for what he had done; it was the first offence—when Mr. Sells came, we went into Simpson's stable—we there found a large bin, full of corn—we did not find any sacks of corn in the stable—I took a sample of the corn in the bit—we went back to the prosecutor's—Jacobs then said, before Mr. Kennard the others, that he was very sorry, and that they were not sacks; they weretkee cotchells—there were a few oats in the sacks when they were returned—I produce a sample of oats from Simpson's stable, and from the prosecutor's.</p>

Simpson deals with me—my attention has been called to Saturday morning, the 29th of Aug—I sold Simpson bran and beans on the Friday evening—I had not sold him any corn myself—I had not been at home in the daytime—I have ascertained that corn bad been sold to him almost everyday in the week, a sack or two—I am not able to say whether I sold him such corn as this—I had about twenty quarters of such oats as these in my possession, with some black oats mixed with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any such corn as this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think these are Dutch oats—I had about twenty quarters—I think there are more black oats in these than in the Dutch oats I had—I think these are not my Dutch oats, but I had Polish oats—these are not my Polish oats.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man. In the beginning of Ang. I was in Simpson's service—I remember his having a job at Richmond—I had to go about it—to cart 160 tons of coals—we ran short of sacks—he borrowed four corn—sacks of Jacobs, because he had not enough—we executed the order—we went there on the 5th of Aug., and came home on the Sunday afterwards, and went back on Monday to finish—I had the misfortune to lose one of the four sacks—when the job was finished I tied up the three sacks, and deposited them in Mr. Simpson's loft—I did not go to them till the Friday previous to Mr. Simpson being taken on the Saturday morning—I had I smock—frock with them—I had torn it, and wanted to take it home to my wife, and I went to the sacks on the Friday, and untied them to get the garter off, that I had tied them with—that was on the day before Mr. Simpson was taken—I found the sacks just as I had left them—one of the sacks had a hole in it—these sacks are a great deal like them—they are similar—they were old sacks, had been used some time, and looked to be half—worn out—they were such as these—I should not like to swear to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live in Whitecross-street. I have known the prisoner about two years—he is a porter in Covent<lb></lb>garden market, and has been so twenty years—on Tuesday, the 29th of March, he came to my shop about eleven o'clock in the morning, alone—he told me that he knew of a pony that would suit me—I told him I was very busy, and could not go to see any pony that day, as I was going to Greenwich—he said it would not take me long, it was at the Golden Lion in St. John's-street—I told him to fetch it—he said he could not, there was something to pay—my farrier came in, and I asked him to go with me to look at it—we went, and at a short distance from my shop another man joined the prisoner—we all went to the Golden Lion, the prisoner and the other man fetched the pony out of the stable, and ran it down the yard—I said it was too small for me, I would not have it—we then went to have something to drink, and the other man kept asking me what I would give for the pony—he said I might get something out of it—I told him I would give him 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—(the other man had before asked me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—the prisoner told me he would ask me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, but I could have it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—when I proposed to give 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, the other man said he would take it back again, but at last he agreed to take it—I said I should require a receipt and his address—the prisoner then asked the landlord if he could accommodate him with pen, ink, and paper, which he did, and the prisoner began writing the receipt—I said, the other man should write it—he said he could not write, and the prisoner wrote it, and the other man marked it—I objected to the first mark he made, as it was not opposite the name—he then made another mark—this now produced is it—the other roan then went to fetch the pony, and the prisoner asked me for something for himself, and said if I had not bought it he should have asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get it away—I said I should see how it turned out—he said, "What you are going to give me, give me now, before he comes back"—I gave him half-a-crown—the other man came back with the pony while the prisoner was there—I received the pony, and the other man went out with the prisoner to pay him—he said to the prisoner, "Come here, and I will satisfy you"—he went out with him, and I came away with the pony—(<hi rend="italic">receipt read.</hi>)—"March 29.

               <p>to me at the yard, and asked if I knew any body that wanted, or would purchase a pony—I told him I did not, but recollecting a gentleman who came and put up, had asked me if I knew of one to let him know, I asked the prisoner the size of it—he said about twelve hands high—he said it was coming from the country, that it belonged to a gentleman's coachman, and that it was to be sold because the gentleman was coming home—he asked me what time he could see the gentleman—I said he was in the habit of coming on Tuesdays and Saturdays, and it would be best to see him about four or five o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner said that time would suit him best—I knew the prisoner worked in the market.</p>

I took the prisoner on the 2nd of April—I had had a communication from Mr. Wooster three or four days before—I told him I took him for being concerned with another in stealing a pony—he said, "What pony?"—I said, "The black pony you sold Wooster"—he said he had it sent from the country by a friend, to get a customer—I asked his name—he said, "Charles Miles," and be took this bit of paper from his pocket, with the name of Miles, Stanmore, on it—I went to the Red Lion public-house, and asked the ostler who brought the pony there—he could give no description of the person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was in the employ of Mr. Bowles. On Monday, 28th March, I was going across Long-lane, and saw a man offering the horse for sale; knowing that Wooster wanted one, I told the man I knew a person in Whitecross-street who would buy it, but he would not be at home until the next morning; he said he would put the pony up at the Golden Lion, St. John-street, which he did; I asked him-where he lived; he said at the Falcon, Stanmore, and that his name was Charles Miles; that the pony belonged to his father, and the reason they were going to sell it was, that they were not allowed to keep it in the farm because the gentleman was come home; he then went into the Bull's Head and asked the landlord to write "Charles Miles, Falcon, Stanmore," which the officer has produced; he gave it to me, and said be would pay me for my trouble, if I would go with him next morning. On Tuesday morning, about ten o'clock, I met the man in Smithfield, and we went to Wooster's together; I said to Wooster, "Here is a man has got a pony for sale, I think it will suit you;" we all went together to the inn; the man brought the pony out of the stable and ran it down the yard three or four times. Wooster said to the man "What do you want for it?" he said, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he said that was too much; he said, "What will you give?" he said 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the man said, "You may give me another crown, for I am to pay that man for his trouble."</p>

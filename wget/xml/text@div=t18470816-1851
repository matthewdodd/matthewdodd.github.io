                  </hi> I am a shoemaker, in Little Windmill-street, Hay<lb></lb>market. On Monday, the 16th of Aug., about a quarter-past twelve o'clock at night, I was coming from the city, and was inquiring my way of a gentleman, the prisoner came up, and told me she would show me the way—I cannot tell the name of the street I met her in—it was near to New Ox<lb></lb>ford-street—I walked a good distance with her—she brought me up a street, and told me that was my way—I began to shake the rain off my coat—she put her hand into my pocket, and took out 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was there loose—I had nothing else there—I followed her—she ran into a house—a woman stopped me in the passage—I came out, saw a policeman—I sent him in while I stood at the door—we could not find her—I saw her the next night, and gave her in charge—I am sure she is the person.</p>

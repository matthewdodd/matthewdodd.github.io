                  </hi>. I live in Fenton Street, Old Kent Road—about one o'clock on the morning of 27th January I was going on the temporary bridge at Blackfriars—when I reached the first recess the prisoner and three others rushed against me and knocked me down—there were no other persons about—I cannot say which of them ran against me—while on the ground I felt a tug at my watch, and on looking down found it was gone—the other three ran towards the Surrey side, and the prisoner towards the City; I followed him, and at the foot of the bridge a policeman stopped him—I was sober.</p>

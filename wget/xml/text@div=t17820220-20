            , with intent to steal thus for the law is clear, that if a person breaks and on dwelling house of another, in the night, with intent to commit a felony, and is prevented from executing that intention, it is as much burglary as if the felony had been actually committed; for the reason why the law is so extremely penal in the case of burglary, is not so much for the protection of property of persons only, as for the security of their persons in the, hour of rest, and when they are not in a condition of protecting or taking care of themselves, and therefore the law holds in this particular offence, the attempt to commit a felony, if so far carried into execution as to break and enter a dwelling-house in the night, shall be as penal as if the rest of the felony had been compleatly committed; upon that part of the law there is no doubt. But there is another point in this indictment which is extremely doubtful; for it is laid in the indictment to be the dwelling house of

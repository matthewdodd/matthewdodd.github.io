                  </hi>. I am a carrier, and live at Godalmin. On the 6th of Sept. I had a person named Edwards in my service as a wagoner—I had missed several lots of corn, and been robbed to a great extent—on Sunday, the 6th of Sept, I went in my hay—loft and found some corn, which had no business there—I examined it—it was mine—the same description as what I had—there was about two bushels—it consisted of white oats, black oats, and split beans—I did not see any chicken's grits with it—I had before then been in communication with the officer, and he had full access to my stable—I gave information to the officer—next morning, about eleven o'clock, I gave out to Edwards, five bushels of corn in two sacks, and one sack of chaff to come to town—he had a right to take those three sacks—I made out his bill, but did not look into the wagon to see what he hadgot,</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief constable of Godalmin. On Sunday, the 6th of Sept., I went to Mr. Moon's stable—the corn and bay loft are on the same floor, over the stable—you pass through the hay loft to get to the corn loft—I looked under some hay lying in the loft, and saw a sack with about two bushels of corn in it, consisting of white oats, black oats, and split beans—I mixed about a pint of chicken's grits with it, and after I had so mixed it, I took a sample of it, which I have here—another sample has been shown to me since by Goff—I have compared the sample I have with the sample I saw—I have no doubt it is the same I mixed the grits with—I marked the sack with grey worsted—I have seen it since produced by Goff—it was the sack in which the corn was that I mixed the grits with—I took the prisoner in charge at Newington Sessions-house—I asked him what account he could give of those oats he had in his stable, that he had from Edwards—he said he knew nothing about it, he never had Any from Edwards.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184207040057"></xptr>
               <p>—on that day the prisoner presented a cheque, on account of the Mar<lb></lb>quis—(<hi rend="italic">looking at</hi> one)—this is it—it is signed in the Marquis's hand<lb></lb>writing—(the <hi rend="italic">cheque being read, was dated Feb</hi>., 1842, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">pay<lb></lb>able to Mr., Suisse and</hi> Co.)—I changed this cheque for him—among other notes, there were two 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-notes, No. 54,369, and No. 64,370, both dated 3rd of Feb., 1841; one of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., No. 95,758, dated 5th of Feb., 1841; another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., No. 95,759, dated 5th of Feb., 1841; the rest was in other notes—there were in all thirty of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., seventy of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., three of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and eleven of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might have done so—I cannot say that he did—he received very large sums—I should not think he received 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In a year—I should think if he received 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would be a large sum—he may have received that sum in a year—I have been there forty years—the Marquis had a pass-book in which entries were made from time to time of the cheques paid—he always "drew his own cheques—they were like this; except when in health, he wrote better perhaps.</p>

My Dear—, I have just received your kind letter, by which I perceive that I can reckon on your friendship, which I cannot too much appreciate, and of which I am proud to make myself worthy. Here is the plan which I had formed; to send by Brussels, two fine horses, with their coachman and their harness. I intend buying from you one of those Brussels carriages, the same as that in which I have seen you drive so often with all your family, a kind of covered <hi rend="italic">char-a-banc;</hi> at to my plate, far from selling it here; I am having a service made here, for which I expect to pay the duty, but I shall draw back here the duty on re<lb></lb>exportation, which will cover that which I shall have to pay abroad. As to the stamp, I had no idea of it as new plate, and I am ignorant whether by Calais, it would be the same thing. My first idea is that from Calais to Nancy, the distance is double that from Brussels to Nancy; if neverthe<lb></lb>less, the same formalities do not exist by the way of France, I will send plate by Calais; in any case, that will not prevent my passing through Brussels; that is to say, from Calais I shall go to you; that cannot is any case be before the month of June next, I shall not be ready before that time. I reckon on your kindness until then. If you can give me other information, have that kindness. Pray present my respectful duty to Madame, and dispose of him who will be all his life, with high considera<lb></lb>tion, your sincere and very devoted friend, <hi rend="smallCaps">SUISSE</hi>. A million of thanks to M. Felice, for the good opinion he has of me, and of the preference he gives me.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary. I was in the habit of attending the late Marquis of Hertford professionally for a con<lb></lb>siderable time—in January last he was very ill with <hi rend="italic">bronchitis,</hi> from which he in a great measure recovered, but he was taken ill again about the middle of February, with the same attack, chronic <hi rend="italic">bronchitis,</hi> from which last attack he never recovered, till he died—as far as I could judge he was in a sane state—he was in a half paralytic state—he had a difficulty in speaking, but, as far as comprehension went, I never found any difficulty in making him understand me, nor had I any difficulty in understanding him—paralysis did not constitute a portion of the attack—the paralysis had existed for some time prior.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THESSIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you attended the Mar<lb></lb>quis, did you generally find the prisoner with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes, and sometimes not—the Marquis's last illness began on February the 16th or 18th—I did not learn from him that he had gone with a party to Richmond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know, from having been his lordship's medical attendant, that he had the most perfect confidence in the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In as many words from himself I do not, but as far as the evidence of my senses went,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184207040066"></xptr>
               <p>that is, seeing one person about another, I should undoubtedly say that he certainly had—he appeared to have, undoubtedly—the prisoner was himself taken ill on the 16th of February—I was attending him—he was not able to attend on the Marquis in his last illness—he was confined to his room, and a great part of the time to his bed—he had an attack of erysipelas of the upper part of the chest, throat, and part of the head, which termi<lb></lb>nated in the formation of two large abscesses in the neck—attendance on the Marquis would undoubtedly be extremely irksome to a person—that state of semi-paralysis, as I may term it, existed for some considerable period—the time I cannot exactly say, but I should think a year or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That which would have made the attendance irksome and disagreeable, had lasted a year or two? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was after his lord<lb></lb>ship's return to town from Dover, whenever that took place, but I can form no minute of the date.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THESIOER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he require constant shifting and changing about? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Entirely, and frequently during the night; that is to say, if he was to be kept as a gentleman ought to have been; he would require constant attendance of course.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you knew very little of the habits of life of the Marquis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never chose to know them—I never made any inquiry about them—curiosity in medical men is the worst thing they can indulge in—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the habit of paying my accounts, and occasionally in the habit of giving me fees from the Marquis; sometimes the Marquis gave them to me himself, and sometimes Suisse gave the money to the Mar<lb></lb>quis, and the Marquis gave it to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you the opportunity of observing where the prisoner got the money, when he got it for Lord Hertford, to give to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I cannot say that I did; generally speaking, as far as my recollection serves me, I think he went and took it from some place, and gave it some<lb></lb>times to the Marquis, and sometimes he gave it to me himself—generally speaking, when the prisoner has been with me, it has been in the Mar<lb></lb>quis's bed-room, but occasionally the Marquis has given him a sort of nod, and he has given me the money afterwards; that happened very rarely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know who attended as the immediate personal servant of the Marquis during Suisse's illness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a man named Robert Foote, who is now very ill; he was his principal attendant, except during the last two or three days of the Marquis's life, when there was a female of the name of Mademoiselle Henriette, Foote attended personally on the Marquis, as well as the prisoner, when he was in good health, apparently under the direction of the prisoner; he was apparently the head servant.</p>

I think Mr. Croker arrived on the Sunday, I will not be positive; the Marquis died on the Ist of March, I think it was on Tuesday—I think Mr. Croker arrived the Sunday before—he was sent for—he did not stay there till his death, he went to Kensington for one night, I think, but I think the second night he was in the house—I will not speak positively—I considered the Mir<lb></lb>quis in danger before the Sunday Mr. Croker was sent for—he was in danger from the beginning of his last relapse—there was more or less hazard about his illness during the whole time it was on Saturday the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know a person who has been called Mademoiselle Henrietta? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I not know her—I saw her when I went to Lord Hertford on his last illness—as I was going out of the house she spoke to me as she was coming in—I think I never saw her but twice—I know a Miss Bourrielle, I saw her frequently with Lord Hertford—I dined with Lord Hertford more than once, where she also dined. I presume the is a French, woman from her speaking French—I know nothing at all about her—I never heard who she was—I looked upon her—indeed I really was not at all sorry that she attended Lord Hertford—I did everything in my power, when Lord Hertford went abroad, to induce him to take a medical man—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want to know who Miss Bourrielle is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I tell you that she is a person who attended Lord Hertford, and to say the truth, in my own opinion, much more as a nurse than any thing else—his lordship's state of health was so very bad—I believe she did not live at Dorchester-house—I do not know where she lived—I do not know that she came in the evening and went away in the morning—I know nothing about it, but I have seen her at dinner, and when Lord Hertford was travelling abroad, I have heard of that name—she was in the house when he and I dined in one room, I believe that she dined in another—I have dined with her more than three times at Dorchester-house—but when his lordship was travel<lb></lb>ling abroad before, I dined with him at several places—at Fontainbleau, for instance, and often in Paris, and she dined. in the house, but not with Lord Hertford and me on those occasions—I have dined with her several times at Dorchester-house—I never knew where she lived—yes, by the way, I think I did, and if you will allow me, I will tell you the reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Never mind your reason, where did she live? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Clarges-street—I never visited her there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have the kindness to tell me how you know she lived in Clarges-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When Lord Hertford was going away on the last occasion, he asked me to accompany him in his carriage to Westminster-bridge, or at far as I could go—he had an impression on his mind that he was not likely to see me again—I accordingly got into the carriage to go with him—to my surprise, the carriage stopped in Clarges-street—I said, "What is this for, how is this?"—he said, "It is only to take up Felicite Bour<lb></lb>rielle"—I said, "Excuse me, then, I cannot be in the carriage with Fe<lb></lb>licite Bourrielle," and I got out at the door in Clarges-ajreet, and left them—this was on the 12th or 13th of June last year, when he was going out of town last—I cannot say how often I had dined with Felicite Bourrielle before that—I had frequently dined at Lord Hertford's—he once invited me to dine with him, and to meet the Ladies—, and I was very much surprised when I came there, instead of those ladies, to see another—I do not think I dined with her after I refused to ride in the carriage with her—I will not be sure—I cannot say—I do not rightly recollect whether I dined with her since his lordship's return this last time—I rather think not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you give orders to have Suisse apprehended? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> should think I did not give the orders alone—the executors, of whom I am one, gave orders, I presume the same day on which he was appre<lb></lb>hended—I did not see him after he was apprehended—I cannot recollect what time in the day, hut it was in the afternoon—I cannot say at what time—there was a meeting at Lord Lowther's house—it was not during the time he was conferring with Mr. Brabant—it was what he said to Mr. Brabant, that excited our suspicions—he was apprehended the same day as the conversation with Mr. Brabant—I think on the 4th of April, but I really am not sure—I was not present at Mr. Brabant's interview with the prisoner, though I knew of it—I recollect Mr. Brabant's consulting me, but I do not know whether it was the same day the prisoner was ap<lb></lb>prehended—it was after I had been consulted—I have known Suisse for twenty years in the Marquis's service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he not the entire confidence of the Marquis during the greater part of that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really do not know what you mean by entire confidence—I should say not—Lord Hertford was a very reserved man, exceedingly silent and reserved—the prisoner was confidential for all pur<lb></lb>poses for which a servant can be confidential, I have not the slightest doubt, and appeared to me a faithful and attentive servant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that he was receiving and paying very large sums from time to time for the Marquis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Lord Hertford had a fit of illness—it is a question which I cannot answer yes or no to—I should say he was not, decidedly, during the greater part of the time, nor for the last ten years—for the last few months, I should say yes, but not for the last few yean—I have not looked into beyond the last few months of the Marquis's accounts at the bankers'—indeed I have not looked at the bankers' books at all—I have seen the last bankers' book immediately before Lord Hertford's death—the bankers' book begins on the 1st of January, and Lord Hertford died on the 1st of March, and during that time I saw that the prisoner had paid large sums of money—I did not look into other books—I began on that date—I do not think I was present at any time when the prisoner was told of his having a legacy of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the Marquis's will, or of his having a very large legacy under his late master's will and codicil—I do not think I was present at any conversation with anybody and him about the legacy—I do not remember it—I do not think that I ever saw Suisse. after the will was opened.</p>

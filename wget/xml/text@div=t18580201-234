                  </hi>. I keep the Sussex Arms beer shop. On 5th or 6th Jan., the prisoner came to my bar, and asked for a glass of half and half—she gave me in payment a shilling—I gave her change, and put the shilling in the till—I had no other shilling in the till, only a half crown, and some sixpences—about two minutes after the prisoner had gone, I exa<lb></lb>mined the shilling, and found it was a bad one—on 14th Jan., the prisoner came again about 10 minutes past 1 o'clock; she asked for a glass of half and half, and gave me a shilling—I knew it was bad, but I gave her the change, and kept the shilling in my hand—she drank the half and half, and went out; I followed her—I met a constable, and gave her in charge—she said why did not I tell her of it before I gave her in charge—I told her about her being at my house before—she denied it.</p>

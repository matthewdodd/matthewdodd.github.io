On the 2d of September a shopmate of mine and two of his friends came to see me; we spent the evening together; a little before nine he said he must go home; he asked me to go with him a little way; I said I did not mind. He lived at Paddington, and as we were going up the <placeName id="t18111030-69-crimeloc373">Hay market</placeName>

Ashby drawed the coat off my arm, and by drawing it off the lining came outside. The watchman came up and asked what was the matter, and wished us to disperse; we did; I looked round and Ashby was gone; we got intelligence which way she was gone; I went home. In the morning I went to Queen-square, and gave a description of Ashby, we took her in Pie-street, Westminster, we found my coat and waistcoat at the pawnbrokers.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you quite sober - A. I was fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure as to the woman - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say about the other woman - A. The other woman pawned the coat; I never saw her till the morning we went to take her.</p>
               <p>- M'GUIRR. Q. Were you of this party - A. Yes. In the Haymarket we met the prisoner, she asked us to give her some gin; we did. This young man ran against a man by accident, the man struck him with a stick in his face; he pulled his coat off one arm to defend himself, the prisoner pulled it off the other arm; the watchman interfered and wanted us to disperse, we did. I had seen Ashby with his coat, we looked for her and could not find her.</p>
               <p>JOHN GILLMORE. I apprehended Ashby and Churchill together; Ashby denied knowing the young man; I found she had pawned the waistcoat by Congee, and the coat by Churchill.</p>

               <p>Q. How were you certain that you had hit one of them? - A. Because he was so close that I could not miss him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was one of the Bow-street officers who went in the chaise; when we came to Bedfont, we observed two men drinking on horseback, at the Bell, that gave us a suspicion; about a quarter of an hour afterwards we had got down the lane, I suppose about a mile and a half, I repeatedly looked out at the window, and then observed two men coming after the chaise; I immediately said, here they are coming, one on each side; in about a minute they both came up nearly together, one rode violently past the other, and ran against the post-boy, knocked him off the horse upon the lead horse; he said, d-n your eyes, stop, or something of that sort; the other tapped the pistol against the glass, and said, money, you b-rs, money; Edwards then replied, gentlemen, do not be in a hurry, and I will give it you, at which moment the man at the horses' heads said, d-n your eyes, Jack, give it them; he spoke very quick, as if he was aware who we were.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the christian name of the man that was convicted here? - A. John Haines; at that instant the pistol was fired from the man at the side of the chaise, it came in at the side glass, and went out at the front off glass, taking a bit of the frame of the wood with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say, from the effect, whether it was loaded with ball? - A. Very clearly,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110004"></xptr>because it took a piece of the wood with it; Edwards then returned the fire, and said, I have hit him; I said, I am sure you have hit him; momentarily, the fire of the man at the horses heads came in at the front of the chaise, I have the ball,(produces it); it went into the lining just over Edwards's head, it had rolled itself up in the stuffing; I pursued the men but could not overtake them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any notion of the persons of the men? - A. No; except the colour of their clothes, and their horses being nearly alike; the horses were both dark bays, or rather brown bay; this is exactly the colour of the coats that they appeared to have on; the man at the horses heads, I thought, did not appear to be quite so tall as the other man; I got this coat from the Windsor-castle, at Hamersmith, where I got the mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Who delivered you the mare? - A. The ostler, he is here.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JONES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a Bow-street officer: I went with Dowsett and Edwards when the chaise was stopped.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any recollection of the persons of the men that stopped the chaise? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the horses? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HARRIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you know him? - A. I never saw him above once before.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I was a labourer in the India-House, I am now in the portering-work; any thing I can get to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Haines? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the man that was convicted in this place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any application to you by the prisoner Clark, or by Haines in the presence of Clark? - A. The prisoner at the bar came, on the 8th of November, with Haines, to the house where I lodged, the Moguls's-head, in Drury-lane; I believe it was on a Friday, I am not certain, it was about four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure it was the 8th of November? - A. Yes; Haines applied to me to get him a horse; I told him I would ask a person at the west end of the town of the name of Coles, whom I knew, I would try to get him one; and the next morning I got him a horse from Mr. Brown's in Clipstone-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go with you to Brown's for the purpose of getting a horse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go with you to Coles's? - A. No, not up to the house; the prisoner at the bar, and Haines, went to a public-house just by; Coles lived near Mr. Brown, but he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Haines and Clark wait for you? - A. At a public-house near Fitzroy-square, I do not know the sign of it; I returned to Haines and Clark, and told them I could not get one; I then went to Brown's, and left Haines and Clark at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. It was on the Friday you went to Brown's? - A. Yes, the day after they applied to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing the day that they applied to you? - A. No, I did not till the next day, and then they went with me to a public-house near Fitzroy-square.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Clipstone-street from that public-house? - A. A very little way; I got a horse there, and took it to them at the public-house where they were waiting for me, that was about five or six o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was that horse? - A. A brown horse; I delivered the horse to Haines at the end of a street leading into Piccadilly, they walked with me from the public-house; Clark was with Haines at the time I delivered the horse to Haines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from Haines, or from the prisoner Clark, where they were going with the horse? - A. No, I did not; I had hired the horse to go to Croydon, Haines told me he wanted a horse to go to Croydon that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Clark on foot, or on horseback, when you delivered the horse to Haines? - A. On foot; they both went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see Haines, or the prisoner? - A. On the Friday following I saw the prisoner at the bar in St. George's-fields, about the middle of the day, just beyond the Obelisk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alone at that time? - A. No, he had another person in company, who it was I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by accident that you met him there? - A. I had been to Clark's house to enquire for him, he lived in the Walworth-road, a little below the Elephant and Castle; Clark said he was going up to Islington to get a doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him before that? - A. Yes; I told him I wanted to see Haines particularly, because Mr. Brown would look to me to bring the horse back again, or something similar to that; he said he was going to Islington to meet the doctor, and he would shew me where Haines was; I went with him some way up Islington, and then he directed me to Union-square, Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did he direct you to Union-square? - A. To see Haines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the number of the house? - A. I think No. 4,</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the house? - A. Mrs. Jewry; I went up stairs, and there I found Haines up stairs in bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110005"></xptr>Q. How long was it before you saw Haines? - - A. He came in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, with the doctor; the doctor and the prisoner Clark had some private conversation, but what it was I did not hear, I came away soon after.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you came away, and while Clark was there, did you make any enquiry of Haines, or Clark, respecting the horse you had had from Brown? - A. Of Haines I did, Clark was in the room at the time; I told Haines I should Certainly get into trouble if there could be no step taken to let Mr. Brown have the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Haines, or Clark, say any thing in answer to that? - A. Haines desired that Clark would go and see if there had been any intelligence given at Bow-street about it; Clark told Haines that he would go and see about it, as Haines was very ill, and could not give any answer about it; he seemed very bad.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was Haines in good health on the Friday when you saw him? - A. Yes; he seemed very well when I delivered him the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Haines, during the time Clark was present, give any account what had happened to him? - A. In the conversation with the doctor, he said, he was certain it was the Bow-street officers that shot him, as the windows of the chaise were all up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Clark hear what he said to the doctor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend that both Clark and the doctor heard it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any other conversation that passed? - A. Yes; the prisoner said he had had a good deal of trouble with Haines in coming over the stones in the chaise, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing else? - A. No; soon after that, I came away and went home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You have told us you were a labourer in the India-House? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You resigned your situation I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know you are saying all that you say here upon your oath-were you not turned out? - A. There was a committee held, and I was dismissed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me the period when you were turned out of your office? - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you at work there last? - A. I was at work there in November.</p>
               <p>Q.Probably some time before the 8th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After the 8th you could not very well work there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up, and put into the House of Correction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A very good place for you-you were taken up for this very business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, when you were taken up, you thought it a good thing to give evidence against somebody else; it was a safe way you know? - A. I did not speak any thing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it a more convenient thing to give evidence than to be tried? - A. I hired the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the habit of hiring horses? - A. Not much.</p>
               <p>Q. You have hired horses of Coles before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think of going to him? - A. Because he deals in horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever at Bristol? - A. Yes; I lived in Bristol.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any time that you could not follow your occupation in Bristol? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never in jail there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you never were tried there? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this committee held that turned you out? - A. Very lately.</p>
               <p>Q. But you have been out of the House of Correction these three weeks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they would not let you come back to work? - A. I have not been at work since.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. I had seen him once or twice before he came with Haines.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way of life was he? - A. I cannot take upon me to say; I heard that he belonged to the lottery.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the horse come up? - A. Not then, it might be about half an hour afterwards; a gentleman on horseback apparently came to the door, and asked for a glass of spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the place where you heard the pistols nearest to Bedsont, or the public-house nearest to Bedfont? - A. Very little difference.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you enabled, by the assistance of the light, to see what sort of a man he was? - A. I looked at him in the face, and observed that he was a stout made man, with a cast in his eye, as I thought; I said, dear Sir, how your horse swears.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other observation that you made upon his face? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look round and see if you can see the man that you saw upon the horse that night? - A. The prisoner might be the man, but I cannot say positively.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the colour of that coat? - A. No, I do not; it might be done up in something, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was it? - A. It seemed to be a large big-boned horse, or a mare.</p>

No, for I had broke the glass that contained the liquor, and was stooping down, when he gave me the shillings, to pick up the pieces; then they both got into the chaise, and we came away; as I was driving on this side of Kensington, the man who appeared to me to be the well man asked me to stop at the first house that was open; I told him there would be none open till we got to Piccadilly; just before I came to Hyde-park-corner, the same man let down the glass again, and asked me if I could not drive through Westminster, and go by the Obelisk, in St. George's-fields; when I was going through Westminster, the same man stopped me again, about one hundred and fifty yards after I had got into the street, I believe York-street, he got out of the chaise, and fetched some other man to the chaise; he was in the chaise about two minutes, and then he got out; I went on again; then I drove till just on this side the Obelisk, as he was getting into the chaise, and I was shutting the door, he said, I must stop at the Obelisk again, for he must get some assistance for the gentleman, who had dislocated his collar-bone by a fall from his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards stop at the Obelisk? - A. Yes, he stopped me about fifty yards before I got to the Obelisk; he got out, and called somebody by name, but I did not hear what the name was; then he said he would not take him any farther, he would get a coach for him, and get some assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any coaches near that you could perceive? - A. No, I did not perceive any at all; he discharged me there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Best. Q. Your first directions were to drive to Smithfield? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any orders to stop at the Windsor-castle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He saw a light, and gave that as a reason for his stopping that he wanted something to drink? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he applied to you first, before he applied to the gentleman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a great coat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take that great coat into the chaise with him? - A. I cannot say, I did not take notice whether he had it on or off afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Dowsett). Q. Did you receive the great coat here produced, at the same time with the mare, from the Windsor-castle? - A. Yes, from Smith, the ostler, and the white tapes were then on the saddle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please your Lordship, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am totally innocent of the charge, and I shall leave the case in your hands.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Clark? - A. I have known him a great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him on the 10th of November last? - A. I saw him and shaved<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110010"></xptr>him in the evening, between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was on the 10th of November? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long have you known Clark? - A. A great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been an old customer of your's? - A. Not a constant customer; he has called when he has come that way.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you shave him before the 10th of November? - A. It might be five or six months.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you shave him after the 10th of November? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q.But you are sure this was the 10th of November? - A. The day after Lord-Mayor's Day; and about eight or nine or ten days after that, I saw him advertised ten guineas reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else there? - A. Yes, my wife, she is here; when I saw the advertisement, it mentioned the day, the 10th of November, ten guineas reward for committing a robbery, or stopping a post-chaise on Hounslow-heath, and shooting at the runners.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this nine or eleven days after? - A. Yes, and I knew directly it was that Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q.Saturday night is a slack night for business with a barber? - A. Sometimes it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, is there any night that you can name in the week more crowded than a Saturday? - A. No; only I have sometimes had as many of a Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the only man you shaved that night? - A. Not by many.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it that there was nobody else in your shop of a Saturday night? - A. My customers in the winter time drop in early in the evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it not a fortnight or three weeks after that this advertisement appeared? - A. Nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to recollect so particularly that it was Saturday night, the 10th? - A. Because I had not shaved him for so long a time before.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no memorandum of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you employ any body else in your business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop at the time? - A. Only my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Does she generally attend in the shop? - A. We often sup in the shop in the winter.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you were at supper when this man came in? - A. Yes, my wife and I were at supper upon bread and cheese and beer, and asked him to drink, and he would not drink, because there was some bread in it, and he sent out for a pot; my wife went out for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some conversation with him, I suppose? - A. All the conversation was, he wished I lived near him, I should always shave him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been a companion of his? - A. We have drank together before.</p>
               <p>Q. What public-house did your wife fetch this beer from? - A. The Three Compasses and the Artichoke are both customers of mine; I don't know which she fetched it from.</p>
               <p>Q. How many customers might you have come in after he was gone? - A. Several; they came in now and then till eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing remarkable in the day to six it upon your mind? - A. No, but I am sure it was on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. It might be Friday, perhaps? - A. No, I am sure it was of a Saturday night; I always go to have Mr. Mills, in Lambeth-road, and then my wife generally gets a pot of beer, and we have our supper, and he came in while we were at supper.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing particular to six it upon your memory? - A. I said, as soon as ever I read it, that he was the man that I shaved that night.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where does he live? - A. At Newington; his father has got two houses in the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life is he in? - A. I understood he was in the Custom-house or the Excise.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Best. I am the wife of the last witness.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any advertisement? - A. I heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards was it that you saw the advertisement? - A. I cannot say exactly; I thought it was very hard he should be accused elsewhere, when I knew he was there; I have a great Judge to come before, and I know the consequence of an oath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How many customers did your husband shave that Saturday night? - A. I cannot pretend to tell you that.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a busy night, is it not? - A. Yes, sometimes people come in unawares to be shaved.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110011"></xptr>Q. It made no impression on your memory, I dare say, till after the advertisement? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And then it struck you all of a heap, I suppose? - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. It would not have made any impression upon your mind if you had not seen that? - A. No, for I had never heard any thing of the kind of him.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been at the shop a good many times before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been there in the week before, had he not; had you seen him? - A.Certainly I had.</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you think your husband had shaved him the week before? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that the week before he was not shaved? - A. No, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the 10th of November, how many times, in the course of the last two months preceding this; was it more than four times or six times? - A. I cannot tell you.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you see him shaved more than once in your shop within two months? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, how many times had you seen Mr. Clark shaved by your husband in the course of two months? - A. Very likely he might come, and I not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. But, when you did see him, did he come more than once in that time? - A. He has been shaved a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. With in the two months? - A. I cannot tell you whether he was or not; but I can tell you the day that he was shaved there.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a tolerable good customer of your husband's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him shaved in the course of two months previous to the 10th of November? - A. I will not swear either one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet with respect to that day, you will swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you sup that night? - A. We were at supper when he came in, and my husband asked him to drink with him, and he would not, because there was bread in it, and I went out and got a pot for him.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q.How long might he be there? - A.Drinking and washing himself he might be a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. And can you recollect how long before you had seen him there? - A. I cannot tell, he said, whenever he came that way, he would come to be shaved, and he wished my husband lived nearer, because he shaved so well.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he been within three months? - A. I really do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Within four months? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you say he came frequently? - A. Yes, there was an estate repairing in our neighbourhood, as much as twelve months ago, and then he used to come very often; he was a promiscuous customer.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying he was frequently at your house-have you or not seen him within three months at your shop? - A. He might, and I not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the Jury whether you did see him within three months? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell the Jury that he was there the week before the 10th of November? - A. When he came that way, he used to come.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how lately before the 10th of November had you seen him there? - A. I cannot tell if I was to die upon the spot.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was there any body else in the shop at the time? - A. No.</p>

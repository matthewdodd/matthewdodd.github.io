            . I live in Seymour-place, in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone. On Monday, the 28th of February, between half-past eight and nine o'clock at night, I was going down Edgware-road - it was quite dark; I was about two yards from Mrs. Sander's house, in <placeName id="t18250407-38-crimeloc194">Portman-place</placeName>

I took him into the house; the bundle was brought in; the watchman was sent for, who opened the bundle in our presence - it contained different articles of female apparel, and a picture.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get into the house? A. I got in at the parlour window, by Mrs. Sanders's desire, to see if anybody else was there - the parlour door was locked outside - the street door was not open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What was done with the prisoner while you got in at the window? A. He was in charge of a watchman, and not out of my sight.</p>
               <p>SARAH SANDERS. I am a widow, and live at No. 28, Portman-place, in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone - I rent the house, and sleep there. Mrs. Nelson lodges with me.</p>

            . I am married to John Nelson, but we have been many years separated - the last time I heard of him was six years ago; I do not know whether he is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070022"></xptr>alive - he was butler in a gentleman's family. I lodge in this home; here are several things here which are all mine; they are marked with my name, and I made them; here is a silk gown, ten towels, and other property, all of which are mine; I occupied the parlour, and slept there. I went out at two o'clock in the afternoon, returned about ten in the evening, and found this had happened; I locked the parlour door, and left the window down, but am not sure that it was quite down, for I have observed since that unless it is quite down it will not latch, and I recollect that I did not latch it - I could not have left it quite open, but it might not be quite down.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether you had left it open wide enough for the prisoner to get in? A. No, I certainly did not - it must have been lifted up for any one to get in, I am certain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long is it since you and your husband parted? A. We have been quite separated for twelve years - I saw him six years ago last June. All the things were bought with my money.</p>
               <p>SARAH SANDERS. Here is a picture of mine among the property - it hung in the parlour.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK contended that if the window was not quite down a burglary had not been committed. The Court over-ruled the objection.</p>

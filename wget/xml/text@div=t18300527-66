I lost this jacket and trousers on the 3rd of May; I heard an alarm at my door - I went out, and saw the prisoners running across the street; I pursued them, and saw them come out of a pawnbroker's shop, two hundred yards from my house - I stopped them, took the articles from under Neal's apron, and gave charge of them; that is Neal nearest me (pointing to Smith) - the other had left Neal at that time; I ran and took her - I had seen them before they went to the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Which of these prisoners do you say had these articles? A. Neal; I took Smith in Devonshire-street - she said she had nothing to do with it; I had seen them together - I did not see her face when they were running, but I can swear this is the person; I took Neal first, and gave her into custody, but I kept my eye on the other at the time - I suppose she was a hundred and fifty yards from me; I had never lost sight of her - I had not seen her face, but if I had seen her an hour afterwards I could swear to her by her dress; I had seen her back - I do not know whether she had a sash on, but if I had seen her two years afterwards I should have known her.</p>

            . I live near the prosecutor's, in the Edgware-road; I was at his house when these articles were taken - I saw Neal cross the road - that is Neal the farthest from me; she had something under her apron, and I saw the witness take the things from under her apron - I afterwards saw him take Smith, and she said she had nothing to do with it; Smith had turned the corner, and was taken in Devonshire-street, but I had not lost sight of Neal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The last witness was with you when Neal was taken? A. Yes - in Steven-street, not above seven yards from Devonshire-street; they are not in a line - he could not keep his eyes upon Smith while he was taking Neal - we both lost sight of her when she turned into Devonshire-street.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I saw the witnesses going after the two young girls; Mr. Turner took Neal into custody, and gave her to me - she is the nearest one to me, I have every reason to believe; I did not see the other prisoner till Mr. Turner gave her in charge - he gave me these articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He gave the prisoner into your custody at the same time? A. Yes; I cannot say whether he could at that time have seen the other prisoner - he might have seen her; I could not say which of the prisoners he gave me first, except it was the first this way.</p>

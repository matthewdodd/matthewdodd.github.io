Sweet-apple-court, Bishopsgate-street—I saw her there on the 10th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock when was sent for, and found her in bed—Hall was there, but no one else—he said he had had a very bad night of it, and said it was all over, he had done it himself—he said she had had a fine child—he did not say at what time she had it—I asked him where it was—he said he had put it into a pan, he did not know whether he had done right, but he was so frightened he had put it down the privy—I said, "Oh, you should not have done that"—he said she would to very well, and he would take all the care he could of her, and would make her his wife—I heard nothing about the child being alive or dead—I asked my daughter but she said she was so bad, she knew nothing about it—I did not ask Hall whether the child was born alive—I do not recollect that I asked him—my daughter said she was in such a state of mind she was scarcely in her senses, and she could not tell—I do not recollect any thing more—I left the room, and went home—my daughter was in a very wretched but state—she appeared col<lb></lb>lected at the time I spoke to her—I cannot tell at what time she was delivered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Bishopsgate-street—I have been in practice twenty years. On the 10th of October, about half-past one o'clock in the afternoon, I went to No. 2, Sweet-apple-court, and examined the female prisoner—she was in bed—I found her to have been recently delivered—I inquired what had become of the infant—she informed, me it had been out away—I then asked her if it was alive, and she told me it was—I desired her to be cautious, and asked her how she knew it was alive—she said she had heard it cry—I made no further inquiry respecting the child, but attended to the state of her health—she appeared in a state of great wretchedness—I saw the body of the child the next day at the workhouse—its appearance was that of a child at the full time—it was plump and well formed, with hair on its head, and its nails perfect—the naval string was not shrunk—it was not secured—it had not been divided—the cord remained united to the after-birth—no ligature had been</p>

               <p>put upon it—it all came together—I examined the lungs—they appeared of fill the cavity of the chest—they appeared to have been extended and inflated with air, and were of a bright red appearance—that indicates that the lungs must have been in contact with oxygen or atmospheric air, and that blood must have circulated, that the child must have been alive—a child may cease to respire without any violence offered to it—I have known a child die very soon after birth, although come to full maturity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When a woman has no assistance, may it not happen a child may be suffocated and smothered in the mess in which it is born with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I con<lb></lb>ceive it may very easily happen, without any intention of the kind—it does not necessarily follow that because it comes to full birth and is perfect, and is heard to cry, that it must have died of violence—I conceive it is possible a child may cry when first put forth, and still be dead before delivery is complete—children very frequently cry as soon as the head is protruded—it takes two or three pains generally before the delivery is complete, and it might be suffocated before those pains are over—my opinion is the child died from suffocation, but whether at the birth or from the soil I cannot say—it might be either. (Here the witness detailed several circumstances under which the child might be heard to cry, yet not be completely born alive, and other circumstances under which it might die immediately after its birth.)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If it should turn out that this was the first, child of the woman, all these circumstances would become more probable from her ignorance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Much more probable—I considered her a woman of very dull mind, not possessing much information—I think it very probable death might have arisen from suffocation in the way suggested—I think is very likely the discharge might produce death, she being without assistance, in the state of mind and body in which she was—for some hours after, women are generally in a very great state of exhaustion and helplessness—many of them are incapable of moving at all, being in a very exhausted state, especially of body, and if the mind be dull, it would he more likely to in<lb></lb>capacitate it then if it was acute—I never saw two persons in a more wretched state, and I have seen a great deal of misery in London—I did not see a pan there—I beg to state there were no external marks of violence on the child.</p>

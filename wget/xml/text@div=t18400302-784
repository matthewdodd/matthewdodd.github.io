                  </hi>. I live in Francis-place, Westminster, with my mother, who is a laundress. On Saturday morning, the 25th of January, I was driving my mother's cart, in Broad-street, City, delivering linen at the City of London Club-house—I was absent from the cart about ten minutes, and my atteption was called to my coat, which I left in the cart—Sarah Knight was there, and asked me, in the prisoner's presence, if I missed my coat—I said, "Yes"—she said, "That is the young man that took it"—he said he had never seen it—he was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Camomile-street, with my husband. On the evening of the 25th of January I was in Broad-street, about twelve yards from the club-house—I noticed a cart at the door, and saw the prisoner get up on the step, and take the coat off the seat—it was rolled up—he ran across the road, and gave it to another lad—I went after him—he was apprehended without my losing sight of him—he turned up Winchester-street, and asked me if that was Winchester-street—I followed him to Long-alley, and he then asked me what I was following him for—I said he had taken a coat off a cart in Broad-street—he said he had never been in Broad-street, and did not know where it was, and he would go back with me, which he did—I waited by the cart about ten minutes—Robert<lb></lb>son came out, and I asked if he had lost his coat—he went to the cart to look for it, where I had teen it taken from—I am certain the prisoner is the person who took it.</p>

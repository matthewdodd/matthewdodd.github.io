                  </hi>. I am a Dissenting minister, and live at No. 1, Oxford-terrace, Dalston. On 18th Oct., about half past 10 o'clock in the morning, I was walking in Bishopsgate-street—I felt something touching my pocket—I put my hand down immediately, and found my handkerchief was gone from my left hand coat pocket behind—I saw the prisoner crouch<lb></lb>ing behind two or three persons—I seized him immediately, and he drew my handkerchief from his pocket, and handed it to me, saying, that it had fallen on the ground—when I turned round he was within a step of me—two or three persons who were talking were quite close, touching my elbow—the prisoner struggled very violently, and tore himself away, leaving a great part of his coat in my hand—I ran after him; a policeman was coming in the opposite direction, and took him—this is my handkerchief I had it safe just before.</p>

On the morning of 18th Oct., I saw the last witness running after the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street, and calling out, "Stop thief!"—just before the prisoner got to me, he turned up a court—I ran after him up several courts, I think six or seven; at last he ran into a yard, and stood against a stable wall—I told him I wanted him for picking a pocket, I understood—he said, "I am very sorry"—when before the Magistrate, the prisoner said, "I wish you to sentence me."</p>

On Sunday evening, the 20th of December, at half-past six o'clock all my family, consisting of eight persons, went out to church, leaving me alone in the house; it was not quite dark - I believe the house was safe; I had not seen the fastenings in the course of the day, for I had been very unwell the whole day - in about ten minutes after my family were gone out, the front door bell rang twice, very faintly: I did not get up to answer it - about ten minutes after that(there was no noise whatever, every thing was perfectly silent;) I was sitting in the dining-room, up stairs - my face was directed towards the dining-room door, and the door of the room was pushed very slowly open, and part of the head of a person appeared; I immediately rose from my seat, went towards the door, and the head was instantly withdrawn, and the person ran very precipitately down stairs, and made a great noise in going down - I thought it unwise to follow, so I proceeded to the dining-room window, threw it up, gave an alarm, and in rather more than an hour I saw the prisoner in custody - I examined the house, but was not aware that any thing was gone; the street-door was closed in the usual way when I went down - I had not heard it shut when he ran down, if it had I think I must have heard it; I saw two small crow-bars in the back part of the house - I could not discover how the party had got in; I found the street-door bolted on the inside - they could have entered that way, and bolted it afterwards- my family returned about half-past eight o'clock; a hat was found at the bottom of the stairs - I did not see it there myself; the spoons, sugar-tongs, and milk-pot were in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any second Christian name? A. No; I saw no appearance of breaking into the house - I cannot say a person might not have been concealed in the house.</p>
               <p>HENRY CHANDLER. I live at No. 32, Cock-lane, and am a silver spoon maker, in Mr. Chawner's employ. On Sunday, the 20th of December, about a quarter-past seven o'clock, I was sitting in doors, and heard a cry of Murder! and Thieves! my house is a very little distance from the prosecutor's - I ran out to the spot; the cry came from the first floor of Mr. Heath's house - he was giving the alarm, and said, "Go to the front door;" I ran to the front door - it was fast; I had been there about two minutes, and heard a cracking up Cock-lane - I ran there, and saw the shutters fall out; they were pushed out from inside, and I saw the prisoner come out without a hat, and run up the lane - I pursued close at his heels, and never lost sight of him - just as he turned the corner I caught him, about twelve yards down the turning; I could not possibly be mistaken - I could not swear to his face, but I never lost sight of his person; he had no hat on - he ran against Kemp, and had a tussle with him, which enabled me to collar him, and he said, "It is not me - what have I done?" I am sure he is the person that came out of the window; when I could see his face he had a black mark under his nose - I do not know whether it was dirt or a plaister; Hanley came up, and kept the mob off as we took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. An alarm had been given by Mr. Heath before you went? A. I should think about a minute before; I went to the door, and in two minutes went to the window - several neighbours had come out of their houses in consequence of the alarm; I suppose fifteen or sixteen, but not out of the prosecutor's house; the place where the window is is very dark; he came out of the window without his hat - his being taken without a hat did not increase my belief of his being the man, for I never lost sight of him; he turned one slight corner by Munn and Co.'s - the gateway projects, and it is but a slight turn; three or four came up when he was stopped: I had run out without my hat, and there was one person by the window without a hat or coat - he is a man who keeps a coal-shed opposite.</p>

On Sunday evening, about a quarter-past seven o'clock, I was coming across Smithfield, and heard a cry of Stop thief! at the end of Cock-lane; I saw a man come up Cock-lane without a hat, and about fifty persons pursuing him - he was running from the cry; I caught hold of him - it was the prisoner: Chandler came up instantly after, and laid hold of him - the prisoner said directly I took hold of him, once or twice, that it was not him; the people behind came up - Chandler and I took him to the watch-house, and he was detained.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not see a good many other persons running? A. Behind him there was - there was nobody without a hat, except the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre. I heard Mr. Heath give an alarm, and saw him on the window leads of the first floor; I went to the front door, found it was fast, and came round to Cock-lane, to what had been a side door, but has been blocked up - I waited there about a minute; the shutters opened, and the prisoner came out first, and another one with him: the prisoner ran up Cock-lane, towards Smithfield; I attempted to lay hold of the other, but stumbled over the shutter, and lost him; I pursued after the prisoner, but lost sight of him as I stumbled over the shutter - I went up Cock-lane, found him in the hands of Kemp, Chandler, and Carter, and laid hold of him; Hanley came up, and took him to the watch-house - I saw Hanley search him; a small pocket-book and I believe three halfpence were found on him: he was the first who came out of the house, and was without a hat- I returned to Mr. Heath's, and on examining the back window which he had come out of in the warehouse, I found a small basket, with two small jemmies in it; I saw a hat found at the bottom of the staircase - it was not claimed by any body; when I came up to the prisoner in Cock-lane he said he had lost his hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw two men come out of the window? A. Yes; I tried to take the second man - my attention was particularly directed to him; there was a number of persons running in the street - I saw nobody without a hat while I was running; there were people without hats at the top of the lane when the prisoner was detained - I cannot tell where they came from; there might be three without hats or more - I did not take an account of them; it was impossible for me to look at every body when my attention was directed to the prisoner - there might be fifty people altogether; I did not hear the prisoner say he had been knocked down, and lost his hat.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I was in Giltspur-street about seven o'clock on Sunday evening, the 20th of December, and heard a great noise and bustle, and near the corner of Giltspur-street there was a great crowd, some crying, "Hold him fast," and others said, "Let him go;" I rushed into the crowd, and saw the prisoner struggling violently with Chandler and Kemp; I laid hold of him, and he then said, "I will go quietly;" after leaving him in the watch-house I went to Mr. Heath's house, and found this hat at the bottom of the stairs, within a yard of the stairs; I searched the house well, and found two jemmies near the window which had been burst open - they laid on a work-board; I tried the largest crow-bar to a desk in the counting-house next day, and it fitted the marks on that desk, which had been broken open; I went to the Compter, tried the hat on the prisoner, and it fitted him exactly, but he denied its being his; Hooker, the officer, had this key in his possession - I saw him fit it next day to the prosecutor's door, and it opened it; I did not see that found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who did you get that key from? A.

            . I am a constable of the City, and live about one hundred yards from Mr. Heath's. I heard a great noise, went out immediately, and about halfway between my house and Mr. Heath's, I heard a great crash of something falling; I went to the corner of Cock-lane, and saw two shutters had fallen outside the house - in consequence of information I saw the crowd going up Cock-lane; I followed, and within a few yards of the lane, near Giltspur-street, I found the prisoner had been stopped - Hanley was there, and they gave him in charge; I then went to Mr. Heath's, but found nothing particular. Next morning, when I went, this key was given to me by Mr. Heath's son; I tried it to the lock of the front door, one end of it opened the door very easily; I saw two jemmies, but did not see them found - the hat was given to me: I saw it tried on the prisoner - it fitted him well; twenty spoons, two pairs of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot were delivered to me next morning - I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Some of them are very small spoons? A. Yes; I did not try the hat on any body else a person could not get in; I did not see a single person without a hat, except the prisoner - I saw Chandler, but cannot say whether he had a hat; I noticed the prisoner more than other people - I think Chandler had his hat on.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many are there in the family? A. Seven, including myself - there is only one young lady grown up; mistress is alive - I cannot say she had not moved the plate in my absence; nothing was taken out of the house - some of the things were moved from one end of the kitchen to the other, and left on the dresser; I found them all laying together, not tied up.</p>

            . I am Mr. Heath's son. On this Sunday evening, about half-past six o'clock, I went out with the rest of the family; we went out at the street door, which I found fast - I cannot say whether I opened it, or any of the rest of the family; I left my brother behind - he came out with us, but was the last out; he went to church with me - we left nobody in the house but my father; I am sure the door was closed; the key was not in the lock, but was in the house - the prisoner is a perfect stranger; my mother went out with us to church - we all went out at the same time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you undertake to swear which of the family was last at the door? A. Yes, my brother; I had not searched the house - the servant is not in the habit of taking the key out; it hung up inside the passage; my father keeps a warehouse, which is pretty large - I cannot say whether any body was concealed there- I am sure the key was not in the lock, for it is never kept in it; I did not look at the lock, but the key always hangs up.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATH. I can positively swear there was no key in the lock; I particularly examined it before I opened it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell whether any body inside might not have taken it out after the persons came in? A. I found the lock without a key in it; I cannot say whether it was in or out when the family went out.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What is the value of the spoons? A. There are twenty spoons, and two pairs of sugar-tongs, worth about 7l.</p>


               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The milk-pot is not silver? A. No, it is worth very little - some of the spoons are very old and some very small; I have not weighed them - my opinion is they are worth 7l. in their present state.</p>

               <p>HENRY HEATH. I was not in the kitchen before I went to church; my mother and sister went out before me - they did not go into the kitchen as we went out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Might they not have gone in before they went out? A. They might.</p>

            . The tea-spoons were used at tea, the salt, table, and gravy spoons at dinner; the dessert-spoons were not used that day - I put the table and gravy-spoons into the drawer about two o'clock, after dinner, and the tea-spoons in the closet about ten minutes before I went out; I am quite sure of that - there could be no occasion for them to be used after I left; I found them clean, as I had left them.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it customary for your mistress to take the plate up stairs in the evening? A. No, never - they were not locked up.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. HEATH. Q. Have you any recollection of the person who looked into the dining-room? A. No- there could be no spoons wanted after the servant went out, that I know of; I wanted none, and saw none used - my wife occasionally goes into the kitchen: I think the bell rang about ten minutes after the family went out - the ring was repeated in about two minutes, and in about ten minutes the man appeared at my room door; there is a small room, about six feet five inches, between the room I was in and the kitchen; the cupboard might have opened without my hearing it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Passing the prosecutor's house on the night named in the indictment, there was a quantity of persons at the corner of Cock-lane; I passed through the crowd, and at that moment a shutter fell from the prosecutor's window, which knocked me down, and knocked my hat off - I got up, and followed the persons who I suspected; I was secured, and accused of the robbery: what I state is a fact, I assure you - it was evident to the persons who took me, that I had been knocked down; they saw my hands and side all over mud - my witnesses have been here four days, but were not aware of my being tried this morning.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATH. The prisoner told me he had been knocked down; I went to the Compter to see if there was any mark or cut in his hand, as I found a lamp had been knocked down - he shewed me his hand, which had a mark of dry dirt on it; it did not appear to be street dirt - my opinion was that it was not street dirt; his hand was not cut.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What communication is there between the warehouse and dwelling-house? A.There is a door between two rooms, in the further room is the window from which the person escaped; that door was fastened on Saturday night, after the men left, I am certain; it is a ground floor window - the shutters were fastened inside by a screw not: I had two candles burning in my dining-room - the light could be seen outside from three windows, as the shutters were not shut; there is a key-hole to the parlour door; after the robbery the warehouse door between the back and front rooms was found open - no violence had been done to it; it had only been bolted: the warehouse and house are all under one roof - I went down stairs my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140008"></xptr>self after returning to the dining-room, before I went to the window to give an alarm, and before the men had got out of the window.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CARTER. I am a pavior, and live at No. 23, Cock-lane, about one hundred yards from the back of Mr. Heath's premises. On the Sunday night in question I had occasion to come down to the back yard, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran down the street, and the moment I got there the shutter was forced out - it very nearly fell on my shoulder; the prisoner then jumped out of the window, and ran up the street as fast as possible - he was without his hat; I am certain he is the man; I ran after him quite close, and saw him secured - I went back to Mr. Heath's house in about a quarter of an hour, and saw the hat picked up at the bottom of the stairs; on searching a little further I found two small crow-bars on the desk near the window he had jumped out of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you very good sight? A. Yes, pretty fair with one eye - I cannot see with the other eye; the shutter falling did not alarm me - I got out of the way of it; it might distract my attention a little - I only saw one man jump out of the window; I took notice of nobody else, but went after him - whether he had been concealed in the house before I cannot say; the prosecutor's front door is on Snow-bill - it is a public street, and much frequented.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Do you know what time it was? A. I will not positively say, but we took him to the watch-house, and got back by half-past seven o'clock; there is a gaslight in the lane - I was close to him, and saw him come out of the window; I ran close after him, and never lost sight of him for a moment; he was not ten yards from me when he jumped out; Hanley, the officer, ran round with me - I do not know who else was in pursuit.</p>

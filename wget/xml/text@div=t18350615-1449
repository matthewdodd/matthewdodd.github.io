                  </hi>. I am a corn-dealer, and live in Seymour-place, Bryanstone-square. Wicks was in my employ for five months—I saw Wicks and Fry at my granary door on the evening of the 10th of June—I said to Wicks, my carman, "What are you going out with!"—he said, "One quarter of oats and one bushel of beans"—I am quite sure he said that—I saw there were two sacks in the cart before I spoke, and just as I spoke to him he discharged another sack into the cart, which made three—when the last sack was put in, the prisoner Fry said, "I have my usual quantity"—I said to him, "What is my man going with?"—he said, "One quarter of oats and one bushel of beans for me"—he then got into the cart—he went partly up the gateway, and then stopped for my man to get in to ride with him—while he was stopping I looked over the cart, and I said, "I perceive you have got three sacks here, Wicks"—he lifted up the sack of corn, and exposing the beans in the front of the cart said, "I have my usual quantity—one quarter of oats and one bushel of beans"—he went out of the yard—I went into my shop—a female told me something, and I followed the cart—I called to him, and said, I was very tired, I would ride with him as far as my brother's, which was in the way where this corn was to be delivered—I did so, and got within two hundred yards of Fry's house—Fry then said, "Are not you going to your brothers?"—I said, "I may as well ride as far as your stables"—I did so—they drove to his door, and un<lb></lb>loaded one sack of com, and came back for the other—when it was lifted off the beans, I perceived that there was more—I said "Here is more than the quantity ordered; at your peril take them out of the cart"—they were both together when they shot the last sack of corn—I went for the policeman—Fry said, that he had ordered two bushels—I told them not to shoot the beans—Fry then said if he had got more than his quantity, he would pay for them—I was not more than two minutes going to get a policeman—when I came back, I found the beans in the cart—they had remained in the cart—I gave them in charge—I then said to Fry, "Here is more than you have booked"—the policeman then took them, and the beans—I saw the beans afterwards at the station-house—there were two bushels and one peck—Fry has dealt with me some years—his usual quantity was one quarter of oats and one bushel of beans—the value of one bushel and one peck of beans is 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, I attend at Mr. Brooks's shop; it is part of my duty to take orders for goods—I remember Fry coming on the evening of the 10th of June—he asked if Mr. Brooks was at home—I said no—he said, "Never mind, you will do as well; I owe two lots, I want to pay you for one"—he paid for one quarter of corn and one bushel of beans; I then gave him the receipt—I then said, "What am I to send you?"—he said, "The same as usual, one quarter of oats, and one bushel of beans"—I am quite sure of that—I made this entry in the book at the time (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>:) "Mr. Fry, one quarter oats, on bushel beans, S. Wicks"—that is the name of the man who delivers them—I read the entry to Fry, and he said, "That is right"—Wicks came in, and Fry said to him, "Well, young man, I want some corn to-night; it is useless for you to swear and be cross about it, for I must have it to-night"—Wicks said his horses had been hard at work that day, and he had put them into the stables, would not to-morrow do?—he said, "No, I must have it to-night, I have not a handful for my horses to-night"—Wicks said, "What is it to be?"—I said, "One quarter of oats, and one bushel of beans"—they both left the shop together, and went down to the granary—in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, Wicks came back, and said, "It is very strange that man comes so late at night for his com"—he said, "How long has <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> been gone?" (he is the other carman)—I said, "He went about half-past seven o'clock, he cannot poss<lb></lb>bly be back yet"—he said, "Then I have a mind to put the horses into the big cart, and take it myself—I said, "I think you had better"—he then said, "What is it to be?"—I then repeated the order again—they went in the light cart, as <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> came back sooner than I expected when he went.</p>

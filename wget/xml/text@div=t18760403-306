                  </hi>. I live with my father and mother, at 2, Escott's Cottage, Poplar—before this occurred Margaret Carcass had been living in the house—I came home on the 17th at 12.30 p.m., the morning of the 18th, and the prisoner was in the parlour with my father—I heard a scream from my mother, who was upstairs, and Margaret Carcass with her, who had come for her clothes—the prisoner then went to run upstairs, but I—pulled him down and put him out of the house—I sat down for a quarter of an hour, and then went out and found the prisoner standing outside—he struck me on my shoulder and ran away—I did not know that I was stabbed, and ran after him and caught him—he hugged me and threw me down and cut me on the head and round the neck—the wound on my head is still bad; that is why I am wearing a bandage—I was under the doctor's care more than a week—I bled a great deal, and have not been able to do anything since—my shoulder and neck are healed, but my head is not quite healed yet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I found the prosecutor suffering from a. scalp wound about 4 inches long and going down to the bone, and a stab in his left shoulder about 4 inches wide and an inch and a half deep—I attended him a fortnight; he is out of danger now—the wounds did not touch, but they were near to vital parts, and there is always danger of erysipelas—the wound on the neck would have been very dan<lb></lb>gerous if it had been deeper, because it was within one-eighth of an inch of the carotid artery, and the one on the arm was close to the auxiliary artery</p>

               <p>—if those parts had been injured they would have been highly dangerous, and, supposing, he had a bad constitution, they might have been fetal—he lost a great deal of blood, and I could not allow him to go to the police-court on the first remand because he was so weak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went with my friend, a young woman, to get my clothes from Mrs. Goodwin's; she and Mrs. Goodwin went upstairs; I waited down stairs ten minutes and heard a scream, the prosecutor went up, and I saw the young woman fall downstairs, and the prosecutor and another man beating her; I interfered and the three of them jumped on me, and pushed me outside; I pulled out my knife and said "If any of you come you may have this." I had hardly said it when he took me by the neck, and sang out to him to-let go of me, he would not, and then I cut him in defending myself because three of them were trying to choke me.</p>

             sworn. Q. I believe you live at Old Ford? - A. I do; on Saturday the 30th of November I was returning on horseback from the road to Old Ford; I came to the cart rather unexpectedly, I saw the prisoner take a sack out of his master's cart, it was about two-thirds filled with potatoes, he put it into a ditch where there were nettles; I took no notice of the man, I drove on, I went to Mr. Ridge's yard, I said do you know me; oh! yes, he said, that sack of potatoes that I put in the ditch, I am going to fetch them, I was over loaded. I got off from my horse, and took the prisoner by the collar, and told him he had robbed his master; he said that he did not mean to steal them, he was going to take them up. I then gave him into the custody of this young man and his father. I then returned with Mr. Cooper to the potatoes; I found them in the ditch, under the nettles. The prisoner begged for mercy, and said it was his first offence.</p>
               <p>(The sack produced, and identified by Mr. Ridge, jun, and Mr. Higgins.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My cart was overloaded with potatoes, I took one sack out, and put it in the hedge, I was thinking of returning afterwards to take it to my master's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give it up on the 12th? - A. I did not give it up, I left it; my portmanteau was there till after the 12th.</p>
               <p>Q. What property was in the portmanteau that was missing afterwards? - A. One hundred and ten pounds, all in Bank-notes of different descriptions; I don't say certainly that the five-pound Bank-note was stole from me, because I passed some of them.</p>
               <p>Q.Were there any other of the value of ten pounds? - A. Yes, two ten-pound Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q.When had you seen them in your portmanteau last? - A. On Sunday, the 12th, they were in my portmanteau; I took out a five-pound note; the five-pound notes were in one bundle, and the others in another bundle; I did not open the bun<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160038"></xptr>dle with the ten-pound notes, they were just as I had left them.</p>
               <p>Q.When can you speak certainly that they were there? - A. I cannot say, they were just as I had folded them up, the portmanteau was locked. On the 12th, I took a five-pound note out, and locked it again.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you examine the portmanteau again? - A. On Friday, the 17th, I went up to my room; it is a soft leather portmanteau. I went to unbuckle it, and found the chain run but half through, and the lock hanging to the staple, but not locked; it alarmed me a little, I knew somebody must have been at it; I put my hand in, and took out my pocket-book, the paper the notes were in was thrust into my pocket-book, and all the notes were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of the notes since? - A. Yes, they passed through the Bank; the Clerk of the Bank is here with them.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know the prisoner? - A. I never spoke to him; I understand he lodged in the next room, I don't know whether I have ever seen him in the house, I never spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.What happened between the 12th and 17th, you know nothing about? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not unroll them to see if any of them were there? - A. No; they were folded up in the state I left them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you know the numbers of them when they were in your portmanteau? - A. No, I did not know the numbers; I had a ten-pound Post-bill.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was quarter-master in a regiment; I have been some years in the habit of having a good deal of money to pay away; I heard of the robbery that had been committed at the Northumberland Coffee-house; I remained five days after that; I went down into the country, and was absent six weeks; when I returned I was apprehended under suspicion of stealing the 110l. I was down in Scotland; I was apprehended there, and kept in Edinburgh jail three months; I petitioned, and by the assistance of Mr. Erskine got removed to London.</p>

                  </hi>. 1 shawl be fifteen years of age in May, Before this happened I lived with Mrs. Eyres, at 45, Ossulston-street—I left her on Saturday the 2nd of January, about one o'clock, and went to the Edgeware-road to look for my father, but could not find him—when it was getting dark, I saw some woman in William-street, and was inquiring of her for a lodging when the prisoner came over—the woman I speaking to spoke to hes, and she asked me where my father was—I told her I had been to see for him in the Edgeware-road, and he was not there—the other woman asked the prisoner if I might go home and stay with her till I got a place—the prisoner said yea, I might, and said, "Come along with me home to my fire, and warm yourself"—I went her to 23, Steven-street, Lisson-grove—there was no other person with me when I went, but there was a person in the room, and she asked me if I would have any being to eat—I took a half-quartern loaf with me, and she said she would boy some bacon; had I any money—I had the remains of two shillings, after buying the loaf, and I gave that to the prisoner—I went the next day and got my trunks from No. 45, Ossulston-street, and took them to her house; and she said, "Have you any thing you can sell to get tea and sugar, as I am very hungry?—I said, I did not know, they might look at my things; but I could not part with above one or two things—she said, "What use is that great trunk to you? your may as well sell it?"—I did sell it, and gave her the money—I then had my clothes left in ano<lb></lb>ther trunk; and then they sent me up in the yard and looked over my clothes, and took some—when I came into the room again, they went out directly, and some of my clothes were gone—they came home again about six o'clock in the evening—I asked them where my clothes were—the prisoner said, they were all right, I should have them again; but I had never given her permission to take them—I said, I would not allow her to take any of them, because I should want them when I got a place—we went to bed very soon—she got up at eight o'clock in the morning, and said, "I shall not be long, I am only going to get some tea and sugar"—she went out, and while she was gone, the other woman asked me to let her have my black stockings, and I should be sure to have them again—I let her have them—they came in about nine o'clock, both together—they said, "Go and fetch a penny loaf"—I went out, and when I came back all my things were gone—I waited there till about eleven o'clock—I then came into the passage, and was crying—the lodgers came into the passage, and asked what I was crying about—about four o'clock, a gentleman came in and ill-used me, and attempted to take liberties—I screamed out, and the people in the house opened the door—the policeman had found some of my clothes.</p>

About two o'clock on the morning of 3d July, I was on duty in High-street, Staines, which is between seven and eight miles from the Toy at Hampton, and saw the prisoner driving in a horse and cart at a rapid rate—I did not know him before—another constable was within fifty yards of me—the prisoner hallooed out to him as he went along, "Is this the way to Maidenhead?"—he said "Yes," and he went on—I suspected something wrong, and ran after him and stopped him—I asked him whose horse and cart it was—he said he hired it of a person at Hounslow, and he was to give 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I asked him if he knew the man's name, and he said no, he had never seen him before—the horse was in a great sweat—the name of" Edmund Lay, New Hampton," was on the cart—I took the prisoner and the horse and cart to the station, went over to Hampton, and Mr. Lay came and claimed the horse and cart.</p>

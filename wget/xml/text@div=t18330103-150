The prisoner was under my care; he went to the prosecutor's to work, but came home to dinner - he absconded, and I did not see him again till Saturday three weeks; he said he had done this, and I asked him what for - he said he did not know but he had sold the things to a Jew - he had been two years in the workhouse, and I knew nothing wrong of him before.</p>

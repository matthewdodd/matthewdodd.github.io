She asked to look at some calico, at fifteen pence a yard. I was then busy with two other customers. I left them to serve her. She bought as much as came to eight-pence. I asked her, whether she wanted any thing else. She said, no. I then went to the lower part of the counter, to get some paper; and while I was getting the paper, I observed her go to the muslin wrapper. I suspected her then. I came to her. She was looking over the wrapper, and her apron was laying over the counter. I was then confirmed in my suspicion. She said, that she wanted some spotted muslin. I took down the spotted muslin wrapper. There was none that suited her. On her going out of the shop I stopped her. I sent my boy for an officer. He returned. He said, he could not get an officer. He exclaimed, there! I looked into the parlour, and saw a piece of muslin lay down on the parlour floor. I am sure it was not there before.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, you suspected the whole of it - A. Yes, from the beginning of it.</p>

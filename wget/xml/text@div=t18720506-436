I am staff-sergeant of pensioners of the Greenwich district—on 11th August, 1870, I enrolled the prisoner—I produce the attestation paper relating to that enrolment, which I filled in from his dis<lb></lb>charge from the Military Train which he produced; this is it—I wrote across it "Enrolled in the Army Reserve at Deptford, August, 1870"—at the time they are enrolled the discharge is endorsed in red, and given back to them—he signed this attestation paper in my presence—he received his pay up to 31st March, 1872; that was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when he was enrolled, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in October, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in January, 1871—he is the man—I was not aware when I enrolled him, that he was already a member of the Army Reserve; he swears to a declaration that he does not belong to the militia or any other force, and has not been already enrolled—I should not have paid him unless I had believed that—the discharge that he handed to me proved that he did not belong to any other department.</p>

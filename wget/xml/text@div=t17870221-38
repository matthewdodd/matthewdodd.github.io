            ; on Wednesday, the 1st of February, about the noon of the day, between eleven and twelve, I lost six pair of stockings; the prisoner Wood and another boy with him, which I believe to be Riley, came to my shop for a ball of worsted; the prisoner Molloy did not come in with them at that time; they paid for the ball of worsted, and went their way; about ten minutes after, the boy Wood was brought back to me, with six pair of thread stockings, by Mr. Higinbottom.</p>
               <p>Had these two boys any conversation together? - They came in together, they spoke together, and they were both concerned together in buying the worsted; I am clear the stockings are my own property; they are marked with an eyelet-hole just under the welt; there are four eyelet-holes in each heel.</p>
               <p>Is that the case of all of them? - No, it is only to distinguish the different qualities of them; these eyelet holes are made by the manufacturer; this is a very particular article; I bought them the day before, and I had them in my hand, examining them, not five minutes before the prisoners came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Unless you gave express orders for these stockings yourself, other stockings are made the same way for other people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was nothing else besides these eylet holes? - No.</p>
               <p>What quantity had you bought before? - Six pair, they were tied up in a sheet of blue paper when I lost them; I bought them in brown paper; when they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210088"></xptr>brought back, they were in paper; I have not got the paper; I know nothing of Molloy.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of these stockings? - Fourteen shillings I gave for them.</p>
               <p>When did you first miss your stockings? - Not till they were brought back by Mr. Higinbottom.</p>

               <p>I am a young man in the hosiery branch; my situation is in South Moulton-street; I keep a house there; on Wednesday morning, February 21st, it might be half after ten, I saw the prisoner Riley and Molloy in company pass my shop door, and I was wiping the windows, and I observed Riley go to my left hand window, as I was wiping the right hand window, with a view to look into the shop.</p>
               <p>What time might it be when the boys got to the shop? - I suppose it might be near twelve; I did not take notice of the time; I observed to a Mr. Dunn, that these were pickpockets, or shop-lifters; I observed Riley, and from my own suspicions, I followed him and Molloy up Bond-street; they crossed Oxford-street, and went into Bear-street; they went up several streets, and went to Mr. Hartshorn's window; Wood and Riley went into a shop, and Molloy stood at the door; I followed the boys to Portland-street, there I lost sight of Wood and Riley; I saw Molloy stand or sit, on the opposite side, a few doors above Mr. Wigley's shop; I saw Wood and Riley go into the prosecutor's shop, and I went into the opposite corner shop, Mr. Wallis's the butcher's, in order to remain there till Riley and Wood joined again to Molloy; I had hardly been there the space of five minutes, before I saw Wood come out with something under his coat; I pursued him up Mary-bone-street, I took him immediately; I did not see the other boy then come out with him; I am sure it was Wood; I do not know what became of the other boy; there was a coal cart obstructed me; I seized him opposite Queen Ann-street; there he had quitted himself of the goods; I did not see him throw down any goods; he had nothing upon him; I brought the prisoner back into George-street, and the goods were given me by a man out of Mr. Phelp's shop; I took Wood and the goods back to Mr. Wigley's shop; Mr. Wigley said, they were goods he had had much trouble in getting the day before, for Mr. Yorke, of Portland-place; and had tied them up that morning that the prisoners came in for a ball of worsted, that he bid them match it, and left them, and went down stairs.</p>
               <p>What became of Riley? - I do not know, I saw Molloy lurking on the opposite side, when I came back; he was not in the shop; I observed he was one of the gang; I sent over, and had him taken.</p>

               <p>I am a muffin baker, in George-street, Portland chapel; I was standing in my shop, on the 21st of February, and I saw a lad run, to the best of my knowledge it was Wood; I knew him; I saw him stoop down with a bundle in blue, like blue paper.</p>
               <p>Had you seen Riley at that time? - No, I have not a doubt but it is Wood, because when he stooped to drop the bundle, I perceived he had very short hair; I saw him throw the bundle under a stair-case, which goes over some stabling; I saw a gentleman take it up; he brought it into my shop; the blue paper looked very fresh then, but I could not say any further as to the bundle.</p>
               <p>Did the gentleman pick up the same bundle that the boy put down? - Yes, we kept the bundle; the gentleman said, I will take it home, and if they should ask for it, you will tell them where it is; I immediately saw him bringing the boy back again; and he gave the bundle to Mr. Higinbottom I believe.</p>
               <p>Did you see him give the bundle to Wigley? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see the boy taken? - No, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210089"></xptr>was brought back in five minutes, it was not three minutes I believe.</p>
               <p>Is that the boy which was brought back? - It was Wood; I am positive Wood was the lad that was brought back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wood. Pray Sir, did you see me take a bundle? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see me throw it down? - To the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say that it was a light colour blue paper? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not it a very short gentleman, in a blue coat, and that gentleman had a white coat at the same time, and a pig-tail? - To the best of my knowledge, it was Mr. Higinbottom.</p>
               <p>Higinbottom. I received the parcel, but I cannot say from whom.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Phelps. Did you follow me to the shop where I was taken to? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you gave the stockings to that gentleman? - Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wood. This is not the boy that was with me, it is a boy bigger than him; I know nothing of these two lads; I never saw them before I came into the prison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Riley. I never saw this boy before.</p>

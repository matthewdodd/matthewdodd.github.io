                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Buttery, who keeps a beer-shop in Ossulton-street, St. Pancras. On the evening of the 16th of May, I counted the silver in the till—there was 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am not sure which—there was a crown-piece among it, two half-crowns, and the rest in shillings and sixpences—there were no customers in the house it the time I counted it—I locked the till, but did not take out the key—I went to the front door, and spoke to a neighbour—five minutes after that the prisoner and another man came up—the prisoner said he had been <hi rend="italic">larking.</hi> and had got his hands all black, would I allow him to wash them—I allowed him to go into the back-yard to do so—he and his companion went into the yard, and I went outside again—in ten minutes afterwards the other man came back, and the prisoner followed him some minutes</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130035"></xptr>
               <p>afterwards—they went away together to a public-house near—they came back again to the door, but not into the house, they spoke to me in passing, then went across to Mr. Griffiths, the pawnbroker, where some handker<lb></lb>chiefs were hanging up—the prisoner came in again for some porter—I went to the till to change 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and when I got there, I found the money stated gone—no one but the prisoner and his companion had been in from the time of my seeing the money, and missing it—I told the prisoner I was robbed, that there had only been him and his companion there—I said there was a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece I could swear to, because it was particu<lb></lb>larly marked—a person went to Mr. Griffiths, and returned to my house—that person said nothing in the prisoner's presence about a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece to my knowledge—the prisoner had a handkerchief in his hand—I had noticed marks on the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece I lost—when the prisoner heard that I had missed a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, he went over to Mr. Griffiths, and retained with the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—he asked if I knew the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I said, "It is mine"—he put it into his pocket, and said, "It is in my pocket now, and you shall not see it again"—I sent for a policeman—I sent a person out of the shop to see what he had paid for this handkerchief, and the person returned, and said he had paid with a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—he was given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Mr. Bedford was at the pawnbroker's at the time I bought the two handkerchiefs; he told me to look at them, and said they were cheap at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I said I would give 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them; Bedford stopped there, and saw, me pay the money; I came over to Mrs. Buttery's, and ordered two pots of beer; I was in liquor at the time; I told Mrs. Buttery the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece was paid for the handkerchiefs; she sent over to the pawnbroker's; Mr. Bedford came back, and said there was a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece; I went over directly, and got the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece back, gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more for if, Drought it in, and said, "Is this your 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece?" she said, "Yes."

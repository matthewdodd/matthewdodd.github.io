I had forgotten I had left the desk in the coach. There were no persons about the coach door that I saw. I did not recollect that I had left it in the coach till the following morning; I then went down to the coach office in Essex-street, and stated my loss. I am quite sure the prisoner was the driver. I saw the desk again at a house in Westminster, on the 19th of January - the prisoner was not then in custody. I am certain of the property; the sovereigns were gone - the lock had been picked. I had advertised it on the 15th, and offered three guineas reward, as the papers in it were of great consequence; they were still in it, but the money was gone. The prisoner came to me, and said he believed he was the man who had driven me from Castle-street, to Holling's-street, and said by paying the three guineas reward, and 6 s. to the person at whose house it was, I might have it again; he represented the place where it was as his lodging; I went and examined the desk, and finding the two sovereigns were gone I did not give him the reward. The person of the house detained him while I got a Police officer. When I applied at Essex-street they knew nothing about it, but told me to call again in about four days - I went again on the 15th, and they said they had not seen it, and advised me to advertise. I did not know the number of the coach.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not state that the box was detained by the man who keeps the Punch Bowl, public-house, in the Strand? A. Yes, he did.</p>

            . I am the landlady of the Punch Bowl. I recollect having the desk in my possession; it was not brought by the prisoner, but by a man who is called Yorkshire Jemmy; I think it came on a Tuesday, the 11th of January, and remained there till the Monday following; the person who brought it took it away again, but I do not know where. The prisoner came for it on the Saturday after it was left - I told him I would not give it to any body but the person who left it. The prisoner was a stranger to me; I am certain it is the same desk.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live at No. 11, Lower Crown-street, Westminster. The prisoner lodged in my house till the 17th of January. On Tuesday, the 18th, Jemmy brought the desk to my house, in the evening; I took it into my front parlour, and put it into a cupboard. On Wednesday, the 19th, the prisoner came to my house in the evening; he said there was an advertisement respecting the desk, and he wanted to take it away; I asked him where he wanted to take it to; he said to Holling's-street, Wardour-street, and if one of my boys went with him, he would satisfy them for what he owed me - he owed then 5 s. for rent, and 1 s. for a latch key. I said I would go with him to see that it was all right, before I delivered it - I went with him, and saw Mr. Fisher; I told him I had the desk in my possession, and desired him to come to my house with the prisoner. I brought the desk to the door of my room, and said, "Is this it;" he said, "I dare say it is all right, and if you will go with me, I will settle with you;" I then stated that there was 6 s. due to me. The prisoner said to the prosecutor, "Pay him the 6 s., and I will settle with you presently;" he did so, and they went away.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Udall. I remember Yorkshire Jemmy coming about ten o'clock on the morning the desk was left, which was Tuesday, the 11th - while I was sweeping the parlour he asked me for the desk; I brought it out: he had a locksmith with him, and opened it. I saw him rout it about, and saw there were two sovereigns in it; he shut it up again, but did not take them out - I took it up stairs again.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 19th of January, between nine and ten o'clock at night, at Mr. Fisher's lodgings. I asked him how he came not to take the desk to the coach-office, which he knew was a general thing - he said it was very wrong, but he took it down to the Punch Bowl, near Temple-bar, and gave it to another coachman, named Yorkshire Jemmy. I have apprehended Jemmy since then - he was discharged on his own recognizance, but he has not been heard of since.</p>

I took the box the day after I had found it, to go to the office; but just as I came by the Punch Bowl I was called off to a fare; I gave it to Jemmy, which I thought was the safest way. I called at the Punch Bowl for it, but they would not give it to me. I have not seen Jemmy since. I heard no more of it till I saw the bill up in a public-house - I said, "That must be the desk I left at the Punch Bowl." I then went and told the gentleman of it.</p>

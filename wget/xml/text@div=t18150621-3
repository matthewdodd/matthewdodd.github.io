               <p>Q. Is there a communication between both - A. there is.</p>
               <p>(A plan of the premises was here put into the hands of the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. Does that represent your master's premises? is it like them - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. The mill is under the same roof with the dwelling-house - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, go on, relate what occured - A. My mistress told me to make secure the door; which I did, about half past nine in the evening of the 12th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the window then - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to bed - A. At about eleven o'clock, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any alarm in the night - A. I did, at about one o'clock; I heard a noise, which induced me to look out of the window; I could see nothing, but I heard my master's voice, telling me to open the front door, which was close to the mill; I went down stairs; I then saw my master, and his man, Miles, struggling with Bailey, the prisoner at the bar; it was near the front door of the house, which was close to the mill.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do with Bailey - A. They had him down against the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, what then - A. They took him into the house. He called out very plain for help when he was out of doors. I went to call Brown, the carter, but they had got him in then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the same room when Brown came - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What then passed - A. My master asked him how he intended to carry away the flour, and he said, upon my back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about the window - A. Not to my knowledge. My master asked him, what was become of the candle, and he said, he might make himself happy where the candle was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the mill, and perceive how the flour was - A. In the morning I went into the mill, and saw some strange bags; I mean they were not my master's; some were full, and some were empty.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the bags in the mill the night before - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your master a quaker - A. He is.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do, sir; I have seen him; he lives at Belfont, about three miles off, from where my master lives. He did not say any thing at first, but afterwards he said, that he knew he had done wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure there was no promise or threat nor any thing of the kind - A. Not in the least,</p>
               <p>Q. You say, he at first said nothing; what did he afterwards say - A. He said, he knew he had done wrong, and wished my master had shot him at once out of the way.</p>

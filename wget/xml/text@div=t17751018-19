            . I am a pawnbroker. This watch (producing it) was brought to me on Monday morning the 18th of September, by Jones, the other prisoner was with him; there was only one link of the chain to the watch; I asked where the rest of the chain was; Jones pulled the remainder out of his pocket, but it being of no value, I did not take it.</p>
               <p>Pilkington. The watch produced is my property, I know it by the name and the number.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence.</p>
               <p>Mullins and I met the prosecutor in the street, he asked us to drink with him; he was so drunk that he tumbled down in the taproom: I left him and Mullins together, as soon as we came out of the public-house. I did not see Mullins again till Monday morning; then he gave me this watch, and asked me to pawn it; I said, I would, if he would go with me; I went with him; he used to wear a watch, I thought it was his own.</p>
               <p>Mullins' Defence.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor was very much in liquor; he took his watch out in the public-house, and laid it on the table: he brought it out into the street in his hand; coming along, he asked me to lend him some money; I lent him five shillings, and he left the watch with me, and said, he would bring merthe money next day. and take his watch again; as he did not come on Sunday, and as I wanted money, I pawned it on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Did you borrow any money of him?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. None at all; I had fifteen shillings in my pocket.</p>

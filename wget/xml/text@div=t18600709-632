I offered her a penny to get a candle; he said the shops were shut; she came in again with a poker in one hand and a knife in the other, and said that I must go down stairs. I said, "No, I have paid for the room for all night, and I will sleep in it," the three girls started on to me, but would not strike a woman. I asked the man to keep hold of them; if I did it, I did not do it with any intention, but in my own defence; but one of them might have done it when they were making blows at me; they took my handkerchief and what money I had in my pocket.</p>

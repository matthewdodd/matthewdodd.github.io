                  </hi>. I live in New-court, Bluegate-fields, St. George's-in-the-East. On the 5th of October I was with Daniel Fitzgerald, drink<lb></lb>ing at the Three Suns' public-house, New Gravel-lane, between half-past seven and eight o'clock in the evening—the prisoner came in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after us, and sat on the opposite side of the room—I and Fitzgerald were talking Irish together—the prisoner said, "I will have none of your b—Irish here"—I said, "We are not talking to you, we are talking among ourselves"—he said, "If you don't hold your tongue, you b—y Irish b—r, I will <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> your eye out;" and he took his pipe out of his mouth, came over, and <hi rend="italic">dabbed</hi> the small end of it right into ray left eye—the pipe broke in my eye—I pulled it out, and some blood fell out at the time—I became very weak and insensible—I was taken to a doctor's, opposite, and went to the hospital next day, where I remained three weeks and three days—I have lost the sight of my eye through it—I cannot see a bit out of it—the prisoner seemed to me to be sober—this is not the first time he has <hi rend="italic">served me out</hi>—I have known him six or seven years—I do not know whether he is an Irishman—I was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Crawley in the Three Suns—I saw the prisoner come in and sit on the far side of the room—I was talking to Crawley in Irish, and the prisoner said, "I will have no b—y Irish here" Crawley said, "We are not speaking to you"—the prisoner said, "You b—r, I will <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> your b—y eye out"—he got up, walked across the room, took the pipe from his mouth, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it with all his might into Crawley's eye—Crawley lifted up both hands to pull the piece of pipe out of his eye—it had broken in his head, and a little blood came down his face—I conveyed him home the best way I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. In October last I was a pupil in the London Hospital—the prosecutor came there with a severe injury in the inner angle of his eye—it was a punctured, lacerated wound, made with something pointed—I should imagine the mouth end of a pipe would be very likely to inflict such a wound—it was a severe wound—there was very severe subsequent inflammation—from the highly organized state of the eye, I do not conceive that any severe injury can be inflicted upon it without a person being more or less in danger, from the connexion between the eye and the brain—I consider he was decidedly in danger at one time while in the hospital—he says there is considerable im<lb></lb>pairment of the sight, and I think that more than probable—whatever in<lb></lb>jury there is now is likely to be permanent.</p>

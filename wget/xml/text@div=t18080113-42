             at the Cross Keys, Gracechurch-street; the master of the Cross Keys informed Mr. Osborne that his father had been there and wanted to see him; he asked me to go with him; he said, if I said I belonged to the same ship as he did, he should get some money of his father; I did go. I saw a tin case with a key in it; it was there when I came, in and when I went out, I never touched it; when Mr. Osborne came down stairs, we went out; we walked along to the corner of Gracechurch-street, where we left Mr. Osborne's brother, who came down stairs with us; we went into the Strand; when we came there Mr. Osborne said he had got a check, he wanted cash for it; I said, I could get it cashed at Mr. Stunt's; I was to say this check belonged to me; we went into Mr. Stunt's shop, I ask- for a pair of boots; Mr.

             presented the check, and asked the foreman if he could cash it. Mr. Stunt's foreman went up stairs, he said when he came down he had not got enough money; I had a pair of boots and three pound one, and we went to the play.</p>
               <p>COURT. - The prisoner's counsel has made an objection about the word London on the draft; you shall see it. At the same time it is my duty to declare what the law is; if the word London had not appeared on the face of it, the prisoner would have taken the benefit of it; but as it is, both law and ets are mixed together, the word London being expressed, and it actually was drawn in London and therefore you are to say whether you are satisfied in point of fact that he stole the note if you are, then the prisoner has committed the larcency; however, you are to judge of that; you have heard the evidence of persons both in the house of Mr. Dunbar and Mr. Stunt; Mr. Stunt's foreman has told you upon his oath the prisoner at the bar was the person who presented that draft, there can no imputation at all to Mr. Osborne.</p>

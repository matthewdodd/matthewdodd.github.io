               <p>JOHN NOCK. I am about ten years of age. My sister gave me the jacket in a handkerchief to carry to my brother, over the water. The prisoner met me, and sent me up a three pair of stairs room in <placeName id="t18130407-15-crimeloc80">Wild-street</placeName>

I went up into the three pair room, and asked for the name of Smith, and as I was going up he took the bundle out of my hand. He had asked me for the bundle before. I denied him. The bundle belonged to

            . The constable found the handkerchief which contained the jacket. The prisoner took the bundle from me, and went up Wild-street. When I came down stairs I could not see the prisoner; I began to cry, and then John Russell, a young man, came up to me. I told him what had happened. After that, I saw the prisoner in Monmouth-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the man that took the bundle from you - A. Yes, I am. It was a jacket in an handkerchief.</p>

            . Q. Did you see this boy in the street - A. Yes I was going down Wild-street; I saw the boy crying; I asked him what was the matter. He said, a man had sent him up stairs, and had ran away with his bundle. The boy described the man to me. I saw the prisoner in Monmouth-street. The boy said that was the man. I went over to him, and asked him for the boy's bundle. He said, he had not seen it; he had not seen the boy. I said you must go along with me. The prisoner said, I hope you will not hurt me. I said, I did not want to hurt him, but he must go along with me. He then said, if I would not hurt him, he would give me the jacket, and he wanted me to go into a court in Long Acre. I would not go. I took him into custody, and took him to Bow-street. The prisoner there was searched, and the handkerchief was found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had not the jacket when you took him - A. No. This is the handkerchief that was found on him.</p>
               <p>Nock. That is the handkerchief that contained the jacket; I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Russell. When the handkerchief was found, the prisoner said he gave three halfpence for it, to another boy that was playing in the street; and when I asked him if he had the boy's bundle, he said, he would give me the jacket or the money to make it up. As soon as ever the boy saw the handkerchief, he said, that was the handkerchief that the jacket was wrapped in. And the person that belonged to the handkerchief described the handkerchief before she saw it.</p>
               <p>MRS. SMITH. I am sister to the little boy. I gave him the handkerchief to to carry to his brother-in-law. This is the handkerchief that the jacket was tied in. I value the jacket at twenty-five shillings. The handkerchief is of no value hardly.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PRICE. I am a constable. I searched the prisoner, and took the handkerchief from him. He wanted to make it up. He told us the jacket should be forth coming. I refused.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime.</p>

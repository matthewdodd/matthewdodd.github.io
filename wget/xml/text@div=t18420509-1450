                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, North-passage, Bethnal-green—eight or nine weeks ago I went to Smart's warehouse, near Spitalfields church, and saw the prisoner waiting in the warehouse—I had some empty bob<lb></lb>bins with me—I left him there and was going home, and met the prisoner in Lamb-street—he touched me on the shoulder, and said he was to have my shute, which is what we weave with—it belonged to Mr. Smart—I asked him if he had got a bill—as it was usual when I give it up to have a bill delivered to me—he said he had not got one, but I could not doubt him because I had seen him at the warehouse—I told him if he had got a bill my daughter would give it him—he did not ask me for anything else—I gave him nothing then—he came three times to me, and next day he asked me for the shute—I thought it was all right, and gave him twenty-three bobbins, with silk on them, believing what he said—they belong to Mr. Smart—I was to pay 11$. for them—I should have lost my employ if I did not—it had been given me at the warehouse to work up.</p>

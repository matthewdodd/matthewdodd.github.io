            . As I was sitting in Company last Saturday was a Fortnight, my Wife imagined I wanted some Money -</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this ?</p>
               <p>Kirk. At Mrs Hutchinson's in Ayloffe street - so my Wife throws the Purse to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ask you if you wanted Money?</p>
               <p>Kirk. She thought I did; and a Gentleman pickt up the Purse, and opened it, and counted the Money, and carried it to Mrs Kirk again.</p>

               <p>Q How came the Gentleman to take the Liberty of opening your Wife's Purse.</p>
               <p>Kirk. I suppose in a jocular way; I believe this was about four or five o'Clock, it was returned to my Wife, and she mist it in the Morning: As she was same, and not able to stir out of her Chair, the Prisoner was Servant in the House, and was very ready to wait upon my Wife: She was very bare of Clothes before, and in two or three Days she was very flush of Money, and bought herself abundance of Things, that gave us reason to suspect that she was guilty of the Robbery.</p>
               <p>Q Did you find the Purse and Money?</p>
               <p>Kirk. No, but she has confest the Thing.</p>

            . Yes, I lost these eighteen Guineas last Saturday was a Fortnight. I thought my Spouse wanted Money, and I tost it to him out of a Window of a little Bar-Room: They were sitting at a Table in the Yard, and I throw'd it to him; so a Gentleman pickt it up, and told it, and there was eighteen Guineas; there was six and twenty, but I had laid out some; the Gentleman brought it to me, and I put it, as I thought, into my Pocket, or whether I might drop it I cannot say, or whether I might clap it under the Seat of the Chair, but there was no Body in the Room with me but that Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Bed, did you feel for your Purse?</p>
               <p>Kirk. No, my Lord. Whether I dropt it aside, or whether behind the Chair, or whether dropt down I can't tell: The next Morning I searcht for it, and ask'd the Gentlewoman of the House after it, but she said she knew nothing of it: This Girl was more than ordinary kind in waiting upon me, but I did not see her take it; but when she came to this Gentlewoman no body would have given her Six-pence for her two Shifts, and presently after she had plenty of Things, which gave me a great Suspicion of her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman—the prisoner was in my service. On 18th June I missed a watch from the toilet-drawer—it had been locked, and I found it so—I called the prisoner, who was in the next room—she said she could not come, she was dressing—I said I would wait—in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour she came—I said she had taken my watch—she went on her knees, and said she had not—I said, "I have Lad enough of your hypocrisy; I shall not go out till I find it, nor shall you"—at half-past ten o'clock I was going to bed, and went to another drawer, which was not locked, and found my watch in a piece of wash-leather—next morning I called a policeman—the prisoner's box was searched, and the other articles stated found in it—she had no right to them—there was no one but her and me in the house.</p>

On Friday night, 26th April, I went to bed about a quarter to two—I left the house fastened securely—I saw my husband fasten the parlour window looking into the back-yard—I came down in the morning, about twenty minutes to six—the alarm had then been given—my daughter and the servant were down first—I found the house had been broken open—I missed a quantity of copper—I can scarcely tell bow much—it was in the half of a bolster-case—I should say there must have been a peck, and six or seven shillings in silver, which we had left in the bowl for the morning's use, and some copper also which we had left in the bar—the two bowls were removed, and one put in the bar-parlour, and one in the public parlour—I also missed a box of cigars, and 150 screws of tobacco which I had made up on the Friday afternoon—I think I should know them again (<hi rend="italic">looking at some produced by the officer</hi>)—these I made on the Friday—I also missed some cakes like these, some knives like these, and three or four bottles of spirits similar to these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also missed a small bowl nearly full of farthings, nearly 300, I should say—some table-spoons were taken out of a drawer, but were not taken away—this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—we have</p>

On the morn<lb></lb>ing of 27th April I came down-stairs about twenty minutes to six—I found the house broken open—the back window was open and the shutters down—I directly went up to my father, and when I came down again I went into the bar-parlour—I found the drawers had been opened and ransacked, and the cupboard also—I missed some spoons from the cupboard, a box of cigars from the bar, and some biscuits from the safe.</p>

In consequence of information I received on Saturday morning, 27th April, I went, about ten o'clock to Mr. Relph's house—the prisoner's sister lives nearly opposite Mr. Relph's—I watched that house till seven, or half-past seven, in the evening—I then saw the prisoner come out of his sister's house and go into Mr. Relph's—at asked for something at the bar, which he got in a bottle—I followed him out, called him back, and took him into Mr. Relph's back yard, and asked whether he had been into his sister's house that morning—he said he had not—I asked if he had carried any bundles into his sister's house that morning—he said be bad not—I asked where he lived—he said at 20, Edward-street—(I found be had lived there for a few days, and the back yard of the boost looks into Mr. Relph's back yard; it is very easy to get from one to the other)—I told him 1 was a police-officer, and he was suspected of committing a robbery there on the Friday night—he said, "I did not do it"—I then took him to the station—on the way I said I believed he had bought a coat, waistcoat, and trowsers, at Mr. Thompson's—he said, "I did not buy any<lb></lb>thing of the kind; I have not been into Mr. Thompson's shop this morning"—I found on him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and this empty bag wrapped round his waist inside his coat—I afterwards went to his sister's house, 2, Albany-place—she was not at home—I waited till she came—I found there twenty-seven farthings on the mantelpiece, in a saltcellar, and four screws of tobacco, and these knives I found in a drawer.</p>

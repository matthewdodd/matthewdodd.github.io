            . I am a publican, I live at the Red Lion, Poppin's court, Fleet street. On Sunday morning, the 5th of February, my wife awoke me, she told me somebody was breaking into the house; I opened the window, I saw three men at Mr. Leaf and Severs' warehouse, they were standing against the warehouse; the watchman came to cry the hour of half past three, and they dispersed; I got into bed again; presently I heard the noise of moving some shutters, I got up and dressed myself and came to the one pair of stairs window; I watched them alternately, sometimes at the window and sometimes at the door; that part of the shutter that they first attempted to break they left off, it made such a noise; they began another shutter with a center bit; after they had made a small hole with the center bit the watchman came by; they dispersed the second time. When he came at four o'clock they had made a very visible hole, then Norman stood with his back towards the hole, and his face towards me, and the others went away. The watchman asked him what he was doing there; he said he was in liquor, he was going home to Stonecutter street; they had some conversation relating to some gin. After the watchman went to his box; they went to work again; the prisoners and another there were three and at times there were two. Thompson and Norman came back, they continued to work, excepting when the watchman came round at half past four, then they dispersed as they did before, taking the precaution to daub the shutter that they had cut with some mud that they took out of the gutter. About a quarter before five these men were very attentive to work; I armed myself with a small poker, went and collared Thompson, and struck Norman; a scuffle ensued, they gave me a few slight blows<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150066"></xptr>with their hands; I turned my attention towards securing one; I beat the one that I laid hold of till I thought he had sufficient and he was in my power; then I turned to Norman, he ran away; while I turned round to Norman, Thompson ran down the court; I pursued him at about two yards distance; I was about two yards distance from him all the way down the court till we came to the bottom; two watchmen were turning into the court, they rather impeded his progress; I came up to him, collared him, and turned him over to the watchman; I heard a voice say what is the matter; I turned round and saw it was Norman. I gave him in charge likewise; they were both taken to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw them at half past three - A. Yes; and when they were taken it was a quarter before five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the persons of these men - A. The lamp gave a very indifferent light, I could not swear to their features ; when I gave a knock at Norman I had a full opportunity of seeing; he had the opportunity of running away and going to Fleet street; but when he returned and asked what was the matter I was convinced he is the same man; I am now quite satisfied in my own mind he is the same person; the other man there can be no doubt of him; I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Before the alderman you were not quite so certain as you are now, you then said you thought he was dressed like the man, and his voice was like the man that you heard speak to the watchman - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were taking Thompson, Norman came behind you and asked what was the matter, his voice corresponded with the man you had heard before and you gave him in custody - he was not committed when the other man was - A. He was; and after being committed he asked leave to bring some people to prove where he was at the time; he brought some person to prove where he was at two o'clock; the next day he was to bring people to prove further; then he could not prove so far as he did the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to speak positively to Norman - A. His going out of my sight does not enable me to speak so positively as to Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. The man who did escape, whoever he was, you gave him a pretty sharp blow on the neck with the poker - A. I fancy I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact he was examined and no mark found on his neck - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my beat is in Poppin's court, Fleet street. When I went the hour of four Norman was standing with his back to the shutter; I asked him what he was standing there for; he said he was looking towards Mr. Shenton's window; he wanted a glass of gin; he said he could get one; Shenton knew him very well; I told him he had better go on; he said he would. I went up to the top of the court; he asked me if there were no houses open where he could get a glass of gin, he would give me one; I told him there was a night house in the Old Bailey where he might get some; he wanted me to go with him; I told him I could not go, nor I would not go; he told me that he lived in Stonecutter street; I told him to go down Poppin's court into Harp alley, to Stonecutter street, or to go down Shoe lane; he went down Poppin's court; I went down to the watch-box, and then I went about half way up to where the noise was, I heard a noise of screaking; the noise ceased a bit and then began again; I could not think what it was: I thought it was some people moving their goods, I thought I must watch if in case any body moved their goods away I should be blamed; I went up the court, then Mr. Shenton was pursuing after these men; Thompson was stopped at the end of Poppin's court, Harp alley ; when we got him a little way down Harp alley Norman came up and asked what was the matter; then Mr. Shenton gave charge of him; I laid hold of him and took him to the watch-house along with the other.</p>
               <p>Q. After the long conversation that you had with Norman about the gin, had you the opportunity of observing him so as to be able positively to tell that he is the man - A. Yes, I had, at the end of the court.</p>
               <p>- ROGERS . I am beadle and constable of St. Bride's. The prisoners were brought into our watch-house between four and five in the morning; I took the charge from Mr. Shenton; they were searched in the watchhouse and no implement was found on them at all; I was in the room when Norman was stripped at Guildhall; there was no marks of any blow on his neck or body.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, to Leaf. How was the house broken - A. The shutter was cut through the wood but not through the plate ; they had attempted two places, one place was cut with a slight mark, the other was cut a round ring through; about five inches diameter was taken out of the wood part, leaving the iron plate on the inside; the iron plate was nailed to the wood.</p>
               <p>COURT. Mr. Shenton, you said you heard a noise - A. Yes; it was something like a splitting of the shutters; a screaking noise.</p>
               <p>Thompson's Defence. I had been out to a money club that I belong to, I stopped very late; I went to sleep on a bench. I live in Shoe lane; coming home very late some young girl picked me up and took me down this court; in the mean time the young girl took me down somebody rushed upon me and struck me with the poker; I ran; I did not know but it was somebody belonging to this girl, and they were going to use me ill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney addressed the jury on behalf of the prisoner Norman.</p>

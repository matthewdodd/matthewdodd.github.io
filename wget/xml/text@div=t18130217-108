             to buy twelve oranges for sixpence, and the sixpence I offered him he refused, saying it was a bad one. I gave him an eighteen-penny piece, and he gave me a shilling in change. The shilling I got from him was a bad one. My brother was standing by the side of me. He said, we may as well have another dozen. The prisoner had only nine left in his basket. He borrowed three oranges of a brother Jew, and made up a dozen. My brother offered him sixpence for them. The prisoner said to me, if you will give me a three-shilling piece, I will give half-a-crown change. I gave him a three-shilling piece. He gave me an eighteen-penny piece and a shilling. I gave the whole of the money to the constable. A boy came up and said something, and in consequence of what the boy said I went back to the corner of the bank, and from there I went to the side of the Exchange. The prisoner was there selling oranges. I told him he had given me bad change. He offered to change them. He said he was very sorry for it. I said, no, if I let him change them I should be as bad as he was. I led him along as far as the counter. A parcel of Jews kept round him; they said I was no constable, I had no right to take him. Then I let him go. He ran up the Old Jewry as fast as he could run. I ran after him, and my brother. I cried, stop thief. A man stopped him. Mr. Fenner came up and took him to the Compter. I went with him.</p>

            . I was with my brother. I bought sixpennyworth of oranges. I gave him sixpence. He refused it. He said, it was a Frenchman. He asked if we had a three-shilling piece. We told him, yes, and gave him one. He gave us an eighteen-penny piece and a bad shilling. My brother took the shilling, and afterwards gave it to Fenner. After we brought the oranges we went on to the Bank, a boy stopped us, and told us something. In consequence of what the boy said, we went back to the prisoner, and told him he had given us bad-change. He told us he would change it. My brother told him he would not let him. We took him as far as the Compter, and then he ran away. I ran after him and halloaed out, stop thief. He was stopped. A constable came and took him to the Compter. He was searched, and a few halfpence was found on him, perhaps enough to buy him a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>- . I was walking past. I saw the prisoner dealing with these gentleman. I was going towards Cheapside. I had seen the Jew selling oranges before. One of the gentlemen offered him a sixpence. He said, I do not think this sixpence is a good one. The gentleman then gave him an eighteen-penny piece. He gave him a shilling; it had a black circle round it. He had a great deal more silver. I dare say he had two pounds worth. He selected this shilling, took one out, and gave it him. He had more shillings marked in the same way as that was. The other gentleman wanted a dozen oranges; he had only nine left; he borrowed three of another jew. He gave him a sixpence. He refused that. He said, give me a three-shilling piece, I will give you half-a-crown. I went to these gentlemen and told them the Jew had given them bad money, and pointed out the prisoner at Sweeting's-alley. I said, the Jew is selling there. I am positive he is the man. I have known him for two or three years.</p>

I gave it him before the Lord Mayor, I produce the shillings and the sixpence, and the eighteen-penny token.

            . Q. Look at the two shillings, are they new manufactured - A. They are quite fresh counterfeits. They have never been in circulation. The eighteen-penny token is a good one; both the sixpences are good ones. One is a French sixpence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer and dealer in coals, and live at Battersea. I had a barge of coals on the Thames, off Battersea Church, on the 29th of Aug.—the prisoner was not employed by me on board the barge—I cannot swear to the coals produced—they are similar coals to what I was unloading.</p>

About two o'clock on Thursday morning, the 29th of Aug., I saw the prisoner on board a coal-barge, near Battersea Church—there were no other coal<lb></lb>barges there—he was taking coals off the top of the barge, and putting them into a bag—I took him into custody, and asked him if he was the owner of the coals—he said he was not there for the purpose of stealing coals, but to fasten a rope on to the head of the barge—there was a full moon, and it was a very light morning.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 295.) About a quarter past two o'clock in the morning of the 29th, I was present at this barge—I saw the prisoner stooping down in the middle of the barge, picking up coals, and put ting them into a bag—I took him—he said he was making fast a rope—when he saw me and my brother officer, he got up from the coal-barge, went to his own barge, and merely took hold of the rope, and shook it.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you not find that his barge was fast to the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I and my brother officer met there—we had just come there—we both saw him together—he was stooping down—his face was towards me—I saw his countenance quite plainly—it was a bright moonlight morning—I took notice enough of him to know him again—I had my uniform on—it was quite light—I went on board the barge, and found a small bag there, containing coals—that was the first thing I saw when I got on board—he was taken before the Magistrate the next day, was remanded, and ultimately admitted to bail, and has surrendered here to-day.</p>

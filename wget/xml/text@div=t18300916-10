On Saturday, the 4th of September, about eleven or half-past eleven o'clock at night (I do not know what street this happened in, as I am a stranger) I had been drinking at a public-house, but knew every thing that passed - I was not drunk; I had all my senses about me - I was going along a street endeavouring to find my way to my lodging; I am quite a stranger in London - I lodge at No. 20, Park-street, Limehouse; I inquired the nearest way of both men and women who I met, and must have been directed wrong; I was walking along, and received a violent blow behind me in the small of my back, and at the same time I got a blow on my forehead which bled very much - the blow was either with a first or something heavy; that blow knocked me backwards, and knocked me down - blood flowed from that blow; I could not see any body, for the moment I was down my eyes were covered over - I could not exactly say what it was by - it might be that the blows were so violent that I could not see, but it appeared as if I was covered with a handkerchief or something over my eyes; I could not see - I had from 4l. 19s. 6d. to 5l. 1s. 6d. about me; there were three sovereigns, and the rest in silver - it was in my breeches pocket; I did not feel it taken - I became insensible; I hardly knew what I was about - I had a tobacco pouch about me; I cannot say how many blows I received - it was more than two; I was obliged to keep my room several hours every day, and spit blood for nine days; I was very much bruised - my eye was not black, as it bled so much; as soon as I was able, I called Watch! Police! and Robbery! - I did not see any body running away from me; the prisoner was taken into custody by the Police, and my tobacco-pouch found.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty on this Saturday night, in Hermitage-street, Wapping, about half-past eleven o'clock, and heard the cry of Robbery! Murder! Watch! and Police! I made towards the spot, and saw the prisoner running from the dock wall; he cut across, and ran down Hermitage-street - he was the first person running; he was running away very hard - when I saw him run I followed him; he met me, but turned down the street - I ran after him, overtook him, and collared him; when he found I was gaining on him, he called Watch! Watch! I collared<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160013"></xptr>him, and he then said to me, "There is a man been robbed near the dock wall, and I am calling out Watch! for him;" I then told him I must proceed with him to where the noise first came from, and in my way I met a brother officer, and proceeded with him to the spot - there was a mob collected, and the prosecutor appeared all over blood, as if he had been knocked down; he had his senses about him perfectly - he was not at all drunk; I searched the prisoner before I got to the spot, and found only a tobacco-pouch, a knife, and handkerchief on him- the pouch was in his pocket; when we got to the spot where the man was knocked down, we took his hat off, and a lot of silver and copper fell out; we picked it up, put it into the handkerchief, and a little further there were two sovereigns picked up, near to where he had been; as I took him to the watch-house I heard something drop either from his month or sleeve - I picked it up, and found it was a sovereign; my brother officer opened his hand, and found half a crown and a halfpenny in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. It was half-past eleven o'clock? A. Yes - it was dark; there are gaslights there - Hermitage-street is a great thoroughfare; there were not many persons passing at the time - there might be one or two; I could see no more - I saw the prisoner plainly; I might be about the length of this Court from him at first; I had seen him before that night three or four times - there are three or four gas-lights, and he came running towards me; I first saw him coming from the dock wall - I took him in Hermitage-street, which may be one-eighth of a mile from the wall; I did not lose sight of him - I cannot say whether he knew me- I saw him in less than half a minute after I first heard the cry of Stop thief! it was all in a moment; there might be another person running.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said you first heard a cry of Watch! and Police! saw the prisoner, and nobody was running before him? A. I say there might have been, but I saw nobody.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty on the night in question; Mosely and I were nearly together - I heard a cry of Murder! Watch! and Stop thief! ran towards the spot, and saw the prisoner running - he was the first person running; nobody was before him - Mosely was coming on way, and the prisoner another; he turned short round at the end of the dock wall, and Mosely caught him - we took him to where the noise proceeded from, and saw the prosecutor bleeding; he described what had happened, and appeared quite sensible - he said he had been knocked down, and robbed of his money; I took off the prisoner's hat, and found 1l. 11s 6d. in silver, and 10 1/2d. in copper - I found a tobacco-pouch in his right-hand jacket pocket; we went to where the man said he was knocked down, and found four shillings, some halfpence, and a penny piece - as we went to the watch-house the prisoner contrived to drop a sovereign, which I picked up; I believe it came from his hand - I had hold of his arm; he gave his arm a jerk, and the sovereign fell behind him - I opened his hand, and found half a crown and a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you when you first heard the cry? A. Near Hermitage-bridge; I saw nobody else running, and am sure nobody was running before him - Hermitage-street is not very dark.</p>

            . This pouch is mine, and was in one of my pockets, I will take my oath - here is a head of tobacco, which was found on him; I had just such a piece in my pocket, but I do not swear to that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a hard-working industrious man - the money is my own, so is the tobacco-pouch, and every thing; I always carry a pouch for my tobacco - the money I had in my hat I tied in a little handkerchief, to buy things with; when they searched me I took out the half-crown, that they should not take all my money - that man said he would settle me; he had the money in his hand, carrying it to the watch-house, when the sovereign fell - I am innocent.</p>

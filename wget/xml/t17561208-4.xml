               <p>I went to this woman's house in the morning, and said I was going farther; she desir'd I'd call as I came back, which I did; she desir'd I'd sit down. I staid there till near noon, drinking with her all the time, when I said I'd have a dish of tea; she insisted upon my staying till her husband came home, she was jealous of me and her husband, and wanted to make things up. I spent the value of a crown on her, and she offer'd to lend me this ring to pawn: as to the book, she said I might have that; since this she has said, she would be revenged of me on account of her husband.</p>

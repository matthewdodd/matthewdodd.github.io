                  </hi>. I am one of the registers of the principal Registry of Her Majesty's Court of Divorce—I produce the original petition for dissolution of marriage of Harry Lewis Ayling, dated 15th December, 1869—it states that he was married on the 23rd January 1865, to Emma Merritt, that there were two children by the marriage, and alleges that his wife had committed adultery with one John Collier, between 1st May and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187208190040"></xptr>
               <p>30th January, and prays for a dissolution of marriage on that ground—the petition was presented by himself in person—I also produce an affidavit by the same person, Henry Lewis Ayling, verifying the petition—a copy of the citation is served on the respondent and co-respondent by showing them the citation and leaving them a copy—the two citations would be given out with the seal of the Court attached, and copies would then be made—this is a blank form; it is first signed by the registrar, and then sealed—the parties themselves can make copies, and serve them on the respondent and co-respondent—on 22nd December Mrs. Ayling appeared in person—this document purports to bear my signature as registrar—it is a forgery—it is dated 17th January, 1870—there is a seal attached to that; it appears to be a genuine seal of the Court—as far as I can judge it is similar to the seal that would be attached to the citation when issued—the document bears two sets of initials—I can swear to my own signature, but I am not prepared to say whether the other is genuine or not—the first two initials of my signature are very good, the remainder is not so good—a decree in the Divorce Court is not usually sealed; it can be sealed, but it is not usual—by the minutes nothing appears to have been done in the Divorce Court after the appearance of the respondent—this decree is not on a form of the Court—the Court makes the rule nisi and then absolute, which dissolves the marriage in the first instance—I believe this to be a Scotch form; it is not our form.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first step is to take out a citation of petition—I really can hardly tell you how the party gets that form of citation—the first I see of it is when it comes up in the usual form with the initials of the senior clerk, and then I or one of the registrars issue the usual form, which is afterwards sealed—I know of one or two cases in which unquali<lb></lb>fied persons have tried to act as attornies in the Divorce Court, but I don't know whether they have succeeded.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Divorce Registry Office—the citations are brought to me—they are always issued filled up—before they are given out they are filled up with the names of the respondent and the co<lb></lb>respondent, the seal is attached, and the signature of the registrar—the initials of "<hi rend="largeCaps">G. E</hi>." to this decree of 17th January are my initials, but they are not written by me—my initials are attached to everything which comes out of the Divorce Court, and my initials would be attached to the cita<lb></lb>tion—I know nothing of this document.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I grant a citation, the party comes with what is Called a precipe and also a form like this of citation—you can get that form at the stationer's—I attach the seal—I could not attach the seal to a fictitious divorce suit, because I should have the petition and the affidavit and the precipe before me—they bring the petition and the affidavit in order that I may issue the citation—those are all the documents I want to authenticate the citation and to get my initials—when I see the affidavit, I feel justified in granting the citation—they ought to be returned to the Court—we keep all documents filed when a suit is completed—when the party leaves our office with the citation he serves it on the respondent and co-respondent, and he ought to return it to the Registry Office after service—parties sometimes neglect to return them, but when the cause goes before the Court for directions for trial, they are bound to bring in the citation, otherwise the Judge could not set the cause down—if the suit was abandoned, you would not see anything more of the citation—I don't know that</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Doery, and live at 12, Burnett Street, Vauxhal—he is a cab proprietor—my daughter Mary Jane Doery, was married to the prisoner on 14th February, 1870—she is twenty-four now; she was twenty-two when she was married—I have known the prisoner about six years—he was clerk to Messrs. Blake &amp; Sons, solicitors, in Blackfriars Road—he first commenced to pay attention to my daughter about six years ago—his wife called upon me about six months after he made my daughter's acquaintance; it was about 1867—I saw the woman who represented herself as the prisoner's wife—I saw the prisoner the same evening and told him I had seen his wife, and begged him to have nothing more to say to my daughter—he said "Very well, I don't intend to," or something of that sort, and he bid me good night—he said "If I am married, where was I married?"—I said "At Greenwich;" and he said "It is too true"—I lost sight of him for some time; some months—I after<lb></lb>wards saw him in Kennington Lane—that was about twelve months before he married my daughter—he told me then he was trying for a divorce, and he should get it in six months—my daughter was living with me at that time—I received this letter from him; I think about November last year, and I went to see him—this is the letter: "252, Kennington Lane. Will you look down this evening; the Court has granted me a divorce, and I am now, thank God, free. Yours truly, H. L. Ayling"—I said "You have got the divorce, I see"—he said "Yes"—I said "I suppose you will soon be married then?"—he said "I have got it here," and he showed me a piece of parchment folded up—I saw him afterwards, and said I was surprised he had got it so soon—he said he was in the law and he knew how to do it sooner and cheaper—I had said I thought it was very expensive—the pri<lb></lb>soner was lodging at 252, Kennington Road—my daughter was married from his lodgings—it was at his lodging I saw the parchment—on the morning of the wedding it was lying on the table; he said "I must not forget to take it with me to church, for fear some of the opposite party may be there"—I went with my daughter to the church, and they were married on 14th February, 1870—after the marriage the prisoner came to my house and brought the document with him—I asked him to bring it in order that the rest of the family might see it—we had no doubt, but it was for our satisfaction—my husband was present when it was read—it was a document exactly like this—I did not understand it, but I heard what the substance was—it was a document of divorce from the first wife that he might marry my daughter—he took it away with him after he read it—some time after<lb></lb>wards my daughter brought the document to me, and I had it in my possession about a fortnight, and after that she fetched it away—I never opened it—I afterwards saw it in the possession of my husband, and he gave it to Mr. Coleman, the solicitor, in my presence—some time in the present year proceedings were taken in the Lambeth Police Court for bigamy, and then I found out that the document was not genuine.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 11th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was passing these premises, and hearing the door shut too, and knowing the men had left work, I looked through the board, and saw the prisoner shutting the door - this bundle was lying down by his side; I said "What are you doing?" he said "Shutting the door:" I said "Does Mr. Brass know you are here at this time?" he said "Yes, and if you will go with me, he will satisfy you;" I said "What have you got in this bundle?" he said "Bits of wood," but I found it was lead - he endeavoured to escape, but I secured him; I saw the lead fitted - it matched exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found it lying down, and thinking it was of no use, I took it up to make a few halfpence, being very much distressed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cow keeper, and live at Prince's-row, Notting-hill. I have known the prisoner two or three years—there was a little dealing between us—in May last there was no money due by me to the prisoner—on 24th May Hutchins came to my house between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening—Duffield was with him—he banded me this piece of paper, and said "I have brought this paper, a writ from Mr. Lewis"—I said I did not owe Mr. Lewis anything at all—he said, Mr. Lewis instructed him to take any sum of money he could get from me—he said, could I give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he would take that and give me a receipt, and I should have no more trouble—I said, "No, not a farthing"—he called me on one side, and said "Can't you manage to give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?" I said, "No, not a farthing"—he then</p>

               <p>left—he came to my sister's house, where I lodge, two or three times, but I was not at home—Duffield was present when the writ was given to me, but I do not think he heard the conversation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the prisoner taken before a Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was not discharged—Hutchings was charged—he was remanded, and the case against him was dismissed—I have known the prisoner three or four years—he has not been continually in my employment—I employed him to collect money for me—I only spoke to him once about it—I gave him so many debts at one time—I do not remember giving him more afterwards—that is about a year and a half ago—he sent me in a bill after I had sued him at the County Court—he did not make a charge against me for remuneration for the trouble and expense he had been put to in trying to collect my debts—he never said anything to me about it.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You authorized him to receive some debts, amounting to about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he did receive part of that, and it was for that I sued him, 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I believe he pleaded at the County Court that I was indebted to him—I do not know what was the amount of the set-off—the set-off was allowed by the Judge—this was in April, and after that he sent a bill by Watts for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I refused to pay him—I did not owe him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or any sum of money—whatever sums he collected, I have never received any of the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer, of 31, Lower Rosoman Street, Clerkenwell—on 23rd August the prisoner and a woman named Stanley came to the front of my shop—I served Stanley with a pound of apples, she gave me a bad sixpence—I bit it, and said, "This is bad, we have been taking a great deal of this money lately, I must know more about it"—Stanley said, "I know where I took it from, we were going to the workhouse to see our mother"—she asked for it back—I said, "No"—Taylor said, "I will pay for the apples," gave me a penny, and made off—I sent Tait after her and detained Stanley—my man came back soon, and almost immediately a young man from the pawnbroker's brought a blue bag, which he said that Taylor, who had a child with her, had left in his shop—I gave them in custody with the sixpence and the bag, which was opened and turned out into a scale—they both tried to get hold of it—I did not see what coin it was, as each was screwed up in tissue paper—they were not undone till the prisoner came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Bowdon's employment—he called me on 23rd August, and I saw a mob round the door—Stanley was there, and I went and overtook Taylor, who was going fast in the direction of the workhouse, but she turned to the right—I did not lose sight of her, she went into a pawnbroker's shop in Exmouth Street, Mr. Sill's—I followed her in, and saw her hiding in a dark corner—I called her out, and said, "My master wants you"—she said, "What for? I am going to see my mother at the workhouse, and if I am not there soon I shall be too late"—I took her back; the pawnbroker's assistant came to my master's shop, and said in her presence, "Look what this woman has left," holding a blue bag in his hand—the constable turned it out into the scale, and there was a lot of money in it—Stanley <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> at it, and said, "You shall not have them all, you b----s." <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN GURR</hi>. I am assistant to Sill and Moore's, pawnbrokers, of Exmouth Street—I was there when the woman came in, and saw her put her hand under a petticoat which was on the counter—somebody said, "I want you"—I turned over the petticoat, and saw a little blue bag rolled up—I asked if it belonged to anybody, the officer turned it out, and it was counterfeit coin—I also found two sixpences wrapped in a piece of rag where she had been standing—I handed them to the officer.</p>

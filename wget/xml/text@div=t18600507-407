                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman, of White Conduit-street, Pentonville—on 18th March, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was going along South Conduit-street, Bethnal-green, arm in arm with my wife—I saw the prisoner and two others coming towards me; I made way for them to pass—on their coming up, one of the prisoner's companions made a blow at my head, which was stayed by the rim of my hat, and the prisoner made a grasp at my watch, which was in my waistcoat pocket—he did not get it; he got hold of my waistcoat, and I felt a sharp tug at my pocket—on that I turned round and there was my brother-in-law—he tried to secure the prisoner, and we were surrounded by a great number of men and boys—the others escaped—the policeman came up and I went into the next street and pointed out the prisoner—the moment I charged him he knocked the officer down, and either he or his companions knocked me down—a large crowd was collected—I was knocked down and lost my breath.</p>

             sworn. - I keep an earthenware and broker's shop, and deal in old iron, in Windmill-street; the prisoner came to my house about one o'clock in the day, and asked me if I bought old iron; I told him I did, if it was their own.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you told him that? - A. Yes; he said, it was his own, and I told him not to bring it unless it was; I gave him five farthings a pound for it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the full value of it, I take it for granted? - A. Yes; we do not get three halfpence a pound for it ourselves.</p>

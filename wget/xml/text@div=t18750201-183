                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live with my father, Mr. Hands, a boot and shoe maker, of 39, Church Street, Woolwich—on the night of 19th December my father went to bed early; I went to bed about 12.30—before going to bed I went round the house and saw that it was all securely fastened—about 1 o'clock I heard a noise as of footsteps of more than one person downstairs in the parlour and shop—I lighted a, candle and went downstairs in time to see some one disappear out of the parlour window, which was wide open—I saw thirteen or fourteen pairs of boots lying on the parlour floor in a sheet which had been on a clothes horse in front of the fire in that room—a chair was knocked down by the window, which might have been done by a person getting in or out—from the shop I missed about thirty pairs of boots—my father came down and we called "Police!" and "Murder!"—the prisoner came up to us and said "What is the matter, what have you lost?"—I pushed him into the road and said I believed he was one of them and I should know him again—he appeared to be out of breath, as if he had scrambled up—the window had been opened by a knife being slipped in between the sashes, and pushing the catch back—I saw a pair of boots produced before the Magistrate, they were my father's; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them, there is a mark of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the corner of the toe, I can recognise them as a pair that were lost.</p>

I live at 5, Martyn's Passage, Woolwich—the prisoner has lived with me—I remember his asking me to give him some money—I always gave him money—he never went out without a shilling or two in his pocket from me—on one occasion I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I had just previously given him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was a fortnight or three weeks before Christ<lb></lb>mas—I gave him 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Sunday night—I remember his being away one evening and coming back to me with a soldier—he had been with me up to 12 o'clock the night before—I was ironing, and he was giving me the irons from the fire when the police came and said he wanted him, and he went with the police—he was let go then—about a week after that he said to me "I took a sheet off the horse, and if the chair had not been tipped over, and he could have got away, he should have made a good job of it"—this was three or four days after the robbery—I said well, if it was him, if I could find it out any way in the world, if it was my own father, I should <hi rend="italic">round</hi> upon him—I remember his cutting up a boot and mending his own with it as he sat in my back kitchen with the soldier—I did not see any other boots.</p>

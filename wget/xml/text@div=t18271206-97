            . I live at Aberdeen. The prisoner lodged at my house, and left on the 3d of November, and took his passage to London; and next day, when I cleaned myself for church, I missed my watch from a chest of drawers in the room he slept in; he sailed that day. - I came to London, and gave information at the Thames Police.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information I went on board a smack in the Thames, and saw the prisoner; I asked what he had done with the watch which he took from Aberdeen; he said he had taken no watch; I found this watch in his fob.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I had bought it? A. He did, to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to WILLIAM MATTOCKS. Q. Can you swear I stole it? A. It is mine; he was only three days with me: he came from America.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought it of a shipmate who lodged in the house, a quarter of an hour before I came away. Witness. There were two lads lodged in the house; one of them came home drunk that night, and said, "Bill is off with the watch." The prisoner had not seen me use it; his shipmate could get to the room.</p>

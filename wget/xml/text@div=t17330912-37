On the 27th of June, I went out about 7 in the Evening with a young Lady, whom I nurse for my Lord Albemarle, and left my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173309120018"></xptr> Goods and Money lock'd up in a Deal-box in my Chamber, I return'd in about half an Hour, when the Prisoner was gone; my Box was broke open, and 4 gold Rings, 4 Handkerchiefs, 4 Suits of Head-Clothes, 4 pair of Russles, a pair of Stays, and 34 Guineas were taken away. She was taken about 4 a Clock next Morning at the World's-End, at Newington-Butts. My Rings were found upon her, and my Money in her Pocket, which she deliver'd, and confess'd were mine.</p>
               <p>- Philips. I was in the Square with the Nurse and the young Lady. When we return'd, and Mrs. Cope found she had been robb'd, I went among the Hackney-Coachmen, and enquir'd if they knew who had carry'd such a Fare. By eleven at Night, I found the Coachman, who told me, that he took up such a Person in Brook-street, and carry'd her to the Vine Tavern in Holbourn, where she treated him. Thence he drove her to London-Bridge, where she bought two gold Rings, and after that to the World's-End. I went to the World's-End after her, and saw her and a Man in their Shifts at the Window, but as soon as they perceiv'd me, they shut the Sash down, and the Man and Woman of the House came in their Places, and ask'd What I wanted? I told them my Business, and they said there was no Body in the House but themselves. But when I got in, I took the Prisoner and the Man in the Yard, as they were getting over the Pails. How do you do, Nanny? says I. Fellow, says she, I know you not. And at the same Time I perceived she was fumbling with her Fingers, to get the Rings off. I call'd a Watchman, and searching her, found 31 Guineas, a half Crown, and 3 s. 6 d. in her Pocket. I ask'd her whose Money that was? and she answer'd, What's that to you, Fellow? But next Morning she own'd, that the Money, the Rings, a Necklace, and other Things that were found upon her were all her Mistress's.</p>

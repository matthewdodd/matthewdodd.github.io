               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went to get a goose? A. Yes, at Leadenhall-market; I was sober and collected as I am now - I consider that I was sober: I had had a glass or two to drink - Mr. Montague bought the goose for me; I did not give him the money to buy it- he brought it in, and I paid him for it; he is the landlord of the Poulterers' Arms - I told him I had come for a goose, and he went out and bought it; I had a drop of bitters, and each one round who thought proper to take some were welcome - he could not refuse to serve me with spirits, because I did not ask him; he did not refuse to serve me - it being Christmas time I had a buttock of beef to give to my customers; I had not opportunities to cook it at home, so I took it to my sister's that day - I dined at the Swan, and had a drop of porter; I did not stop after four o'clock the first time - I was not drinking there all day; I was sober when I left, and I consider I was sober at ten o'clock at night - I went to the Swan after Godfrey had been searched, but that was after ten; I consider I was sober then - I had never bought a goose, and thought Mr. Montague was a better judge than I was; I was so confused about the money that I do not recollect whether I drank at the Swan after ten o'clock - if I was drunk then I am now; I went to acquaint my sister with it - to make short of it, I did not take any thing into my lips; I was not drinking with Ray, the officer, at the Swan - the prisoner was there, but I did not drink with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember going to the Poulterers' Arms on the 29th of December, and seeing Lewis, the waterman, there? A. I was there once since: it might be on that day - I saw two persons there, but I did not know their names; they came in while I was there - I did not say, in their presence that I had hoped that some of Godfrey's friends would give me 5l. to settle the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean you said there that you felt the prisoner's hand in your pocket? A. I mean to swear that it was so; I said so at the watch-house, and before the Lord Mayor - to cut the matter short, I did say it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to swear that you recollect saying so at the watch-house? A. I have not a correct recollection, but I have not the least doubt that it was so.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you say at the watch-house that you felt his hand in your pocket? A. I do not exactly recollect; I might not have been asked the question.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say so before the Lord Mayor? A. Yes, I did say so; my deposition was read over to me, and I am pretty sure I signed it - the question was asked, "Do you recollect Godfrey's hand being in your pocket?" and I said Yes - I should not have let Godfrey go, but he got out before I could get down stairs.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How did you know that it was his hand from your brother-in-law's? A. He had hold of my right arm, - he let my arm go, and put his hand into my pocket; a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050070"></xptr>young man named Atterton had hold of my left arm - my brother-in-law was not in the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then what did you mean by stating before the Lord Mayor that the prisoner and your brother-in-law were taking you up stairs? A. Because I told them I would not go to bed; when I felt his hand in my pocket I said, "Godfrey has got his hand in my pocket."</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you say any thing to this effect, that you would not have kicked a 5l. note out of doors if any of the prisoner's friends had sent it to settle the business? A. I have no recollection of any such a word; Mr. Montague told me at the bar, "You were drunk that night when you came to buy the goose," and I said, "Then I am drunk now;" I had a glass or two that night after I met Mr. Montague - I suppose I had four or five glasses; I do not know the two Lewis' by name - some men wanted to kick up a quarrel with me (looking at two persons); yes, these are the men - I did not say before them that I would not have kicked a 5l. note out of doors if any of the prisoner's friends had sent it to settle the prosecution; I do not recollect any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever had a proposal made to you, or have you ever made a proposal to any one else that this matter should be settled for 5l.? A. I have not; the Lord Mayor said if the money was not made up he would commit him for trial.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to the White Hart on the evening of the 24th of December, on the subject of this charge; I found the prisoner standing before the fire in the tap-room - I searched him, and found only two halfpence on him; I rather think he was the worse for liquor - the prosecutor appeared to have been drinking a little, but he was not to say drunk at the time; about twelve o'clock the same night I went to the White Swan, where the prisoner lodges - he was in bed; I awoke him, and asked what money he had - he said four or five shillings, which he had received from his master; I do not think he was more drunk then than when I saw him at the White Hart; I desired him to put on his clothes, but I had before examined his pockets, in the presence of the landlord, and found 4s. 6d. in silver, 4d. in halfpence, and two sovereigns - I asked where he got the sovereigns; he said he could not tell, he had no knowledge at all of them, nor how they came there - I took him to the watch-house; he remained there an hour and a half or two hours - I asked him again if he knew or recollected any thing about the sovereigns; he said No, somebody must have put them there for a lark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it true that the Lord Mayor told the prisoner if the money was not made up he would commit him? A. He said, "If it is not made up by Thursday, I will commit you for trial;" the prisoner did not appear drunk when I awoke him - I do not consider he was drunk; the prosecutor, said in his presence, that he had his hand in his pocket, and he said so before the Lord Mayor - I think I heard his deposition read over, but I do not remember whether I did or not; I will not swear whether Mr. Hobler called me, and read the deposition to me or not - Mr. Hinsley was at the Mansion-house, and was examined the first day,</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was it after you desired your husband to go to bed that the prisoner got about him and hugged him? A. Yes; I did not go up till I saw the prisoner going out- I told Godfrey not to cuddle my husband; I said he did not want to be cuddled - I thought he was going to take the money; I knew my husband had money, but did not know what - he will not let me interfere with his money.</p>

            . I am a publican, and live in Swan-lane. I know nothing of the robbery, but was present when the prisoner was searched in his bed-room, between twelve and one o'clock - he said he could not account for any more than 5s., which his master gave him, and 1s. 6d. he had from his father; that he did not know how the money came in his clothes, somebody had been playing a lark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was found on him? A. Two sovereigns, 4s. 6d. in silver, and 4d. in copper - he lodged in my house, and was a regular steady boy, as far as I know - he was rather fresh, but knew what he was about; he was not tipsy, nor was he sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The money that was found in my pockets I know nothing at all about, no further than the few shillings which my master and my father gave me.</p>

            . I keep the Poulterers' Arms, Leadenhall-market. I saw Fearon and these other young men on Christmas-eve; they came to my house about a quarter before seven o'clock, and went away about half-past seven - I bought a goose for Fearon: they had three glasses of bitters each; I had one, and would not have any more - they wanted more spirits, but I refused to serve them, for Fearon and the prisoner were tipsy; the other young man was not - I said, "Fearon, I will drink no more with you, and serve you no more, for you are tipsy, go home and go to bed; I consider you have had quite sufficient;" - he said he would take my advice, and he went out; it was my fair conscientious opinion that they were so tipsy, I ought not to serve them any more - I saw Fearon at my house one evening in the ensuing week; I think it was on Thursday - he said,"I wish I had nothing to do with this case, it is a pity but Godfrey's friends had settled it, for the Lord Mayor allowed it to be settled; and if they had sent a 5l. note, I would not have kicked it out of doors;" he said, "I am as drunk now as I was then" - I said "You are not, you was very tipsy then, but I don't think you are now;" it did not appear a tipsy observation, that he would not have kicked a 5l. note out of doors - and I made the reply, if the young man was innocent, it was a pity he should pay it, and if not, he deserved to be punished.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure that you observed to them that they were tipsy? A. Yes, I am; I said it three or four times - Fearon knocked Godfrey's hat off, and put his arm through the crown of it - I suppose he was at my house a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before I bought the goose; two persons of the name of Lewis, and a friend of his, and his wife, were present when he was talking about the 5l. note.</p>

            . I am a waterman and lighterman. On the 24th of December, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I saw the prisoner Fearon, an officer named Ray, and a woman, in the Old Swan, drinking; there were others in company with them - some of them went out to see a wager on the river, but Ray, the woman, and Fearon, staid behind; I did not see the prisoner then - I saw the prisoner and Fearon at the Poulterers' Arms in Leadenhall-market, with another man, about seven o'clock - Fearon was very drunk indeed; I was at the Poulterers' Arms on the following Thursday, between eight and nine o'clock -I saw the prosecutor there; my brother was present - I heard the prosecutor say he hoped some of Godfrey's friends would have settled this prosecution, for if they had, he would not have kicked a 5l. note out of doors.</p>

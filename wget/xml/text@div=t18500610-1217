                  </hi>. I am in the employ of John and James Stevens, in Bridge-road, Southwark. The prisoner was in their employ—he left rather better than twelve monthsago, directly after this happened—it was his duty to execute any orders he received, to take the materials and book them to the number that corresponded with the order—to take them from the warehouseman—he was to do any job that he was ordered to do—the account was sent in for this work—it was not paid.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185006100173"></xptr>
               <p>—the orders are generally given to the warehouseman—I do not gene-rally go to see the work done; I go sometimes, if there is anything worth notice—a man named Rainer was in our employ, as a labourer—I believe when a labourer was out at work, if there was a material wanted, he came and fetched it—the foreman had the charge of hiring any labourer—when the men or the labourer bring back any goods, the warehouseman, Mr. Baker, takes them in—perhaps at that time we had thirty or forty men—the pri<lb></lb>soner left of his own accord—we seat a policeman after him—a reward has been offered for him for twelve months—I do not keep the books; I some<lb></lb>times take the money—I superintend the whole concern—I have seen the prisoner drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman in the employ of Messrs, Stevens; it is my duty to give out to the gas-fitters anything required for the job they are employed in. I recollect the prisoner being in their service—I gave him some tin pipe twelve months ago—he told me it was to do work at the British and Foreign School—about twenty-four feet of pipe was delivered to him on 20th and 21st Feb., 1849—I have not seen any of those articles since—I have seen a bill which refers to them—I did not hear any<lb></lb>body speak to him as to what had become of those goods, but I know he was sent back to point out where the goods were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you keep a book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have the charge of the warehouse, and enter everything that goes out and that comes back—I do not make mistakes—I have not had accounts constantly sent back with mistakes—I had one sent back from Mr. Morley's, in Wood-street, but it was not my error, but that of the person who measured the work—I am hardly ever absent when the men bring the work back—every inch of pipe that is brought back is put down—I have not frequently, when things have been brought back, omitted to put them down—these things were taken partly by Rainer, and partly by the prisoner—Rainer is here—they were never brought back—the men bring back what they do not use from various jobs, and they are taken off the bill—I have the bill here and the day-book—Mr. Williams receives money, and Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Scales—Mr. Scales is not here—this is the book in which I entered the things I supplied the prisoner with—here is the place where he asked me for materials to work at the British and Foreign School—it was on 20th Feb., 1849—that was the first day we supplied him with anything for that job—he had 12 ft. 5 in. of 18 in. pipe.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Here seems to be an erasure here; you make mis<lb></lb>takes in your books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; this word double is written on an erasure—I cannot see an erasure where this 12 is—here is an erasure—the whole of this is on an erasure—these alterations were made afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What else is entered beside the pipe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One 3/4 in. union, one 3/4 T, four screws, and other things—I heard the prisoner say at the Court that he got drunk and lost it—this paper is the writing of Mr. Taylor, our clerk—I do not see that there are any screws in it—the next article is half-inch union-pipe—here is twelve inches in one of these books, and twelve in the other—one of these is the Tuesday's-book, and while the clerk is posting one, I use the other—I do not copy from one book into the other—this is the Tuesday's book; things go from hence into the journal—Wednesday's work is put in this other book—I swear 1 delivered these things myself to the prisoner or his labourer; I will not swear to which—I cannot tell how much I delivered to the prisoner.</p>

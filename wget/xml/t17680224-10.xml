            . Mr. Wyld and I had the pimento in charge, it is what is called pepper; about half an hour past five o'clock the prisoner was standing by the bags, I asked him what he was doing there; he said, nothing; I found one of the bags cut, and a good parcel of the pepper lying on the ground; there was also a bag with about five pounds and a half in it lying by the prisoner; that bag did not belong to Mr. Paumier; I had seen the bags not above six minutes before, they were all right then, and none cut.</p>

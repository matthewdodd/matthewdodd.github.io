                  </hi>. I am a draper, residing at 3, Cambridge Terrace, Woolwich—on Monday night, 20th September, I was in the Freemasons' Tavera, at Woolwich, from 11 to 12 o'clock—the prisoner and deceased were there—they were quarrelling—they went out to fight two or three times and came in again—I went out the last time, hearing a scuffle—they were then in the middle of the road—I saw the prisoner strike Smith, I could not say where being dark, and a lot of people about—they both went down, Beasley was uppermost—I believe I saw him strike Smith while he was down, but I don't feel quite certain about it—Smith seemed very much hurt; he did not get up, and he was carried to the side of the public-house—I ran inside, and got some brandy for him—I believe I told the sergeant where he lived, and he was taken home.</p>

I was on duty near the Freemason's Arms, Woolwich, on Monday night, 20th September, about 12 o'clock—seeing a crowd of persons, I went up, and found the deceased lying on the payment, against the railings of the house, insensible—he was very ill, and under the influence of drink—I got four men to help me carry him to the divisional surgeon—he attended to him, and said there would be no harm; he would be safe till the next morning—he was then charged with being drunk and incapable—he was discharged by the Magistrate next day—I afterwards saw him dead—I took the prisoner into custody—I was referred to him at the time as having struck the man, and he said, "It leryea him right; he is not so bad as he pretends to be; he is only acting the goat"—when I took him into custody he said he had heard of it, and he was very sorry to hear it.</p>

I am a surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the deceased we received there on 22nd September—he was suffering from symptoms of injury to the brain—he died the following morning—on making a post-mortem examination, I found a fracture at the base of the skull—being thrown violently on the pavement would be likely to cause such an injury.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

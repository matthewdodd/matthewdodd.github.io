                  </hi>. I am assistant to a chemist and druggist, in Lawrence Pountney-lane. I know the prisoner—last Monday night, about eight o'clock, as I was leaving the warehouse, she fired at me with a pistol, the contents of which I received in my left thigh—I saw the flash of the pistol—it was nearly dark in the situation I was in—she was about two yards, or two yards and a half from me, I could see the figure of a female—a gentleman who had left the warehouse a minute or two before me saw her turn round and fire the pistol, and seized the prisoner immediately—I did not see him seize her, as I went into the warehouse and shut the door—about twenty shots entered the cuticle of my thigh, most of which dropped out as I undressed myself—they had penetrated my trousers, and just buried themselves in my skin—they are all out now—most of the others worked out in my way home—when I arrived at home I had only one left, which was very easily extracted with my finger and thumb—I applied a lancet—I rode home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Trinity-square, Borough—I bled a little, but not much—I am not disabled at all—I felt a little stiffness, which caused me to walk a little lame, but nothing at all serious—the wound was very superficial—the</p>

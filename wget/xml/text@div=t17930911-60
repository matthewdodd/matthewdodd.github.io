               <p>Mr. Knowlys The other woman was bailed, was she? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. To any other person then you might have sold this quantity of muslin that is stated in the indictment before this happened, before the prisoner came into the shop, in the course of that day? Don't you understand what I mean? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had a great deal of muslin in your shop in the course of that day for sale; you say you don't know what quantity might have been sold in the course of that day; therefore whether the quantity stated in the indictment might be sold or no, you don't know? - No.</p>

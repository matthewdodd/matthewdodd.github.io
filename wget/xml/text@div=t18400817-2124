                  </hi>. I live in Southampton-street, Covent-garden—the prisoner was my shopman for five or six years. On the morning of the 13th of August I went into the shop to look at the slate on which he en<lb></lb>tered what he sold—there was an entry of only one spade, and he gave me the money for it—he was employed to receive money in my shop—I after<lb></lb>wards saw at Mr. Cousins's shop two spades with my mark—I got Mr. Cousins to go back to my shop—he said that he bought the two spades there, and paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—the prisoner admitted that he had done so, and said, that having lost half-a-crown of his own, the night previous, he had taken the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and intended to replace it—on going back to the coun<lb></lb>ter I found he had put 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on my desk.</p>

The Prisoner did not deny the having the Watch, but produc'd it voluntarily as the Bar, and offer'd to deliver it to the Court, but they order'd it to be return'd to her. She pleaded, That she took the Watch for Money the Prisoner had had of her, and that she told the Prosecutor so at the same Time. That he had deluded her, and she was with Child by him: That the Reason of this Indictment being laid against her by the Prosecutor was, because she having sworn the Child to him, he was taken up, and oblig'd to give Security. To prove this, she call'd her Father, who depos'd, That the Prosecutor lodg'd at his House, and pretending he was a Person of Substance, had 200 l. in Money, and an Estate of 80 l. a Year, had deluded his Daughter; and that he having set his Daughter up in a Chandler's Shop, the Prisoner, as he afterwards heard, us'd to keep her Company: And that being now oblig'd to give Security, had prosecuted his Daughter for stealing his Watch.

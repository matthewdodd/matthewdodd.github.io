Cox and Merle's, in Little-Britain; I saw them, and knew them to be the same.</p>
               <p>NATHANIEL PHILLIPS sworn. - I am an apprentice to Mr. Riley; I know the tongs to be the same that I mended on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BENNETT sworn. - I am servant to Messrs. Cox and Merle's, refiners, in Little-Britain: On the 19th of January, the prisoner brought me a pair of silver sugar-tongs to sell as old silver; I supposed him to have come by them regularly; I had known him many years, he kept a silversmith's shop, in Barbican, and I did not know but he was a master at that time; about half an hour after I had purchased them, a servant of Mr. Riley's came to me, to know if I had bought a pair of old fashioned tea tongs that morning; I told him, I had, and shewed them to him; I have had them ever since. (The witness produced the tongs, which were identified by all the other witnesses.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have only to say, that of late years my mental faculties have been much impaired, but I hope the evidence that will appear to my character, will operate in my favour.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18020217-8-verdict37" type="verdictDescription">

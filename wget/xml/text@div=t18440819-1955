                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Bride-terrace, Liverpool-road, Islington. I know Mr. Glenn, a builder—I have been in the habit of lending him money, from time to time, for the purpose of his business—the prisoner came to me about half-past four o'clock on Saturday the 20th of July—I did not know him—he came with Mr. Glenn's compliments, and I was to send all the cash I had got—I told him I had got very little cash that day, for I had given change to three different gentlemen for three checks, but what I had got I would send—I opened my cash-box—I had got a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, four sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns, which I gave him, and said, "That is all I have got"—he said, had I not better take the number of the note—I said I did not see that that would be of any use—there was a piece of paper lying on the counter—I said, "You may as well give me an acknow<lb></lb>ledgment on this piece of paper, it will be just the same"—he said, certainly, he would do that—I looked at it, and he had not put his name—I said, "You may as well put your name," which he did, and went away—in consequence of some suspicion, I told my son to watch where the prisoner went, and I kept him in sight the whole of the time—it is a long line of road—he went into no house—it is in the same road where Mr. Glenn lives—he did not go in there, but he went by—my son was about a hundred yards before me—I did not hear him speak to the prisoner—the prisoner turned back to me after my son spoke to him—I then said that Mr. Glenn had not sent him for the money, for he was not at home—the prisoner then said, "I know that; I have left him in the City; he told me to make haste home, and get all the cash I could for him against he came home"—I said, "You give my money back; I will not let you have it; I will give it to Mr. Glenn when he comes home"—: he gave me the money and I left him—I have the number of the note in his own handwriting—the Magistrate said I had no occasion to keep the note—the prisoner gave me back the whole of the money wrapped up, just as I had given it to him.</p>

As I was coming home I called at a public-house to get it changed, as the clerk asked me to get small change; I could not get it there; I was going to another public-house at the corner of Mr. Glenn's yard, when Mr. Laurence came up and said he would give the money himself to Mr. Glenn; I gave the money up to Mr. Laurence without any hesitation.</p>

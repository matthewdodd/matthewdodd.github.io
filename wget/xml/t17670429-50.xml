            . I live at the lower end of Red Lion-street, Holborn. Going home on the 18th of February, about twelve at night, in <placeName id="t17670429-50-crimeloc276">Great James-street, Bedford-row</placeName>

I said he had better go about his business, for I would not be robbed; I had a cane in my right hand, but he being too near me I could not strike him with it. I took him a blow with my left hand on the right shoulder, and drove him from me; then I struck him two blows with my cane, which drove him into the middle of the street; he recovered himself, and took to his heels and ran away. I called out, Watch, stop thief; he ran down into the King's-road, and down Gray's-inn-lane; I followed him. We imagined he had got into the field and gave the pursuit over, but coming back, in the King's-road, two watchmen had got him. He fell on his knees and begged I would forgive him, saying he did not intend to hurt me, the pistol not being charged; I said that would be a circumstance in his favour; he told me he threw it down into an area; upon searching it was found, and not charged. He confessed the fact, and said he was very sorry. He had a painted nose on, which was afterwards found in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I live in Shadwell—the prisoner keeps an oyster-stall at the top of the street where I live—I gave her a shilling to give to Michael Dolphin—I afterwards asked her to get it back from him—she said she had been two or three times and she would not trouble herself any more about it—we had a few words, and she struck me on my head with her knife—it cut my head, but very trifling—I hit her two or three blows afterwards, and she did not repeat it—that was on Saturday, 9th Sept.—on Saturday, the 15th, I was standing in Peel-alley talking to a man, be<lb></lb>tween four and five o'clock—the prisoner came up to me—I had not said anything to her then—she spat in my face—she went into the house at the corner, and came out again and came up to me—I asked her what she meant</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184909170076"></xptr>
               <p>by spitting in my face—I spoke rather rash to her—she said she would do for me, and she took a knife from her pocket and stabbed it in my arm, and ran across the road—this was in the street in which she was in the habit of keeping her stall, but she had no stall at that time—my arm bled—she ran into the house opposite—she came to the window of the house and said she was sorry it went into my arm only, and did not <hi rend="italic">go</hi> into my heart—I had not followed her about or abused her at all—I had not seen her since that night week—I had not torn her bonnet—I believe her bonnet fell off in the street as she ran across the road after she had stabbed me—I had not touched her in any way before she stabbed me, but no doubt she did it in a passion—I hope you will look over it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> On the Saturday she struck me while I was serving my customers, and said, "Will you go for the shilling?" I said, "I have been several times and the man won't give it me;" she said, "If it were your own you would go after it; I will serve you out;" she was abusing me, and Mrs. Wells came to the door and spoke to the policeman, and got her removed, and then she took my shawl and twisted it; the next day she followed me into the passage and said, "Come out you b—y wretch; I will serve you out;" I had my vinegar-bottle and the oyster-knife in my hand, and the moment I came out she laid hold of me and tore my bonnet. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not, on my oath—I laid hold of her afterwards and her bonnet fell off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I ran into the house after she took hold of my bonnet and cap; I said to the woman of the house, "For God's sake let me come in till the policeman comes;" she shut the door, went up stairs, and called for the police-man; the prosecutrix and a lot more were about the door; I did not stab her; she ran after me; I put my two hands up to put her out, and her arm came in contact with the door as I put her out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No; she stabbed me before she ran into the passage. <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES MALIN</hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 99). On Saturday afternoon, 15th Sept. I was sent for to Peel-alley—I found the prosecutrix bleeding very much from a wound in the arm—she pointed out the prisoner, who was standing at the door of No. 1, Peel-alley, and told me what she had done—I took the prisoner, and asked her how she came to stab her—she said, "What does she come and abuse me for, and tear my bonnet"—I said, "Where is the knife that you stabbed the woman with?"—she put her hand into her pocket, pulled out this knife, and said, "This is the knife I stabbed her with; "and in going to the station she said, "I am sorry I did not put it into her b—y heart."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I said, "She says I stabbed her with a knife; this is the only knife I have."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No; she said, "This is the knife I stabbed her with." <hi rend="smallCaps">DANIEL ROSS</hi>. On Saturday afternoon last, the prosecutrix came to my surgery—I examined her, and found a wound on her left fore-arm, about an inch deep, and passing about two inches upwards towards the elbow—such a knife as this is likely to have caused the injury—it entered straight, and then the arm must have been moved, and it turned towards the elbow—I have known the prisoner from a child—I never heard any thing against her. <hi rend="smallCaps">MARY OLLEY</hi>. I did not know where she was going to stab me—I put my left arm up, and received the blow in my arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Dejence.</hi> I deny all knowledge of stabbing her; she was always annoying me wherever she met me.</p>

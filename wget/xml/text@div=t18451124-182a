                  </hi>. I am toll-keeper of the Charing-cross suspension-bridge. I was on duty there on the 24th of Oct.—the prisoner came between four and five o'clock to pass over the bridge—the toll is a halfpenny for each person—there was a young female with her—the prisoner gave me half-a-crown to pay for them both—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out, the fare of the two being a penny—I believe the money I gave her was good—immediately after she threw me down a shilling, and said, "Give me another for that"—I saw it was a bad one—I took her into the toll-house and detained her a few minutes—I put the shilling she gave me on a slab beside me, and while I was in the act of taking toll of another person who was going over, the prisoner laid hold of the counterfeit shilling and swallowed it—I never gave her a good one in its place, because I was confident I did not give it her—she said, "Now, what can you do, where is the piece?"—she had heard me send for an officer—let her go—I was standing on the bridge, and she walked over.</p>

I keep the White Hart, in College-street, Belvidere-road—on the 24th of Oct. the prisoner came, called for half a quartern of gin, and gave me a good half-crown—I gave her the half quartern of gin, and gave her one shilling, two sixpences, and fourpence in copper—the shilling I gave her was one of George the Third's—I know that because she had paid me a visit about two months before, and I took particular notice of the coin I gave her—I swear it was a George the Third shilling I gave her—she then measured out the gin, gave part of it to her female friend, and spilled a good deal of it—she gave the rest to a person behind—she did not drink any herself—she then said to the person behind her, speaking of an old man that was there, "How much he is like my father, I will treat him to some gin"—she was, I should say, conveniently drunk—she knew what she was doing—I should say she was not drunk—she called for some more gin, and threw down a William the Fourth shilling—I took it up, and it was bad—whilst I was considering what I should do, Mr. Cook came in and spoke to me—I cannot tell whether the prisoner heard him or not—I said I had taken a bad shilling of her, and Cook said, "I will fetch a policeman"—the policeman came in, and I said I believed she had got the money still in her mouth that I gave her—there was some money in her mouth—when I gave her the good silver she put it into her mouth—she opened her mouth and said, "Look here"—the policeman immediately grabbed hold of her neck, and tried to make her eject it, I should imagine, and she appeared as if swallowing the good money—I was present when her mouth was opened, but I did not see anything in it—I gave the William the Fourth shilling to the policeman.</p>

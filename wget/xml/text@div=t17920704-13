He came up to me, and caught me by the collar, and stopped me, pulled me down, and took me up again, and took away my watch: I ran after him down Parker's Lane; a gentleman knocked up his heels, and before he got up, I took him: he never was out of my sight, nor as far off as I am from you: a boy picked up the watch, who is here. The prisoner asked me where I was going; I said I was going home, what was that to him; so he made no more to do but pushed me down, and pulled me up again, and took away my watch.</p>

               <p>About a quarter past ten I heard a rattle sprang; I ran and assisted to apprehend the prisoner; the prosecutor and the watchman had hold of him: in a few minutes after, a little boy came in and deposited the watch with the keeper of the watch-house.</p>
               <p>VALENTINE RUMLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am watch-house-keeper of St. Giles's in the Fields. I produce the watch; I received it from the landlord belonging to this little boy, as the boy was so young,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179207040019"></xptr>and his parents poor, he thought it would not be safe; I think the boy was with him at the time.</p>
               <p>(A little Boy set up.)</p>
               <p>Court. How old are you? - Twelve years old this summer.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the nature of an oath? - No.</p>
               <p>Court, Do you know what it is you are called upon to speak when you swear? - I do not know the nature of an oath.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether it is right or wrong to tell lies? - I will speak what is truth.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it right or wrong to tell a lie? - It is not a lie.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it right or wrong for any body to tell a lie? - It is not right.</p>
               <p>(Sworn.)</p>
               <p>Court. Now mind you are sworn to tell the truth, that is, you appeal to God, that what you say is truth. - Yes. I was in my shirt on the 31st of May. I live in Newtener's Lane, at a coal-shed, that goes into Cross Lane, and Cross Lane goes into Parker's Lane, and Parker's Lane goes into Queen-street. I ran down in my shirt; I heard the rattle sprung, and I saw this gentleman give charge of that man; and just as he took charge of him, a woman said,</p>
               <p>"May be you may find the watch." There was a good many looking besides me, and I looked and I found it laying between two tubs in Parker's Lane; I called out for our landlord, and gave it to him, for there were a whole parcel of blackguards about me; I thought they would take it from me, and our landlord carried it up to the watch-house, and gave it to that gentleman there.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>As I was going along, I had been of an errand, I heard a great cry of Stop thief! a gentleman came and knocked me down, and this man came up and said to me,</p>
               <p>"You rascal, you have robbed me!" I have not a soul; I have lately come from sea.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner for several years about the town, but not where her place of dealing was until I had information of Tuhoy. I went with Tuhoy to the house of Mr. M'Gibbs, in a passage leading from Fitzroy-market to Tottenham-court-road. I think it was on the 25th of May I was introduced to her by Tuhoy; we got in conversation; she gave me to understand that she served the person who owned the house with bad money; she agreed to serve me also; she said she sold two for one. She agreed to let me have five or six in the evening; she could not let me have more; Old Abel, the cutter, had got drunk and disappointed her. I have heard Abel talked of, he is a button-maker. She came in the evening to M'Gibbs in the court; she served me six counterfeit shillings; I gave her her a three shilling bank token. We had something to drink; these parties were there; I drank with them. She produced a quantity of bad shillings with rough edges, just as they came from the cutter. She then said I might have any quantity I wanted the next day. I met with her on the next day at M'Gibbs's, and then I gave information to the assistant solicitor of the Mint. Matthews was waiting on the opposite side of the way, and a son of mine was present too. I bought some more money of the prisoner. We thought of detecting her then. She was apprehended on Sunday the 28th.</p>

            . I am an officer. I accompanied Herbert and his son on both days when he went to the house of M'Gibbs; I staid at a public-house right opposite. I saw Herbert go in. On Sunday I apprehended the prisoner in Mortimer-street, Cavendish-square; her husband was with her; she nudged him and said, there is one of the Hatton Garden traps. I stepped up some steps of a gentleman's door; I saw her give a blueish rag in his hand, there appeared to be something wrapped in it. I came down the steps; they both ran away immediately; she ran into a public-house. When I got in she was having a glass of gin at the bar. I took her to the office. I went after the man; I met him in Tottenham-street. He came behind me and struck me. He threw a blue rag from him that was like the rag that had passed from the prisoner. Herbert gave me the money.</p>

            . Q. Look at the money, and tell me whether it is counterfeit or not - A. They are all counterfeits; they appear fresh, not to have been in circulation, and all of the same make.</p>

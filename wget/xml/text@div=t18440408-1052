                  </hi>. I live at No. 14, in the Strand. About the beginning of January I saw the two prisoners upon two occasions—they did not make any purchase on either occasion—the three rings now produced are my pro<lb></lb>perty—they have never been sold—I know they were in the stock some time ago, and that they have not been sold—no one but myself and partner sell—the prisoners saw rings on both occasions, and on the first occasion they saw trays containing 300 rings, among which were these—the policeman gave us information, and I saw them at Guildhall—we had not missed them up to that time.</p>

I am a butcher, carrying on business at Rusdon, in Northamptonshire—I know the prisoner—he keeps a beer-house at Newton Bromswald—he also keeps a couple of cows—on Saturday, the 6th Decem<lb></lb>ber, he came to me, bringing a dead cow in a cart—he told me it had been stuck, and had bled well—he asked me to dress it for him—I said my son should dress it—it was dressed—I saw the carcase afterwards—the prisoner was present on Monday morning—it had been, dressed on the Saturday night—it looked very thin and dark—the weather was very bad—I did not see any disease upon it whatever; and, being so thin, it would cause it to look very bad for that class of meat—all that class of meat, in hanging would naturally look very bad, and every day it hangs it looks very much worse—the weather made it look dark—the prisoner asked me if I could sell it for him—I said it was so very thin, I could not do anything at all with it—I sometimes sell thin meat as well at fat—he asked me then to send it to London—I said, "No; it won't do for London, it is so very thin, and looks bad from hanging"—I said it looked so thin and bad the inspectors would take it, or something of that sort; I cannot recollect the exact words—I said, "I dare not send it to London"—I told him if it was detected he was liable to six months—he said it should go up to London—I cannot say the words he made use of—he said he would take all responsibility upon him<lb></lb>self—it was packed by my son, in consequence of orders given me by the prisoner—it was consigned to Messrs. Bouser—I proposed sending it there, because he was my salesman—the prisoner was not present when I gave instructions to my son—I saw the prisoner again, on the Wednesday after the meat had been sent to London—I cannot all the exact words; we talked about it, and he said it was a bad job—I told him if he had been ruled by me he would not have sent it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of Meat to Newgate-market, and have been so for nearly three years—on 9th September, I saw a hamper of meat at Messrs. Bouser's, at about half-past 5—it was four quarters of a cow, less the briskets, which had been out off—it was wet, and very flabby, and emaciated; the flesh of it was very much inflamed and very dark—I could not tell what state the animal was in when it died, as there were no lungs or any of the inside—I should say it was decidedly not a healthy animal—it must have been suffering from some internal disease for a considerable time—it was not merely poor, it was diseased—it was decidedly unfit for human food, and that unfitness was decidedly apparent to any person who saw it—I should think it would have been apparent on the day before to any one.</p>

Bouser's shop, Newgate-market—it was four quarters of a cow, less the briskets—I examined it, and found it in a very wet state, I should apprehend, from disease; it was what in the trade is called a "wet 'un," generally the result of disease the general appearance of the meat indicated that the animal had been diseased—I can only indicate the wetness, and flabbiness, and general appearance altogether; to a practised eye it would be so—I doubt whether those indications would be apparent to a person who was not a butcher—when I saw the meat it was out of the hamper—I cannot tell who took it out—I did not see it taken out—in my opinion it was totally unfit for human food—I say so from its diseased state—there is</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know what being "blowed" is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do a little—several different things will make a cow "blowed"—I believe eating clover and drinking after it will do so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you had much experience with cows? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; very little—I know very little about cows being blowed—being blowed, I expect, is a stoppage of the gut, I suppose with wind—I do not know—I have heard of a knife being put into a cow, in a certain part, when it is blowed—I never saw it done.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Newton, Broomswald—I know the prisoner—I knew his cows; one calved—I do not know the date—I was working in my field on 6th September, and I was called in to look at the cow—it was afterwards killed—the prosecutor told me he thought it was blowed—I told him he had better have it killed, and I killed it there and then.</p>

I am a carrier—I am in Mr. Skinner's shop every day—I remember being there on Monday, 8th September, when there was a carcase hanging up there; I had the head of it—I did not buy it, he gave it me—I cut off part of the cheeks, and salted it, and the tongue and the roots I dined off the next day, with my family, my two sons, and daughters; it was good—it was thin, but it was sweet.</p>

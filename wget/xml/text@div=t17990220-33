               <p>Q.Was the door open? - A.It was a little open, just room enough to admit his arm, the swansdown laid upon the counter; I caried out, stop, he immediately snatched them off the counter, and ran off with them across the road towards the corner of Middle-row, I was not five yards behind him; he had ran about forty or fifty yards with five or six yards of swansdown hanging behind him; I saw him drop them; a gentleman of the name of Mason picked up the goods; I returned home with the goods, and Mr. Mason with me, the prisoner was pursued by another person; I saw the prisoner again in five or ten minutes, near the corner of Castle-street, in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say, that the man you saw carrying the swansdown was the prisoner? - A. No, I cannot; I can only say the prisoner is the man that was stopped; I delivered the swans-down to the officer, who has it in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us whether Mr. Quinby carried on business on his own account, or whether he had any partner? - A. He had no partner.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the shop part of his dwelling-house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. It communicated with that part of the house in which his family slept? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- MASON sworn. - On Thursday evening, the 7th of February, about six o'clock, upon hearing the cry of stop thief, as I was going up Holborn, I perceived a man running with these articles under his arm, four or five yards of it was dragging upon the ground; he was running from Southampton-buildings towards Middle-row; I was running, my foot slipped, it being frosty, upon the curb, or I think I should have caught him; he instantly dropped the goods at my feet, and I picked them up; he ran on past the wheel of a hackney-coach; when I picked up the pieces, I took them to Mr. Quinby's shop, and, in the course of a few minutes, the prisoner was brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the prisoner is that man? - A. From his appearance at the moment of his being brought back I believed it to be the man;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200030"></xptr>and I believe he is now; he had a black handkerchief round his neck, and a dark great coat on.</p>

             sworn. - On Thursday evening, about six o'clock, I heard, at the end of Middle-row, a cry of stop him, stop him; I saw the prisoner at the bar drop something, upon which he ran towards a hackney-coach that was passing towards Fleet-market, he passed as close to me as a person could possibly be; I had a parcel in my hand which I endeavoured to throw at his head, I missed him, and he passed me; then I saw him again, a few minutes afterwards, at Mr. Quinby's.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Harper.) Can you speak to the prisoner being the man you saw running? - A. He came close to me, and, from the light of three shops, I can undertake to swear that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his dress? - A. He had a loose coat on, buttoned, and something black about his neck, but what I cannot say.</p>

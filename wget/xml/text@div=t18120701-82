I lost these three brass lamps on the 21st of June, from out of a back room in my house. There came five of them togegether, between five and six in the morning. They went into the tap-room and called for a pint of beer. The two prisoners were of the party: after being there some minutes, Taylor came and asked me to let her go back wards. I went and opened the door for her, and, after some little while, she went out in the street, and a woman came and told me, she had taken something out with her. I sent a man out after Taylor; he brought back Spence. He turned her apron down, and there were a brass lamp. He went out again and brought back Taylor.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Clerkenwell. I was in the house at the time the two prisoners were there. I noticed Taylor to ask Mr. Guielack to go backwards. She did so. I saw her go out, and come back again. Soon after that, Mr. Guielack asked me to step out. He said, this good woman has told me, that I have been robbed. In about 20 or 30 yards from the place I overtook Spence. I brought Spence back, and took a lamp out of her pocket. The prosecutor said, it was his. She said, a woman gave it her. I then went into Love-court, Mutton-hill; I there saw Taylor: I took her to Spence, and Spence said, that was the person that gave her the lamp. A man in Love-court said, Taylor had been in the privy there. We found this lamp there. I took one lamp from Spence, and the other lamp was taken from between them both, as they sat in the parlour; and this one in the privy, after Taylor came out of the privy.</p>
               <p>JOHN CAREY. I saw Taylor come out of the privy, in Love-court, Mutton-hill. I went into the privy and found this lamp.</p>
               <p>JOHN HUTT. I know these lamps to be Mr. Guielack's property. I bought them, and fixed them for him.</p>

As I was walking along, with my wife holding my left arm, I felt something behind me, and my pocket moving: I instantly let go my wife's arm, and turned round quick; I perceived the prisoner behind my wife and me. On my turning round, he attempted to pass my wife; I laid hold of the prisoner by the collar; at that time my wife was alarmed. The prisoner said it was not him, it was that man. I had not spoke to the prisoner; there was no man near. My wife did not know what was the matter; I said he has picked my pocket, and there lies the handkerchief. I told my wife to pick my handkerchief up; she did, and gave it into my hands. I took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel your handkerchief go out of your pocket - A. I did; I did not see it in the prisoner's hand. There was no one near me at the time but the prisoner.</p>

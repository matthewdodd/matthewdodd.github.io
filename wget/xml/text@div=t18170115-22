I watched the prisoner, and suspected that he took some yarn away with him every night. On the 14th of December I went to Mr. Weaver's house, and saw a rug exposed for sale, which was made from my yarn; it was a particular kind of yarn. I compared it with my yarn, and it exactly matched. I got a search-warrant, and went with the officer to the prisoner's house, and found a quantity of yarn, and a sleigh in his room, which was mine; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150010"></xptr>more yarn in the cellar, which was also mine. I had often observed his pockets bulky. I manufacture my own yarn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I manufacture my yarn at Wolverhampton and Kidderminster. The prisoner lived with me two years. I believe he once sold carpets by commission.</p>

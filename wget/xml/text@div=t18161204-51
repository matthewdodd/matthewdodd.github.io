               <p>MARY FLYNN. I am the wife of Hugh Flynn; he is in Greenwich College; the things were taken out of a chest in the room adjoining where the prisoner slept; but there was no lock on the door. I lodge at No. 20, Maidenhead-court, Moor-lane. The prisoner came to my place on a Monday evening, after I had lost the things; I charged him with taking them, and he denied it; but at last he owned it, and gave me two duplicates; one was for my own gown, the other belonged to a person whose things are in my care. I gave the officer the duplicates.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer—I live at 74, Lower George-street, Sloane-square—on the morning of 23d July, at about 20 minutes to 3, I left the King's Arms, Chelsea, with my mate, Alfred Smith, and was going towards home—I had seen the prisoner in the King's Arms—he left at the same time, and walked along by the side of us—I did not speak to him—I and my mate went into the Cricketers, and the prisoner came in—we had half-a-pint of purl—then we came along the road towards home—when we came to Cook's ground, my mate, Alfred Smith, says, "Jim, I am taken so bad in my inside, dp not go far; I shall not be long;" he went away to ease him<lb></lb>self—the prisoner walked slowly on with me—seeing him in the dress of a lighterman, I asked him if he knew George Green, Phil Ellis, and one of the Coombs's—he said he knew <hi rend="italic">Phil</hi> Ellis—I whistled, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Al</hi>, what a while you are"—the prisoner said, "I know you have got some money, I will have your money or your life," and he up with his foot and kicked me in the privates—I stooped with the pain, and he thrust his hand in my waistcoat pocket, and then, into my trowser's pocket—I struggled with him, and he seized me by the throat; I did not fall down—I felt the pain for a week—after I had got his hands off my throat, he ran away down the King's-road—nearly opposite the turnpike, by Cook's ground, I met two policemen, and while they were asking what had occurred, up rused the prisoner behind me—this was about 20 yards from where he attempted to rob me—he came round the corner; he could not see that the policemen were so near.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-constable, V</hi> 347). I was on duty in the King's-road on the night of 23d July—I saw the prosecutor there at about 3 o'clock the next morning; he ran up to me from Cook's ground—the prisoner followed him directly across the road—it was just getting break of day, and they might have seen me from Cook's ground—the prosecutor told me the prisoner had kicked him in the privates, and while he had his hands down with the pain, the prisoner put his hands in his waistcoat pocket, but fortunately he had nothing there—he felt in great pain, and gave the prisoner into custody—the prisoner said nothing at all till I got very near the station, then he said the prosecutor had laid him a shilling on some<lb></lb>thing and he would have it—he bit my thumb, likewise my hand, and kicked my leg—he was drunk.</p>

No; she signified that she had lost her pocket or left it at home, I do not know which, and run away immediately; I pursued her and caught her, and brought her back with great difficulty; I got a porter in the market to assist me; she was taken to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Mr. Arabin. Before you took this from her hand, did you see any thing drop from her hand - A.

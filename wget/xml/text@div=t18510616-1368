                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 8, South Conduit-street, Bethnal-green; the prisoner is my son, and lived in Alfred-place, about ten minutes' walk from my house—he has been in the habit of visiting me, but I do not know whether he was aware of my having this tin box in my bedroom. On 15th May, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I went out, leaving the box</p>

               <p>locked, in my bedroom, and a cash-box in that, locked also, containing a few sovereigns—there was a milk-jug, a cup, a quart mug, some spoons, two pairs of sugar-tongs, and other things, which I forget now, as my memory is so bad, in the tin box—I came home about 11, and found the box gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in this house. On this night Mrs. Begarnie went out about 6 o'clock—the prisoner came about 9. and asked if his mother was at home—I said she was gone out; he wanted to know where to; I said I did not know; she had said she might be an hour, or she might be ten minutes—he waited at the door—I asked him to come into my room; he gave me no answer, but walked into the back-kitchen—I left, went up-stairs, and he called to me, that if Mr. Darwin came home he should be back in half-an-hour—I came down to him, and he had the tin box in his hand at the street-door, and I then saw Mrs. Begarnie's door open, but did not notice the lock till the police were sent for; I then saw that the woodwork was split, and the box of the lock had been forced—before the prisoner came, the door had been shut, and appeared safe—I went with the policeman to the prisoner's house, about 12 that night, and found him there, intoxicated—he was so when at our house, but not so bad—we found this tin box there (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

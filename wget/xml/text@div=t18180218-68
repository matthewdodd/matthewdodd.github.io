            . On the 17th of February, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was standing opposite the gateway of Mr. Bullock's house, in <placeName id="t18180218-68-crimeloc359">Cumberland-street, Portman-square</placeName>

I saw the prisoner, Ready, come up first, and observed his hands in his pocket - He had a loose coat on. He came into the street, went to the corner of Berkeley-street, stopped there, and looked over the corner of the railing towards the house. In about a minute, or a minute and a half, I saw Gossip come out of the area, and go up to him-his hands were also in his pocket-he had the same kind of coat on. I went over to Mr. Bullock's, went down the area-steps, and met Johnson, the butler, and told him. I lost sight of them. We both went in pursuit of the prisoners, and overtook Ready at the corner of Duke-street, Oxford-street, which is between a quarter and half a mile off. I had seen Gossip run down Somerset-street with him. While we were pursuing, they parted - I overtook Ready, and took him to the watch-house. As we went along, I saw him drop eight table-spoons - I heard them fall close to him - They were silver; Johnson picked up seven of them. I saw Ready searched at the watch-house, and eighteen silver forks, and two gravy-spoons found on him. I also saw twelve silver desert-spoons, and twelve silver forks found on Gossip- they said nothing.</p>

I saw some person take Gossip- I then ran after Ready, and saw him taken also- we took him to the watch-house. I saw eight table-spoons drop from his person- I am sure they dropped from him; I picked up seven of them. I knew them to be my master's, by the crest. I went to the watch-house, and saw eighteen large forks, and two gravy-spoons, found on him, which were Mr. Bullock's, and had his crest on them.</p>

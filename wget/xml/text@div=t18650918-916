                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, M.</hi>) On Saturday evening 2d September, the prisoner was brought to the station-house charged with causing the death of Sarah Ann Scott—as soon as the charge was entered, he said, "I will tell you all about it"—I cautioned him, and said, "Whatever state<lb></lb>ment you make, I will take down in writing, and it may be used against you"—I then wrote down what he stated—this is it (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>: "She was a widow woman; her husband has been dead about five years. She has lived with me four years. She had two children by her husband. We had no dispute. When I came in, I saw she was the worse for liquor. There was no fire. I said, "Why do not you get my tea?" She made some kind of mumbling noise. I could not tell what she said. I said, "Anyway you will suffer for this; it is not the first or second time you have served me so." While she was trying to light the fire I got out of temper, and struck her. When she fell I kicked her with my foot, and I think that the heel of my boot must have made the gash in her head, and caused her death—I then went into the yard, and when I came again into the house I found she had not moved. I lifted her up, and found she was immoveable. I found her life was gone from her. I laid her head on a small block of wood, and sent for a doctor by a next-door neighbour. I fancy she was led away by Mrs. Laptrern, living in No. 2, White's-grounds")—After I took that statement I read to him—he said, "That is quite correct"—he was detained at the</p>

               <p>station—I went to No. 3, White's-grounds, Bermondsey, and found the house in charge of a police-constable—it was a small house, only two rooms—I found the deceased on the ground-floor, lying in the middle of the floor—her head was on a small block of wood—I sent for two surgeons—Mr. Evans came—the deceased was quite dead at that time—I took off the prisoner's boots at the station—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I showed them to the surgeon—on the inner heel of the right boot, there was a small patch of matter, which the doctor said was blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the prisoner make the statement which you have read, voluntarily? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perfectly so—I did not put any question to him pre vious <hi rend="italic">to</hi> his making it, or make any observation—he was in the employ of Colonel Beresford, of Hartley's wharf—I did not find any duplicates in the room—some were afterwards handed to me by the prisoner's father—there was not much blood on the floor, only a patch about the size of a person's hand.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 308). On the night in question I was at the police-station on duty—from information I received I went with another constable to 3, White's-grounds—I found a Mrs. Gregory there—she let me in—I found the deceased lying on the floor, with her head resting on a small block of wood—she was dead—the prisoner was sitting at the back of her with her right hand in his—I said, "Who did this?"—the prisoner said, "I did"—I cautioned him to be careful of what he said, as anything he might say I should use against him before the magistrate—he said, "I want to tell you all; about a quarter to six I came home from work, I saw the de ceased sitting in front of the fire, beastly drunk, I asked her if she intended to get any tea to-night, she muttered something that I could not under<lb></lb>stand, she then commenced cutting a piece of wood to light the fire, but she was so long about it I got out of temper, and struck her on the side of the head with my fist; she fell on the floor, and whilst lying on the ground I gave her a kick with my boot, and I think the heel of my boot must have made the gash in her head—I then went out in the yard; when I came back I found she had not moved, I lifted her up and found she was senseless, I placed her head on a small block of wood and went to Mrs. Gregory's, next door, and asked her to go for the doctor"—I then took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I was sent for to the police-station on this evening, and went from there to No. 3, White's-grounds and saw the deceased—I found a severe contusion on the forehead above the left eye, and a wound at the upper and back part of the head—it was an incised wound, rather jagged, an inch and a half in length, and penetrating to the bone—the scalp was separated from the bone, to about the extent of an inch there was not a great deal of blood—I afterwards made a post mortem examination by direction of the coroner—I found effusion of blood on the inner part of the scalp, under both the external injuries—on exposing the bone I found the membranes very much congested, and on removing the membranes there was a large quantity of effused blood—the cause of death was rupture of a blood vessel on the brain—the other organs of the body werehealthy—if a person was intoxicated at the time a blow was given, the rupture of a blood vessel would be more likely to occur—the wound at the back of the head would be very likely to be caused by one of these boots—I examined</p>

               <p>them at the station, and found a small spot of blood on the iron heel of the right boot—the contusion over the eye might have been caused by a blow of the hand or fist—the skin was not broken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

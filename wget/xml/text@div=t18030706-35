               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to your shop last month? - A. Yes, on the 11th of June, about five o'clock in the afternoon, she came in to match two bits of lace that she had in her hand: I told her I had not any of the same; I was in the shop alone; I carried some lace to some ladies in a carriage before she came in; I came back into the shop, leaving the lace in the carriage; I then went back again to the carriage, leaving the prisoner in the shop; I had told her I had no lace of that sort; I saw her go to the box where I had taken the lace from; I saw her hand in the box; it was on the opposite side of the shop from where I had left her; she took a piece of lace out with her right-hand; I went into the shop, and asked her, what she was going to do with that piece of lace; she said, she had not got any; I told her, I had seen her take a piece; I pulled down her apron, and there I found the piece of lace. - (Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A.Six pounds and upwards prime cost; as I had got my property I let her go, but some people about the door took her to Bow-street, and I was sent for; I did not with to prosecute her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I wanted to match some lace; that gentleman told me he could match one, but not the other; he desired me to stop a moment, he was going to a carriage, and while he was gone, I observed the lace upon the floor; I never moved a foot, and as he was coming in, I stooped to pick it up, and he said it was not mine, and I gave it to him.</p>

On the 14th December last, William Brittain, having left my employment as fore<lb></lb>man of works at Bennett's-court, Drury-lane, and having taken a contract to the amount of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to do certain works for the Central London. Dwellings' Improvement Company, Limited, asked me to advance him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to enable him to procure some deals and timber to carry out his contract. I told him it was inconvenient for me to do so. He pressed me very hard, and I told him if the person of whom he was going to purchase the good, would take my cheque, dated for the 21st of December, I would oblige him. On the afternoon of that day, ie. the 14th, he told me that he could do with a cheque dated for the 21st, and thereupon I gave him one for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dated the 21st December. This cheque, by his own statement, he was going to pay to Mr. Putney, timber merchant, Elm-street, Gray's-inn-lane. On the morning of Wednesday, December 18th, about noon, Brittain came to me, and said that Mr. Putney's bankers would not take the cheque dated the 21st; and he asked me to give him in exchange a cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the current date, on the understanding that it should not be presented until the coming Saturday, the 21st of December. I did so, and he presently sent me the cheque which I had given him on the previous Saturday, and which cheque, believing the transaction to be quite regular, I destroyed. In con<lb></lb>sequence of information which I received on this 18th of December, I requested the Bank of London not to pay this cheque, and two others,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186205120063"></xptr>
               <p>dated the 17th instant, in Brittain's favour, for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. re<lb></lb>spectively. On Friday, the 20th of December, I gave Brittain in custody on a charge of obtaining money by false pretences, and he was remanded for a week; and on the evening of the name day, Mrs. Williams, the land-lady of the Harlequin Tavern, Drury-lane, called upon me and stated that she held my cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated the 18th December, which cheque I produce, and said as follows, viz.: that on Saturday, December 14th, Brittain lad asked her to change a cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she had said that she could not do so, and that on Monday he had made a similar request to her, and that she changed it for him. That she paid said cheque away on Tuesday, December 17th, and that it was returned to her and refused, by reason of its being post-dated for the 21st December. That she there-upon applied to Brittain for a cheque of the current date, which he promised to procure for her, and that shortly afterwards he brought her a cheque (now produced), dated the 18th of December, whereupon she gave him back the post-dated cheque. This cheque Brittain returned to me, and I de<lb></lb>stroyed, same as before stated. I gave Mrs. Williams' cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (now produced) in lieu of that of which payment had been stopped. The first intimation which I had of the existence of the cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l,</hi> which I say is a forgery, was on Wednesday morning last, January 1st, when a Mr. Smith, baker, of 10, Peter-street, Islington, called upon me and stated that he was the holder of the cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the payment of which I had ordered to be stopped, and that he had cashed for Brittain three cheques, viz., one for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. one for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that he had sent them in together to his bankers, the London and County Bank, Islington branch; that the two latter had been paid, but the former had been returned to him on the 23d ult. Since which time be said he had applied to Brittain and his wife for my address, and that he could not and did not obtain it until the after<lb></lb>noon of that day. I told him that I knew nothing of any cheque of mine for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being out; that I had only given Brittain one cheque for that amount, which cheque I had found out that he had cashed at the Harlequin public-house, Drury-lane. On the following morning, Thursday, January 2d, I obtained from the Bank of London the cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. produced, and which I presume is the cheque referred to by Mr. Smith, as it appears to have passed through the Islington branch of the London and County Bank. I at once recognised it as a forgery. No part of it is in my handwriting, although, in many respects, it has ft similarity. I believe the cheque to be in the handwriting of Brittain, although I cannot speak positively on this point. This much I know, that on the 14th of December I gave him no other cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than that whioh was dated the 21st of December, and which cheque, it can be indisputably proved that he changed at the Harlequin Tavern, as before stated, and afterwards received in exchange for same the cheque dated the 18th of December, also before stated. I was in the habit of carrying a few blank cheques in my pocket for business pur<lb></lb>poses, and about the 14th of December I lost or mislaid a roll of these. Brittain was daily at my office, and my impression now is that he found them, and that the cheque in question is one of those which I lost. I named my loss to him. I had such confidence in him that I would have trusted him to any amount at that time, and therefore took his word that he had not seen the cheques I had lost. On searching at Brittain's office, in the works at Bennett's-court this <hi rend="italic">day,</hi> I found a piece of paper (herewith pro<lb></lb>duced), on which certain attempts to copy my signature are made. I believe them to be in Brittain's handwriting. He is at present out on bail, being</p>

               <p>committed to take his trial at the next Middlesex Sessions, for obtaining money by fraud and false pretences, full particulars of which charge have appeared in the newspapers. I believe the total amount of his frauds upon me, as discovered to the present date, are about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. There are one or two charges of embezzlement, and several of forged receipts. I have not the least doubt that he forged and uttered the cheque in question.</p>

I placed the matter in the hands of Sergeant Packman, and on Wednesday, 10th January, Brittain was taken into custody for uttering the cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dated 14th December—the examination took place that same day, and there was then a remand, Brown being examined as a witness—I was present when he was sworn and saw him sign both these deposition—(<hi rend="italic">The depositions were here put in and read, together with a paper of signature annexed thereto</hi>)—in consequence of a statement that he made to me about other forged cheques, which he said he believed Brittain had uttered, I applied to the bank for information as to what cheque, had been presented, and then I wrote to Brown a letter, dated 8th January—the prisoner has had notice to produce that letter (<hi rend="italic">it was here handed in by the prisoner and read;</hi> "Do you know anything of the undermentioned cheques, viz. 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Doxey, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Palmer, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Spratt"—in reply I received this letter from Brown, dated 9th January—he says, "Palmer and Short's cheques an right, Doxey's I know nothing of"—the letter contains a long explanation of some transactions with Doxey, which has nothing whatever to do will this case; but, at the latter part of it, he says, "I inclose you a cheque for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which Brittain yesterday asked for, and also the cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. given to Brittain to purchase bricks"—that is the cheque marked B,</p>

(marked K) either on Saturday evening or Monday morning—you did not tell me at that time that you had a receipt from Brittain for the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that you had mislaid it; nor did you tell me that Brittain was indebted to you in the sum of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—you put this book on the table—I saw it, and it was then in the same state as it is now—we did not go into the account—you told me that Brittain owed you over 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I say so now; he owes me over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—No sum of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was mentioned on that occasion—you put the book before me to show the state</p>

               <p>of Brittain's account with you, but we did not go into any details of it—I think you produced several other cheques of yours on that occasion—I did not look at those cheques with a magnifying-glass—I am not in the habit of carrying a glass, only an eye-glass—I did not look at these cheques, and say that looking at them through the glass, the forgery became more apparent—I am not certain whether some person who opened the door to me was not present on that occasion—your wife was not present; she merely looked into the room just before I left; she was certainly not there during the greater portion of the time—the next time I saw you was a little before 11 in the morning; we were talking together for more than an hour on that occasion upon your transactions with Brittain, and the circumstances which you conceived threw suspicion upon him, and you related to me his mode of carrying on his business, and your mode, and so on—you did not tell me at that time that you had called at Mr. Goodson Smith's shop, but had not been able to see him—that was on the Tuesday—I do not recollect telling you then that I had called, and was unable to see him, and that I was going to call in the evening—I could not have told you so, because I did not call upon Mr. Smith at all till the Monday evening—I did call on him on the Monday evening—I did not see him—on the next morning (Tuesday) I saw you again at the Sessions House, Clerkenwell—I think I had arranged to meet you there for this reason, that if I had seen Mr. Smith, and he had told me he had received the cheques from Brittain's hands, I should have given Brittain into custody on the Tuesday morning, but as I had not seen Mr. Smith, I declined to do so.</p>

               <p>one dated 24th January—my object in applying for it was in consequence of Brittain's repeated statement before the Magistrate—you sent it me as part of the statement relating to the supposed payment of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by you to Brittain—there was no attempt on your part to withhold documents from me; you inundated me with documents—when I met you at this Court, on 27th January, you did not tell me that Brittain had given a receipt for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the course of the day, which you had handed to Mr. Bosanquet, and that at the time you paid him the balance you took his receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you did not give me the receipt on the Tuesday; not until the Wednesday—I speak with some degree of certainty, because by entries in my diary I was not here on the Tuesday—(<hi rend="italic">referring</hi>)—I beg your pardon, I was here on the Tuesday—you did not give me the receipt on the Tuesday—I am all but certain that a day intervened before I had it—Monday, the 27th, was the first day of the Session—the indictment against Brittain was preferred then—I had a conversation with you about the receipt referred to in your letter, which you said you bad given to the secretary—no reference was made in our conversation to any other receipt than that—the documents were in my possession from the dose of that Session until I saw you on 20th February, but they were not opened by me at all—it was only on the approach of the March Session that I sent for you and opened the docu<lb></lb>ments—it was after my interview on 20th February that I made what I supposed to be the discovery that they were not genuine—I refer to cheque A—it remained with me six weeks—I think I told you at the conclusion of Brittain's trial that Mr. Bosanquet had said something about my conduct being very improper in prosecuting Brittain at all, and that he should make some complaint upon the subject—I overheard him say that as he left the Court—I did not tell you a few days Afterwards that I had had an interview with Mr. Glyn, and that I had said something to him about the fact of my having been threatened—you saw me several times between 20th February and 1st March—I do not recollect that I asked you to furnish me with other documents—I received no farther papers from you—I may have done so, but I cannot recall it—this letter of 26th February (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—this states, "I think you said you had some memorandum signed by Brittain about his debt to you; if so, be so good as to bring it with you"—that was after I had discovered that these documents were not genuine—I did not consider that all the conversations that took place between us were of a confidential character—on Thursday, 20th February, you promised to send me a copy of all your correspondence with Mr. Bosan<lb></lb>quet—you called at my office on Saturday, the 22d, but did not see me—I did not ask you on that day to furnish me with a statement of matters as regarded Mr. Bosanquet and Brittain, and copies of the various letters you had received from Brittain and had written to him—that was on the 20th—I afterwards received that statement from you—you called on me after I received that statement—you called continually up to the morning of 3d March, and I particularly drew your attention to a portion of the corre<lb></lb>spondence respecting the arrest of Brittain—I do not recollect remarking that nothing could be more fair or straightforward than the course you had pursued—I do not think I made any such observation with reference to the letters; I had not got the letters at that time—I recollect seeing you upon this correspondence on Thursday, 27th February—that was after I had got this copy correspondence—I recollect reading over two or three letters relating to Brittain's arrest, and pointing out to you that the dates seemed to be inconsistent, and then you said that Mr. Bosanquet pretended that</p>

               <p>one letter was written by him after he knew of Brittain's arrest, and asking you not to arrett him—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was found amongst your papers—at the latter part it states "the bearer of this can bring back Mr. Beaumont's contract, and anything else you may have to send me"—there is an entry of Mr. Bosanquet's name in your call-book on the 20th—I do not know who made it—you called on me on Saturday, 1st March, and had a long conversation with me—I do not recollect producing, or proposing to produce to you, several of the papers—the principal part of our con<lb></lb>versation was with reference to the additional charge which you said you intended to press against Brittain—I don't recollect asking you to tell me, when I gave you the paper referring to Mr. Bosanquet, in order to refresh my memory—I did not produce a bundle of papers, and find one or two missing—I will not say I might not have sent for Mr. Base, my clerk, and said, "I cannot think where this paper has got to"—I kept part of the papers, and my clerk might have some—as you were going away, I asked if you would be at home in the evening—I said I was going to a consultation with counsel, and probably I should have to see you in the evening—I did not say I wanted to see certain letters of Mr. Bosanquet—you did not tell me I was welcome to see anything you had—you were trying to find out what I was going to do on the Monday, and I did not choose to tell you—I sent you a letter to the effect that counsel had advised under the circumstances that no evidence should be offered against Brittain on the Monday morning—you came to my house early on Monday morning—I did not tell you that, in consequence of his having been acquitted upon two other charges, counsel thought there would be a pre<lb></lb>judice in his favour, and that consequently an acquittal might possibly be the result—this is the letter that was written to you by my clerk, at Mr. Giffard's chambers, immediately after the consultation, "Temple, March 2, 1862, half-post 4. Sir,—Mr. Mullens desires me to inform you that the result of the consultation is, that counsel are of opinion, under all the cir<lb></lb>cumstances, that the Bankers' Committe should not further press the prose<lb></lb>cution against Brittain; it will, however, be open to you to continue the prosecution on your own account, if you think fit; and I send you this information at once, in order that you may instruct Mr. Abrahams, or any other gentleman, without delay"—You called on me after that with that letter, and asked what was meant by the last part, and I told you that although the Bankers' Committee did not wish to press it, it was open to you, if you pleased to instruct counsel on your own behalf—I do not recollect your saying if it was useless for me to carry it on, it was folly for you to do so—I do not know that it was in consequence of the receipt of that letter that you did not appear as a witness—you made an appointment to meet me at this Court—I did not, at that interview, tell you that I had reason to suppose any of the documents in question were not genuine—on the after<lb></lb>noon of that day, I gave you into custody on the charge of forging this cheque—the police had instructions on the subject before Brittain's acquittal—I have a letter of yours dated the 26th, and one dated the 24th, but none dated the 25th of February—I have no letter from you stating that you had heard it had been put in circulation by Brittain, or his party, that you were guilty of the forgery of this cheque; this is the letter I got from you on the 25th, "I could not manage to spare time to give you a call yesterday; I was told last night that a charge of forgery and perjury is to be preferred against Brittain to-day by a man named Edkins, of Bow-street, with whom he had some transactions;" I hare no letter of the 25th; that was the last</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of 10, St. Peter-street, Islington; in December, 1861, I received these three cheques from Brittain—he was a customer of mine—I used to change cheques for him when hs asked we—the cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 14th December, I received from him on Satur<lb></lb>day the 14th—the one for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I received on the 11th, and the other on the 17th—I kept them until the 23d, and then paid them to Mr. Beckingham, my landlord—next day I received back from him this cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went with it to the prisoner's office, in Robert-street, Adelphi,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186205120072"></xptr>
               <p>on the 30th, and told him that I had had the cheque returned dishonoured; and he said he would send me an open cheque for it by post, and I could return this; I did not get one—I went to see him again on the Friday, but did not see him—at last I got this note from him, dated 3d January: "Sir, I am sorry that I was not at home when you called this afternoon; have the goodness to call here on Monday morning with the cheque, and I will settle the matter"—I called on the 6th and got a crossed cheque from him for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and returned the other—he asked me what cheques I had changed, or what others I had in my possession—I think he asked whether I had changed the cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Yes;" and he said, "That is a forgery "—this cheque marked B is not in the same state as when I gave it to the prisoner—the words, "for bricks, Bennett's-court" have been added to it—those words were not on it when I first had it, or when I returned it to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When do you say you first called on me with reference to this cheque? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Monday, 30th December—it was not the 31st; it was in the evening—I do not know the time—it was about 7 or 8; I had to wait about half an hour before I could see you—I took a friend with me—you did not at that time state to me that the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was a forgery—I did not state at Clerkenwell that you had told me on the 30th that you had not given Brittain the cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">the witness deposition was here read</hi>)—there is a mistake there; I remember it well—I did not know whether it was at the first or second interview that I had with you, and it was put down as the first; that was on the 30th, but you never stated anything to me about the cheque being a forgery until 6th January—I received the dishonoured cheque back from Mr. Beckingham on 24th December—it remained in my hands six days before I communicated with you, because I did not know where to find you—I could not get your address—Brittain did not refuse it—I asked Mrs. Brittain, and she said she would go with me to your house one evening—at that time Brittain was in the House of Detention—there was no correspondence going on between me and Brittain at that time—I did not know him—I knew his wife—I had not seen him above once or twice before then—I had only known him a very few weeks, while he had been dealing with me—I knew him when he brought the first cheque to be cashed—he was not a stranger to me; he was a customer, but he had of been in the neighbourhood many weeks—I had cashed other cheques of yours, and they were all right—the first cheque I cashed for him was to oblige you, his master—I am not aware that he made any particular statement to me—I think he told me that his baker at Notting-hill had been in the habit of doing it for him—he said they were his master's cheques, Mr. Brown's—he said that you were in the habit of paying him with cheques—I cannot tell you about what time it was that I cashed the first cheque for him—sometimes I was not at home, and they were left till the next morning—I found the cheques all right until the last one—when I first went to you, I asked why you had ordered the cheque not to be paid—the words "Ordered not to pay" are written across the cheque—I forget what you said—I don't recollect your saying it was in consequence of the misappropriation by Brittain of three cheques which you had given him, of which that was one—your wife was not present at this conversation—I took a friend with me, but I left him in a back place—what I said was, I had got one of your cheques dishonoured, and I should be glad if you could pay me—I was examined at Clerkenwell Police-court—I remember Mr. Moald, the cheif clerk there, guaranteeing to see the cheque paid, but it has never been paid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186205120073"></xptr>
               <p>—I did not ask you on 30th December why you had written on the cheque "Ordered not to be patd"—I aaked you the reason it was returned—I did not tell you that I had paid it with two others through my banken—I told you that I had paid it to my landlord—I remember calling on you on 6th January—I went three times one day, and could not see you; you came to me—I do not know whether it was on the 7th—I forget now what you called for—you asked me if I had paid the cheques into my bank, and I said no, I had got no bank—you said, "Who did?" and I said, "I do not know, you must go to the bank and see"—I did not know who had paid them into the bank; I knew who I had paid them to—I do not think I told Mr. Mullens who I had paid them to—I forget now whether I refused to tell him how I had disposed of the cheques—I don't remember your saying when you called, "You have had a gentleman calling on you about the forged cheque; why tell him one story and me another?"—I did not reply that I had a right to say what I liked—I did not refuse to give you the name of the bank where they were paid in—I told you I had received the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque on the Saturday evening, and deducted a small account out of it of 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my books are at home.</p>

                  </hi>. I did live at 17, Hanover-street, Islington—I have removed from there now, I lived there at the time these matters were pending—I now live at 2, Grosvenor-street—I am a builder in a small way of business—I have known the prisoner about five years; two or three years ago I was unfortunate and had to pass through the Insolvent Court, since then I have done several little jobs by contract for the prisoner, and he recommended me as clerk of the works in Bennett's-court—in the latter part of last year he was appointed as architect and surveyor to the Central Lon<lb></lb>don Dwellings Improvement Company—I occupied the position of clerk of the works there, so far as Bennett's-court was concerned; the secretary engaged me; during the week it was my duty to make petty disbursements, and on the Friday to render an account to the prisoner of what those disburse<lb></lb>ments were, and also to furnish him with a pay-sheet of the wages of the men—I generally drew about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Monday for the petty cash, and rendered an account of it, about 10 o'clock on the Saturday, on the pay-sheets which be used to give me—I took a contract to do a portion of the work myself about the latter end of November or the beginning of Decem<lb></lb>ber, I cannot say the date—I continued to act as clerk of the works, as regards the remainder of the works—a person of the name of Beaumont was contractor for that part of the works of which I was clerk, and another builder; they were doing the work for the company—the prisoner had nothing to do with the contract, beyoud certifying when the work was done—I could not charge money on account of my contract unless I had a certificate—on Friday, 13th December, I handed to the prisoner this pay-sheet, amounting to 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but it has been altered since I delivered it; there was a balance-sheet filed with the time-sheet—I had been previ<lb></lb>ously doing some work on my own portion of the contract—on the Satur<lb></lb>day, I went to his office about half-past 9, and told him I wanted 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he could not let me have more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he wrote out a receipt and asked me to sign it—I did sign it, and he said if I would come at 10 o'clock, the usual time, he would give me the money; the receipt was for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to him in the afternoon—according to his statement there was an amount of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due for the men's wages, for the day workmen—he gave me a cheque for that amount, that settled the wages part of the matter—he said he could let me have 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that was by an open cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>and a crow-cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he could let me have some more on the Tuesday following—I said I would make shift with that; this cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 14th (<hi rend="italic">marked A</hi>), is the cheque that be gave me that day—he owed me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. previous to this Saturday—he had not advanced or lent me an amount of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 9th December—I cannot recollect his giving me a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 10th December—I think it is very likely he might have done so—I got this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from him, if I recollect right it was on account of petty cash, the balance-sheet to be given on the following Saturday, and I think he had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of this, but I cannot recollect for certain; I did not have it or any part of it as a loan, or advance for my own private use, it was received on account of petty cash accounts for the week, and I think Mr. Brown had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it; he was in the habit of giving me the cheques for a certain amount, and I was in the habit of taking certain portions of it back again to him—I cannot recollecd whether he had any money out of this or not, if not, it is accounted for in the balance-sheet—I received this cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated 11th Decem<lb></lb>ber, from the prisoner; that he had the money for; I bad the cheque dis<lb></lb>counted and gave him the cash, that I can swear to distinctly—I frequently got cross-cheques cashed through Mr. Smith, nearly every week, I gave Brown the money; I got this 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque cashed the same evening I received it, I think on the 14th, by Mr. Smith the baker—previous to his cashing it, I asked Miss West, the barmaid at the Harlequin, if they could do it, and they could not—I remember the Tuesday following, the 17th, I went to the prisoner that morning for some money, and he said he wanted to see me as he wanted 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day very badly—I said I wanted some as well, and he then wrote out three cheques, one for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he said, "Here are three cheques for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., bring me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of that, and keep the rest yourself," that was on Tuesday the 17th—he said, "Bring me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and keep the rest yourself "—I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque to Miss West, and in the afternoon they cashed it; they were not all dated the 17th, the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was a post-dated cheque, but I was not aware of it at the time, it was dated the 21st, the Saturday follow<lb></lb>ing; in the afternoon, they got it cashed for me, by the landlord signing his name to it, and I took that 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. directly down to Mr. Brown and gave him the seven sovereigns which I received—Mr. Osborn, a carpenter, and his brother, were with me at the time I got the money; I got the money in gold—Osborn went with me as far as Brown's, and stayed outside while I went in—I saw Brown and gave him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then rejoined Osborn—he and I went back to the Harlequin, and had a pint of ale; after paying for it in coppers, 1 missed a sovereign, there was a search made for it, I turned out every pocket of course, it was the only piece of money I had about me; in the presence of Osborn and his brother; the sovereign was afterwards fount by Miss West among the copper, I had given it her in mistake—I took the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque to Mr. Smith, and he gave me the money next morning; before I took that to Mr. Brown, I took the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque to Mr. Putney's and bought some timber, I gave them the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque, and they gave me the difference out—those two cheques are before me—I gave Brown eight sovereigns and four half-crowns out of the other two cheques, making the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as he required, and keeping 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as he had promised me—that was on the 18th—on the Wednesday I received a message from the Harle<lb></lb>quin which caused me to go there—in consequence of a communication that was made to me there, I went to the prisoner and told him he had given me a post-dated cheque—he said, "I thought you asked for one"—I said, "Cer<lb></lb>tainly</p>

               <p>not"—be then gave me another one which I took to the Harlequin, and the landlord sent me over to the post-office—I got the post-dated one away, inclosed it in an envelope, and sent it by poet to Brown—this is the substituted cheque—there is this memorandum on it, "Paid Mr. Brittain, in exchange for cheque dated 21/12/61—I did not, on 14th December, ask him to lend me a cheque post-dated for the 21st—I did not tell him that I was going to buy timber at Mr. Putney's, and that they had told me if I would bring a cheque dated 21st December they would take it—I never on any occasion asked him to lend me a cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dated 21st December—I did not on that 14th December receive any cheque from him for the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., save and except the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque that has been placed in my hands to-day, dated the 14th—that was the only 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque I received that day—I was not in the habit of giving him receipts on blank paper—I have lent him my acceptance several times, but have always had his acknowledgment for it—in the course of business he used always to make out the receipts for me, and I have then signed my name across the penny adhesive stamp—I always did that when I received the pay-sheets—this is the receipt for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of my contract, which I gave the prisoner to hand to Mr. Bosanquet—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>"Received this day for payment of Mr. Brittain, for contract of work to be done in Bennett's-court, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14/12/61.")—that is the paper I signed in anticipation of receiving the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him as I expected—the body of this IOU, told the writing on the stamp, is mine, I believe, but the other is not—I never signed that stamp on that paper, and I never owed Brown 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my life—we handwriting in the body of it is Brown's—I certainly never wrote my name across that stamp, when it was affixed to that paper—I never saw this paper until after Brown was in custody—I believe the writing on the stamp is mine; indeed, I have no doubt of it, but when I so wrote on that stamp it was not on that paper—the letters just before the stamp, and the finishing of the letters after the stamp, are not mine, or made by my authority—there is no truth in the statement that is made on this I 0 U about my owing him that sum of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is entirely false—the body of this paper, which purports to be a receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is in the prisoner's handwriting—the writing on the stamp which is affixed to it, I believe, is mine, but when I se wrote on that stamp it was not affixed to that paper—it must have been affixed to one of the time sheets—whatever there is that is genuine on this stamp written by me, when I so wrote it, was not affixed to that paper—just before the stamp there are portions of the words "Received the above"—that is not in my handwriting, or written by my authority; nothing but what is on the stamp—the word "Received" is on the paper, and "the above" is on the stamp—the word "Received" is not in my handwriting at all—the "Wm." is not in my writing; the words "the above" are mine, except the final "e" of the word "above"—I always signed the pay-sheets on a stamped receipt, with the words "Received the above," the date and my name—here is one of the pay-sheets for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for November, 1861-that is my writing—there is no receipt to that—when I parted with that I should say it was not on that half-sheet of paper as it is now—it had no receipt to it when I handed it to the prisoner—I used to hand them to him on the Friday night, and then affix the stamp on the Saturday, when I received the money—I have not the least doubt in the world that when I received the money on the Saturday I put a receipt to it over the receipt stamp—this paper seems to have been out since I delivered it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the pay-sheets entire, receipt and all; that is how I used to sign</p>

               <p>the wages, and would bring the money—you asked me if I was afraid to trust you, and I said, "Certainly not"—it is usual when builders are in difficulties to do it in that way, but it was not so then, and I complained at the time that it was not a regular way of doing business—on 13th Decem<lb></lb>ber, I owed you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had lent you on 4th December, but that was irrespective of my contract, and you agreed to take it back at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week: I have no memorandum to show that—I always obtained from you an under-taking for the bills I accepted for you except two—I know that I was equally liable on those cheques, which I cashed for you, and I always asked you if they were right—I have no memorandum from you to show that I have re<lb></lb>ceived the money from you—I was led foolishly to trust you, and bitterly I have paid for it—I have no books to show it, it was not business transac<lb></lb>tions with the Company, it was done to oblige you—I have no other papers or documents to support my statement—on 14th December you owed me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not receive a 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque in payment of the balance—I received the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, and the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. crossed cheque, and I believe the cheque-book will prove it—I received three cheques on 17th December, and you then owed me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the balance of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I got your cheques cashed I did not think there was any necessity to ask you for a memorandum, the more fool that I was, but I thought you were an honourable man—your own cheque-book will substantiate my statement—on 14th December, when I called upon you, your wife was in and out of the office several times during the inter<lb></lb>view; she was not there the whole time—she was speaking about the beer-money for the men—I called to give you the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the afternoon of Tues<lb></lb>day, 17th December, I called on you and told you of the reports which were going about, that I had not been paying the men the amount that had been booked to them, and said that you ought to clear my character; I did not say that Mr. Bosanquet had been making inquiries about me, and wished to know what your opinion was—I believe it was on the 20th you gave me the cheque, or I brought you the money, I should not like to say for certain—Mr. Fergusson, of Paddington, was supplying me with bricks directly I began the contract at 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a thousand—I do not know that I only had 4,500, I paid him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I did not order any quantity, but when I wanted any I sent him an order—4,500 bricks would come to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and not 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the amount of the cheque you gave me—nothing was said to me about discount—I do not know your arrangements—what bricks I had were delivered in my own name, and I paid for them—I believe I can swear I never gave you the tickets, but I may be mistaken—I had at that time had some dealing with Messrs. Schole's and Wood for the purchase of lime—I did not take an order for those goods, amounting to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Mr. Wood did call upon me at Bennett's-court, to know under what circumstances I required them, but that has nothing to do with you; they were goods to go to Notting-hill—I recollect a conversation about it, and I may have said that if he would supply them, I would get an order from you making them all right, and be delivered at Bennett's-court, on 16th or 17 th, one yard of grey lime, and seven sacks, thirty bushels of Roman cement, amounting to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I used that lot on the work set forth in my contract—I did not obtain those goods in your name—being in your employment at Ben<lb></lb>nett's-court, in October, I went to Mr. Wood and opened an account in the joint names of Brittain and Osborn; that was for goods to go to Notting-hill—I stated that I would pay for them on the Saturday week, but I did not—I owe Mr. Wood 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I think I can swear it is not over 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not make use of your name in order to obtain those materials—I did not represent my<lb></lb>self</p>

               <p>as being in partnership with Mr. Osborn, I said that he was going to build, and I was going to lend him some money, which I did—the goods were supplied in our joint names, because Mr. Wood had had business with him before—I have had several transactions with Mr. Osborn at various times—this letter, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) addressed to you is my writing—the Mr. Osborn mentioned in it is the same person—I told you that Mr. Osborn had had me arrested, but afterwards I found that he was innocent—I do not know a Mr. Allen—there is a Mr. Allen named in this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Produced by the prisoner, and dated Whitecross-street</hi>)—it says, "Allen was discharged to<lb></lb>day," but who he is I do not know, it must have been some of your acquaint<lb></lb>ances, I never had any business with him—this letter is addressed to Mr. Taylor; I know him—I do not know of any transactions between him and me—a bill of exchange for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated 17th May, 1860, and accepted by Willett and Co. was put into my hand when before the Magistrate, and I admitted it to be my writing—I did not say, "I have not made an affi<lb></lb>davit stating that it is a forgery, because the bill I believed to be a forgery was not that bill at all—(<hi rend="italic">The affidavit was here put in by the prisoner</hi>) the bill shown to me at Bow-street was not the same bill that I was sued on—I do not know whether this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one shown me before the Magistrate—I do not believe it is—I swore before the Magistrate that I was not at your house at all on 19th December; I only saw you in the street—I do not know whether your little boy was christened on 19th De<lb></lb>cember—I called at your house and saw your wife, who said that you had gone to Bennett's-court, and I saw you about 2 o'clock, which was the only time I saw you on the 19th—I did not come into your private office, nor did your wife give me a glass of wine, and tell me to drink the boy's health as he was going to be christened—I called, but I did not see you that day till I met you in Drury-lane between 1 and 2 o'clock; Mr. Osborn was with me—it never happened but once that I did net give a receipt to the pay-sheet, and that was when yon came on a Saturday and brought me four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and I had not got the pay-sheet with me—this pay-sheet of 6th De<lb></lb>cember has no receipts to it—I think there has been one to this pay-sheet of November 8, but I should not like to say—there is some writing on it which is not mine—I never received any money from you—you lent me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but you had it back within a month—I have been a bankrupt once and got an immediate certificate—I have been insolvent twice—Mr. Lewis, of Wilmington-square, got me through the Court—the first time was in the name of William Brittain, and the second William Richard Brittain—it was not five times; it was about the same number of times that you have been, but mine has been through misfortune—I have not been in the habit of taking building ground and running up carcases and leaving them—I have not built at Holloway or Highgate; I have at Kentish-town—I received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon them, and ought to have had 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I never had anymore—I received the materials as part of the improved ground-rent—I have not built at Islington or Hackney—I was building at Finchley when I became bankrupt—I built four carcases at Stratford and sold them—Mr. Hammitt, the surveyor, did not accuse me of obtaining the bricks for those houses, but I gave him bill of your's for them—it was repudiated, and I sued you, and got judg<lb></lb>ment against you for it—I commenced an action against Mr. Hammitt, and lost it—that was for taking my bricks—previous to going into Whitecross-street Prison, I had some transactions with Mr. Gold; I got him to advance me money on bills—I may have represented that they were genuine bills—I wrote you a letter at Whitecross-street, concluding, "I feel very uneasy</p>

               <p>about Wednesday, and shall feel obliged If you will call on me in the course of the day, to let me know what course Mr. Lowe means to adopt"—he did not accuse me of having obtained money from him on fictitious bills—he says that of all the bills I brought him he could only find the acceptor of one, because two of them had run away—one of them was not a relative of mine—it was Mr. Lance, and it was for money I lent him—"he went through the Insolvent Court, and lives there now, and I lost the money through it—I had not bill-transactions upon Osborne, in which Messrs. Kidder and Willetts took me in execution—they are not numerous—I could not put the bill of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in May, 1860, into my schedule, because I did not know anything at all about it—I stated before the Magistrate that I had never been in custody before; that was true—I did not receive a cheque from you, in March 1st, for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to pay for some laths; it was for work I had done—I did not go and pay Mr. Pye, of Hammersmith, for the laths; you paid him, and stopped it off me—I did not, on the day after you gave me in custody, 28th March, agree to arrange and settle for those laths—I was bound down to keep the peace, because I came to demand my money, which was owing to me—I did not, after I came out on bail, use a number of threats to various people, as to what I would do with you—I charged you 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a load for a man named Forsyth casting away rubbish—I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am not aware that Forsyth gave you information that he only received 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you have got the bills, and his own receipts to them—Matthews has been paid the various sums which are charged, except one or two little jobs owing for now—I did not, on 2d March, pay 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a man named Short, for shoves—I do not know him, and never had transactions with him—I saw Mr. Samuel Bosanqnet at the Sessions-house, Clerkenwell, on 2d January—he gave me some money to engage some one to defend me, because he knew you were prosecuting me for what I was not guilty of—I have not got the letters I received from him with me—while I was in Pack-man's custody, I met Mr. Edward Dyer, and asked him to come and identify your writing—he said that he had seen the cheque, and did not think it was your writing, but it was not produced—with reference to 17th December, you gave me the cheques, and told me you had an account—you said that you wanted to keep a good balance, and as you said that you had a balance there, I got them discounted—I have done that week after week, because you said that you wanted to keep your name good, and did not want to draw your account too close—I brought you 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that night, and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. next morning:</p>

I am the niece of Mr. Williams, the proprietor of the Harlequin public-house, Drury-lane—I have seen the prisoner there occasionally—I know Brittain; he used to come there generally during the day—on Saturday, 14th December, he came there, and asked me to change a cheque—I took it into my hands—this cheque looks like it—I declined cashing it; handed it back to him, and he left—I particularly noticed that it was dated the 16th, the very day on which it was brought to me—next day, the 17th, he came again with Osborne, and brought a cheque—I did not look at it, but sent a servant out with it, and it was cashed by a neigh<lb></lb>bour—I took the money, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from the servant, handed it to Brittain, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186205120080"></xptr>
               <p>he left with Osborne—they both came back the same evening, and had something to drink—he missed a sovereign; a search was made for it, and it was found among some coppers—he turned his pockets inside out, and I do not think there could have been any other money in them—on the next day the cheque was brought back, and I made a communication to Brittain, who afterwards brought me another cheque, and I gave him the origial one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I not tell you that it was in consequence of some cheques which I had paid to Brittain being misappropriated that I stopped payment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I said that it was inconvenient, for me to cash it at that time—on the following Monday morning, when he came in for some ale, I made it con<lb></lb>venient to cash it—he said that he had not got it with him then, his wife had got it—his wife came down about 1 o'clock on the Monday—it was on Tuesday the cheque was cashed—he did not apply to me for it till Tuesday, about 4 o'clock, and I was under the impression that it was the same cheque, though I did not think it necessary to look at it, but it could not have been, because I am quite sure the one I looked at on the Saturday was dated the 14th—I cashed it at 4 o'clook on Tuesday afternoon—it was not returned to me about 7 in the evening—I do not recollect telling you anything at that time about Brittain being short of money—I do not think I had the second cheque in my hand till after it was returned—it was my im<lb></lb>pression that it was the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, nothing was said to the contrary: in fact.

I am a member of the Bar of Lincolin's-inn, and one of the Directors of the Central London Dwellings Improvement Society—we employed the prisoner in 1861 as surveyor and architect, and Brittain as clerk of the works, and he afterwards had a contract on his own account—on 14th December, the prisoner called on me in reference to the works, and handed me this receipt for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. signed by Brittain, telling me that he had advanced the money to Brittain—this letter of 19th December, directed to the prisoner, is in my writing—before I wrote it I had had some conversation with the prisoner about some charges against Brittain—the date has since been altered to the 20th without my authority—(<hi rend="italic">This letter stated:</hi> "We hope, if you find the charges against Brittain are true, you will not take any steps against him till we have talked the matter over together.")—the prosecutor was arrested on the 20th without my authority—I know the prisoner's writing, and should say that this 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, marked A, is his writing; it resembles it, and I believe it to be his—I have had the opportunity of becoming acquainted with his writing—I believe none of these papers (<hi rend="italic">produced by the officer</hi>) are my writing—I am sure two of them are not, but they are very like it—this one purports to be the beginning of a letter of some sort; it is not in my writing, but it is very like it—this letter to Brown, "December 19th, 1861," signed S. C. Bosanquet:—"Dear Sir, I decline to see Brittain; we propose that if you find he is guilty you shall give him in custody according to promise; please let your clerk bring me Mr. Bowman's contract;" is not my writing—I never wrote such a letter as that</p>

Q.</hi> I think at this time there are two actions in which I am plaintiff? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect seeing more than one writ myself—I have received one personally and one in my capacity of Secretary—there was a a suggestion made by our solicitors on one occasion to pay some money into Court—I have never looked at your books or papers—Mr. Mullens showed me a pay-sheet in Brittain's writing, and another paper that contained some accounts—I suppose they had been taken by Packman—I cannot say when it was resolved not to pay anything on account or into Court—I very strongly objected to it from the beginning, and I believe our solicitors have declined—I do not remember finding fault with you while employed by the Company, except for not sending the account in—I told you on one occasion that the</p>

               <p>works were going on too slowly—when you called on me on 14th December, the impression you conveyed to my mind was, that you bad advanced 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I gave you another cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think, and I believe, I said, "There, I have made it an open cheque, it will not require Brittain's endorsement, and you can pay yourself"—I think it was on 17th December that you attended at my office by appointment, at about half-past 11 or 12 o'clock I should think—we spoke about the charges against Brittain, and we told you that charges bad been made against him by certain workmen, and we thought it desirable that you should know it—I do not think you informed me that you had a high opinion of Brittain, and did not believe he was guilty of anything of the kind—you may have said that he was unfortunate in buisness, but was still an honest man—I do not remember saying, "Well, Mr. Brown, if Brittain has been defrauding you, we have been defrauded too," but it is very possible you said that you could find out whether it was true or not, and parted from me with the clear understanding that you were to sea a policeman—I believe I received a communication from you on the subject that afternoon—you saw me next day, the 18th, on the same subject, and I think it was understood that if you found there was no question on the subject, Brittain should be prosecuted—here is a letter dated the 19th or 30th, I can say positively that it reached me before the 20th—I believe it was sent by the hands of my clerk, but I had an answer from you, that is here—I know that it was received—no letter was sent before the day that Brittain was taken up—you had not my instructions, on 19th December, to give him into custody, it was the 18th I saw you last—I de not remember receiving a letter from you, asking whether I should not like to see him first—I know I wrote you this letter telling you not to proceed without our instructions, and I subsequently received another saying that what we wished should be done—I never wrote a letter instructing you to give Brittain in custody—on 27th December, I wrote you this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Looking at it</hi>)—the transaction had not at that time my entire approval, you had proceeded without our authority—I met you at his office, and you showed me a number of papers, and mentioned several charges against Brittain—I cannot say whether you produced an I.O.U. for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., you went fully into nothing—you told me that you had received information that after instigating you to prosecute Brittain, I was defending him—I denied that the Company were assisting him—I cannot say whether you called on me, on Saturday, 11th January, about half-past 11 in the morning—I re<lb></lb>member you calling—you said something about my having acted towards you in an unfair manner, instigating you to prosecute Brittain, and then finding him the means of defence—I remember that by letter, or word of mouth, you said that persons bad seen me giving Brittain money, on Monday after<lb></lb>noon, at the Sessions-house, Clerkenwell, and that it was useless to deny it any longer; but I do not remember saying that I did it as a matter of charith, though it would be very true—I did give him something, I do not deny that; but I do not think I said so—I made an appointment for you to see me on the afternoon of that day, at your chambers—I told you that if you wanted the money, you must bring me the account by 2 o'clock that afternoon—I have seen Mr. Bowman's writing—I do not know that I could swear to it, I have had much more of yours—his address is, 19, Lincoln's-inn-fields—I called on you once to ask you to give me up a paper—a girl, named Julia Ryan, came to my chambers in reference to the charge against Brittain—I do not remember using any threat to Mr. Mullins with reference to the prosecution—I never laid that I should</p>

He entered into a detailed account of the circumstances connected with each of the cheques and paper in substance to the same effect as his cross-examination of the witnesses; and with respect to the alleged tampering with the returned cheques and the counterfoils of his cheque-book, he stated that it was his habit to enter upon them the purpose for which the cheques were given.</hi>

               <p>Q.Did you know the woman that is dead? - A. I did; we lived together four years.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did she live? - A.At the house of the prisoner, in <placeName id="t18010218-80-crimeloc437">Eagle-court, White-hart-yard</placeName>

               <p>Court. Q.Where was the apartment? - A. On the lower floor; Mr. Shehan persuaded them to leave off, and he put a stick between them; they were quarrelling and pulling one another about, such as scratching one another, but not any blows; Mr. Shehan went off to his watch, it might be a little past ten, and he wished me good night, and I wished him the same; I thought my woman was gone up stairs before me, but when I got up to my room I found she was not there.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know where she was? - A. No; in a few minutes time she came in, with her face a little scratched about her nose; I said, you have got a scratched face by quarrelling with Mrs. Shehan; I said, you had better been in my room and you would not have got a scratched face; she made light of it, and went and wiped her face with a cloth; directly the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180048"></xptr>rushed into the room and caught hold of her with her left hand by the side of the head, and made two blows at her with her right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the blows given? - A.Under the jaw, on the left side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether she had got any thing in her hand at the time? - A. I did not apprehend that she had any thing at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did neither of them say any thing? - A.There was no words spoke berwixt them; on seeing her struck, I was sitting on the bed, I jumped off the bed to part them; I made three steps towards them, and I saw the blood run in such a violent stream I had not power to go any further; as soon as I recovered myself I called out for assistance from the persons down stairs, and Mrs. Landrecy came up immediately with a child in her arms and looked in, and she run back immediately; Mrs. Shehan held the deceased up with her left hand against the side of her cheek as long as she could, and then she fell, first falling against a small table, and then upon the floor; after which Mrs. Shehan slipped away down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon afterwards did you see Mrs. Shehan? - A.Not till I saw her at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then? - A.People stocked in as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a knife being found there? - A. The patrol found a knife there, which he has in his keep; it is the knife which my woman used to have in her pocket for her own use; when I came into the room first the knife was lying upon the table open, with another case knife and fork; I did not see it used; it was found upon the floor; she searce lived a moment after she was down; she could not speak; she made a rattling in her throat and attempted to speak to me, but I could not understand her at all; I was then taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.You were taken by the officer upon this charge? - A. Yes; by the patrol.</p>
               <p>Q. The knife was the deceased's knife? - A. It was; I had seen it upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not know, of your own knowledge, who took the knife off the table? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q.There had been words between the prisoner and the deceased below stairs, before, when you parted them? - A.There had.</p>
               <p>Q. And when they came up stairs they had words? - A. No words till the prisoner came up.</p>
               <p>Q. But who took the knife off the table you don't know? - A. I did not see it taken off by any body.</p>
               <p>Q.When the blood spouted out, then it was that the prisoner was giving all the assistance to the deceased by holding her up as long as she could? -</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Were these two women sober? - A. I really believe they were neither of them right sober.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you quite sober yourself? - A. I had had some been, but not incapable of doing my business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.You were not quite sober yourself? - A. I had had a few pints of beer, but not quite seized over; I had not land above three pints of beer.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you all us, as nearly as you can recollect, what space of time might elapse from their being parted below and their coming up to the room where you were? - A. I don't think it was much less or over than a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether any thing passed between the two women by way of making it up below stairs? - A.Nothing was said in the least.</p>
               <p>Q.You went out immediately? - A. Yes.</p>

            ; he is a watchman in our parish; we live in Mrs. Shehan's house, the two pair of stairs, the room under the deceased's room; Mr. Shehan and the prisoner lived in the lower part.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the first part of the quarrel between the two women? - A.They had words below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the quarrel at night in Shehan, the prisoner's room? - A. Yes; it was between ten and eleven o'clock; I went up to my supper, and then Mrs. Griffith's came into our room and had a drop of beer out of our pot; she stopped some time with me, and then went up to her own room.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did she go up immediately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Did you hear Griffiths go up first? - A. He was up in the room first.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it whilst she was with you? - A. I cannot say that; she was no sooner in the room than Griffiths and his wife went to quarrelling; they had very high words together; I could not hear what it was about; then Mrs. Shehan came into our room, as I suppose to see whether the noise was there; then she went up stairs to give them warning, as she said she would not have her lodgers disturbed; she was not above four or five minutes up stairs before we heard the alarm of murder cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who cried murder? - A. I think it was Mr. Griffiths; I went up stairs, and I saw Mr. Griffiths standing in the room with a bundle; he was standing as if he was coming out of the room; I saw Mrs. Shehan laying hold of the woman in this way,(putting her hand up to her neck), and trying to stop the blood; I tumbled down stairs; I was incapable of giving any assistance; the two women were quite drunk; they were at it all the day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you said the two women were quite drunk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Griffiths was not quite sober? - A. I don't think he was; they used to have such a row generally when they were drunk, which happened very often.</p>
               <p>Q. The noise which induced Mrs. Shehan to go up was pretty considerable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it that Mrs. Shehan came into your room, and afterwards went up stairs? - A.She did not stay long in our room; it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night; Mrs. Shehan was nearly stripped and going to bed when she heard the noise; she had only her stockings and her flannel petticoat on.</p>
               <p>Q.Did it appear to you that Mrs. Shehan went up to quell the noise and to prevent the lodgers being any further disturbed? - A. I think it was; I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went up into the room the situation of the parties were in this way, Mr. Griffiths as if going out with a bundle at the time the prisoner was holding up the other woman and giving her assistance? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in the act of going out with a bundle at the time the wife was supported by the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180049"></xptr>Q.Then it was Griffiths that was attempting to go, but not the prisoner, who was giving all the assistance to the poor unfortunate woman that she could? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you hear Mrs. Griffiths go up stairs into her room? - A. Yes, I did; she was in my room before she went up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect about how much time had elapsed between her going up stairs, and the prisoner's going up? - A. Not very long; I cannot exactly tell; about five or six minutes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Whether Mr. Griffiths, at the time you went up, was coming out of the room with a bundle in his hand, you don't know? - A. No: he might have one, but I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. He was coming out of the room, and Mrs. Shehan was trying to stop the blood of the deceased? - A. Yes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, B</hi> 98). On 19th September, about a quarter-past 6 in the morning, I was in James's-place, Marlborough-road, Chelsea—I found the prisoner in a yard in 13, James's-place, lying down in a state of stupor—I found a tart near her, with some powder on it—a man named Fowler got a cab, and I conveyed her to St. George's Hospital—I left the tart in the hospital with Dr. Winter—I found a pocket-book in her pocket, containing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as it is now, partly in ink, and partly in pencil—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the prisoner ran away from home to destroy herself; that the </hi>5<hi rend="italic">s. which would be found in her pocket was for her mother, to whom it belonged; that her parent's address was Hope-cottage, Clarence-road, St. Pancras; and that she had a sister living at 6, Upper Fitzroy-street, Fitzroy-square; signed, "Elizabeth Hughes, aged 14 years"</hi>)—I went to Hope-cottage the same day, after I left the prisoner—I found the mother there—I gave her the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and told her that I found it in her daughter's pocket.</p>

I am tradesman, and deal in coal and coke—I am also a laundry-man—I live at 9, James's-place, Chelsea—on 19th September, my attention was attracted by the prisoner in the morning—she was betwixt two butts, at 13, James's-place—she was not insensible—I could not get her to speak to me—she shook her head, but would not speak—she had no shoes on—I called a policeman to look at her—he asked her to get up; I said,</p>

I am one of the resident medical officers of St. George's Hospital—on 19th September the prisoner was brought to the hospital between 6 and 7 in the morning—she presented the usual symptoms of poisoning by some mineral poison; such as what is commonly called precipi<lb></lb>tate—I treated her in the usual manner; and she recovered in about a week, and left the hospital—a tart was given to me by the policeman, covered with a white powder—it had white precipitate on it, to the best of my belief—that would have caused the illness of the prisoner.</p>

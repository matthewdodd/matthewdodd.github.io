                  </hi>. The prisoner was a clerk of mine, and left me on the 27th of April, 1833, He has not been in my service since—I dealt with the prosecuter for some periodicals—this order is not my writing, nor was it written by my order—I did not want the things.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a tradesman who could get a penny of you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I can show receipts for every thing till the execution came—I was doing business respectably, but got into misfortunes, through my family.</p>

The prisoner with a young man came to my room; they were strangers - the young man said he had been looking for my husband for a long time, to tell him of a job; I said, I was much obliged to him, as my husband had been out of work nineteen weeks, and I expected him home at four o'clock; he said, he could tell me of a good place of work - where he could have 5s. a day; I asked them up to my room - the people below called me down; and while I was gone, the prisoner went away, and took a piece of print from off my bedstead.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I have a piece of cotton, which I took in of the prisoner, I believe; on the evening of the 5th of May, in the name of Ann Raffel - she was in the habit of pawning with me.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutrix in the New-road, Somers'-town; she asked me to go and have something to drink in the Rising Sun public-house - we then met the young man; and she insisted upon his coming to the Orange Tree public-house, and having something more - he did not want to go; but she would make him, as he was an old acquaintance - she drank to such excess that she was obliged to send him to tell her sister to come and fetch home her child; she then took us home to tea - she sat on the young man's knee; and said, if her husband came home and found her so intoxicated, he would be angry - she wanted him to take her somewhere for that night; she then said, she had not much money and gave me the print to pawn for her; which I did, for 1s. 6d., and she told me to bring in a quartern of gin, and I gave her the 1s. 3d.</p>
               <p>MRS. MINGARD. I never received the duplicate; there is not a word of truth in what she has stated - the young man was a perfect stranger to me.</p>

I live at 39, Giffard-street, Kingsland-road—I am clerk and manager to Mr. John Jacobs, of Fiusbury-place, South—he advances money on loan—I recollect this proposal coming, I think about 10th September—I afterwards saw the prisoner upon it—I think he came the office on 17th September—I asked him his name and likewise the (name of his security; he said, a Jabez Goody n—he came with a party who he represented as Jabez Goody—a clerk wrote out the guarantee, and I myself gate him the money—I had not seen Jabez Goody before; I had made inquiry about him—the prisoner had previously been there and said that Mr. Goody could not come up then, but he would on the Thursday evening—the prisoner was the applicant for the loan—he signed this paper in my presence—I made inquiries as to Good's responsibility at 17 1/2 Clarence-street, Waterloo-town, Bethnal Green—I afterwards communicated to the prisoner that I had made inquiries about Goody; that was before I paid him the money—I cannot tell the date—the next time I saw him was on 17th, about half-past 8 o'clock in the evening—he then had the other person with him—I asked the prisoner his own name—he said, "George Hart"—I then asked the name of his security, and he said, "John Goody"—he pointed out the man with him as Jabez Goody—I then asked the clerk to make out the guarantee and the I.O.U., and after it was signed, I paid him the money—this is the guarantee (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is signed "J. Goody" this was signed by the party who the prisoner brought, in his presence—I paid the prisoner 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the money was to be lent at ten per cent, to repaid in instalments of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week-8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was deducted for interest, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for book, rules and guarantee.</p>

I live at 17 1/2, Clarence-street, Anglesea-street, Waterloo<lb></lb>town, Bethnal-green—I know the prisoner—he came to ask me to become his security—I should say that was four months before 10th September—I would not swear to the date—it was either the latter end of June, or the beginning of July—I told him I had already been surety for a loan and had been sued in the county court for the arrears, and I did not think any office would take my security, and I should not like to go up and offer myself and be rejected—I neither said that I would or that I would not—the name of J.

I am a detective officer of the City—I was called to 3, Finsbury-place, South, and took the prisoner into custody—he wished to make some statement; I said, "You are not forted to make any statement without you please; whatever you do may be given in evidence against you—he said he was Tory sorry for what he had done; he did not know there was any harm in it; that he had got a person from a public-house opposite, to sign the name of Jabez Goody—I asked him if be knew the man—he said he was a stranger to him—he had never seen him before in this life—(<hi rend="italic">The guarantee was here put in and read</hi>).</p>

In consequence of some delay I called once or twice to know whether they had been there to make inquiry, and he said they had not; be thought they were a set of swindlers. He promised to go with me and get the money; I made two payments and was then taken ill I sent a letter stating the reason. I called on the Monday and they refused to take the money, saying the matter had gone too far, and I was to call on the Tuesday. I went on the Tuesday, and they then gave me into custody. I did not do it with the slightest intention of defrauding. Mr. Jacobs.</p>

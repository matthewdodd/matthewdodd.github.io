                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist, and live in Upper Marylebone-street, in the parish of Saint Marylebone. The prisoner lived in my service about eleven months, and left twelve or thirteen months ago, and went to live with Mr. Le Strange, a surgeon—he was my errand boy—he did not sleep in the house—on Thursday morning, the 17th of August, I heard a noise in the house, but having a monthly nurse in the house I supposed it was her—I was not aware of the time, but I think it was</p>

               <p>between one and four o'clock—I took no notice of it then, but when I got up at seven o'clock in the morning I received information from my shop boy—(he is not here)—I instantly called in a policeman, left him at home, and went to the Marylebone police-office—I first of all examined my house—there was the lock of the till in my shop broken, and the lock of a drawer in the back parlour—about 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money was taken away, also a knife, a canvas bag, a scent-bottle, and a medicine basket—part of the money was in the bag and part not—the back parlour joins the shop, and the door between was not locked—there was not any fastening whatever—the bolt of the back outer door had been forced back—I always look round the house myself the last thing at night, and did so the night before—it was bolted then—I was the last person up in the house except the nurse, and she bad no access to the shop and parlour, because I had locked the door between the passage and the stairs—there is no means of getting to the shop or parlour, except through the door of which I had the key, not from inside the house—that door was fastened in the morning as I had left it—the outer door leads from the back parlour into the back-yard—the bolt was not broken at all—it was forced back by a knife or screw-driver or some instrument—I presume a person could put the blade of a knife through and force it back—my shop boy slept in the back attic—he could not get to the back parlour from the house, as I had the key in my room—he was up before me—he comes and takes the key out of my room to go into the shop, and he did so that morning I presume—he had the key of the door at the time he gave me the information—I presume he had taken it while I was asleep—that was his practice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of directions from Mr. Edwards, I made inquiries for the prisoner, and went on board the Isabella, which laid off the Tower—I heard something of him there, and ultimately succeeded in apprehending him at Wolverhampton, in Staffordshire, on Wednesday, 23rd August, in bed in a house near the church-yard—I told him I was an officer from London, and wanted him on suspicion of robbing Mr. Edwards' house, the chemist and druggist in Marylebone—he said he was very sorry for it; it was his first offence, and he hoped Mr. Edwards would be merciful to him—I had used no threat to him—I cautioned him not to say any thing, nor did I promise him any thing—he seemed quite dejected and very penitent—he got up and dressed himself—I found this knife in his pocket, and a scent-bottle—I asked him where the money was—he said it was in a bag in a cupboard at his brother's, and he would go with me and show me where it was—he dressed and went with me, and his brother gave me a bag with 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it—he then stated that he was extremely sorry for what he had done, it was his first offence, and he behaved very quiet—the bag contained different coins—I found a quantity of wearing apparel, which he said he bought with the money—he said he should never forgive himself, and stated that he got in at a passage about sixteen doors from Mr. Edwards's house, in George-street, and got into the back yard of a house sixteen doors down George-street, which would lead to the back of Mr. Edwards's house, between eleven and twelve at night—he got over several garden walls, and secreted himself in a water-closet, and about one o'clock in the morning he got over another wall till he came to a very high wall, where he got up find caught hold of the window-sill, which gave way, and he fell back, that he after wards got over a wall to Mr. Edwards's wall, and let himself down there with a rope—he then went up to a back window, and with a screw</p>

               <p>driver which he had borrowed, he succeeded in removing the bolt, and got into the back parlour through the door—that he went and opened the street door, so that if he had heard any body coming down he could have got away—that he then opened the bureau, and took the money out—I am quite sure he told me all this without any promise or threat—he told about twenty people about it as well—he said he took the medicine basket, but threw that away in the fields near Holloway—that he was very sorry for what he had done, and could not account for it, but he hoped Mr. Ed wards would be merciful to him—this paper is his writing (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I saw him write part of it—the gaoler of Marylebone Office received it from him in the cell—I can swear it is the prisoner's writing, because I have got some of his writing at home—(a letter I saw him write)—I saw him write part of this—the words are the same as those I saw him write he said he was going to write to his master to ask his forgiveness—I saw him write a letter at Wolverhampton—this is dated Birmingham, but he wrote it in London—I brought him to town—this letter was written at the police-station in Judd-street, New Road, after I brought him to town—the letter I saw him write at Wolverhampton was in pencil—to the best of my belief the rest of that letter is his writing—I firmly believe it to be his—I saw him write so far as "So help me God"—I have the letter he wrote at Wolverhampton—he gave it me for his brother-in-law—I have kept that ever since—I showed it to his brother, but did not part with it.</p>

"24th of August.—Dear brother, believe me that when I came to Mr. Hampton I had not the least idea of getting you into trouble, but I hope God and yourself will pardon me this crime. Oh!

You received me into your house through ignorance. Forgive me, and may God bless you instead of letting you down through me, is the prayer of G. M. Evans.

               <p>"To Mr. Joseph Edwards, Marylebone-street.—Sir, I most humbly crave your forgiveness for this transaction, and beg your clemency and mercy—and the following was what I was going to do with the money.

I was going to trade next week with 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in order to pay you at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week, the following: 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stolen—for opening each door, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 2 drawer-locks, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; till-lock, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; total, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. interest for one year, being interest at 50 per cent., would make 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 93/4d.; and believe me, that had you lodged 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the drawer I should not have taken more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but, Sir, I beg mercy at your hands, you knowing that hitherto my character was irreproachable, as you yourself can testify. Most humbly I beg forgiveness, and hope you will plead for me in the Court of Justice, as pure poverty is the cause</p>

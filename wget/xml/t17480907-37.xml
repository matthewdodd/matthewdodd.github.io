               <p>Q. At what time?</p>
               <p>Smith . At 11 o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took these things from you?</p>
               <p>Smith. Mary Mills. She followed me as I came out of my boat; and I lost my watch and chain. I lost one handkerchief out of my pocket, and the other off my neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel these things taken from you?</p>
               <p>Smith. I felt my watch taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you feel your handkerchief taken off your neck?</p>
               <p>Smith . Yes; it was tied but with one knot. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174809070016"></xptr> prisoner asked me if I wanted company, and I went and sat down upon a dunghill in Somerset-yard , and she came and sat down by me, and pulled at the chain of my watch several times, and she got the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you secure her then?</p>
               <p>Smith . She called out to several people, and I was afraid of losing the other things I had about me; and I thought I should meet with her another time.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw her do it, did you?</p>
               <p>Smith. I saw her take my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take her up?</p>
               <p>Smith. Last Sunday morning, in Catherine-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in liquor when you lost these things?</p>
               <p>Smith . I was a little, but I was very sensible, tho' I had not the use of my legs ; and I carried her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard any thing of these things since?</p>
               <p>Smith. The watch was sold for 18 s. and she said she wished she had known my buckles had been silver; if she had, she would have had them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not he speak when I took hold of his watch?</p>
               <p>Smith. She called out to somebody, and I was afraid.</p>

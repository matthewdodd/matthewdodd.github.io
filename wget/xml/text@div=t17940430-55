               <p>Q. Did not you tell her it would be better for her if she told? - yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then don't tell us one word what she said about it; were all the things found under that confession? - Yes, the things were found the next day at the pawnbroker's by my father, all the things were found together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when your mother's muslin apron was missing? - No, I cannot recollect, she had wore it the day before; I see the things again when I came before the justice, the pawnbroker brought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of these things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know your father's silver spoon, and your mother's muslin apron? - Yes, I know it, and she knows it too.</p>

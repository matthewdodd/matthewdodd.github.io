On the 22nd of February I was intoxicated—the prisoner was drinking with me—I went to bed that night, and I then had my jacket—I missed it about eleven o'clock the next day—I charged the prisoner with having taken it—he said he knew nothing about it—this is my jacket.—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

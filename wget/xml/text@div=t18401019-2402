               <p>satisfaction of both parties, that a clerk in the office of the said plaintiff, in<lb></lb>stead of preparing a second warrant of attorney, as supposed by the said defendant, had, to save expense, altered the date of the said first and only warrant of attorney to the 19th day of September, and got the same again executed, and which he, on or about the 6th of October, got duly stamped and filed after the negotiation with the said Mr. Allen had terminated, and which said alteration was made without any willful intention, but in the spirit of the said original understanding and agreement for delaying the stamping and filing of the said warrant of attorney: And whereas the said discovery last mentioned has led to an amicable adjustment of all disputes between the said parties, and the said defendant doth hereby agree to cause his life to be insured in the Asylum Insurance Office to collaterally secure the due payment of the debt due from him to the said plaintiff; and the said plaintiff doth agree to obtain and deposit the deeds of the said brewery with Mr. Riccards, the attorney of the said defendant, who is to receive the rents from the 25th of March instant. And lastly, it is agreed that a cer<lb></lb>tain action of replevin of Bye v. Bower and Crook, now pending, under a distress levied on the said brewery and premises, by or in the name of one Samuel Bower, but at the instance of the said Samuel Twaites, shall be discontinued, and all proceedings under the said levy or distress shall henceforth cease and determine.

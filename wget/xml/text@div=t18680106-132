                  </hi>. I live at 3, Newton Street, Holborn, and am a cattle-dealer by trade—I know George Gould, otherwise Bristowe, who was convicted at this Court last Session—I received a subpoena to attend here on the Tuesday, about the middle of the day—I have not got it with me; I destroyed it—I attended here on the Thursday to give evidence against Gould—on the Monday before that Thursday I saw the prisoner in Portugal Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields—Mr. Robson was with me—I had some words with the prisoner—I began with him first—I had had a good deal to drink—as to what took place between us I can't say—there were several words and a good deal of swearing, but as to the particulars that took place I can't say, further than a quarrel—I was examined before the Magistrate—my evidence was taken down and read over, and I signed it—I believe I said to the prisoner, "Don't you interfere with me, or I shall knock your teeth down your throat"—ho said, "You are interfering, I have found you out, you are giving Mr. Robson and Mr. Phipps some information"—I said, "I know nothing about it, I never appeared to any transaction, I am not a witness in any shape or form," no more I was—I don't remember anything being said about my giving evidence here against Bristowe—the prisoner said, "I believe you are inciting Mr. Robson against my father, or something of that sort—I said, "I know nothing about it, I have enough to do to trouble my head with my own business"—I did not hear the prisoner say, "I will settle you before I have done with you, and if you appear against the old man I will rip your b—guts up"—I did not say so before the Magistrate, not that I remember—he never made use of such expressions—we had been drinking in the neighbourhood eight or ten days—I have drunk with him before and since—I had been upset a good deal in business, and had been drinking for a fortnight, and, to tell you the truth, I don't know what he did say—I don't remember his saying if I appeared at the Old Bailey and gave evidence against George Bristowe ho would twist my b——neck—I can't say what day it was that I was before the Magistrate—I don't know whether he said, "You d——old villain, you are giving them the <hi rend="italic">tip</hi>, "I was so in liquor—I was in liquor when I was at Bow Street. not when I gave evidence here; I had been drinking, but I knew then what I was saying—I don't know whether the prisoner said to me, "I will punch your b——head"—I believe there was some swearing—I told him I would knock his teeth down his throat—I don't remember his saying I had been in prison.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, and live at 29, Liquorpond Street, Gray's Inn Road—on Monday evening, 16th December, about a quarter to eight, I met Mr. Day in Portugal Street—while I was with him the prisoner came up and said, "You d——old villain, you are giving them the <hi rend="italic">tip</hi>"—that was the first thing I heard—he then came closer and said, "I will punch your b——head," and he lifted up his hand and was about to strike him, but I prevented him; he threw his right hand out from his body, as a man would do if he was about to strike another; he was quite close to him and could have reached him, when I went in between them—he then said, "I will wring your b—neck if you arc giving any information against the old man"—he entered into a</p>

               <p>variety of accusations as to his being an old thief, and having been in prison a multitude of times, and so on, but nothing further relating to the case, and after a good deal of squabble of that kind he went away—I attended at this Court when Gould, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Bristowe, was tried—I saw the man Day called as a witness—I also saw the prisoner called as a witness for the defence—on the Tuesday, about a quarter-past two, I was standing at the front entrance to the Court and saw a crowd assembled, and I saw the prisoner, in a threatening attitude against Day, making use of language which I could not bear, and he was removed by a City Constable, who threatened to take him into custody if he repeated it—on the Monday, in Portugal Street, Day never said a syllable to the prisoner before the prisoner spoke to him; he could not see him, because he came from behind us.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long were they together on the Monday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some five or ten minutes; I was talking with Day before the prisoner came up in company with another man—after the prisoner spoke to him he might have made some reply, I can't say; I would not say that he did or did not—he said nothing that I noticed—after he threatened to wring his neck there was a little recrimination—they did not afterwards adjourn to the Black Jack public-house—Day went away with me, and continued with me an hour at least; we went from there to Bow Street, and saw the inspector who had the case in hand against Bristowe—I should think the prisoner was as sober then as he is now—I had seen him on one other occasion I believe—I firmly believe he was quite sober.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on 19th December in the New Court in this building, on the day of Gould's second trial—after I got him into the street a person named Henry Day (not the witness, a son of his I believe, who was examined for the defence) and some others came pushing up against me, saying, "What are you going to do with him?" and so on—another constable who was with me kept them off, and I took him to the station—I must say the prisoner himself did not offer any resistance.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Seymour-street, St. Pancras. I was at the bar at Mrs. Buxton's on the Saturday—the prisoners came in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184111290038"></xptr>
               <p>and sat down along with me in the bar, and had several pints of ale—I did not drink with them the first time—they forced their conversation on me very much—I missed a glass the first time—they got up in an hour and wished me good day, and in about three or four hours they both returned—Stone challenged me to toss for half-a-pint of porter—I tossed, beat him, and fetched it—after we drank it I saw Borton take a glass and put it into his pocket—I saw Stone take some tobacco and put it into his pocket—they went out, and I called to the landlady—I went out, saw a constable, and told him—he ordered me to take charge of one while he laid hold of them— Borton took a glass from his pocket and passed it to Stone—I took it and gave it to the constable—I siezed Stone, and he took the tobacco from his pocket, struck me and cut my mouth open—I said to the policeman, "Spring your rattle or they will get him away," and further assistance came.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 140.) I received information from Harding, and followed the two prisoners down to Battle-bridge—I went in front of them and said they were my prisoners for stealing some tobacco from Mrs. Buxton—they said they knew nothing at all about it—I got hold of them, and saw the glass pass from Borton towards Stone, which Harding took from his hand—I then saw something pass from one of their hands, (I cannot swear which,) over into the hospital field—I afterwards procured a light, and saw a young man pick up the glass and a portion of tobacco—I gave it to Harding, who took; it to the station—the glass and tobacco laid both together—Stone said, "I am innocent of what my friend has done, I know nothing about it"—I did not see any blows given to Harding—there was a great crowd round us—I called Harding to assist me, and sprung my rattle.</p>

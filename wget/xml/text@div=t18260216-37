On the 7th of December, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I went out with my wife, leaving nobody in the house; it was just dark when I returned; I had left the front door locked, and the windows fastened; I found the window sash taken out, and a box, which contained the articles stated in the indictment, were taken from under the window; they were worth 3l. 9s. 6d.; I have not found them. I know the prisoners well by sight; I had not seen them near my house that day - I saw them in custody on the 27th of January.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Was it a large dark box? A. No; a smallish old box - it had been painted red, but the colour was a good deal worn; the lid had been joined, but not painted; I do not know Harry Lane; there are only two rooms to my house - there was a broken pane of glass which they could put their hands through, and take a pane out; nobody could get in without taking the sash out.</p>

            . I am eight years and three months old, (this witness, upon being questioned, appeared perfectly aware of the nature of an oath); I live next door but one to Allford. I was standing at the top of Wood's-buildings, about ten yards from Allford's house, and saw two persons at his house; there was a gas-light at the top of the court, but I could distinguish their features without the lamp at first, as it was not dark when I first saw them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160030"></xptr>- I saw them for about half an hour; I am quite sure the prisoners are the persons; there was a hole in the window - they put a hand in, drew the nail out, and put it down the gully hole - the window remained in its place; they lifted it up and got into the house - one of them got inside the house, and the box was shoved through the window - they put it into a cart and drove away with it - there was day light enough to see them when they opened the window; I saw them again about week after, in Devonshire place; I had seen them before the robbery, and am quite sure I cannot be mistaken in them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first mention that you had seen persons get into the house? A. Allford's wife was at the water cock next day, and we told her of it - I told her I knew them and their names - William Bean, and the other is called Taylor - we called him by that name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know where they lived? A. No; they were taken up a good bit afterwards - it was a fortnight after, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not seven weeks before they were taken? A. Yes; they were taken in Devonshire-place - I did not see them afterward till then - one had a black coat on, and the other a light white one; I could only see Taylor's waistcoat, as Bean's coat was buttoned up - they had their hats on all the time; I was rather further from them than I am now; I did not go home, but played about with some other boys - it was dark when they went away - there is a gas-light at the top of Wood's-buildings; I went round to the front of Allford's house, and saw them - I peeped round the corner; I do not know Harry Lane; Shipley and two or three others were playing with me.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 26th of January, I heard of this house being broken open; I saw Sumers and Shipley on that day; on the 27th of January I took up both the prisoners, from the description Sumers gave me; I told them the charge - they denied it - Allford was with me; they had a cart and donkey with them when I took them; Summers called Swiles by the name of Taylor - he is called so by the boys - he is a tailor - and they call him mad tailor.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, in North-street - about the length of a short street from Allford's. I heard of this robbery about three hours after it happened - about half-past four o'clock that afternoon, I was going out of my room door to call my children into tea - it was nearly dark - I saw a young man whom they call Harry Lane, with a box - it appeared to be large - I could not see the colour - and by the time I had shut my door I heard somebody going up stairs, and heard a woman say, "What have you got there?" my children made such a noise, I could not distinctly hear - but I heard her say to the man,"Take it down, or I will kick it down stairs;" after that I saw the man go by the window with a box - I think, by the light, it must have been brown or black; I did not give information about it - but when I heard the prisoners were taken, I mentioned it to their friends.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the prisoners before? A. Yes, for a long time; Swile is a tailor by trade, but sells things in the street - he has an ass and hampers. Bean gets his living in the same way.</p>
               <p>JURY to JAMES LEA. Q. Did you take the prisoners from the description which Sumers gave of their persons or only their names? A. He described their persons as well; he said one was dressed in black, and the other in a light coat; they were so dressed when I took them.</p>

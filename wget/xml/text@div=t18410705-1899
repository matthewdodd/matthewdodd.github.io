                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Samuel Morgan Lewis, who is a hosier, and lives at No. 164, Strand, in the parish of St. Mary-le-Strand—he resides in the house—I was there on the night of the 22nd of June—the door was not shut, nor the windows—about nine o'clock that night all was safe, and about ten the officer came—I found the window was then broken, and four or five bundles of handkerchiefs bad been taken out—forty handkerchiefs at least—I have never seen them since.</p>

I saw the prisoner and two other youths come along the Strand that night—they went to the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's window—the prisoner went between the other two, and did something to the window in a stooping position—then one of the others went and put his hand in and took something out—the prisoner and the other stood aside—they then separated—I took the prisoner, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him into a shop—I found on him this instrument, which corresponds exactly with three holes by the side of the glass—there was a piece cut quite out—one of the others was carrying this umbrella, which he gave to the prisoner, and he had it in his hand when I took him.</p>

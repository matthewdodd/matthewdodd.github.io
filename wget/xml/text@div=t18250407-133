At the end of January, I left a trunk with the prisoner, with the articles in it stated in the indictment; I locked the box and had the key with me - I went to Upton, and returned on the 15th of March; I then found the prisoner in the lower room, and asked her to assist me up stairs with a bundle and a trunk which I had in my hand; she told me she was sorry that she had a young woman lodging with her, and I could not remain there; I said it was of no consequence - she sat down, on the bed while I opened the things I had brought with me; after she was gone I unlocked the trunk I had left with her, and missed most of the things from it; I believe the hasp had been taken off; I then went to Mr. Whiting's who had recommended me to the prisoner's lodgings and she came with me to her - an officer was sent for, and we all went up stairs together - the officer searched, and between the bed and the sacking, my stays were found which I had left in my box; behind her box was one shift; a box of hers was looked over, and in it was found the gown and the pair of pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How do you know the things? A. They were most of them marked by myself; I slept in the room that she does - she keeps a school and sells milk; I do not know who had lodged there while I was away; she occupies the whole house which has but two rooms in it.</p>

            . I went with Lundy to the prisoners, on Tuesday the 15th of March - I searched between the bed and sacking, and found the stays; the prisoner said it was her bed; I found in a box which she called hers, a gown, a shift, a handkerchief, and a bonnet; she gave no account, of the things, but seemed much agitated; I found some other things behind the box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the bed made at this time? A. Yes; the box was not locked.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of going in and out - I never opened the box: she came on the 15th of March, and ran up stairs; I went after her, and sat down on the bed. I saw the things she had brought with her, and said, I was glad to see she had got so many things; she then sent me down, and staid about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - she then came down and went out, and came back with Mrs. Whiting, and said she was robbed; I said,</p>
               <p>"Dear me, how can that be, I have no one here to rob you." Mrs. Whiting said,</p>
               <p>"If you don't produce the tickets, or the things, I will fetch an officer." I said,</p>

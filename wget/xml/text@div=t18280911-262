I did not know the prisoner was there - I never gave him permission to reside there; I paid Jane Thompson 15l. in the middle of July, and at the beginning of August 20l., taking then a receipt for 35l. - they were in 5l. notes, some of which came from Messrs. Barclay and Co., and some from Mr. Lanson; I did not take the numbers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you given this young woman permission to let any man sleep in the house? A. No - I knew a man of the name of McKenzie, but he is dead; I have known the prisoner since the beginning of 1826 - he was my servant for ten or eleven months in 1826, and I gave him a good character, and since then have taken him into my service.</p>
               <p>MR. SHARPE. Q. Was not McKenzie a servant of yours? A. He was - I made no stipulation for either the prisoner or McKenzie to stay in the house; I thought it better that Thompson should have some female to stay - McKenzie was not then in my service; I remember now that there was an accusation against the prisoner - a female servant in my house accused him of having stolen two guineas, or 2l.; I investigated the matter, and found no proof - I thought it extremely improbable, and dismissed it from my mind.</p>

            . I lived with Mr. Gull as housekeeper; I received 35l. from him; my husband was a captain in the West India service, and sailed in a vessel which has never been heard of - McKenzie had been in Mr. Gull's service, and he was at that time up from Scotland to get a situation; Mr. Gull gave him leave to be in the house, and the prisoner came to the house - I told him to stop and have a cup of tea with me after the family were gone; he said Mr. Gull sent him there to see McKenzie, who was there at tea - he said he did not know where to get a lodging, and I said he might stay in the house; the last time I saw my money was at one o'clock, on the 4th of August, when the landlord and his wife were at the house with four ladies - McKenzie came and knocked at the door, and asked if the prisoner was ready to go out; my money was at that time in a trunk in my room; I took it away at night, and put it there in the morning - the prisoner took a shirt to go up stairs; I went up to the room, and saw him sitting on the bed cutting his toe-nails - I retired from the room, and went up stairs with the ladies and the landlady to look at the house; the prisoner went into the room a second time - McKenzie said to him, "Are you not ready yet;" they then went out: about six o'clock I missed my money - no other person had been in the room but the prisoner; I found my two trunks tumbled about - the prisoner had seen me put my money in the trunk the day I received it; when he left the house he said he should not be long, but he never returned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you permission from Mr. Gull to let any man sleep in the house? A. No, but I told him they were going to sleep there, and he never said they were or they were not - he said he would send a woman to sleep there; I will swear I told Mr. Gull that I was going to let the prisoner and McKenzie sleep in the house - he made no answer, or if he did, he made such an answer as no one could understand; I told Mrs. Gull I was going to pay a bill with the notes, but I paid it with some other money - I told her I was going to pay 20l. to a person in Regent-street, but I did not pay it out of the notes; there was no other person in the house, but the prisoner and McKenzie, the landlady, four ladies, and a little girl; a man came to the door for some linen. but he did not come in - the washer-woman was not in the house that day; I never said so, that I recollect - if I did say so before the Magistrate, it was a mistake; a man came after the furniture, but he came no further than the hall - I gave no warning when I went into the room, where the prisoner was cutting his toe nails; he was preparing to dress himself - his trousers were on; he came down into the kitchen, a minute or two afterwards; before that day he had dressed in the butler's pantry - he had slept in the room till he took the money, and then he never came again: his boxes were left in the house with his clothes and all his things - they were searched, but nothing was found; Mc Kenzie was taken up - he was acquitted and died in three days afterwards; I always said he was innocent.</p>
               <p>MR. SHARPE. Q. On the morning of the robbery, the prisoner was in the house? A. Yes, at half-past eleven o'clock, in the room where the trunk and money were; no other person was in the room that day - he did not go out dressed - he left his shirt in the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he see you put the money into the trunk? A. He saw me with the book in my hand that day; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110145"></xptr>knew the money was in one of the trunks - he saw me put it in on the 1st of August, in that same room; he had no further opportunity of knowing the money was in the trunk that morning, but seeing the pocket-book in my hand - when I was putting the trunks to rights, my keys were on a little table in the kitchen, and when he was gone, my trunks were still locked.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the office; he said he lived in York-street. which I found to be the case: I went into the room in York-street, he said he had been to the Leith and Berwick wharf - that he had been on board the Sir William Wallace packet to see if a letter had been brought up for McKenzie, and he had seen the steward and the cook - I was then sent out, and returned about two o'clock; the prisoner then stated that he had eleven shillings or twelve shillings in his pocket - he said he had got nineteen shillings for a Scotch not which he had exchanged near the Haymarket, and bought a bottle of whiskey, paid some money to a green grocer, and a score to a man who lived in the Edgware-road; I calculated the whole together, and it was twentyfour or twenty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You say he told you where he slept? A. Yes; the robbery was committed on the Monday; he was on the wharf on the Tuesday - I searched his trunk, but found nothing belonging to the prosecutrix.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Leith and Berwick Smack Company. On the 5th of August, the prisoner came with another man to enquire if they could get Scotch notes for gold - I said the clerk who had the Scotch notes were not in the way, but just then Mr. Thompson came in, and I referred to him; the prisoner's companion went to him - the prisoner said nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was not asking gold for notes? A. No; Scotch notes for gold.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw neither gold nor notes? A. No, I recommended them where they could get notes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. GULL. Q. Do you remember that woman telling you she was about to allow the prisoner and McKenzie to sleep in the house? A. She proposed to me that they should come to the house, and I said"That is a thing I by no means approve of;" I did not mumble that, she perfectly understood it, because the answer came immediately, "Very well, Sir," and on the same afternoon my house-maid went to ask whether the female servant whom I wanted to sleep with Jane Thompson, could not come - I expressed my disapprobation in a tone that she could not have avoided understanding, and she said, "Very well, Sir."</p>

And if you should take them, say I, for God's Sake send me word. He went away, and I saw no more of him that Night. I met him a few Days after in Bond-street; and, says he, Mr. Elton has been no Loser by the Frenchmen; for I can prove that he has rather got 2 or three Guineas.</p>

               <p>Sherrard. I arrested Cray at the Prisoner's Suit for 17 l. 16 s. at a Coffehouse facing the Bagnio. Says Cray in broken English. Vel mine dear Shile, vare is dis Master Taylore? I vill pay him presaant. I call'd the Prisoner in, he spoke with Cray, and then said to me, let's go to another Place, and I shall get Satisfaction. We took Coach and drove to the King's Arms Tavern in New Bond Street; there we met with a Gentleman in Black; the Prisoner and that Gentleman went out together (leaving me with Cray) and came in again with a Porter, who brought a Trunk. The Prisoner then desir'd me to step out with him, which I did. He gave me a Guinea and a half for my Trouble, and told me that he had made it up, that he had got the Suit of Cloaths back which he had made for Cray, and 2 Guineas, besides a Silver-hilted Sword (which I had taken from Cray for fear of Mischief) and an old Velvet Furniture embroidered with Gold, which (he said) was not of much Value. So I left them between 9 and 10 at Night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Duchire. About 8 o'Clock on Monday Night, 2 Gentlemen came in a Coach to Conduit-Street Coffee-house by Hanover Square, and brought a Portmanteau, and a Brace of Pistols with them.

            . I lived with Mr. Elton; and the Day we came from the Wells, he sent me to tell the Prisoner, that he would speak with him. I asked the Prisoner if he had heard of De Vic and Cray. He said he believed he knew where they were, and would help to take them up; for he was 15 l. out of Pocket by a Suit of Cloaths he had sold to one of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I not say I would tell your Master where the things were?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. No, you said you thought you could tell him where the Men were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Elton. On Thursday Morning about 8, I came home from the Wells. Mrs. Gibbons having acquainted me with the Robbery, told me that the Prisoner came in 2 or 3 Hours after, and she inform'd him of it; and he swore, God damn them, he'd have them, and that she believ'd he knew where they were. I sent my Man to the Prisoner's House in the Strand. In the mean time Mr. Watson the Serjeant came in, and said he had got a Letter from De Vic, who with Cray was then at Gravesend. While we were talking, the Prisoner came in trembling, and said, Are you the Gentleman that has been robb'd? Dogs! Rogues! Villains! Damn them! And pray, Sir, what have you lost? I told him several things, and among them a Velvet embroidered Housing; says he, I believe I can help you to the Housing. I was just upon taking Coach for Gravesend, and as I was going out, I said I had lost some Cambrick Handkerchiefs. When I came to Gravesend, I put up at the Swan, and enquired after De Vic and Cray. The Landlord told me that they had been committed to the Care of the Constable; but as no Body came to accuse them, they were left at their Liberty to walk about the Town. I happen'd to see them just as they were coming down Stairs. Cray gave me the Key of his Trunk, and said, Your Housing is at Mr. Maine's and your Ring at Mr. Darker's. I brought them up in the Yatcht; and as soon as I came home, my Maid told me, that the Prisoner sent home my Housings in about an Hour after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060037"></xptr> I was gone. I was advised to carry De Vic and Cray before a Magistrate directly; but they being fatigued with their Journey, were laid down upon my Bed; and I said, Let the poor Devils sleep, for they have had but little rest this Week. And they slept 5 Hours.</p>
               <p>When I went before Justice De Veil, I sent for the Prisoner to bring the Box with the Handkerchiefs, but he would not come till the Justice threatened to send a Warrant for him; but when he did come he brought the Cambrick Handkerchiefs with him, and said, How do you know these to be yours? I know them by the Marks, says I, and I don't know but you may have been an Accessary in helping the Men off, and at a proper Opportunity I shall take Notice of you. God damn you, says he, what do you mean by that? I have not yet got sufficient Evidence, says I, but when I have I shall answer you in another place. Aye, God damn you, says he, and I shall make an Example of you for scandalizing me. I told him I was not to be frighted by his Menaces, and so we parted. Prisoner. Did you not thank me for returning your Housings? Elton. Yes; but I did not then know what Sherrard could swear.</p>

At this the Prosecutor was affronted, and said, if you receive stolen Goods, you ought to bring them here; and the Prisoner answer'd, if you be so angry you may fetch 'em your self, and so went out; when he was gone, the Prosecutor told the Justice, that he believ'd the Prisoner had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060038"></xptr> assisted De Vic and Cray to make their escape, by helping them to a Boat. When the Prisoner came in again, I told him what the Prosecutor had insinuated, upon which they quarrell'd.</p>

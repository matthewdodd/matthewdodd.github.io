               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where do you live? A. At Hammersmith; I do not know the name of my friend who came up - I had been in his company two or three times; the Magistrate adjourned the case for me to produce him, but I could not find him; I have met him at the Crown public-house; I had no gilt coins about me; I did not ask her to take me home - I did not feel her hand in my pockets; the money was in my trousers, and the handkerchief and purse in my coat pocket; I had been drinking, but nothing to make me elevated; I had spent the evening at Mr. Walker's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long were you with her? A. Not above three minutes; I thought I could get away without the watchman.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was called about a quarter to one o'clock - I was in Grosvenor-place; the prisoner, prosecutor, and another person were talking - the other man told me to part them; the prosecutor and his friend then went and had a few words together: the prosecutor then came back and said, "You have robbed me of a sovereign, 3s. 6d., and a handkerchief;" I saw the handkerchief hanging under her arm; he took it from her, and as he stooped to take up a parcel he found a purse on it; I found no sovereign on her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Till this private whispering there was no charge against her? A. No; the prosecutor was sober - I searched but could find no sovereign; a gilt farthing fell down on going to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me this pocket-piece for a shilling.</p>

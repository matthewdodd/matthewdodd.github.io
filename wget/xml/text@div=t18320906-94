            . I am a drover, and attend Smithfield-market; I remember seeing the ewe between four and five o'clock in the morning in the pens with other sheep; I did not see it any more till twelve o'clock in the day, when we were taking it home with some other sheep which she came with in the morning, belonging to a person named Wilkinson; the prisoner came and took that sheep away from the others - he carried it off; I knew he had no right to it, and asked why he took it; he said it was a sheep he had put into the pens in the morning - it has never been found since.</p>
               <p>EDWARD JENKINS. I am a drover. I was standing with the sheep from the first thing in the morning till they were taken out at dinner time - Goss came and laid hold of this sheep; I asked what he was going to do with it - he said to put into the pens, where he had put it before; I told him it was ours - he called me a liar, and would not let me have it; it was my master's, and I had charge of it all the morning - it was a Kent ewe; the prisoner said it was a little half-bred sheep.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I caught the sheep at half-past ten in the morning, running round the market, with three dogs after it; it is a regular thing to take a sheep or bullock that runs loose, to take care of - Smith asked me for it afterwards; I showed it to him, and he took it.</p>

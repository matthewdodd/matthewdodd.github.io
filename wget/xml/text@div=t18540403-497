                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, G</hi> 14). I went to the prisoner's lodgings, in Wells-street, Jewin-street, in March last, with Mollineaux, another officer—the prisoner opened the door, and was immediately given into custody of Mollineaux—I went into the back parlour, which is a bedroom—his wife was in bed; it was about 7 o'clock in the morning—I made a search, and found in a box in the bedroom nineteen sovereigns, one half sovereign, two bracelets, and a gold ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found a quantity of tissue and brown paper in different parts of the room—this is some of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in the front room I found this cigar case, these three dinner mats, some silk fringe, some gimp, a piece of lace, a leather wrapper, and other articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for the cigar case—he said he bought it two years ago—I have retained it ever since—three or four days afterwards I went with a person named Lee-worthy, in consequence of information I received from him, to the house of the prisoner's mother, No. 4, Radcliff gardens—it was after he was com<lb></lb>mitted for trial—I found in the kitchen some wrappering and some paper (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the trimming department. This piece of leather wrapping is the property of my employers—we missed one of this description; I have no doubt of this being it—I have been in the habit of purchasing tissue paper for my employers for some years—I have bought paper of this description precisely like this; we have missed some, and I believe this to be the property of my employers—it is only used in one part of the house, the upholstery and trimming department—I have purchased similar dinner mats to these for the prosecutors, but I have not missed any, as I have left that department these two or three years; but to the best of my belief they are my employers'; they are of foreign manufac<lb></lb>ture—it was the duty of Coombes and Wells to take care of the paper—I purchased paper, and handed it to them; they kept the key, and whoever wanted paper had to ask one of them—here is a quire and a half of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am manager of the upholstery department. This paper would be in the custody of Wells and Coombes—I have examined it, and believe it to be the property of my employers; I have no doubt of it—we divide the quires in half, and string them up by the corners; and in a portion of this I find holes similar to what we make; it would be taken away a sheet at a time, torn away from the string—this does not bear evidence of having been torn—some weeks before the robbery was dis<lb></lb>covered, I required a large portion of this paper, and sent a boy to Coombes and Wells, who returned with the answer that it had all been used; I was quite certain that it had not, and went to them; they each said, more than once, that it had all been used—these mats are such as I have purchased.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In what numbers do you purchase them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In dozens and grosses; but we never had but a dozen like this—I used to send a boy for tissue paper, it might be twice a week; no one else in the house</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the silk and jewellery department These bracelets produced are such as we have in stock; I buy such goods at Birmingham for my employers, and believe these to be theirs, as also this cigar case—there is printed German paper in the lining of it; that is in it when it comes from Germany—we had some samples of this description in October last, and when we came to mark off the goods we missed them—they were sent to us from Berlin.</p>

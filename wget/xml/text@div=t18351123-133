                  </hi>. I am constable of Portsoken Ward. On the 24th of November, I was on duty near the Cock Tavern, in Thread<lb></lb>needle-street, about two o'clock, and saw the two prisoners standing against the tavern, with this roll of sacking between them—I called a policeman—Collins then took up the sacking, and put it on his shoulder—he went up Threadneedle-street, towards Bishopsgate; and Griffin followed him—Collins then put it down—Griffin took it up, and went on—Collins turned, and saw me and the policeman close behind Griffin, and then ran away—the policeman took Griffin, and I went and took Collins—this is the sacking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. James Crichton, who lives in Pancras-lane. I know this sacking belongs to our stock—It is marked—I missed it, when the officer brought it—we have not sold it.</p>

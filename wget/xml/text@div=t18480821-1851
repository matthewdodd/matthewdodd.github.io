On the morning of 14th July, between seven and eight o'clock, I was outside the Crown public-house, drinking with the prisoners—I had a basket with a pair of braces, an old shirt, an old stock<lb></lb>ing, and one old shoe in it—I went into the public-house with Thompson, leaving my basket on the seat outside, and when I came out it was gone—the other two prisoners had remained outside—I made an excuse to go away, and the female prisoner and another would go with me—I had been at work with the two men in the haytime—I made an excuse to leave them, and went into Mr. Coster's farm-yard, about a quarter or half a mile from the Crown—I saw them looking back—I went along the meadow, across a path which brought me into the high-road again, on purpose to get away fron them—as I went along, the three men ran after me—I thought they should not have my money, and put two lots of money in the hedge—I left a sove<lb></lb>reign in my pocket, in paper—I thought they would not find it all—they could have seen me put it there—they came up to me and said nothing, but threw me down—when I was down, they said I had their money—Thompson was at my legs, one who is not here, at the forepart of me, and the other searched my watch-pocket and pulled the money out—I am sure there was a sovereign there—they pulled my shoes off, and then my trowsers and shook them—I did not see anything fall out—I had a comb there, and a watch</p>

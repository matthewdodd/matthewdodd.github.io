I went; he took hold of me again; I told him again I was willing to go before a magistrate.

            . I was going down Swallow street, towards St. James's church; at the corner of Maddox street, I perceived a man pulling a woman very roughly; I crossed over the way; he then had hold of her by her left arm, which he endeavoured to twist round, swearing at the same time that he would break her arm; I asked him what the woman had done that he was using her so ill in that way; he said she had stole a pair of stockings from him at the Green Dragon public house, at the corner of Maddox street; she said she had not; I told him if he thought she had got them to get a constable and have her searched; he seemed to be very much in liquor; he still persisted in saying that if she did not deliver the stockings up he would break her arm; the woman seemed to be in great pain, and a gentleman who was present seized him by the collar, loosed his hand from her arm, and told her to go about her business. She went as far as the end of Hanover street, when the prisoner followed her, seized her again, brought her to the Green Dragon door, and endeavoured to go into the house, but the landlord of the house pushed him out, and said he would have no more of him: then I told him he had better take the woman to Marlborough street; she said she was willing to go any where before a magistrate. They went down Swallow street into Little Argyle street, where I lost sight of them; I went down Swallow street to where I was going; I stopped to speak to a person at the end of Conduit street, and happening to turn my head, I saw the prisoner running down Swallow street, he had got a something in his hand that appeared like a shawl that the woman had upon her neck; I saw the witness Gibbs running after him, I pursued him down Conduit street, I overtook him in Maddox street; I asked him what he had done with the shawl that he had in his hand, he said if you will go into that house we will have something to drink, and I will tell you all about it; I told him I would not; he immediately darted across the street and ran up Swallow street into Hanover street, Hanover square, crossed Hanover street to the door of Hanover square room; there he took the shawl from his hat and threw it down that area; he ran across Hanover square, turned up Prince's street, there I lost sight of him; I did not see any more of him till I saw him in the hands of Mr. Plank, the constable; I stopped at the door of Hanover room, and the man brought me the shawl out of the area, and I delivered it to Mr. Plank.</p>
               <p>Plank. I have got the shawl and handkerchief; I received the shawl from the witness Richardson. The handkerchief was thrown down the area at the corner of Prince's street, Hanover square; I saw it there; I asked Mr. Elliot's servant to bring it me; he did.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The woman and me were drinking at the Green Dragon in Swallow street, I had a new pair of stockings in my hat on the bench; I went out to make water; while I was gone she ran away with the stockings; they cost me two shillings and nine pence; the people in the house told me to run and fetch her back; I ran and overtook her in the street; I catched my hand upon her shoulder, and the shawl came off in my hand; she drawed a mob of people around me; I set off and run down the street, I threw the shawl down the area; the people ran after me, I was very much in liquor: the constable met me in the street and took me to the office. The woman had been asking me to go home with her before; I was to give her half a crown to stay all night.</p>
               <p>Plank. I think it my duty to state that the woman was in liquor at the time; I do not think she hardly knew what she was doing of.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you state that in your examination - A. I thought you would have asked me; it did not strike me till I got down.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. You have heard the account that the prisoner has given - how much of that account is true - A. It is a false account; I am a married woman. I have had ten children. I had only part of one pot of beer that afternoon, that was not with him; he came in the house just as I was going out.</p>

I have known the prisoner these two years; he lodged in the house, and slept in the same bed with me - I missed my Sunday clothes between eight and nine o'clock on Monday evening, from the box where I had put them that morning; I had locked my box - the prisoner was then gone, and I did not see him again till he was taken into custody; there was a gimblet with which my box had been broken open - I have seen the coat since, but nothing else.</p>

            . I am watch-house-keeper. The prisoner was brought there on the morning of the 18th of March; I found this duplicate of the coat on him - I have known him about five years; he is a farrier, and worked near a Chapel at which I was beadle for some years before I was made watch-house-keeper; he regularly attended there morning and evening, and I considered him a remarkable steady man.(Coat produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out to look for work - this coat was brought into a public-house where I was, and I bought it for 10s.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Manor-farm, at Barking in Essex. A small pig of mine was left at my premises, on the 24th of December—it was the carcase of a pig—I think the feet were not on it, but I am not quite certain—it is what is called in the trade a carcase of a pig—I missed it next morning, the 25th, and made inquiry—I went on the Monday after<lb></lb>noon with Robert Martin to the prisoner Joseph Sinfield's house—both the prisoners lived there—I knocked at the door, the mother opened it—I found William Sin field on the bed, feigning to be tipsy, and I think he was tipsy—I brought him down stairs, got a light, went up stairs again with the light, and saw on the floor in the bedroom, where the pig had been</p>

               <p>salted, and the board it had been chopped on—there were fragments of the salt and blood on the floor—portions of the fat, salt, and blood remained, which satisfied me it had been done there—I told William Sinfield I was sure he knew where the pig was, and advised him to tell me—I merely said I was quite sure he knew what had become of the pig—he said after I had come down stairs, that his brother was under the bed, and he had humped out of window with the pig salted in a pail, and had thrown the salt out of the pail—on searching about, within two steps outside the house, I found part of the pig recently salted in a dish—I brought it into the house, and found a quantity of brains and blood behind the door, in the comer of the sitting-room—I sent for the constable, and gave William Sinfield into custody—the other prisoner was not taken till the 2nd of February.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in Mr. Biggs's employ. I was at the Bull public-house, at Barking, on Sunday, with Joseph and William Sinfield—we had some beer together, and came home to our house again—they live next door to me—we were talking about the pig—a bullock had gored it, and let its entrails out, and master sent me for a butcher to come and dress the pig—I told them it was in Washburn-street, and Joseph said in the course of conversation that he would have the pig—when we came to Chalk Starve, I and William went home, and he went towards my master's house—he asked his mother for his red cap, and gave William his hat—William heard what he said about having the pig—I went next day to work at Mr. Biggs's—he made inquiry about the pig—I said I knew nothing of it—I afterwards went to my father, and by his advice told Charles, the servant, of it—I afterwards told my master what had passed when he questioned me—the pig was gone then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Barking. On Monday evening; the 25th of December, I was sent for, to take William Sinfield into custody—I went to the house, went up stairs, and saw the remains of the brains of a pig, and fragments of meat, and salt, strewed about the floor—I got a light, and found a chopper—I saw the pig's head, which appeared to have been hacked with some blunt instrument—I brought the chopper away—I did not see Joseph in the house—I could not find him—I apprehended him on the 2nd of February—I could not find him till then—I have the head here and the chopper—it appears to have been hacked with that instrument.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

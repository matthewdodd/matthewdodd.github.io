                  </hi>. I am employed at a public-house, 313, Old Street—on 25th February the prisoner tendered me this cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., signed H. Dear, and asked if I would cash it—I asked him where he got it from—he said, "From Mr. Dear's, across the road"—I said, "Which Dear's?"—he said, "The furniture shop"—I went to make inquiries—I jumped over the counter, and saw the prisoner running up the road—I ran after him—I said, "You must give an account of this cheque"—he said, "A man at the Cherry Tree gave it me"—I saw a policeman and asked him to come with me—after going a short distance the prisoner got away again—we caught him in a garden—I had told him I did not know the writing—he said his son wrote it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). I cannot find the Covent Garden Bank—I took down this statement and the prisoner signed it on 25th February: "A man called me out of the London Apprentice public-house, Old Street. He asked me if I would go for an errand for him, and I asked him where it was to go. He said into the public-house fating Dear's shop. He told me if I had to write anything on the back of it to to put 'R. James.' I then took it into the public-house. A young man inside said he did not think it was Mr. Dear's, and then I called the party who gave me the cheque. He ran down the street and got away."</p>

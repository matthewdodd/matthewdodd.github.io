               <p>Powers. There was a Silk Gown striped, it was a sort of darkish Purple and White, a Crape Gown Black and White, a Camblet Gown Brownish. A Camblet Cloak, - I don't remember the Colour. A Rug Coat, Red; A Wastcoat Brownish, and a Banyan of a stingey Colour - A sort of a Roarer [Aurora]; there was a Pair of Black Stockings too. We carried the Goods to the Prisoner, Eliz. Morris; she keeps a Smith's Shop at the Sign of the Jack and Half Moon in Eagle-Court by the New Church in the Strand, and we sold her the Silk Gown. She knew how we came by them. Her Son Will. and I have gone a thieving together these three Months.</p>
               <p>Norman. Powers swears this against me, because he knows I have been under Misfortunes, and have been an Evidence in this Court. But I have Witness that I was sick on the 2d and 3d of January, when this Fact was done.</p>

               <p>C. How came you to remember those Days any more than any other?</p>
               <p>J. B. I have cause to remember the 4th of January, for it was my Wedding-Day 24 Years ago, and I have acknowledged it ever since, and I had a Bit of roast Pork that Day; and Norman and his Wife were both sick of the new Distemper, and they had Rosemary and Treacle, and they both eat some of my roast Pork.</p>
               <p>C. Then they were not so bad but they could eat Pork? Did you never see Powers at your House.</p>
               <p>J. B. I don't know him. - But I can swear that Norman was not abroad the Day before the 4th of January; for I was at home all that Week, though sometimes I go a Nursing.</p>
               <p>C. Can you be positive that you was not out at all in the Evening of the 3d of January ?</p>

               <p>Eliz. Morris. I own I had an undutiful Son, but I could not help what he did; for if I spoke but a Word, he would presently beat and abuse me. I have often forbid Powers coming to my House.</p>

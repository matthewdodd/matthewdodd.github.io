I said I had not much, he said he must have it; he searched my pocket and took out one shilling and four-pence; then they took my tobacco box, and a pair of gloves out of my pocket: Bailey took my hat from off my head, and handkerchief from out of my coat pocket; it was a fine moon-light night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took your money, box and gloves?</p>
               <p>Smith. Frazier took them, my Lord. I saw them all four again about three hours after, I met them accidentally in East-Smithfield near the Maypole, I live there. After I was robb'd I went to the watch-house and inquired for the officer of the night, he was not there; these four watchmen went with me into the fields, we could not meet with them. When I was got near home I heard a talking, I thought it proper to meet them, this was about half an hour after two o'clock; I call'd out watch and thieves, they ran, Bailey ran to Cock-alley, he was taken with my hat on his head, and handkerchief about his neck; Frazier was taken two days after, I was sent for to see if I knew him, I knew him at first sight; he confessed the fact.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Southend, Lewisham. On the 12th of April I was with the prisoner at the King's Arms public-house there—we went from there to the Green Man, and had some more beer—I had my watch safe there—I fell asleep in the tap-room—the prisoner was there—I did not miss my watch till late at night—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is it—I know it by the lesser hand and a belt round the face of it—I was not quite sober when I lost it.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner and Cook were at my public-house, on Monday, the 12th of April, at six o'clock in the morning, as soon as the house was opened, and continued there till the prosecutor left—between two and three the prisoner and prosecutor were in the tap-room alone—I stood in the bar, eight or nine yards off, and heard money drop—knowing the prosecutor was asleep, and that I had given him change for half-a-crown</p>

               <p>—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I looked round and saw them sitting close together—I walked into the tap-room, seeing the prisoner feeling the prosecutor, or pulling him about—when I came into the tap-room, the pri<lb></lb>soner appeared asleep as well as the prosecutor—I looked at the two for about a minute, and looked on the floor, but could see no money—I walked to the fire, stirred it, and in so doing the prisoner awoke and began pulling the prosecutor again, as if to awake him—I remonstrated with him for doing so—I then went away, and saw no more of it—the prisoner went away, leaving Cook in the tap-room asleep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ostler at the Green Man. I recollect the prisoner being in the tap-room with Cook—I saw Cook's watch-chain at nine o'clock, and again at two, hanging from his pocket, and between those times I saw him pull his watch out—the prisoner left the tap-room about half-past three—there had been nobody in the prosecutor's com<lb></lb>pany except the prisoner between two and half-past three.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I apprehended the pri<lb></lb>soner at the Black Horse, Russia-green, asleep in the tap-room—I told him I wanted him for a watch—he said he had not got one—I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and immediately caught fast hold of his arm—he called to the party with him—there were four very bad characters with him—in struggling I saw the watch in his pocket—I called assistance—a man came and dragged his arm out by force, and there was the watch hanging to his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was going to work, and called in at the King's Arms public-house to have refreshment; I then went to the Green Man, fell asleep, and left there; afterwards, in coming along, I found the watch by the side of the road; it was my intention to have it advertised; when I picked it up I went to the Black Horse, and stopped there all night; had any body come to own it, I meant to give it up; I was insensible at the time with a cut in my head.</p>

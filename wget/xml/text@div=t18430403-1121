The prisoner came to my house about seven o'clock on Saturday evening, and had some refreshment—he left a book with my wife in my presence, and said he should call again for it—he went away, and returned in about an hour after with another book under his arm, and asked for the book he had left—I looked through the book, and saw Mr. Humphreys' name printed in it—he asked for a bed, and went to bed—he refused to give his boots up, and having been robbed the week before I set a watch upon him, to see that he did not go off while I went to Mr. Humphreys and returned with him—I went to the prisoner's room, and found him in bed with his drawers and stockings on, and the books were in a chair by his bedside.</p>

I searched him at the station, and found these prints crumpled up in his right trowsers' pocket—he said he saw a person drop the books in Holborn, and he picked them up—he said nothing about the plates.</p>

            . I am a constable. I met Hunt on the 24th of November, a little before six o'clock in the evening, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Evans' premises, with this piece of lead in this bag; I asked what he had got - he said, "Some wet things;" I felt it was a substance, and found this lead in it; I have compared it with what remains - it corresponds exactly.</p>
               <p>DAVID EVANS. This lead was taken from my manufactory, which adjoins my dwelling-house - it belongs to me; I have seen the lead compared with what remains - they correspond exactly.</p>

He repli'd I hope to see you all burn'd, and to be at the burning of you. To this Indictment for a Contempt and Misdemeanor he pleaded Not guilty, and put himself upon the Countrey.</p>
               <p>Matthew Momford, for his contempt and misdemeanor, in speaking the Words.</p>
               <p>One of the Witnesses swore, that the Prisoner being at his house to drink, upon some discourse said, he had been a Papist seaven years: then said he, you are not fit to stand Sentinel where the King passeth, for you may kill him as he goes by you. Then in a fume he replied, I hope to see you burned, and be at the Burning of you.</p>
               <p>The other said, that Momford said he was a Staffordshire man: then said the other, you must be a Papist, for all the Momfords in Staffordshire are Papists, he replied so was he. Then you are not fit to be a Souldier; he in a passion cri'd out, he hoped to see us all burnt, and be at the burning of us. They both said he was in drink, with which the Prisoner would have excused the matter, but the Court told him it was no excuse, but an aggravation. And left him to the Jury.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 167). On 27th May I went to the prisoner's house, No. 6, Turner's Building, Grove Road, at 12 o'clock at night—I went to the first floor front room with a brother officer; I knocked at the door of the room, I asked the prisoner to open it—he said, "Wait a minute"—I said that I was a policeman—he opened the door in his shirt—there was a young girl in the room, his daughter—I asked him if he knew where his wife was—he said, "No"—I told him she was in custody for uttering counterfeit coin—I searched, and on the mantel piece found part of a counterfeit shilling, and also a counterfeit sixpense—my brother officer went to a drawer, and found in it a file, and two moulds in a box on the sideboard—several bottles were found with fluids in them, and a galvanic battery, a jar with quicksilver in it, another jar with some blue powder in it; and in the table drawer my brother constable found three files and three spoons, and he found something under the bed, but I did not see that—I took the prisoner to the station—I asked him if he know anything about these things—he said that he did not know anything about them.</p>

I was with the last witness—I assisted in searching the room; I found three iron spoons in the table drawer, and three files—I found five bottles on the sideboard, with some<lb></lb>thing in them, a jar containing some quicksilver on the sideboard, a jar with some powder in it, and this top of a jar, which contains a broken plaster of Paris mould—on the floor, under the bed, I found this purse with one good shilling sad two counterfeit shillings—they were all in the same end of the purse, but the counterfeit shillings were wrapped in a piece of paper—I found these two moulds in a box on the sideboard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint. This is a mould for a shilling; here are the obverse and reverse sides of it—these two shillings are counterfeit, and are from that mould—these implements ire used for making coin, but they have not been used for some time—these files are used for making good the place where the <hi rend="italic">get</hi> comes off, but they have not been used lately—they have white metal in their teeth—the metal appears the same as the coin—these jars contain what is used for plating the coin—these bottles contain acid used for charging the battery—all these articles are for the purpose of coining—these spoons are used for melting the metal, but have not been used lately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would it not require many more things to make coins besides what are here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—this good shilling does not at all refer to the mould or the counterfeit coin.</p>

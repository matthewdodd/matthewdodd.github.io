                  </hi>. I live in Barbican. On the 1st of April the pri<lb></lb>soner came to my shop, asked for a twopenny memorandum-book, and gave me half a crown in payment—I gave him two shillings and a fourpenny piece in change—I examined the shillings before I gave them to him, and am sure they were good—when he got to the door he turned round, and asked if the memorandum-book had any almanack to it—I said, "No"—he said, "Then it won't do"—he came back, and put two shillings and a fourpenny piece on the counter, and I returned him the half-crown—he in<lb></lb>stantly went out—I looked immediately at the shillings, and found one was bad—I bent it—I went after him about twenty yards from the shop, brought him back, and asked him <hi rend="italic">to</hi> give me the good shilling—he said he had not got it, and wished me to let him look at the bad one—I would not, and sent for an officer—no shilling was found on him.</p>

            . I was building some houses in Arbour-square, Commercial-road. The prisoner was a <rs id="t18230115-148-deflabel812" type="occupation">sawyer</rs>

On Saturday evening, the 14th of December, I went outside and saw him taking them away; his mate was with him; each of them had wood, he said his mate induced him to take them - his mate threw his down and got away. I think it was the mate's fault. I am sure they are mine.</p>

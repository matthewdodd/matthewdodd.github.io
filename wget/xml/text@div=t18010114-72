             sworn. - I am a watchman, at Old Brentford: On Thursday morning, the 1st of January, about a quarter past one, I saw a man coming up the street, with something upon his shoulder, which I thought was not lawful; I followed him up Drum-lane, into the Back-lane, for nearly two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man? - A. The prisoner at the bar; I asked him what he had got there; he said he had nothing but his own property; I asked him to let me see it, and then he threw it off his shoulder; his great coat was off, and the lead was wrapped up in it; then I asked him how he came by it, and he said he found it; at last he said, I will tell you the truth, I got it while I was doing a job at Kew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to induce him to confess? - A. No, I did not; then I asked him whether the people where he was doing a job knew of his taking it, or whether it was his own property to take; he said, no, it was not his own, they did not know of his taking it, and he wished he had never seen it; I took him down to what we call our cage, at Brentford, and put him in, he carred the lead; I then took the lead to the beadle's house, his name is

             sworn. - I am a shoemaker, at Brentford: On Thursday the 1st of this month, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to the beadle's house for the lead.</p>
               <p>Plastine. I had the lead from the beadle's in the morning, I delivered it to Polycutt.</p>
               <p>Polycutt. I had the lead from the watchman, and carried it to Mrs. Trimmer's, in Old Brentford; I observed the appearance of the lead having been taken from the ridge of the house, it was rolled up, and I unrolled it as flat as I could, and fitted it; it appeared to fit as nearly as it could, but could not make it exactly flat, as it was so wrinkled.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that that lead had been taken from the ridge? - A. No; I weighed the lead, there were forty-eight pounds and a quarter of it; I have had the lead ever since. (Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Had you been acquainted with the house and the manner in which it was leaded? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The officer gave you every thing that was found upon the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not give you any cutting knife? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear that that lead came from Mrs. Trimmer's house? - my coat may fit many a man that it was not made for? - A. It is the same sort of lead, I cannot swear that it is the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Having smoothed it as well as you could, have you any doubt that that is the lead which came from that house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you compare the nail holes? - A. Yes, and they corresponded as near as they could.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. My mother's name is Sarah; the house from which the lead was taken was her house; I was present when the last witness fitted the lead to the ridge, it had not been cut but ripped and tore away; just at the corner of the ridge, there was a little nail-hole, which is unusual, which tallied exactly, that part was not bent out of it's proper form, the rest was.</p>
               <p>Q. From your examination of the place, and of the lead, have you any doubt that that is the lead taken from your mother's house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that lead safe the night before? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon before had you seen it - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was this one whole piece? - A. Yes; there was more lead loose, but not taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. That lead might have been loosened a month before for any thing you know? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010114-72-verdict404" type="verdictDescription">

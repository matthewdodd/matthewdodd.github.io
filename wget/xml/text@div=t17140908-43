And Mr. Moor then coming into the House, and being ask'd his Opinion of the Address, said, It was without Examination into the Fact; and added, That Sir Constantine Phipps was a Rascal and a Villain; upon which the Prisoner said he was much surpriz'd to hear any Gentleman so forward to condemn a Person in so high a Station; and that it was taking the Power out of the Legislature, and fixing it in himself; to which the Deceas'd reply'd, he would tell him as much to his Face when he saw him; and seem'd much to be displeased with the Prisoner for what he had said, telling him he was under the Protection of the Coffee-House, and if he had him in another Place he would use him scurrily; The Prisoner answer'd he would endeavour to return his Usage; whereupon the Deceas'd bid the Prisoner hold his prating, and call'd him Puppy; upon which Words there was a Silence in the Coffee-Hose for a while, and then some of the Deceased's Friends talk'd of a Supper, and he said he would go to the Kitchen and order it, which he repeated twice, and then went out; and the Prisoner going out a little after, clashing of Swords was heard, and some of the Company ran out, and found the Deceas'd wounded; and he being ask'd how it came, said, Fair, fair, very fair.

             swore, That she saw the Prisoner and the Deceas'd pass at one another, but could not tell who drew first; but that Mr. Moor being carry'd into the Kitchen, said Mr. G P. had done very fairly by him. The Prisoner in his Defence said, The Deceas'd had given him ill Language, which was acknowledg'd by the Witnesses on both Sides; and that, when he pretended to go to order Supper, the Deceas'd look'd him full in the Face, as if he expected he should follow him; which he did, and found him in the Passage, with his Face towards the Coffee-House Door; and when he saw the Prisoner, he advanc'd with his Sword drawn; whereupon the Prisoner drew, and they had several Passes; and that he receiv'd two slight Wounds before the Deceas'd got his. A Minster depos'd, That being sent for by the Deceas'd, after he was wounded, to administer the Sacrament to him, he told him he was sorry he had given the Prisoner such provoking Language; and that when he went to bespeak Supper he had some thoughts he would follow him; and that what the Prisoner had done was very fair, and if the Law might be dispens'd with, he wou'd not have him Prosecuted; but if he recover'd, he shou'd have as great a Value and Esteem for him as for any Man in the Nation. And the Witness asking the Deceas'd if he might declare this, he reply'd, It is my desire you should if there be Occasion. The Prisoner had a great many Gentlemen to his Character, who upon their Oaths declar'd him to be a modest, courteous, inoffensive Man, and had so behav'd himself in several Stations, Civil and Military; and it appearing to the Court that the Prisoner and the Deceas'd were Strangers to each other, the Jury found him <rs id="t17140908-43-verdict229" type="verdictDescription">

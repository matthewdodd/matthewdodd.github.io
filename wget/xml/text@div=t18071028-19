               <p>Q. Before she went did you miss any of these articles. - A. No, not one, nor had no suspicion of her. On the 5th of October, I found the prisoner in St Martin's-lane, I had received information that she was there to see her mantua maker.</p>
               <p>Q. You found her in St. Martin's lane. - A. Yes; I told her that her fellow servant had got robbed, I asked her if she had any objection to walk with me home; she did very freely. When she was in the room, I asked her if she knew any thing of a cap that I missed before she came back with me that morning; she said she did not; I asked her if she knew the cap I spoke of, telling her it was a new one; she said she knew it very well, but she had not seen it; I asked her if she knew any thing of a lace frill that hung on the glass, she denied that also; I believed it was true; but I turned round and pulled the lace she was wearing instead of a cap; it was a piece of lace that I have got; I asked her if she had got any thing more, she said she had got nothing else than a necklace; I wanted her to tell where she lodged, that I might go and see whether she had any of my property; I took a coach, she did not chuse to tell; I told the coachman to drive to Bow-street; I got a Bow-street officer, Blackman, and then she told where her lodgings was; her pockets were searched in the coach, and several pieces of money were found.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing of the money you can speak to. - A. Yes, a crown piece, I can swear to. When we came into her lodgings, the keys were found upon her; upon searching her box the articles were found in her box, that are now produced.</p>

            . I searched the prisoner in the coach; I took a guinea from her, and a watch, that watch was not claimed; I took two dollars, and a crown piece out of her pocket; five dollars I found in her box, and half a crown piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any articles of wearing apparel. - A. Yes; four napkins, one night cap, two fans, one box, one pillow case, one laced cap, two neck handkerchiefs, one doll's frock. I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The dollars were found in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Blackman. I found two in her pocket and five in her box.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That is one of the crown pieces that was found on her person; I am positive it is mine; there is a scratch on the head like a B, it appears as if it has been lost for some time, it is black. I had it two years, I kept it in the drawer; I never missed it till it was turned out of her pocket. And the wearing apparel are all mine.</p>

               <p>Q. That crown piece may have gone through many hands before it came to the prisoner. - A. Not at all unlikely.</p>

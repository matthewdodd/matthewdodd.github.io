I have two little dogs, they barked violently about three o'clock in the morning - it did not alarm me, as they often bark. I have found none of my property, except two paintings.</p>

I went into the parlour the first in the morning, a few minutes after eight o'clock, found the window shutters wide open, and the property gone - I found a hat in the parlour.

I left the shop immediately after, and in about five minutes, my servant came, and said a person had offered a picture, answering the description in the bill, which she had given me. I went into the shop, and found Corderoy there - he produced the picture, and asked four or five shillings on it. I stooped down to take up the printed bill, as soon as he saw me rise with it in my hand, and begin to read it, he ran away. I sent two of my young men to pursue him, in about a quarter of an hour they brought him back. I then sent for an officer - he was searched by Attfield, in my presence, and in the lining of his pantaloons were found, two duplicates of three shift, among others. The picture was two cows, and a milkmaid.</p>

            . I live in Tabernacle-square, about five hundred yards from the prosecutor's. On the 29th of October, I was in my shop, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I turned my head, and saw the prisoner Corderoy, running by my house - several people were pursuing him. I ran out, and took him in Willow-walk. He said it was only a fight, and asked me to let him go - I refused. A mob of about twenty men interrupted us - I secured him - the prisoner Wood was one of them. Some people came to my assistance - I kept hold of him. I am certain Wood was one of them, by his voice, dress and size. I was struck by three or four different people - I believe he was one who struck me. I took Corderoy to Walker's, and gave him in charge of Attfield.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 28th of October, the morning of the robbery, I went to Thorley's house, and examined it. I found the outside window shutter in the parlour had twenty or thirty holes bored with a gimblet - a piece was taken out, large enough for me to get my hand in - there was a broken square of glass, through which they might undo the catch, and open the window - Reeves gave me a hat, which they had left behind them. I have no doubt but it belonged to Corderoy - I used to see him every day, and believe it to be his. She also gave me the burner of a lamp, it appeared to have been burning that night. It was taken out of a lamp, at the door of the King's Head public-house, near the prosecutor's house. She also gave me a chisel, and two phosphorus matches, one of which had been lit. On Friday, October the 29th, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner Corderoy, close to my house, with a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020005"></xptr>bundle under his arm. I went into a public-house to deliver a parcel which I had, when I came out he was gone. In about half an hour I went to the office, and found him in the custody of Attfield. I then went to a house in Greengate-garden, Hackney-road, where both the prisoners lived together - I knew Corderoy lived there. I knocked at the door, but nobody was at home. I broke it open, and found a gimblet in the cupboard, which fitted the holes in the shutter. I found five skelleton, one picklock, and one droplatch key. I also found a piece of painting, of some shipping, cut to pieces, which the prosecutor claimed. Also part of a gilt frame, three napkins, a shirt, a handkerchief, the knob of a brass fender, a pair of drawers, and twelve plaited buttons. As I returned, I met the prisoner Wood, going towards the house. I stopped him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Your name is George". He said it was not. I said, I was sure it was, and asked him where he lived?. He said, in Wentworth-street. I asked him if he knew

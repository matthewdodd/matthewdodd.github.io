                  </hi>. I am a farmer's man, and live at Edmonton. On the 31st of December, I was returning from Enfield Highway—I met Welsh near the Two Brewers, at Ponder's End—he asked me to come back, and he would <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> a pot at the Two Brewers—he had before asked me where I was going, and I said, "Home"—when we had drank the beer, I was com<lb></lb>ing away; and he said, "If you have nothing to do you may come and help me to load"—I went with him down the marshes into Mr. Pott's osier-ground, and loaded forty-seven bundles—they were in Mr. Reed's cart—Welch drove the cart, and we came into the highway; and when we got between there and Edmonton, he said, "I have got to leave John Vardon four bolts of osiers;" Vardon keeps a <hi rend="italic">Tom and Jerry shop</hi>, and bunches turnips—Welch drove the horse and cart close to the house, and left the horse feeding; and said, "We will go and have a drop of beer before we put the four bundles down"—we went into the house, and were in about half an hour—he then asked me to go and throw the four bolts for him, which</p>

               <p>I did—and when I threw them down, the prisoner Vardon's son took them into their premises, into the yard—I saw the prisoner, Vardon, in the tap-room, and he went into the bar—he did not come out, nor give any directions to his son—he did not tell his son to do any thing, nor show any sign that he knew what he was doing—I did not go into the house again—I was pulling a plank board when Mr. Potts's men came by—I was taken before the Justice, and stated as I have now—the Justice sent me to prison to come here to-day.</p>

Did you, in consequence of information, go to Vardon's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, after I had counted the bundles of osiers, and missed four of them, I went down to Vardon's turnip-shed—I found four bolts altogether—one bolt was near the turnip-shed—they were the smallest osiers, and more fit for tying turnips than the other three were—the others were in the stable—they were the same sort of osiers as my father's—Welch was a servant of Reed's, who was employed to cart them.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. Sherwin, last Monday was a week I was sitting in the counting-house about seven in the afternoon, or a little after, I saw two men come in and take up the basket with three dozen of candles in it, I went round the compter and took up a four pound weight, I saw the prisoner and another man, the prisoner had the basket on his shoulder, and at the corner of Broad-court, I saw the two men, they saw me and dropped the basket, I followed the prisoner, and hit him with the four pound weight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can the witness say I took the candles away at all, or ever saw them at first or last? - I cannot be positive that it was the prisoner took the basket out, as his back was towards me, but it was the colour of his coat, I am sure he was the man that had them on his shoulder.</p>

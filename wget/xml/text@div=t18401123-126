About ten o'clock at night, on the 10th of November, I was drink<lb></lb>ing in Cannon-street with the prisoner—about one o'clock we agreed to have a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> together, and I am sure that when I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I had a purse containing four sovereigns—the prisoner got in first—I followed him—we drove to Wapping-bridge, but it being high water we could not get over—a minute or two before that I found I had lost my purse—I said to the prisoner, "You have taken my bag oat of my pocket"—he said, "No I have not, you are only joking"—when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped at the bridge he opened the door, and ran out—he was stopped by an officer, and I gave him in charge—the purse and sovereigns produced were found on him—these are them.</p>

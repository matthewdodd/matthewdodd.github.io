               <p>Q. You were convicted upon a charge of a libel, you were put in the pillory, were not you - A. Why you must find it out. I believe my character is as good as yours.</p>
               <p>COURT. I remember not a more infamous libel than that. You live at the corner of Finsbury-square, what business are you - A. A <rs id="t18110220-94-viclabel509" type="occupation">plumber</rs>

               <p>Q. It was proved by the jury that you did it - did you put these brass cocks into the poor boy's clothes - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the poor boy's relations are in some respectable way of life of some property and that his father is a coach owner - A. I only know he is a coachman.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had the lad lived there before he was charged with this offence - A. Not a week; he came on the Wednesday, and these brass cocks were found on the Monday following. On the Monday morning I went up to make his bed, the prisoner was not at home; on my turning the bed I found one brass cock between the two beds, I told my mistress of it. I went up of my own accord about an hour afterwards, I looked in the boy's great coat pocket, I found another brass cock. I took it down to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after was the boy questioned about it - A. About seven o'clock in the evening. My master came home about two o'clock in the afternoon. The boy said he knew nothing at all about it; Mr. Armstrong took him to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Armstrong here - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday morning master said he was going out to do a job; I went with him, we did not come away from the house till one o'clock.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200049"></xptr>We both went to dinner. After master had done dinner I sat down to dinner alongside of the girl. We went to work and came home about six o'clock. I told master that I wanted to clean the harness; master has got a horse and two or three chaises; he said, very well; I went into the stable and cleaned the harness, he told me he wanted to go out shortly; I cleaned the horse, and was cutting his tail; I went to tea, and master went out. I went to make a finish of the horses tail, Mr. Armstrong came into the stable; Mr. Armstrong knows me well; he said, my lad, your master accuses you of stealing these cocks; is this your coat; I said yes. Your master has found these two cocks in your coat, tell me the truth; I said, before I would take away any thing from my master I would cut my head off. I was taken away; my friends would have known nothing of it if it had not been for Mr. Armstrong.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to my master and told him I wanted a jacket to work in, and about three o'clock that day he gave me a note; I went to a cook-shop to get me something to eat, and coming back I saw some jackets hang up at that gentleman's door; I went in, and he asked me nine shillings for the jacket; we agreed for the jacket at five shillings and six-pence, and I offered him a note, and he said he could not give me change, and he sent the boy out to get the note changed, and he came back and said he could not get it changed, and then the gentleman sent him out again, and he came back with a man who said it was a bad note; and they asked me who I had it from, I said I had it from my master,

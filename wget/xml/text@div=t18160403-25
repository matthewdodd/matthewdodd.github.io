            , a porter, took these trunks to Galley Quay, on the 30th of October. In consequence of information, I went down to Galley Quay, on the 31st, where I saw the trunks, which from the slovenleness of the package, appeared to have been opened; when they went from us, each was locked, and the key fastened to the end of the trunk, and a cord outside the mat. On un-packing the trunk, we missed the property named in the indictment.</p>

            . I am foreman to Messrs Smith, wharfingers at Galley Quay, and the last witness delivered the three trunks to me, on the 30th of October; they were fit for Exportation, and I delivered them into a lug-boat, in the charge of Flygar, at Galley Quay; he is in the employ of Jacklyn, Williams, and Co. I saw them the next day, and they appeared very different in their package then; the mats were not done up as they were before, and the appearance was such as to make me believe that they had been opened, and when they were opened in my presence, the good appeared to be opened out in order that they might not shake about in the trunks.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Flygar was the only person to whom I delivered them. I could not suspect any one else but Flygar.</p>

               <p>EDWARD BURTON. I am a lighterman; I employed Flygar, when he took these trunks, I told him if he could not make his tide down to the ship, to come home. I saw the boat the next morning, the 31st of October, and when I saw the trunks they seemed as if they had been plundered.</p>

            . In the month of October last, I was servant to Messrs Jacklyn, Williams, and Co. lightermen. On the 30th of October, I was ordered by Mr. Burton, to take three trunks down to Blackwall, to a ship which was lying off there. I returned at about half past eleven o'clock at night. I left Galley Quay at about half past three o'clock in the afternoon. When I was going down the river, I met Spendlove, the prisoner, and Connell the watchman, with him. I stopped along-side Spendlove's barge. I asked him whether he was going to Limehouse. He asked me where I was going, and I told him to Limehouse and Blackwall. He then said, so am I too. He asked me if I had a tool with me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Did he ask you if you had a tool, without any previous reference to any thing that could require a tool. - A. Yes. I told him I had not; and he said he would meet me at the Lower Ship, Limehouse Reach. That was the Lower Ship that I had to go to; nothing more passed at that time. We understood one another without any more. Afterwards he met me at the Lower Ship. It was about a quarter or twenty minutes after four o'clock, just getting dusk. He came on board my vessel first, as I was going to shove her off from the ship. He said he must put the benches up. They are put on each side of the thwarts; that was in order that he might have a covering over, so that the people could not see. I was rowing the boat; he told me to look out to see that nobody was coming nigh. He took the cording off the trunk, and then the matting. He ripped the nails out with a chissel. He then got the key from the handle and opened the trunk, and there was some very dark brown paper that the parcels were wrapt in. He then took the things he thought necessary; they were muslins and shawls. Twentynine shawls, and about nine pieces of muslin. Some of the shawls dark, and some light. He then said he would go to Gates's house, and bring a dark lantern, Gates lived at Limehouse, and a man who was tried at the last sessions. He went down to Blackwall, and said he would take the things to Rammage's, who is a publican there. I afterwards went to Rammage's, aad met Spendlove there. Spendlove took muslins and a lot of shawls, some in his bosom and some in his great coat pocket and his hat. When we were at Rammage's, we went up two pair of stairs. A person of the name of Brown came there. He and Rammage looked over the things, and Rammage said they were rubbishing things, going out to the negroes in the West Indies. Brown asked Spendlove if he wanted any money, and he said he had only a five pound note in his pocket, which he gave Spendlove. The things were left at Rammage's, and Brown with them. After that, I and the prisoner went to the boat.</p>

            . I keep a linen draper's shop in Poplar. I know Mrs. Brown; her husband is a waterman. I remember Mrs. Brown coming to me on the 31st of October, to sell some muslin, five pieces. She brought one first and four more afterwards. I never measured them, she brought seven in the whole; but I bought them for five. She was paid four pounds ten shillings for them by Mr. Smith. I only bought them for five; but they were all left at our house, under a mistake. The seven pieces were all plain; she brought also a striped piece, but that I would not buy, because I thought it would not sell. Mrs. Brown took that away with her. I don't know whether I could recollect that again. It was stri ed and figured. I had the pieces I bought until they were delivered up to the officers.</p>

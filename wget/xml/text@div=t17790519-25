             was a lodger in our house. On the 20th of April last, the prisoner and another man came to my house about one o'clock in the afternoon, to look at a lodging. I shewed them up stairs; we went into a room next to Mr. Savin's bed-chamber. While I was shewing them that room the prisoner went into Mr. Savin's room. Upon missing him, I immediately followed him; on my going into the room he seemed very much confused, and turned pale. This raised a suspicion in me, that he had taken something; I said I hoped he had not taken any thing out of the room; he said, he was surprised at my saying such a thing; he did not know what I meant. Recollecting that Mr. Savin's shoe-buckles lay in that room, I said I hoped he had not taken a pair of silver shoe-buckles out of that room; on that they both ran down stairs. I ran down after them, and said, gentlemen, if you have not stole any thing you need not run away so fast, and I called to my servant to stop them if she could, if not to cry stop thief as soon as they were out, which she did, and the prisoner was taken and brought back. He held the buckles in his hand, and asked me if they were the buckles that were lost. I said they were the same pattern as the buckles that used to lie there, but I could not swear to them. The constable has the buckles. The prisoner said he was a Master Tailor, and had two lodgings, and a house of his own.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not the other man look at the lodgings particularly? - You both looked at them.</p>
               <p>Did I ask you any questions about the lodgings? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were we both in the room together? - You was not in the room. I went to look for you when I found you was not with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190035"></xptr>Prisoner. What apartments in the house were to let at that time? - There would have been all the upper part, because the gentleman was going away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What room were the buckles in, the back room or fore room? - I have no back room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were we not both on the stairs together? - Yes; both going up and coming down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say we were both together the whole time? - No; I said no such thing.</p>

               <p>On the 20th of April I went out about ten in the morning. I left my shoe-buckles and spurs in the closet. When I returned, which was about four in the afternoon, Mrs. Richard told me she had been robbed of my buckles, and desired I would go up stairs, and see if I had lost any thing else. I went up and missed my spurs likewise. The buckles cost me 27 s.</p>

               <p>I was a constable then. I am not now. I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody. I took him to the round-house, and found the spurs in the inside pocket of his coat.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you about the spurs? - He said nothing about them then. In the evening, when he was in the coach going to the justice's, he owned to me and Andrews that he took the spurs.</p>
               <p>Did he own he took the spurs out of Mr. Richards's house? - He said he had done that that was wrong.</p>
               <p>He said nothing about the buckles? - No; he said if we could get him off to go for a soldier he would make us a handsome present.</p>

               <p>I am beadle of the parish. I was sent for by Mr. Richards. I went, and found the constable there. He desired me to assist him in securing the prisoner. We took him to the round-house. He was searched, and the spurs found upon him. He acknowledged he had taken the buckles. He said he was very sorry, and if we could get him off at the justice's to go for a soldier or sailor, he would make us a handsome present.</p>
               <p>Roberts. I saw one of the buckles in his hand when I first came to the house.</p>
               <p>Who was the person that took the prisoner, and brought him back?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Richards. A life-guard man. I went after him this morning, and he was gone out.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at a publick-house in Fetter-lane; there I met with a tailor, who engaged me to work for him, and gave me a pair of breeches to make. I carried them home on the Tuesday following, and met with the other man there. He asked me to go with him to Mary-le-Bonne, to receive some money. He took me to this house; he said he wanted an apartment for a gentleman. He was shewed up stairs; I staid some time in the dining-room, which the servant was cleaning. I went up stairs, and heard him telling the landlady he would call and give her an answer another time. As we were upon the stairs, he delivered me the spurs in a handkerchief, and bid me put them into my pocket, which I did very innocently. I did not steal them, or know that they were stolen. This lady informed my wife, my trial could not come on till Friday; I am entirely unprepared. I am willing to serve his Majesty if I am found guilty, in any capacity the Court may think proper.</p>

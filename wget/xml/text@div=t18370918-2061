                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the S division of police. On Tues day, the 29th of August, I was passing up Grove-end-road, St. John's Wood, and saw the prisoner—he appeared very confused—I stopped him and asked what he had got—he said he had got a top in his pocket—I put my hand into his pocket and took out this silver pepper castor—he then produced some silver sugar tongs, a tea spoon, and salt spoon—the tea spoon had been just used to make mustard, and there was pepper in the pepper box—he said he found them at Hampstead—the mustard pot, sugar basin, and another tea-spoon, lost at the same time, have not been found.</p>

I have been visiting at Mr. Thomas Dowbiggin's, at Abercorn Lodge, Edgware-road—I know all these articles to be his—they were used on the 29th of August, at two o'clock, at dinner—I noticed them on the sideboard, with other articles, in the dining-room, and missed them between three and four o'clock, with a silver sugar basin and mustard pot—all the articles missing were worth about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the prisoner about dinner time crossing a field, about six yards from the house, which is in the parish of St. Marylebone—part of the articles were used at dinner—dinner was over at two o'clock—I saw the whole of the articles before dinner and just after.</p>

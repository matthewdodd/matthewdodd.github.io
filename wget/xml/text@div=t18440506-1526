                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">linendraper, Princes-street, Leicester-square.</hi> The prisoner was in my service for about twelve or thirteen days—he came on the 26th of Feb., and, I think, continued with me till the 12th of March—in consequence of a person calling on me after he left, and making inquiry about a carpet-bag, and in consequence of suspicions I entertained from those in<lb></lb>quiries, I caused a carpet-bag of the prisoner's to be opened—I have the key with which I opened it—in the pocket of the bag I found a pocket-book, in which was a duplicate referring to a scarf—I went to the pawnbroker's and examined that scarf, and it was mine—I never gave the prisoner permission to take it or sell it, or knew of his having it—it is worth about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I think the person called about the bag on the 11th or 12th of April—this is the scarf—I know it by this rent from the bottom upwards, which I believe to have been done in the manufacture, and mended by the manufacturer—before I examined the carpet-bag I went to Mr. Hardwick, of Marlborough-street Police-office, and asked his advice on the subject—it was in accord<lb></lb>ance with his directions that I did what I did.</p>

DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is it by which you swear to that scarf? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By this tear—it has no mark of mine, nor of any one in my establishment—it has been taken off—I did not have the scarf from the manufacturer—I cannot say positively where I had it from, but I believe from Robert Bentley's in Cheapside, a wholesale warehouse—any body might get a scarf of this description from there, with the exception of the tear—the same rent might happen to other scarfs in the manufacture, but I never saw another so—I saw this rent about the beginning of February, in marking it off, which was either the same day, or the day after I purchased it—I had other scarfs of the same description, but of different value—I do not recollect seeing this scarf after marking it off early in February—at that season of the year scarfs are not generally sold—I have no doubt of the scarf—I took par<lb></lb>ticular notice of this mark—I made no memorandum of it—I gave no direc<lb></lb>tions about its being sold at a less price, because of the flaw—I examined all</p>

               <p>the other scarfs as I marked them off—I do not recollect examining them with a view to ascertain whether they had any flaw in them—I had perhaps about thirty scarfs of this kind—I employ fourteen or fifteen persons to sell in my shop—I am sure I never sold this scarf—I sell goods to my young men at the cost price—that is a general rule—but they must be sold by my<lb></lb>self alone.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever sell that scarf to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he never applied to purchase a scarf—I observed this rent before the prisoner came into my service—I did not observe any rent in the other scarfs similar to this—there was a ticket pinned on here with my private mark on it, and, in marking it, this rent struck my attention—you may see the pin-holes now—I did not miss the scarf from my stock till I found the duplicate—I then examined and missed it.</p>

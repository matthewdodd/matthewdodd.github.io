I am a porter, of 4, Collingwood-street, Blackfriars-road,—on 28th May, my wife and I were in Little Suffolk-street, Lant-street, Borough, at a quarter or half-past 11—my wife was a little behind me—the prisoner came up to me and said, "Peter, how are you getting on? I have not seen you for some time"—I looked at him, and said, "I do not know you"—he came nearer to me and attempted to put his hand in my trousers-pocket—I knocked it away, and attempted to hit him, but in so doing 1 fell—he was underneath, and I was on top—I suppose he slipped—I did not knock him down—my wife pulled me off him, and I saw no more of him—I was the first to go away—I did not feel anything when on the ground, but when I had walked twenty-live or thirty yards I felt something rather cold trickling down my side, and found two cuts there—I had not been engaged in a struggle with anybody before that—there was no means of it being done but by the prisoner—we touched each other when on the ground—the wounds were on my left side, through my coat and waistcoat and two shirts—I was four days in the doctor's hands.</p>

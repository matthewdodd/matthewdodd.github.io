The first I knew of the prisoner was about three weeks or a month before the 15th of March. He came to our house to sit for his picture: my husband had been acquainted with him many years. He sat about three times before the 15th of March: my husband told him he was connected with Mr. Parsons, a glass painter at Westminster; that they had a window to finish for Salisbury cathedral, and he could not therefore attend upon him in an afternoon. On the 15th of March my husband waited at home for him till near two o'clock, and then went out; after he was gone, the prisoner came, nobody being at home at Mr. Coy's, which was next door; I was washing in my passage, because they desired me, if any body came, to take in a message for them; there is no other house but that near ours; there was not any body in our house but myself. The street-door was open: Normansel came in, and said, Well, Mrs. Askew, where is Mr. Askew? I said, He was gone to Mr. Parsons's; he walked into the parlour, turned himself round, and said, I want to speak to you; I have got a picture for Mr. Askew to copy my hair from. I took the picture from him; in the interim he went out and fastened the street-door, and came back into the parlour: I was then sitting on a low chair, blowing the fire; he sat down across my lap, and began to pull me about and kiss me; I pulled his hair, and the powder scattered out amazingly about his clothes; he seemed discontented at my behaviour, because I struggled with him, and would not condescend; he got up in a hurry, ran to the window, and let down the curtains, and darkened the room; the curtains were not drawn on one side; then he came and caught fast hold of me again; he pulled me into another chair by the window, and wanted to pull up my petticoats, and he used me very bad; he then said, he had ill-used me, and if I would give him a comb to settle his hair, he would go away; I refused to get him a comb; but, upon his pressing me, I said, If he would let me shut the door, and fasten him into the parlour, to prevent his following me, I would get him a comb; he swore he would not use me ill, but that the door I should not shut; I told him, then I would not bring him a comb; he insisted on my bringing him one; I then said, I would go backwards into the kitchen, and get him one, thinking to fasten myself in, for we have no back-door; I was going by the stairs to the kitchen; he pulled me back, and desired me to go up stairs, and he would not follow me nor hurt me. Says I, Mr. Normansel, what do you mean? Do you mean to use me worse than you have done? He said, If you will bring me a comb, I will not molest you; but if you do not, I will make you suffer for it, for I will not go out in this situation: I said, Will you swear that you will not follow me, nor ill-use me? He said, no; he would not; but if I did not bring him a comb, he would not go out of the house. Then I said, I will bring you a comb, as you have so solemnly sworn you will not molest me. I went up stairs, by his forcing me to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Persuading you? - He forced me to the bottom of the stairs; I went up; I did not know what to do; I was no sooner at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250053"></xptr> the top of the stairs; then he ran up after me; he had let me get to the top of the stairs; I turned, and ran against him, and insisted upon his going down stairs; he caught fast hold of me round the waist, and would not go, and I could not force him; he took me by main force to the bed-room door, which is about two yards from the top of the stairs; I laid hold on each side of the door, to prevent his taking me in, and cried Murder! I said what did he mean by using me in that manner? I said, If you use me ill, Normansel, I'll punish you for it; he said, If I am sure to be hanged for it, I will have my ends. He unclenched my hands, by force, from the door; he had his left hand round my waist, and with his right hand struck my left hand from the door, and loosened my hold from the door; then he took me off my legs, and rushed with me to the foot of the bed; then I cried Murder! he gave me, with his right hand, a stroke on the breast, and I lost my breath for some minutes. I had hold of the bed-posts; he threw himself against me, and threw me down on the bed; in falling, my left hand fell under me: it was a very good bed; being a light bed, I was just smothered with his weight, and I cried out, Murder! Askew! that is my husband: he said, D - n Askew, I don't care if he was here, for I am determined, if I lose my life by it, to have what I want: then he laid his whole weight down upon me; he deprived me of my breath, and then he had his ends of me; I was incapable of being of any assistance to myself. In struggling with him I turned from one side to the other, and crossed my legs, as much as I could, to prevent him; when he found me so very much gone, he laid his hand upon my breast; I suppose he thought he had killed me by his weight, and his smothering me to make me hold my tongue: then with his knees he began to get my legs open; he had the weight of his body down upon me, as much as he could, and held me fast; he got my left hand clenched in his left hand, behind my back; my hand being under me, he had full liberty with his right hand, and he unloosened his breeches, and had carnal connections with me, against my inclination and will.</p>

               <p>Did he enter your body? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>How long did you continue in that situation? - I suppose about five minutes; then he got off me, and I was quite incapable of getting up; he pulled me up by main force off the bed, and I fainted away, at the foot of the bed; I cried very much, and that brought me to myself a great deal. He said to me, Mrs. Askew, for God's sake, have mercy upon me: I told him I was determined to have no mercy on him, for his ill behaviour to me; he said, Well, then I am ruined. He took me off the bed, and rushed me to the room door, and desired I would go down stairs, and he ran down before me: I wanted to go out at the street door, but he stood between it and me, and made me go into the parlour. I was excessively ill; I sat down in the chair where he had ill used me before: I went up stairs; I cried very much, and he was begging at the same time that I would not acquaint my husband with it, for if I did, he was ruined; he made use of the same expression down stairs as well as above; I told him I really would inform my husband the very instant I saw him, or could get any person to fetch him; and would have him punished as the Laws of the Land would admit; he said, Mrs. Askew, you are not a bit the worse; Mr. Askew will know nothing at all of it; I will always be your friend: he said I never should rue it. I told him I always would, for I had no notion of a man like Mr. Askew, who had always behaved like a gentleman to me, to use him ill in his abstence. - While we were in the parlour, (I believe it was after five o'clock) a little boy, a nephew of mine, came and knocked at the door; I was going to the door; Normansel ran to the door, and prevented the boy from coming in; he bid the boy go and bring some beer; I said Bill, I will have no beer; Normansel said to me, D - n you, don't look back, for if you do, I am ruined; for he is a cunning arch dog, and will see you are crying, and have been very ill used, and there is nobody here but me, and I shall be condemned directly: he compelled me to sit down in a chair; he kept the boy out of the room; he desired me not to make a noise, or say any thing, if I did, it would be worse for me: the boy said, My Aunt never drinks porter; he said, Bring a pint of porter, and a pint of two-penny;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250054"></xptr> so the boy ran away, as hard as he could, for the beer. I forgot to mention, when I sat in the chair in the parlour, that he put money into my lap, and I threw it out; he said, Married women wanted money sometimes unknown to their husbands; that was after I came down stairs, before the boy came. The boy went to order the beer, but it was never brought; I said, Normansel, I desire you will not confine me in this room; when I insisted strongly on getting out, finding the boy was coming to my assistance, and he saw I would not be put upon by him, then he opened the door, and went out; I thought he was gone; I ran to the door to call the boy; I saw the little boy coming, and said, Don't bring any beer, Normansel is gone, and he has used me very ill; the boy was at a distance with the beer; Normansel ran to me, from the Grotto, which is at the front of Coy's house, and pulled me back into my house, and said to the boy, Go and bring me a pint of porter, you dog; and the boy ran and brought the pint of porter; while the boy was gone for the beer, Normansel said to me, you had best not say any thing to this boy; I insist upon it; or it will be worse for you: he said, he would not let him in till I had given him a promise that I would not say anything to my husband, nor to any body, about what had happened.</p>
               <p>Did you promise him before you let the boy in? - No, I did not; the boy insisted upon coming in; the door was not, I believe, quite fast, only upon the latch; Normansel held me when he saw the boy coming; he said, If you say a word now, it will be the worse for you, for I will go and fasten all the doors, and confine you in, and the boy will think you are gone out: when the boy came, he stood at the parlour door, and took the beer from him, and I durst not stir, to look back, or to speak; the boy staid playing about the door, and in the passage. The boy had no notion he was such a villain as he is. The prisoner drank of the beer, and set it down on the table, and said, Good bye, Mrs. Askew, and went out. Then the little boy came in, and said, Lord, Aunt, what is the matter with you? with that Normansel ran in again, and said, Mrs. Askew, tell Askew I will be here to-morrow, at half past four, if not at two, and to wait for me; I will come certainly at that time; I said, Then, you villain, you may depend upon it, I will acquaint Mr. Askew of your behaviour; the boy was in the room, and heard me say this; then he went away directly, and left the boy with me.</p>
               <p>How old is the boy? - I believe eleven years of age.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No, they threatened to send him to sea. Mr. Eccles swore he would stick at nothing.</p>
               <p>(The counsel for the prisoner desired Mr. Eccles might be called into court; Mr. Eccles accordingly came into court.)</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the boy? - I cannot tell; I believe they have sent him away; I cannot positively say they have, but they threatened the boy, and said they would send him to sea: the boy has been gone from me three weeks; I was not at home when he went away; my husband sent me into the country, as he said, because of the threatenings of Mr. Eccles. I have enquired after the boy; my husband sent a letter to a blacksmith, at Colnbrook, where the boy had been before he came to me; and at my sister's, and one Crowley's, in St. Giles's; but have never been able to hear any thing of him. I left the boy, and went to my sister,

            's; I told the boy not to stir from the place; but, if his uncle came home, to tell him I was gone to my sister's, and to send him after me; and if he did not come to me, I should be home as soon as possible; that was between five and six o'clock. My sister lives in Parker's-street, Drury-Lane; she was ironing when I went in; I sat down in a chair by her; there was nobody with her that I recollect; she asked me what was the matter with me; I was not able to speak, I was so fatigued: I told her there was a man, one Normansel, who employed Mr. Askew to take his picture, came to our house within this hour and half, and has used me so ill, that I am not able to stand or go, with any propriety: I said, absolutely, he is more like a beast than a man; his treatment has been so vile to me, I cannot express it: she axed me, What has he done to you? I said, he has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250055"></xptr> used me in a very gross bad manner, he has pulled and hauled me about, and he absolutely deserves hanging: she said, I would bring an action against him; I said, an action is nothing, but, if the law takes place, I can hang him; for he has forced me, and lain with me, against my inclination. I said Betty, what had I best to do? I am determined to go to some justice, and complain against this man; but my husband not being at home, what can I do? If Mr. Askew comes home, I said, had I best tell him? for I am afraid of my life, for Mr. Askew is a man that absolutely does not like to have any such thing happen. If Mr. Askew does not condescend, and use me well, if I can do it of my own accord, I will go to a justice, if I am sure to want bread. She said, by all means, acquaint Mr. Askew of it. My husband staid out all that night. I staid at my sister's about an hour and an half. I went the next day to Mr. Parsons, to see for my husband; when I returned, which was three o'clock, he was come home, and was drunk; my sister was dressing some fish for dinner: he was very drunk; he went up stairs, and went to bed in his clothes: he lay four or five hours; then he got up; and I told him what had happened: it was too late to go before a magistrate then. I sent for my sister the next morning, that was Saturday; then my husband, my sister, and I went before Justice Wright, in Bow-Street, and obtained a warrant; and the prisoner was taken up the same day, and brought-before him, and committed.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination, she said, the boy was not before the justice, nor had he been examined by any person: That her husband said, after such a heinous crime, and such a disagreeable affair, it was impossible ever to think of living with her; but that no instructions were given to Mr. Pitman to draw up articles of separation between her and her husband; nor was any mention made of getting money of the prisoner, and her having half of it settled upon her; that there was a talk about money, but that she never meant to have a farthing of his money; that she never said, money was wanting, nor did she propose any sum, nor her husband in her presence: that when she was under the prisoner, on the bed, she sometimes got her right hand at liberty, and defended herself with it, as well as she could, and slapped his face; that with his left hand he kept hold of her left hand; that he came to her house at four o'clock, and the whole of the transaction was over by five o'clock. - That she and her husband had been confined, she first said in the King's Bench Prison, but afterwards she said it was in Newgate, for false swearing, and an assault. That there had been talk of a separation between her and her husband, before this; but that she never meant it sincerely. That when the prisoner forced her to go up stairs for a comb, she had hardly got to the top of the stairs, before he came after her. That the room door was open, but she did not go into the room before he came up. Being pressed for a reason why she did not go in, and lock the door, and call out of the window for help, she said, that he followed her up the stairs, but did not lay hold of her till she was at the top; that, as there was a bed in the room, she was afraid to go into the room, for fear he should ill use her. That she believed she did say before the justice, that she went into the room to fetch the comb, and he met her as she came out; but that she did not recollect what she then said, she was in such a fright, and was afraid of her life; but she now said, she did not go into the room, nor get him a comb at all.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a widow, and live in Parker's street, Drury-lane. My sister, the prosecutrix, came to me on the 15th of March, between five and six o'clock; I was ironing some linen; I thought by her looks she seemed very unhappy, as if she had been crying; I asked her what was the matter with her; she told me, that about four o'clock that afternoon, Normansel came to her house, and asked for Mr. Askew; that she was washing in the passage, with the door open; that she told him Mr. Askew was not at home; that Normansel went into the parlour, took a picture out of his pocket, and called Mrs. Askew to him, and said, Mrs. Askew, give this picture to Mr. Askew, to take a copy from it to do my hair by; that she went into the parlour to take the picture from him, and she turned about to settle the fire under the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250056"></xptr> water to make it hot for her washing; that he seemed as if he had gone out at the street-door, and she thought he was gone away, but instead of that he made fast the street-door, and came back again into the parlour; that she was sitting in a chair, and he sat down in her lap, and began to be very rude to her; put his hands down her bosom, attempted to put his hands up her petticoats, and kissed her; and at last she forced herself off the chair, and he dragged her back to another chair that was on the other side of the parlour; that she struggled with him some time, slapped his face, and pulled his hair; that when she did that, he said, Mrs. Askew, I am sorry for what I have done; and if you will give me a comb to settle my hair, I will not offend you any farther; that she said she would give him none; that then he let down the window curtains, and made the place dark, and insisted upon her bringing him a comb; that she persisted against it, and said she did not know where there was one; that he swore if she did not give him a comb, he would use her with all the violence imaginable; but if she did, he would not; for how did she think he could go out in that manner? that she ran to the door, and he ran after her, and pulled her back to the bottom of the stairs, and swore she must bring him a comb, or he would use her with all the severity imaginable, and pushed her towards the stairs with all his force: she said she went up stairs to get this comb for him; that by the time she got at the landing of the stairs, he followed her; that when she found him following her, she ran down a step or two of the stairs back again to meet him, but that he forcibly pushed her up the stairs before him, and took her in his arms towards the room-door, and that she laid hold of both the jambs of the door with her hands; that he took her round the waist in his arms, and squeezed her, she said, to that degree, that she was incapable of helping herself; then he forced her into the room, and as far as the foot of the bed; that she cried out, Murder! but he gave her a blow on the breast that hindered her crying out any more; that she called her husband, and he said, D - n you and Askew too; then she said, I will hang you, if there was no more men in the world; he said, I will use you as I like, if I was sure I should be hanged directly. This, upon my oath, she told me; every word in my own house. That she laid hold of the bed-post with one of her hands, and that he gave her arm a blow with his hand, and knocked her hand off the bed-post, and threw her down upon the bed, got her right hand under him, and her other hand under her back, in one of his hands; and by that means, in that form, by struggling some time upon the bed, that he forcibly and against her will lay with her. She sat down, and told me directly every word I have mentioned; there was no other conversation in the world: I went before the justice, and told this story.</p>
               <p>(On her cross-examination, she said she told her sister she was a great fool if she did not prosecute him according to law; that she understood at first that he had laid with her; that she shewed marks of violence to her; that the next day she went to her sister's about twelve o'clock, to see if Mr. Askew was come home; that she found her sister at home; that her sister left her in the house, and went to see after her husband; that he came home about half past two, very fuddled; that the dinner was dressed, but he could eat none; that he said he was sick, and she persuaded him to lie down; she said she was in the house from about twelve o'clock till he came in; that her sister came in about half an hour after; that she could not tell what they had for dinner that day; that whatever it was, she did not cook it; but that it was boiled meat; that it was on the fire when she came in; afterwards she said that it was not on the fire when she came in, but her sister set it on; that she did not know that it was fish; that her sister took the dinner up when she came in; that she never gave her sister any advice till she had told her the whole story, and knew what the prisoner had done to her.)</p>
               <p>The Prosecutrix called into court.</p>
               <p>Court. When you f irst went to your sister's house, you said you was very much<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250057"></xptr> confused, and did not immediately tell her all that had happened to you? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>You told her at first that the man had pulled you about, and used you ill; what advice did she give you? - She said, I would not be pulled about and ill-used by any body; enter an action against him; I said, An action! if justice takes place, I can hang him. Hang him! said she; I would do my endeavour, as far as justice, to punish any body.</p>
               <p>Then you told her he had lain with you against your consent?</p>
               <p>How soon after that was it before you told her all the particulars? - The next day, I believe.</p>
               <p>When did you shew her the marks of violence that were upon your person? - The next day.</p>
               <p>When you went to look for your husband, your sister was then coming to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you desire her to get ready for dinner? - Some fish.</p>
               <p>Who was to buy the fish? - She and I went out together to buy the fish. This is truth, upon my oath: she and I bought the fish together; I just stopped and paid for the fish.</p>
               <p>Before you went into your own house? - Yes; and I desired her to dress it, while I went to seek for my husband.</p>
               <p>Did the do as you desired her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it fryed or boiled? - Boiled.</p>
               <p>What fish was it? - Barrelled cod: we had eggs and potatoes with it; she got them ready too.</p>
               <p>(The counsel for the crown gave up the prosecution.)</p>

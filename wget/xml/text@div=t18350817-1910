I was examined before the Coroner—One Friday the 17th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing by the coach-rank in the Borough-road, and saw two old people coming from the Blind-school to<lb></lb>wards the Borough-road, arm in arm—when they got two or three yards from the Blind-school, a chaise, with two gentlemen in it, called out as loud as they could for them to get out of the way, and the old people pushed back—that drew my attention to the way they were crossing, and when they got near the obelisk, I saw a cab coming from Westminster-road towards the Borough-road—when the cabman came within ten yards of them, I heard him call out "Ahoy," as loud as he could—the horse he had got seemed to spring forwards—the old lady seemed frightened and turned the old gentleman in a different direction, more towards the coach-stand than to the cab, which caused his back to be more towards the cab than his face—the shaft of the cab then struck the man somewhere in the back or ribs, and knocked him down—the man shoved the woman further away—I do not think the woman was struck at all, except the force of the shaft striking the man, caused her to fall—I am sure she was not struck at all—she appeared frightened, and was picked up by somebody—I should think the cab was going at about eight miles an hour—I am no judge of these things—when he hallood out, the horse seemed to go faster than before.</p>

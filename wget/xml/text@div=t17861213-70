               <p>I live in Hatton court: on the 5th of this month, I lost a great coat; I hung it up in the Carolina coffee-house, about six in the evening; I missed it in about an hour and a half; I went up the further end of the room; I heard a bustle, and went to see what was the matter; I saw Mr. Harper, the master of the coffee-house, have hold of the prisoner, and my great coat then lay at the prisoner's feet.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the waiter at the Carolina coffee-house; I saw the prisoner come into the coffee-room, on Tuesday, the 5th of this month, a quarter past seven, with an umbrella in his hand; he asked me for a glass of brandy and water, which I served him with, and he paid me immediately; he drank a part of it by the fire; and then he went and set in one of the boxes; he sat there some considerable time; then he moved into the box, where the great coats hung.</p>


               <p>Did you see the great coat hanging there before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know whose it was? - Having some suspicion of him, I was determined to pay attention to him; and I saw him, about five minutes after, draw the coat off a curtain rod where it hung; there were two or three other great coats; he left the great coat at the end of the bench; afterwards he got up, and walked to the fire place, and looked about him, and seeing no person about the fire, he went in again.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - I was behind the door, looking through a glass door for the purpose of watching him; when he had been in the box about a minute, he came out with a great coat rolled up under his arm; he had no great coat on when he came in; and I came from behind the door and caught him; I asked him what business he had with that coat; he signified that it must be a mistake; my master came up immediately, and caught hold of him, and sent for a constable, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Was he a customer of yours? - He had been two or three times before; the reason I suspected him was, a gentleman had lost his great coat about the same time; I should know the great coat again.</p>

I am barman at the Three Tuns—on September 2nd about 1 o'clock I came into the bar, when Mr. Eady went to his dinner—I noticed a bad sixpence on the money board when I turned to get change for a florin—I spoke to Mr. Eady, and on returning I found the prisoner in front of the bar—she asked for half a pint of id. ale, and tendered a sixpence, and I saw it had just the same date on it as the other—I went to Mr. Eady, and he came into the bar and said "You are the woman I served here just now," and he held the two sixpences up, and said "You must be the woman I served here just now, and I have taken one before this"—she threw down a shilling, and wanted him to let her go—she was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder and stationer, at 43, Cannon-street, 8t. George's. The prisoner was in my service three weeks—on Sunday morning, 26th Dec., I missed a bottle of gin, and asked the prisoner what she had done with it—she said she knew nothing about it—she was quite intoxi<lb></lb>cated—I sent for a constable, made a search, and on the top of a shed in the yard we found these perforated cards—they are mine—the prisoner told the constable, in my presence, that he need not look further, that was all she bad taken—I afterwards saw him find some sheets of paper concealed in an old bedstead in the yard—it is mine—it has my stamp on it—it had been part of the stock of the shop.</p>

In consequence of information, I went to Mr. Hipkins', and told the prisoner she was suspected of stealing a bottle of gin—she said her father had been twenty years in one place, and she would not be accused of anything—I searched for it, and Mr. Hipkins found these cards on a shed in the yard, in my presence—the prisoner said, "I have taken them and put them there, you need not search for any more"—I found these thirty-eight sheets of writing-paper in a bedstead in the yard—she said she put them there—she was very violent, and tried to escape—she appeared to have been drinking freely.</p>

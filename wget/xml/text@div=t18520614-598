                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Mears, bell-founders, of White-chapel. On 27th April I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in consequence of which, on the following morning, I went to 23, Old Fish-street, and saw a woman, who sent for the prisoner—he said he had an order to fit up a gentle<lb></lb>man's mansion, in the country, with two large bells, and he likewise had a warehouse to fit up with alarums; that he wanted the things very quickly, and wanted to know when he could have them—I produced the letter to him, I believe he did not say anything about it—I told him I did not exactly know what bells Messrs. Mears had in stock; he had better come down to the foundry—I had not known him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the foundry; I am not a member of the firm. On 27th April the prisoner came, and said he wished to look at two bells, of 2 cwt. each, for a contract he had got in the country—I told him we had not any of that size made then, but there was another small bell, which he said would do—I said we were making some, which he could have—he then said he wished for four dozen alarums for warehouse doors—he went with me up to another part of the warehouse to look out the size—he then said he had left his pocket-book, containing the order—I said it was very unfortunate—the small bell was sent to him on 29th April, by my brother's cart, and on 1st May a town carman delivered to him the second bell, and the four dozen alarums—on 14th May I went to a shop in Cow-cross, and saw two of the alarums, and the large bell, which had been delivered by the carman on 1st May—it was worth about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have also seen the bell which went away on 29th April, at a saleroom in Leadenhall-street—I had my brother's consent before I parted with the articles—the large bell left between 3 and 4 o'clock on 1st May.</p>

               <p>not look to see whether his father dealt with my father—his father was in the same business—I do not know that the prisoner was threatened to be sued—he was applied to for the money—when we found the goods hsd been sold, my brother put the matter into the hands of a solicitor, to recover the amount—I did not agree to give three months' credit—I do not think my brother would give any credit at all.</p>

Gentlemen,—Requiring two bells, about 2 cwts. each, and also four dozen of alarum bells suitable for large warehouse doors, I can give you an order for the same, on my usual terms, three months' credit, the same credit you gave my father. Perhaps you do not recollect us. I wish to know the price of the two large bells: they are for a gentleman's country mansion, and must not be less than 2 cwts. each bell: and how soon I can have the same, as I am greatly <hi rend="italic">drove</hi> to execute the order in time.

I have got a bell at home, which was shown to Mr. Mears—it was hanging up in front of the house—the prisoner brought it to me on 1st May, in a cart, with a lot of alarums, and asked me to buy it—he said he had got a contract for a gentleman's mansion in the country, who had afterwards given up the contract, and had paid half the expense of casting it; it was of no use to him, and he wanted to dispose of it—I asked him what he wanted for it—he said 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I offered him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he shut up the tailboard of the cart, and then said, "Will you give six guineas?"—I said, "Yes;" and he asked me to make it 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and take the two alarums, which I did—I cannot recollect what time of day it was, but I think it was about the middle of the day—the name of Mears was on the bell.</p>

            . I was at the Cock and Bottle in Cannon-street, but cannot say the day of the month, it was the same time Mrs. Wilson means.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I do not know the time, but it was in April.</p>
               <p>Kelley. I saw the prisoner there, and he moved the tankard to where he sat, and put it on the seat behind him; he moved from one box to another; he asked what it was o'clock, being told, he said it was time for him to go. I wish you a good night, and was going away with this tankard. I said, my friend, leave the tankard behind you, and laid hold of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he the tankard?</p>
               <p>Kelley. He had it under his coat, and was got to the door; there are two doors. I laid hold of him in the first door way, that door stood open. Mrs. Wilson took the tankard out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Kelley. He said he was not going away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this tankard taken from?</p>
               <p>Kelley. From out of one of the boxes.</p>

               <p>I went into this house, and had a pint of beer, and sat down and drank it in a box; there were three men, one of them said he thought he knew me; I said I think I know something of your face, did you never live at Hummerton; he said he did, he was a butcher there. When we had talked together a little, he asked me to drink. I drank out of the same tankard. Then I put my beer into the tankard, they went away, and left me a little beer in it. I called for a pennyworth more, and had it in the same tankard. When I was going away, I saw some ragged men set just by the fire place; I took the tankard in order to put it safe; when I was near the door, I thought I saw a man that I knew; I just took hold of the door to see whether I knew him or not. I had the tankard in my hand, this man came and took hold of my hand, and said what are you going to do with the tankard. I said nothing;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175805100004"></xptr> the gentlewoman came and took it. I had no thoughts of stealing it.</p>

I am the chief examiner of spoiled stamps at Somerset House—these four stamps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), were brought into my room by one of the clerks—I had Shipley brought in, and I asked him if he had brought the stamps for allowance, he said he had—I asked him from whom he obtained them—he said from a Mr. Bennett; I asked him what Mr. Bennett was, and he said a costermonger—I asked him where he lived, he said, some place near King's Cross—I have forgotten the name—I asked him if he knew where Mr. Bennett got them from—he said he believed he got them from a cattle-dealer, in payment for a debt—I asked him where the cattle-dealer resided, and his name—he said he did not know—I asked him where he was likely to be found, and he said somewhere about the cattle-market—I then said, "Why did you bring these in"—he said, "I did it to oblige my friend, Mr. Bennett"—I asked him why Mr. Bennett</p>

Fifteen-foot Lane, King's Cross, and was a costermonger—I asked him if he could account for the possession of the stamps—he said "I got them from a cattle dealer, who lodged with me, in part payment of rent"—I asked him if he knew the cattle dealer's name and address—he said he lid not—he said he did not know where he could find him, unless it was up at the cattle market next Thursday—I took thorn both to the static:—I found on Shipley a letter addressed "4, Fifteen-foot Lane, King's Cross"—that was the address that Bennett had given—I went there, and found that Bennett lived there—I did not find any cattle dealer there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a photographer, of 205, City Road—on 21st Feb. about 9 p.m., I was in East Road, the prisoner came across me, took a medal and chain out of my pocket, hit me in the face and knocked me down—I was stunned and could not see him—I cannot identify him, but I saw the man turn the corner with the medal and chain in his hand—I have not seen them again.</p>

On the night of 21st February the prisoner and three men were pointed out to me in East Road, they all ran away—I ran after the prisoner, took him in a coffee-shop, and charged him with assaulting George Hill—he said he had not seen him and had been at work till 7 o'clock.</p>

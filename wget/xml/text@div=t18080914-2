               <p>Q. Did you lose any property out of your apartment - A. I did, on the 26th of July between the hours of three and four in the afternoon. I left my apartments about twelve o'clock; I left nobody in my apartment; there might be people in the house; I have only the apartment; there is no lock to my door; I fasten it with a nail; I came back between the hours of three and four and missed my property; the door was open and the nail that fastened it was taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen your property since - A. Yes, at Mr. Matthews, pawnbroker, Wheeler street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose - A. One gown, two white petticoats and a pair of breeches; I value the whole at a guinea. When I came out I saw

I am a shoemaker, the prisoner worked for me; I had some conversation with her about some things she had taken out of pawn on the 27th of July, she said she had taken nothing out of pawn on that day, only a child's gown for six pence; I was informed she had taken three articles out of pawn; I asked her if she had any money from Tom, the man she lives with, she said no, he would give her no money, if it was to save her life; I told her that I suspected that she had taken Mrs. Short's things away; she had only one shilling and sixpence of me on that day.</p>

I am as innocent of what I am blamed as the infant within me; when I went to Mr. Steele, I carried him four pair of shoes: his woman that he lives with, sells coals; I asked her for some; I crossed over the way to a butcher to buy a sheep's head; I ask'd the woman if she would let me go into the yard; when I came out of her yard I went into the cellar, I took up the bag of coals, and went home; the prosecutrix sent a girl to watch me home; I had not been home long before the mother and she came; she said if I would give the tickets up, she would forgive me; she said I was afraid to let her look in my box; I told her she was welcome; she looked in my box and in my bedstead, she could not find them; she said I do not think it is you, it must be somebody else, because the door was fastened curiously with a nail; she said a woman saw me come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140004"></xptr>out; I went to the woman; the woman said it was not me, it was a lustier woman than I am; my husband brought me home a pound note from the West India docks; I went to Mr. Lamport immediately and took out the articles while I had the money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

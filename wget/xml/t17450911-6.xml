Between three and four, says I, Mary, you are a fine servant to stay here all this afternoon (for she said she was a servant, and lived next door to Dr. Bamber .) She said she waited for the Bow coach. Some time after that I told her so again, and then she said all the family were in the country. I drank the last of our beer, and handed the tankard to Mary, the maid of the house; this was about 8 o'clock, and at that time the Prisoner said to Mary, the maid draw me a tankard of beer, and the maid of the house went to draw it in a pewter tankard, the Prisoner made reply, Why do you draw it in a pewter tankard? I and my fellow servants can drink out of a silver tankard as well as those men: the maid of the house said, a pewter tankard was as good as a silver one; the Prisoner said, she would have a silver tankard, and I saw the maid bring the silver tankard up full, and set it down upon a little table in the room, and the Prisoner took the tankard off the table, and said, she would go into the little room by the bar; and the maid of the house followed her the room, and came back to us. I said, Mary, there is a tankard of beer that she has had, which shall have to pay for, if you do not take care of it ; she went into the room the Prisoner went into , and said, Lord, Mr. Fell, there is no body there , and the candle is blown out; said I, what is the tankard? she said, I cannot tell; said I the candle and see; she took the candle and looked , and the tankard was gone, and no body there : presently Mrs. Cross came down, and she said to me, for God's sake go and look after the tankard; said I, what can I do? I cannot do any thing in it, but she desired I would. I knew the Prisoner used to go sometimes to a place where she had an acquaintance, and I intended to go there; but I thought as I went along, I would call at two or three pawnbrokers to try if I could hear any thing of it: I happened to go into a pawnbroker's in Houndsditch, and said, there was a silver tankard lost from the Angel in Whitechapel, and asked if they had seen such a tankard, marked R.C.S. the man seemed in a surprise; said I, you need not be in a surprise, for I have got the Prisoner, though I had not, but I said so, because I saw him in a surprise: said I, let me see the tankard, there's nothing at all in that; so he took the tankard out of a drawer from under the counter, and shewed it me: I said it was Mr. Cross's tankard: he said, the person that brought it to him was an honest girl, for he had known her a great while, and told me that I must look after the Prisoner: I said, as I had seen the tankard, I would not trouble myself about it, for they should find out the Prisoner; and in about an hour they found the Prisoner and brought her to the pawnbroker's shop.</p>

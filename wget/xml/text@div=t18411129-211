I am master of the barque <hi rend="italic">Thomas Laurie</hi>, which, in September last, laid in St. Katherine's Dock, and had brought home some bales of wool, secured with ropes of hemp round them—we call them bands—the wool was landed on the 14th of November—the bands of hemp were cut from the bales—some remained on board, and some on the quay of the dock—they were the property of George Bishop, the owner of the vessel—I had authority from him to dispose of them—on Monday, the 15th of November, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was on board the vessel in the Dock—the whole of the rope was lying on the quarter-deck—the prisoner Bond came to me and asked if I would dispose of it—I said, "Yes," and asked what he would give me for it—he said 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.—I said he should have it at that price—I said he should have it weighed alongside the ship, and pay the money for it before it was taken out of the Docks—he said, "Very well"—he said he would come to-morrow morning and take it away, and pay me for it—we did not agree to any particular hour that he was to come, but he was not to have it unless I was present—he went away—I went on board between eleven and twelve next morning, and found the goods were gone—there was about 4cwt. of rope there the day before, it appears so since—he was not to have them away till they were weighed and paid for—I am cer<lb></lb>tain that was the agreement—I never had dealings with him before—goods</p>

On the 15th of November I saw Bond talking to the captain on the quarter-deck—on the following morning, between eight and nine o'clock, Bond came on board again—it was not usual for the captain to come so early in the morning—I asked Bond if he was going to take the rope away—I supposed he had authority to take it—he said he was come to take it—we threw it from the vessel on to the quay—Sheedy stood on the quay and assisted in loading it—I went down to my breakfast while this was going on, supposing it all right—when I came up I found the rope and the prisoners both gone—I made inquiry of King, a Cus<lb></lb>tom-house officer, and then went out of the gate into the street after the prisoners—I found them drawing a truck along with the bands in it—I asked Bond if he was going to pay me the money—he said, "Oh, yes, I will be back again in five minutes"—the captain ha told me what the agreement was—I told him he knew the agreement between the cap<lb></lb>tain and him—he said, "Oh, yes, he did"—I did not tell him what the agreement was—he said he was going to sell them first—they had never been weighed—I still permitted them to go—I afterwards told Captain Price what had happened—I knew it had not been paid for—I received no money for it—if I had known they meant to take it out of the gate, I should not have allowed it, because of the captain's orders.</p>

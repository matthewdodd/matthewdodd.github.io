On the 17th of November the prisoner came to my shop, and bought cheese, which he paid 18 s. 11 d. for - he was unknown to me till then. On the 19th he came again, and asked if I had got any old Cheshire cheese - I shewed him two; he selected one, which weighed 59 lbs. He then selected two new cheeses, weighing 51 lbs. I shewed him another, which weighed 10 lbs., which he also bought - he asked me to send them to the same place as I had the others, and he would return the money for them; they came to 4 l. 11 s. 6 d. I sent my man with them, and a bill, in about two hours, to No. 13, Fetter-lane, and told him to bring back the goods or the money; he was not to leave them without the money. The man returned with 11 s. in silver, and sixteen paper parcels, which I supposed to be 5 s. papers of copper, but they contained lead; eight having a penny piece at each end, and the other eight a halfpenny; I did not find it out till next day, and then went to Fetter-lane, but could hear nothing of him. I found him in Old Gravel-lane, Borough, a week afterwards.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's shopman. On the 19th of November I went to No. 13, Fetter-lane, with these cheeses, and was not to leave them without the money - it is a front room on the ground floor. I found the prisoner there, and took the goods in; I saw these parcels laying on the window, and said,</p>
               <p>"I see you have got a load for me to take back, as well as to bring here" -</p>
               <p>"Yes," said he</p>
               <p>"4 l. worth of copper;" I expected that they were for me, seeing them lay there. I said my master did not like coppers - he said,</p>
               <p>"You may have either silver or copper, which you please;" I said,</p>
               <p>"I will thank you to let me have silver then." I waited some time, and he said all at once,</p>
               <p>"You must take these coppers." I asked why he had not got his shelves and counters fixed: he said he could not get a carpenter. He gave these sixteen parcels into my hand, four at a time - he lifted them on my head. Nothing more passed. I took them home.</p>
               <p>MR. CARRINGTON. I did not open the parcels, but paid eight of them away to Mr. Tully, of Leadenhall-market, next day; he sent them back that afternoon - I then opened the rest, and found they contained lead.</p>

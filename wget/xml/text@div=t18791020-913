I am the prisoner's wife and live at 32, Stanhope Street, Hampstead Road—on the night of 15th September, when I was in bed, I heard my husband strike a match; I raised my head, saw it was my husband—I remember no more until I felt his hand on my neck; he squeezed it, but not very heavily; blood came from my ears, I could not rightly tell how he did it—nothing happened to my ears, there was a little blood in my earhole, I did not find that out till some time after, as I went to the police station that same morning—nothing happened to my eyes—I had a bit of a cold in my eyes; they were bloodshot next day, not that night—I was insensible for a few minutes; that was from the fright; when I came to myself I got out of bed and went downstairs and made an alarm—I then went back and put on my clothes and went to the station in Albany Street and made a complaint—my husband had been drinking for a whole fortnight before this and had never been sober once—when sober a better husband could not be or a more tender father—we</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing director in the house of Messrs. Gagniere and Co., Golden Square, woollen drapers and manufacturers—our woollen goods are made exclusively from patterns and designs invented for us—they are frequently invented twelve months' in advance of the time they are wanted—our patterns are of immense value to us, because on the novelty of our designs depends the reputation and interest of our house—I have several books in which we enter, exclusively, patterns ordered perhaps two seasons in advance—I cannot put a value on the patterns because single design, of which perhaps six colourings are made, enables us to sell as much 5,000 yards of trowserings which represents, perhaps 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a short time ago I saw this advertisement in the "Telegraph," and also this one. (<hi rend="italic">These advertisements were addressed to cutters and travellers offering good terms for new patterns and designs, and purporting to emanate from a foreign house doing no trade in Great Britain.</hi>) After the second advertisement I gave Laughlin, who is in my employ, some instructions respecting it, he subse<lb></lb>quently showed me a letter and I gave him other directions in consequence of which he told me he was going out, and told me where he was going—he afterwards told me the result of an interview he had had—according to my directions he wrote again and I gave him a great number of patterns—I could identify them, but I have not seen them since the examination—the patterns that were produced were the ones that Laughlin obtained, and were found on the prisoner—I heard that according to my directions the prisoner was given into custody—we send goods to nearly all countries in the world.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We sell goods manufactured for us—we order a certain quantity in advance—there is a great deal of cutting up on our premises for the execution of orders—we supply first-class tailors in the piece, like Poole—probably odd pieces would be left—we have men in our employ who make pattern cards of this size for our travellers—in May or April, 1877, I order the goods for the Spring season of 1878—I then engage the designs either from ideas suggested or what not, and I order for the month of May or June, a yard length of each particular thing that I order from which a number of men in our hire make up collections of travellers' patterns, which takes a considerable time because there are a great many travellers going to all countries of the world, and they set out on their journies in September—they will start in the months of September and October next, with all our novelties for the coming Spring of 1878—during the interval the goods are being manufactured, and we only receive them in the piece in November and December—Laughlin has been many years in our employ, and is a most trustworthy man—there was nothing in the advertisements about "No rough Scotch or Cheviots"—I was shown a letter of 21st July, from the defendant—Messrs. Holland and Sherry's is a rival house, and Dormeuil, and Kennerley and Co—they are all very extensive houses, and we all of us do a large American trade.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in Messrs. Gagniere's employ—my attention was called to the first advertisement in the "Daily Tele-graph, "and I received instructions from Mr. Coleman, in consequence of which I answered the advertisement,-which was addressed to Ettlich and Co., Charing Cross post-office—I received this reply through the Dead Letter Office—it is addressed to Mr. Loughlin, 137, Eye Lane, Peckham, which is my private address—some time afterwards I saw in the "Daily Telegraph" this No. 2, which I also answered. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "137, Rye Lane, Peckham, July 21st, 1877. Sir,—Having seen your advertisement in to-day's "Telegraph," I beg to inform you I am engaged in a first-class West-end house and can supply the latest novelties,"&amp;c.) I received this letter of the same date in reply—on Monday, 23rd July, in consequence of which I went to the York-shire Grey, public-house, Piccadilly, and the prisoner came into the luncheon bar—he had on a pair of homespun plaid trowsers, as indicated in the letter—I rose as he came in—he came up to me and asked if my name was Loughlin, and he said he had received several answers to his advertisement, several of which he showed me, but not the names and addresses—he asked me what facilities I had for getting the new patterns required and I told him—I had the entire charge of all the new patterns in the house of Gag<lb></lb>niere and Co., and he said it was a first-class one and he would make it worth. my while to get him some of them; he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the season's patterns—he said "Mind, that is just ten <hi rend="italic">bob</hi> a week"—he asked me if I was not afraid to answer the advertisement—I told him "No," I had care<lb></lb>fully considered it, and being alone in the matter I felt quite safe—he told me he would pay almost any price for the novelties; that he had paid a man 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only a few days before for what was really worth nothing, but he bought it might lead to something better—he also asked me if I knew any Pattern cutters in any other houses—I told him I did not and I wouldn't ouch anything I couldn't do myself—he said if I could get the names and addresses of any he could arrange everything else with them, and at the</p>

               <p>finish he told me if I could get two others like myself he could divide 150'. between us, and it would be a regular thing—he said he didn't want the rough stuffs and said "I will give you what I do want,"and gave me this list "<hi rend="italic">No</hi> rough Scotch, that is to say, Cheviots; only fancy worsted; plain, blanch and blue silk; mixed worsted, West of England; Yorkshire and French, as many as possible; and suitings"—double widths are called "suitings"—I took the list away with me and informed Mr. Coleman of what had happened, and in consequence I made another appointment to meet him at the Yorkshire Grey, where I went on the Thursday at 1 o'clock, provided with two parcels of patterns of novelties which I had received from Mr. Coleman—the prisoner came in and said "Well, have you got anything for me?" or something of that kind, I do not remember the exact words—I told him I had got a very nice lot of patterns for him and I opened them and showed them to him—he said he saw they were the right kind of thing, "But, good God, this is nothing of Gagniere's stock, I meant the whole lot"—he asked me if they were all new and said he would give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this lot and make it 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he could see he could afford to pay me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year regular, but would give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that lot and I was to bring as many as I could as soon as possible, and asked me when I could do the next lot—I said about Sunday and that I would take him a few at a time whenever I met him—he said "Cannot you get some out at the dinner time?"—I said "Yes," I would so as to get a larger lot and quicker, and he could come to my lodgings for them on Sunday, when it was suggested that I should go to his house with them and dine with him, when he would show me some he had from the letters he had shown me—he said he had an appointment with a gentleman from America and could not stop—he then proposed to leave the house and gave me the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the patterns I gave him—I had a detective outside and he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went for the purpose of trapping the prisoner into this—I do not remember that I said anything before the Magistrate about his asking me if I was afraid to answer the advertisement, very little was said—I do not think I said before the Magistrate anything about getting another to do the came and it being worth 150/. a year; I was prepared to say it—I can't remember whether I said anything about the patterns being a very choice lot, or about his making it worth 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year to me, or about my taking some patterns out at dinner time, or about my dining with him; whether 1 did or no I know that such was the case—I do not remember whether I said anything about his appointment with a gentleman—it was understood that I cut the cuttings or clippings myself—I did not tell the prisoner I was able to get clippings—he knew Gagniere and Co.'s was a well-known house, because he wrote to me to that effect before 1 saw him—I do not remember whether I was the first person who mentioned next Summer's patterns—I did not say that the Summer patterns were cut up to so many odds and ends that I could easily give him some snippings, or that I was not well paid and was always ready to make a little bit extra—he asked me some question about it—he said "I suppose you have plenty of work and not much pay"—I said "Plenty of work, but nothing to grumble at"—I said nothing about pieces I could get which were perquisites—I saw Mr. Coleman directly after I got back from my first visit—there have been cases of our patterns being anticipated occasionally, I suppose—I am certain that other houses in London have not such good patterns as ours—I believe these to be the packets of patterns which I handed to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in White Horse-street. Stepney; the prisoner and his wife live in Honest Lawyer-court, White Horse-street. On Saturday, the 28th of September, about seven o'clock in the afternoon, I was sent for to their lodging—a woman came for me—I found the prisoner there, and three or four women with his wife and a man—I knew the prisoner, having attended them several times—he appear<lb></lb>ed to be crying and was supporting his wife, who was bleeding from the arm—she had an incision on the left arm, five inches long and three quarters of an inch deep—it appeared dangerous—there was considerable effusion of blood—it appeared to have been done by some sharp in<lb></lb>strument—it must have been done first with puncture, and then the in<lb></lb>strument drawn downwards—there was only one wound—I put in six or eight sutures, and strapped it over with adhesive plaster—I said to the prisoner that I was quite surprised that he should do so (the woman who fetched me had told me something)—he said I should not be surprised if I knew the cause, and at another time he would tell me the cause—be said he had threatened her twenty times, and that it was through jealousy—a knife was shown to me at Lambeth-street, which I should say would do the injury—she was taken to the hospital—I did not attend her there—I have seen her since she has left the hospital—she has got pretty well—she cannot use her arm as she did before—the wound is not calculated to produce permanent injury—I should think in a week or two longer it will be quite recovered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called to the prisoner's lodging on Saturday, the 28th of September, and saw him and his wife, and Mr. Donahoo attending her—she was bleeding profusely—I said to the prisoner, "Are you aware what you have done?"—he said, "Quite aware, and I had cause"—I saw a constable find a knife among others on a shelf covered with blood—the prisoner said, "Is the knife found?"—I said, "Yes"—it was shown to him, and he said, "That is it"—I took him to the station-house—as we went along he pointed over to a house, and said, "That is the fellow who is the cause of all this, and I should like to stick him to the heart"—he said he had threatened her twenty times, and now he had done it, and he did not care if he was hanged for it to-morrow morning—I cautioned him several times, telling him any thing he said I should feel bound to use against him—he after<lb></lb>wards said, "I will tell you how I did it, 1 took up a knife and I threatened her four or five times—we were in the dark, and I struck her, and when a light was brought I was stunned to see what I had done"—he said it was an old jealousy, an old grudge, an old quarrel—he was sober—he might have been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Otto Alexander Berens, and another, of St. Paul's Churchyard, it is a large establishment, and they employ a great number of people—among other things they deal in clocks—the prisoner, Pope, was in their service—my attention was called to his conduct on 30th April—I went with him to a house where he lived, at Dalston, and there found a good deal of property belonging to my em<lb></lb>ployers—the next day Pope made a statement to me, in consequence of which, on 3rd May, I went to the house of the prisoner Hirschfield, in Bishopsgate-street Within—Pope remained outside—he gave me the number of the shop—it is in the public street; it is a shop for the sale of clocks, watches, jewellery, and miscellaneous articles of that sort—I saw four or five clocks in the window before I went in—I found his wife in the shop—she called him, and he came forward—I asked him to let me look at one of the clocks in the window—he did so, and I recognised it as one of Mr. Beren's—I asked him the price—he said either 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 65<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I do not exactly recollect which—I then asked for another, and so went through five (<hi rend="italic">looking at five clocks</hi>)—I believe this marble one is the first one I looked at, and these are the others—I only asked the price of one—they were all on the counter at the time—four of them were in the window and one in the shop—both the marble clocks were in the window—after examining the clocks, I told Hirschfield they were stolen, and inquired where he bought them—he said he bought them of some young man living at Kingsland, that his wife purchased the first for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the black one he gave either 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for,</p>

               <p>himself, and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for each of the marble ones—I asked him whether he bought anything else—he said, "Yes, I have bought ten duplicates, for which I gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, on the understanding that if they turned out well I would give a trifle more"—he said the duplicates were for clocks—he pro<lb></lb>duced nine duplicates—I do not recollect whether he mentioned the tenth—I sent Mr. Tucker, who was with me, for a policeman, to be present while I directed Mr. Tucker to take an account of the duplicates which he had—the policeman came in, and I believe the prisoner Pope with him—I directed Tucker to bring him in, and Hirschfield immediately identified him as the person of whom he bought the clocks—Pope was not in custody—I had not spoken to the policeman before, it was only a casual policeman that I spoke to—an altercation took place between the prisoners—Hirschfield said to Pope, "You have deceived me, in representing you were in business in Dalston, and that you were in difficulties"—Pope said, "You have held out every inducement to me to bring property"—Tucker had commenced making a list of the duplicates, and had taken down two, I believe, or he might have commenced the third, and Hirschfield said, "I will not allow it to be taken down, if you like to pay me for them you may have them"—the policeman reminded him that if he did not permit me to take them down, I could give him in charge as well as Pope, and after some little hesitation on Hirschfield's part, the list was proceeded with—Heischfield said that he had taken one of the clocks out of pledge—I believe that clock was in the shop—it was one of the rosewood ones—Pope was given into custody the following morning—I left Hirschfield in the shop—these goods are not in my department, but in Mr. Taylor's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Thomas Johnson, pawnbroker, of 184, Bishopsgate-street, about five minutes' walk from Hirschfield's shop. I produce a clock, which was pawned for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of John Smith.</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor for this prosecution. I attended at Guildhall when this matter was inquired into as to Pope before Sir Robert Carden—Hirschfield was summoned there with a number of other witnesses—he made a statement before Sir Robert Carden, which was taken down in writing—he was sworn and examined—I have a copy of his statement—it was read over to him afterwards in my presence, and signed by the Alderman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185207050004"></xptr>
               <p>—he corrected some portions of it as it went on, and those corrections were made in this copy—after hearing him examined, Sir Robert Carden thought it proper that he should be placed by the side of Pope, and wished to know whether Mr. Wood would give him into custody—Mr. Wood said he thought it his duty to do so, and he was thereupon given into custody—his statement was read over to him, and he refused to sign it—his solicitor advised him not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There were two examinations, were there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at one of which Hirschfield was examined as a witness—Mr. Wood, the clerk, took down the examination, he will be here in a moment—on the next occasion a copy of the rough notes was read over to him, and he made some alterations—he said he was deaf, and I therefore spoke very loud to him—he did not desire to make any alteration which was refused to be made—he did not refuse to sign it because of his not being able to alter some part of it—he would have signed it, only his solicitor advised him not.</p>

                  </hi>. I took down the examination of Hirschfield on a charge against the prisoner Pope, before Sir Robert Carden—this copy has the Alderman's signature to it—it was read over to the prisoner Hirschfield, and is an accurate representation of what he stated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There was no attorney present for Hirschfield on the first examination was there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have no recollection on the second occasion, when the attorney attended, that he applied to have any alteration made in his statement—I did not, to my recollection, refer to my note and say that was what he had said, and I would not alter it—I cannot charge my memory one way or the other—I should rather think nothing was said, or I should have recollected it—I do not recollect the attorney wishing to ask Hirschfield some further questions with a view to explain what passed on the former occasion—it is not unlikely that I advised the Alderman that the depositions having been made out, it could not be done, as he had been remanded for committal—it is a matter of practice that when the depositions are entirely completed, and there has been the benefit of cross-examination, and the prisoner is entirely remanded for the depositions to be transcribed, that alterations are not allowed—any statement the prisoner volunteers I am bound to take—Hirschfield was a witness when he made this statement, it was taken down as his evidence.</p>

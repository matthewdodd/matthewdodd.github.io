I saw the prisoner at the bar close by my left-hand. He kept his elbow in a suspicious position, close to his body. I said, friend, I have lost something, let me see what you have got under your coat. He would not, but returned towards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175702230003"></xptr> the north isle, saying, he was no sailor, and had never been at sea, and went as fast as he could from me. When he was got near the wall he was surrounded with people. I pull'd his arm up, and my handkerchief drop'd on the pavement. I took it up. (Produced in court, and deposed to.) I had wore it in my pocket all that day, till that time.</p>

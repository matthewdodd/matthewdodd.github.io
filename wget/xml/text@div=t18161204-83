On the 14th of November, I was at Mr. Dishbourn's, in Old Gravel-lane; it is a private house, I might be a little in liquor, but not much. I had only drank two glasses of rum and water. Mr. Dishbourn's is not more than one hundred yards from my own house. I left his house, and had not got more than thirty yards before I was molested by two or three men, who demanded some drink-money, which I refused, when they immediately pushed me up against a wall; I fell down, and they went away; when I got up two women came and spoke to me, left me, and went up a lane; I then went home, when I was at my own door I missed my watch-my seals had been hanging out. I had seen my watch at Mr. Dishbourn's; I saw it the next morning at the Police-Office.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS JACKSON. I took the watch from the prisoner Jeffries, at about a quarter past two in the morning, on the 5th of November; I heard the two prisoners wrangling about dividing some property; I also heard them disputing concerning a seal, upon which Proctor had lent them one shilling. I asked them what they were disputing about, they said, it was nothing but a joke. I asked about the seal, they told me, that it was Jeffries's husband's seal upon which Proctor had lent them one shilling. I took them to the watch-house, I then went to Proctor's and got the seal from him.</p>

The two prisoners came to me about one o'clock in the morning of the 5th of November, Burns had got a bottle with her, and asked me to lend her a shilling, as her father was gone to bed; I refused; when Jeffries offered me the seal, which, she said, was her husband's, and she would return the shilling again in the morning.

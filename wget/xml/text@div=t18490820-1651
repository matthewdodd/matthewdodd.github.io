                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Arthur Williams. On 16th July, the prisoner was in his service—he applied to me that day to go into the cellar for a hammer-handle—I gave him permission to go—he was gone too long, and I went down and saw him putting a paper of nails into his pocket—he had not taken any hammer-handle—he said, "I have been helping myself to a few shoe-nails, Mr. Knibb"—he went up-stairs—I asked him if he had got his hammer-handle—he said, no; he did not want it—he then went into the back shop—I went after him, and said, "Where are those nails you have got?"—he said, "You do not want to see them"—I said, "I do, and I must"—he said, "I have not got them"—I said, "What have you done with them?"—he said he had put them away—I said, "Where?"—he said he had sent them home—I said, "Go and fetch them"—he went and fetched them, and when he came back he was dreadfully agitated, and cried, and begged I would not say anything about it to Mr. Williams on account of his wife and family—I said, "I must"—he caught my arm, and begged I would not—he went to work, and I went into the shop and put the nails away—I did not tell Mr. Williams till about a week after the other circumstance.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mr. William's employ on 16th July. I recollect on that day asking the prisoner to get a hammer-handle for me—I had broken mine—he went from the back shop to the front shop—the cellar</p>

               <p>is in the front-shop—he came hack with the handle, and I then asked him to handle two more hammers—he fitted the handle to the first hammer in my presence—there was a man present, hut I do not know his name—I believe Mr. Knibb was present—he might have seen the prisoner fitting the handle—I recollect Mr. Knibb speaking to him—he was in the front shop—Mr. Knibb asked him if he was going to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> something—the prisoner called me outside, and asked me if I had any money—I said, "Yes," and he and I went over to the Bell and Anchor, and had some gin and milk—Mr. Knibb and the other shopman followed us—the 15th was my birthday; that brings it to my recollection that this was on the 16th.</p>

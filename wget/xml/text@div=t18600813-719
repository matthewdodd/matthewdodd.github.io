                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer residing at Edward-street Wool<lb></lb>wich—on the morning of 20th July I was awoke by somebody coming to my place—I went down stairs and examined the shop shutters—it was some people passing the door—I discovered that the bar had been forced and two shutters taken down—I missed four cages and a bolster, my property, belonging to a sofa-bedstead—I stopped there, leaving the shutters as they were, till a policeman came; I then put up the shutters and went with the policeman to the station—I there found the prisoners, the cages, and the bolster—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the things—I had seen them the night before, at 11 o'clock in my shop when I closed the shop.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 443). On the morning of 20th July, about half-past 2, I was on duty in Powia-street, Woolwich—I there saw the five prisoners; they were coming towards me from the shop—they had these cages with them—they all had something—I asked them where they got the cages from; they said they found them—I said, "If you found them, if you bring them to the station you will get a reward;" they declined doing so—with the assistance of another constable we endeavoured to get the cages from them; they got away from us—with the assistance of O'Leary the officer, and another constable, I got the cages—I am certain that these are the men; I had seen them three or four times that evening.</p>

               <p>officers assisted—the prisoners had the cages when I came up—they were asked to go to the station with them and they would get a reward for their trouble—they refused to do so, and with great difficulty we got the cages from them—there were altogether, I dare say, ten or twelve officers, taking these men in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Laden's Defence.</hi> We found the cages about forty yards from where we met those police-officers, and we intended to give them to the first policeman we met, and, as they were the first, we gave them to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hammond's Defence.</hi> As soon as we found those things we stood over them a minute, wondering how they got there. I said, "Well, it is quite likely somebody has been removing, and the cart has been overloaded, and these have fallen of;" so we all came to that conclusion; and we picked them up and intended to give them to the first policeman we met.</p>

            . Q. When did you lose your watch. A. On the 14th of August last; it was a very stormy day; me and my fellow <rs id="t18070408-37-viclabel213" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18070408-37-victim355 t18070408-37-viclabel213"></join> had been to Uxbridge with a chaise and four horses; it was about one o'clock when we returned; being late we could not get into our lodgings, and we being very wet went to the watering house in Cockspur-street; from there went into the stable, <placeName id="t18070408-37-crimeloc214">Nag's head yard, Whitcomb-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. What money had you. - A. Two one pound notes, a half guinea, and a seven shilling piece. I wound my silver watch up, and put it and the money in a silk handkerchief together. I left it under the bin of a four-stall stable in Nag's-head yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cover it over under this bin. - A. No further than pushing it under the bin; there were three horses in this stable that I had put in when I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock this stable door. - A. No, there was no lock to the door; I left the watch and money there a little before two o'clock; I returned to the stable about five o'clock, it was gone; I asked Cave if he had been in the stable, he said no.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you heard any thing of it. - A. Nearly two months; I saw it first at Dunstable in Bedfordshire; Cave was down there. He wrote to me he had suspicion my watch was there in the prisoner's custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before. - A. Yes;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080023"></xptr> he had been accustomed to sleep in the stables, or in the lofts in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. On this information of Cave's you went down to Dunstable. - A. Yes; I heard the watch had been to a watchmaker at Dunstable, and by the description the watchmaker gave me, I got a constable and took up the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was at Dunstable. - A. Yes. I sent Cave first to the prisoner; he came; I told him I had lost my watch and money, I told him I thought he had got it; he said he had not, but he knew who had got it, it was not far off, he would shew me where it was; he took me to the landlady of the Saracen's-head, Dunstable; it was in her possession; he asked the landlady for his watch, she gave it into his hand, and he delivered it to me; he told me it was mine, I might take it, he had bought it of a girl for fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking at it did you find it to be your property. - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. You drove with this lad on the 14th of August. - A. Yes, we returned about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his putting by his money and watch in the way he has stated. - A. Yes, he wrapped it up in a handkerchief, and put it under the bin; the next morning he came into my stable and asked me if I had been in his stable; I said no. The next morning he made it known to his master; and he laid it to my charge; my master had us all searched, and nothing was found on any body.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay with your master after that. - A. Very near two months; then I went to Dunstable. I heard the prisoner was there; I asked a friend of his if he had ever seen him with a watch; I learned the watch had been to a watchmaker's there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask that question. - A. Because a person had said he came into the country with a good watch; it struck me it might be this watch, as he had worked in the yard, and after that he had liberty from the master to sleep in the yard. I wrote to Medes, and he came down and claimed the watch</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That place where he laid his watch was public; I have lost several things there myself. I bought this watch of a girl that lived in Pye-street, Westminster.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Mr. Smith, the prosecutor, a chemist and druggist, No. 69, Coleman-street; it is his house. On 21st April, my father was not in town; he had been away from home about a month—I left the house about half-past 8 o'clock that evening; the shop was then shut up—I had been in the parlour; the front room, first floor—there was no fire in the grate when I left that room, nor any candle burning; the room is lighted by two jets of gas—before leaving the room, I screwed them down very low, but still alight—after putting on my coat and hat, I called up stairs for the servant, and receiving no answer, I rang the parlour bell; I got no answer, and again called up the stairs loudly, and getting no answer, I again rang the bell very loudly; I got no reply—I then proceeded to walk up stairs, to see why it was I got no answer—when I got to the second floor, I heard footsteps above, which I supposed to be the footstep of the prisoner—I did not see her—I called her by name, and she replied, "Yes, Sir"—I informed her that I was going to the railway, and to tell my father so if he called in my absence—there were three children in the house at the time I left it; two nieces of mine and a nephew—their names were, Alexander, about seven years of age, Ellen, about five, and Elizabeth, about two; their surname is Lapsley—I did not return until after 10 o'clock—when I left, there were no clothes scattered about the front room—there was a large chest of drawers, between the two windows in front; some of the things in those drawers belonged to me—in one drawer my father kept a number of his keys, and one of them was the key of his bed room—there was a chest on the right hand side of the door, on entering the room opposite one of the windows; it was an unusually large chest, two feet deep, and, perhaps, nearly five feet long, and two feet broad—on the Monday, I made, with my father, an examination of a bundle of linen that was produced; they were muslins and other kinds of goods; some shawl borders—partly wearing apparel, and partly what may be termed goods—some portion of them I noticed had candle grease upon them; a few drops such as would be made by the droppings from a candle—one portion seemed very like the remains of a candle; the bottom of a candle, with a portion of a wick in it—the clothes were stained; I could not form an opinion what with—we did not keep chemicals in that room—there was the remains of a burnt newspaper lying flat on the floor—I noticed the floor in front of the chest, when the bundle was removed; it was burnt in two or three different places.</p>

               <p>day after the General Fast—before I left, I locked up every place that had lock and key, in my bed room, and deposited the keys in a little drawer in my secretaire there—I then locked my bed room, and locked the key of my bed room in the upper drawer of a chest of drawers, standing in my sitting room—I locked that drawer, and put the key of it into the pocket of my portmanteau, where it still remains—the chest was full—it contained a great many pairs of blankets, from a dozen to twenty; more than one, and fewer than the other—sheets in proportion, a great number; I do not know how many—it was a very large chest—there were pillow slips, bolster slips in proportion; a very great number—counterpanes of a variety of kinds—a variety of damask table cloths and napkins, and all connected with bed and table, household linen of all kinds—the chest was full; it was locked, and the key was locked in my bed room with the other keys—I returned home on Saturday, 21st April—I think the train arrived at Euston-square precisely at half-past 8 o'clock, and I took a <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> and came direct to my house; it was, as near as possible, 9 o'clock, when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped at the door—after getting out the luggage, and paying the <hi rend="italic">cabman.</hi> I rang the bell; I rang it again, and rang three or four times; no answer was made—I then asked the next door neighbour, Mrs. Davis, to receive my luggage, and I went to a coffee house, and had a cup of coffee—I went back again between twenty minutes and half an hour, and I scarcely knew my own premises—I found a policeman at the door, who refused me admittance—he said there had been a fire in the house, and until I was identified, I was not admitted—when I was admitted, I went up stairs to the sitting room, on the first floor; I found a crowd of persons surrounding a parcel, which was lying on the floor, and which showed evidence of burning; it had been extinguished—my look at them was but slight at first; I examined them fully afterwards—I saw sufficient to show that they came from lock fast places, from my own drawers; it was my property which had been taken from lock fast places—I immediately inquired for my servant; I was told that she was next door—I ultimately found her coming back again to my house, just by the door; I pushed her in, and told the policeman not to let her escape—I told her to go up stairs with me into the sitting room, and pointing to the bundle on the floor, I desired her to explain it; she professed inability to explain it—I said she must explain it, as she knew well those things were out of the place, and I must have an explanation of how they came to be there; she still professed inability to explain it—the bundle was close to the chest—in the course of the evening, the inspector and I went over the house, and examined it—at the back of the drawers near the wall, we found a fracture—when the drawers were pulled away, the boards at the back were found to be loose; they were in such a state as would enable a person to take put the property that was in them—I saw some things found in the prisoner's bed room, in different places—the policeman brought from under the bed a sort of basket, containing a considerable portion of plate, consisting of silver sugar tongs, butter knives, fish slice, and so on; some German silver, but a number of them massive silver articles—I had left those things locked in one of my drawers, in my bed room—I should say I have lost altogether upwards of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property; a portion of it will be recoverable, but a large portion of it was consumed—the chest which I had left full, I found quite—after one of the examinations before the police, the prisoner sent for me—I went to her, and she professed to make an explanation, but told thing that we did not know before—she told me that she had pawned all the goods, which were at Grant's and Russell's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman.</hi> 28). After the prisoner was in custody I went to the second floor back bedroom—Mr. Smith pointed it out to me—I there found these two silver butter knives, a pair of silver sugar tongs, a pair of German silver gravy spoons, a fish slice, six table spoons, six dessert spoons, nine forks, a pair of German silver sugar tongs, two tea spoons, a caddy spoon, a sugar spoon, and a salt spoon—I have compared one of the butter knives with the one found in the grate, and it is the fellow to it, the same size and the same make—I also found seven pairs of new stockings, a petticoat, a gown piece, a hair brush, an enema pump, in a mahogany case, in a cupboard, in the bedroom, and a hamper, full of shawl borders—they were claimed by Mr. Smith.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, in the employ of Mr. South. A week after the fire I missed a bottle from the warehouse—I have seen the clothes with the stains on them—I could not tell at the time they were shown to me what they consisted of; the smell was somewhat familiar to me, but I could not pronounce upon it—I have formed an opinion, now that they were produced by the contents of the bottle missed which is a spirituous solution of gingerine—the taste and the smell prove it—it was sixty over proof, very inflammable—I have here a piece of a bottle that was said to be found in the room—it appears to be the bottom of the bottle I missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at No. 28, Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell. On friday, the 27th of January, I was coming down that street, about a quarter before eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner standing close to the window of Mr. Watkins's shop—as I passed the window I beard a crash of glass—I immediately looked round and saw his hand in the window—I am quite sure I saw his hand within the window—he ran away—I ran after him, and collared him—he said he had only broken the window—he knocked off my hat—I let him go, but did not leave him—I took him back to Mr. Watkins—he walked back with me, as a mob had assembled he could not get away—a policeman was sent for, and he came—a person spoke to the prisoner as I was leading him back to Mr. Watkins's, but I could not tell what the person said to him.</p>

I have a shop there for he sale of watches and jewellery—I lost a silver watch, a seal, and a chain. Which I had put in front of the second pane of glass in the left hand window, on the Tuesday previous to the robbery—I left London</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father. On Friday night the 27th of January, a little before eight o'clock, I was in the parlour, and heard a dreadful crash—I immediately ran out and found the shop window broken—I missed the watch, chain, and seal, which I had seen there about six o'clock that evening—the window-pane was very much broken—it was quite sound at six o'clock—the prisoner was brought to the shop in five or ten minutes—he could reach the watch, it was close to the glass.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 106.) I live in Rosoman-street, Clerkenwell. On the 27th of January, in the evening, I was called to Mr. Watkins's shop, and took the prisoner into custody—there was about two hundred people about the door—the prisoner was in the shop—I saw no disturbance on his part.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been drinking in the afternoon with a friend, in fact I had not been near Mr. Watkins's shop that evening—I was stand<lb></lb>ing leaning against a post at the corner of Bury-street, very sick. I saw the witness and other men running down Hooper-street, calling "Stop thief"—I, being in liquor, made way for them to go by—they went up a street, the name of which I don't know, and turned the corner—I walked to the bottom of Bury-street, and was standing by a baker's shop when Hell collared me—I did not say I had broken a window, he said, "you have broken a window;"I said, "I have not broken any window, let me go"—probably his hat fell off, I dare say it did—a crowed collected, some said, "Let the man go;" others said, "If you have not broken a window, go with him;" and I did go with him to Mr. Watkins's shop, and when in the shop feeling sick again, I went to the door not to go out, but not wishing to make a <hi rend="italic">mess</hi> on the mat, but two men seized me by the collar and pulled me back—I called for no rescue, for I had not a person near the place whom I knew—I did call Murdei—he people said "What is the matter?"I said "They are ill using me, force the door open"—I went to the station-house—after the witness let go of my collar, I walked with him by myself voluntarily I could have gone away if I had chosen—when I went in I said to Miss. Watkins, "Did you see me break the window?" She said, "No, I cer<lb></lb>tainly did not." I particularly requested the policeman to look at my hands, for if they had been inside a broken window they must have been cut—I was not within sixty yards of the shop at any time—come which way I could I could not be within sixty yards of the shop, and if I had been at the window, and the witness where he says he was, instead of my escaping from him, I must have run into his arras—there was no pos<lb></lb>sibility of going any other way—I can only say, really I am not the</p>

               <p>person—it had been raining, and was a very dark night—he says in his deposition he never lost sight of me—if it had been me, and taking three turnings he could not be off losing sight of me—at the baker's shop a man came running past me, before Bell came up, and ran through a passage, but I did not offer to stop him, being in liquor—the policeman searched me—Miss. Watkins owns it was not above four or five minutes from the I time the window was broken and my being brought back, and the round the witness went could not be accomplished in that time—if I had run from Mr. Watkins's shop window down Sutton-street into Allen-street again, it is half a mile round, and I could not have done that in four minutes—he must be mistaken in me.</p>

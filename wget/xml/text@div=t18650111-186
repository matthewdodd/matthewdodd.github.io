                  </hi>. I am sub-warder at the House of Correction, Coldbath<lb></lb>fields—the prisoner is undergoing a term of imprisonment there—on the 20th of December I saw him in his cell—I spoke to him about his books being wrongly placed on the shelf—the Lord's Book was on the top, and it should have been at the bottom—he called me a s—d, and said I was always making complaints—on the following day I went to his cell between 9 and 10 o'clock—I went to take his stool away, as I wanted to sit down, having a sick headache—the stool was not required by the prisoner—when in the act of stooping I received a violent blow on the chin—I rose, and saw the prisoner with a knife in his hand—I said, "Oh, man, what are you doing?" he did not speak—I cannot say whether he struck me more than once—after<lb></lb>wards I found two wounds on my face—I ran to another prisoner and told him to shut the cell door—persons came to my assistance, and I was taken to the infirmary—I cannot swear that this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that the prisoner used; it was one similar to that—it was a shoemaker's knife.</p>

On 21st December I was a prisoner in the House of Correction—I was employed under Kempt in cleaning out the cells—I saw Kempt come out of the prisoners cell—I went to the prisoner and said, "you foolish fellow, what have you done?"—I saw Kempt with his face bleeding—he told me to shut the prisoner's door—I gave an alarm, and called, "Officers, be quick, please"—when I went to the prisoner he said, "If the b----r comes in this place again I will tell him what for, and do it as well"—in his right hand he held a large knife, and in his left he held a shoe—the knife was like the one produced.</p>

I informed Furzman, the officer about this, and he took me to Plank. In consequence of what passed, I met him in Rupert-street, on the following Tuesday; I had seen him on Monday, and he agreed to bring me two sovereigns, which I was to buy of him. I received 9 s. from Plank before I went to the house; he asked if I had the money for the two sovereigns; I said I had money for one, but could not take two; he said, "You first said you wanted two, and now only one; I must go out for some little time, and will return and let you have it." He returned in two minutes, and gave it me, I gave him 9 s., as he said he could not sell a single one for less; I said the sovereign was wet, he said Yes; in consequence of my not taking the two, he thought I was going to play him a trick, and he had planted the other outside, in the water spout but now his suspicions were at rest; he asked when I should want more, and told me to advise the person to take more at a time, as it would be very advantageous; I said, I should want three on the following night, and agreed to meet him there for them. I gave the sovereign to Plank, and got 24 s. from him; and on Wednesday evening I met him there. He said, as I did not before take what I wanted, he had only got one; I said, I could not take one, as the person expected three; he said it was of little consequence, as I could meet him next morning and have the two, and wished me to pay for the three, as he had some money to make up by the morning, as he had to meet a party with some at nine o'clock, or forfeit 6 s., if he had not got them. After some conversation, I gave him 24 s. for the three, and took one, which I gave Plank. I went next morning, found he had been there; I met him in two minutes in Jeremy-street, he said he had been to the party, but something had happened in the country, they had not arrived, and he should have them in the evening. I met him in the evening in Rupert-street, he produced five, but said he was going into the country, and could only let me have one. I said in a day or two I would take half a score; he said I could have them on Saturday, and if I enquired at the house in the morning, I should hear if he had left town; I took the one, and was to have the other, with the half score, and was to give him 7 s. each. I went on Saturday, and waited him in; he asked if I wanted the quantity that I said; I said Yes; and he told me to meet him in half an hour; I went out and saw Plank at a house in King-street, and got four crowns, three half-crowns, and seven shilling and a sixpence in marked money from him, and another sixpence, unmarked, to spend. Jefferies and Furzman were there, they followed me to Rupert-street, the prisoner was not there, he came in a few minutes, and asked if I had got the money; I said Yes; he said he was very sorry, but he only had three; I said I must have the quantity I stated, he said, as I had the money, if I waited half an hour, he would return, he left, returned, and said, "Well, I have them for you;" I said, in consequence of his delay, I had been to the person who would only take five; he said, then he could not let me have them for less than 7 s. 6 d. each; I said I only had the money for five, at 7 s. each, and could only give that; he said it was of no consequence whether I had them or not; I said I could not pay 7 s. 6 d. without seeing the person; he said I could not have them at all till he had gone out for half an hour; we both left, I went to Plank, at the end of the street, and got half-a-crown from him; I met the prisoner at the house, he took me into the yard, and asked if I had all the money right for the five. I gave him 1 l. 17 s. and he gave me five sovereigns. (I had no money but what Plank gave me.) He had four more in his hand; I said I expected to have five, and the one I had paid for before, at six o'clock, that evening, to compleat the half score. I paid for some porter with the sixpence, and parted with him at the door, after drinking some beer, for which he paid 1 s.; the moment I got out, Jefferies took me into a printing-office and took the five sovereigns from me.</p>

            , of Bond-street, and left him three years and a half ago. I have served other people since, and have kept a furnished house at Lambeth, which I laid out 300 l. upon. I am a married man. The house in Bedfordbury is the Rising Sun, public-house, kept by Mr. Ingram. I now sleep at my mother's, my wife lives in Lisle-street. I called at the prisoner's house once before he was taken, and once since. I had met the prisoner a week before, he talked about the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050055"></xptr>sovereigns. He said he planted both the sovereigns in the water-spout. I had seen Furzeman about five years ago, but never spoke to him afterwards till I accidentally met him and stated the case to him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way do you get your living now - A. I have property in pledge which I am living on, and my wife has 35 l. a year and her business.</p>

            . I am officer, of Marlborough-street. Furzeman brought the last witness to me, the Mint directed me to do the best to detect the dealer; and on the 6th of November, in the afternoon, Jefferies was with me, I gave Findley 9 s., to buy a sovereign. I watched him into the Crown and Punch Bowl, public-house, Rupert-street, he came out in a few minutes with the prisoner, they remained a short time in conversation, and then separated. I followed him into Pultney-street, and he gave one a sovereign, which I produce. I saw him next day, at the Marlborough Head, public-house, and gave him 24 s., followed him to the same house, and saw him come out in company with the prisoner; it was then dusk, I saw Findley give him some silver, and heard the prisoner say,"You shall have them in the morning." Findlay said something, and the prisoner said, "I shall loose 6 s., by them." Findlay said, "Then you will let me have them in the afternoon." He said, "Yes, about ten o'clock;" and they parted. Before that, when they first came to the door, the prisoner went away, and I followed him to a house, in Bedfordbury, I went back to Rupert-street, he returned to the Crown and Punch Bowl, public-house; they then came out together, and I heard the conversation I have stated. I followed Findley, and joined him, he delivered me another sovereign. The next day, I saw Findley again, and followed him to the house, in Rupert-street. I saw them come to the door, they parted, Findley gave me another sovereign. On the 10th of September, Furzeman and Jefferys were with me, at a public-house, in King-street, Golden-square; we searched Findley, to see that he had no money, and I gave him four crowns, three half-crowns, seven shillings, and a sixpence, all of which I had marked - I gave him an unmarked sixpence to spend. I saw him go into the Crown and Punch Bowl, public-house, the prisoner went in soon after, and came out in a very short time, I watched him into Coventry-street, and there saw a man speak to him, who was waiting with a bag under his arm; they stepped up by a door, and the man delivered something to the prisoner; they parted, the prisoner went along Coventry-street, he returned in half an hour, and went into the Crown and Punch Bowl, public-house, they remained there half an hour, they then came out and parted. I took the prisoner about twenty yards off, his right hand was in his breeches pocket, I had great difficulty to get it out. I found a sixpence in his left hand, unmarked. I searched him at the office, and in his right hand breeches pocket I found four crowns, marked; four half-crowns, three marked; six shillings, and a sixpence, marked; it was the money I gave Findley, one shilling was wanting. Furzeman took four sovereigns from his left hand pocket. I went to the Crown and Punch Bowl, public-house, the landlady gave me a shilling, which was one I had given Findley. The prisoner said he lived in Bury-street, with his mother, and attended on gentlemen, who lodged there, and got the silver from them, and the gold he had had some time. He said he had been at the Crown and Punch Bowl, public-house, with Findley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went to his mother - A. Yes; he did live there, his friends are respectable. I lost sight of him when he came out on Saturday, there is a court opposite the house. The house in Bedfordbury is a most desperate place.</p>

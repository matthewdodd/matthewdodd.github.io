                  </hi>. I am a tailor, in Brick-lane, Old-street. The prisoner came to ray shop on 7th Jan., between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—another man came in shortly afterwards; he appeared to be waiting—the prisoners asked for a pair of trowsers; I produced some; they both looked at them, and selected a pair, which came to 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Cullum paid me for them with a good Victoria sovereign; I examined it, and rang it on the counter; I am a pretty good judge of coin—I satisfied myself that it was good, and put it into my till—there was but one other sovereign there, which was an old George and Dragon sovereign—I was counting out the change, and Davis said, "I think I can save your changing;" and he was pulling some shillings out of his pocket, a shilling at a time—I took the sovereign out again—I am perfectly certain that it was the same that I took from the</p>

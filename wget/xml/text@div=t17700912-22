I went out on Sunday the 26th of August, about five in the afternoon, and left only the prisoners in my house. I returned again about a quarter before eight, and found my servant was gone out. I waited about half an hour in the square. When the prisoner came to the door, I took the key from her to let myself in, and found the lock was only catched. After I had been at home some little time, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; then I sent for several men as witnesses, and examined the house. There were no signs of any person having got in over the garden-wall; and the stairs, which were fresh cleaned, had not the marks of a foot upon them. When we came to the garret, we found two-chairs that had stood in the maid's room standing in the passage, under the trap-door, which was wide open, with two of the maid's boxes upon them. Two or three men went out at the trap-door, and there were no signs of any person's having been out there. I then accused the prisoner, who all along denied it. I have never seen any of the things since.</p>

On the 16th of December, about twelve o'clock at night, I was called out to protect the property at a fire in Wapping, I had my watch, chain, and seals about me, they are worth 9l., I looked at my watch once or twice, I was there about two hours, I was standing at the corner of the street, and felt my watch drawn from my fob, I made a snatch at the hand that was taking it, and caught the prisoner by the sleeve, I did not see the watch in his hand, I accused him of it, and he made no reply, I heard it rattle on the ground, it fell at his feet, I picked it up, I laid hold of him by the collar, he resisted, I struck him on the head and he called out to his companions, saying,</p>
               <p>"Will you let me be taken in this way?" one of them said to me, let him go, it was not him; I knew that man to be a bad character. I took the prisoner with much difficulty and gave him to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. My attention was directed to the fire, I had about twenty-five round me, my back was against the wall; I did not observe the prisoner till I took hold of his hand, the watch fell immediately I took hold of his arms, it fell at his feet; he stood next to me.</p>
               <p>Court. From the position in which the arm was when you seized it, could there be any other arm to convey away the property, but the one you seized - A. I have not the least doubt of it, the hand was directly before my fob.</p>
               <p>GEORGE OLNEY. I am a patrol. I took the prisoner in charge; he denied the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman took hold of a sailor, and he got away; the gentleman then took hold of my arm and gave me into custody.</p>
               <p>PAULIN. I did not take any body but the prisoner.</p>

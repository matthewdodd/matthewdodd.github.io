            . I am a patrol. I met the prisoner, Campion's, cart, with three men in it, about half-past seven o'clock, on the 20th of March, they were going towards Bedfont. In about three minutes after I met Goring, went back with him, and found the cart opposite the public-house - the prisoners were then in the cart; the third man was gone, and the butter stood by the cart wheel. I asked where the third man was? a by-stander said he had ran up the road. I pursued, but did not catch a sight of him. The prisoners did not attempt to escape - they said the butter belonged to another man.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 23rd of November I was in the Coal-yard, Drury-lane, about half-past six o'clock in the evening; I met the prisoner with a bundle under his arm - I asked what he had there; he said some things he had taken out of pawn - I looked, and found they were wet, and said they would not take them in in that state: he said Yes they did, and he would take me to the house - I said I would go; in going along he said he got them from his mother, in Short's-gardens; I took him to the watch-house and went there, but found no such person - I went to him again, he burst into tears, and told me where he got them.</p>

            . Two nights before Mrs. Vain's shop was broke open, I was with the prisoner to break her shop open, but the watchman coming it hindred us then; so we went home to bed. On Friday after I parted from him, and he went and broke it open by himself. He called me up between 6 and 7 the 1st of June, to go and sell the things. There were two pair of shoes and pair of pumps, and three pair of women's shoes a box-iron and heaters, and a pair of child's stockings. We went and sold the things to an old cloaths man at the end of Hatton-Garden, only the pumps, which we pawned for a shilling.</p>

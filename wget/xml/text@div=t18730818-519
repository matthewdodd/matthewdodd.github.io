I went first to Marsha house on the 19th—every assistance was given to me—I went down in the cellar then—it was 10 or 11 o'clock at night, so I should think the plank of the flap was in then—I had candles—on the first occasion I believe the place was dry, and on the second there was some water there, it was between 7 and 8 in the morning when I went the second time, on the first July—Mr. Marsh offered to open the movable plank from the flap—he removed the gimlet and took out the plank; that threw down a ray of light on the ground below—I know that the flap is open all day long, as a rule—I asked for a shovel, and we turned the place over, and I found the things in a sort of indentation that was caused by the barrels being let down.</p>

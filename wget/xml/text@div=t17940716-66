               <p>I was robbed the 6th of July, I lost thirty-nine guineas, two half guineas, and a half jole, worth about thirty-five shillings, and a small bag the money was in. I was coming down <placeName id="t17940716-66-crimeloc326">Holborn</placeName>

I told them on board; they asked me if I would stay with them? I told them if they would let me go to bed I would. I had my money in my right hand waistcoat pocket; I am a seaman; I had been drinking a little, but I was not drunk; I know the person again, it was between eleven and twelve o'clock, I went to a place they call Black Boy-alley, to Mr. Clarke's house, a private house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the two women go along with you? - Yes, both women.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with any others by the way? - No, nobody. When I got to Mr. Clarke's, they shewed me a bed; I laid down, and both women laid down along side of me; I never pulled my clothes off, I fell asleep directly, and never waked till four o'clock in the morning, and they were both gone; I came out of doors, I did not know where to go, I had not a farthing in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your money? - Directly as I awoke.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last felt your money, before you went with these two women? - About three quarters of an hour before that, when I stopped to buy some fruit.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160113"></xptr>Q. Where had you come from? - From Baldwin's-lane, Gray's Inn-lane, and I was going on board at Iron Gate.</p>

            What had you been doing at Gray's Inn lane? - I was acquainted with a young man there, and I changed half a guinea, in Baldwin's-court, to buy the children some fruit; this was about three quarters of an hour before I met these women.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after you lost your money? - There was a man at the door, and he told me it was a very bad house; how came I to go there? and he took me to a constable; and I did not find any of them that day; I staid from going on board all that day, to look for them; in about a week after the constable found the prisoner; I never saw any money again, not the six and thirty shilling piece. I am quite sure the prisoner was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You see nothing of the other woman? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. A man in sailor's clothes came to me, on Monday morning, and said, that he had been robbed by two women, of about forty guineas and half a jole; I asked him if he knew who it was? he said it was down in Black Boy-alley; says I, do you think you should know the people again? he said, he was sure he should know them both; says I, was you drunk? he said, he had been drinking a little; I asked him if he knew he had the money when he laid down with them? he said he felt it when he laid down. I searched about with him the whole day, but did not find either of them that day, but last Sunday I took the prisoner in the Eagle and Child-alley.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the man in my life before, till that gentleman came and took me out of my room, any more than any strange gentleman that is in this place.</p>

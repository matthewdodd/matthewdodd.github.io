               <p>Had he a cutlass? - There was not one found upon him when he was searched; when he said he would cut my head off I loosed the other to get him under me; upon that the other ran away, and the prisoner got from me just into the ditch; I jumped after him and secured him; the other lost his hat and got clear off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single and seventeen years of age—I am now stopping at a reformatory in the Euston Road—on 12th November last I was living at Charlton in Dover, and was getting my living there as an unfortunate girl—the prisoner lived with me in the same lodging—I was with her on Monday night, 12th November, at about 10.30, and met the deceased man in Snargate Street; he came into a public-house where we were—I don't know the name of the house—we left the public-house near eleven, I think, all three together—he was a stranger to me—he had had a little to drink, I mean he was a little tipsy; he was able to walk and to talk properly—we went to what is called the Pent side by the dock; on our way there we met two policemen—there are houses on one side and the flock is on the other side of the road—a quantity of timber is stacked there, brought by the ships—the prisoner and the deceased went into the timber—the deceased was wear<lb></lb>ing his hat and coat at that time—I did not hear anything pass between them as to what they went there, for—it was then about 10.4.5, I should think—I could not see them when they went to the timber—while they were away the prisoner's sister joined me—the prisoner afterwards re<lb></lb>turned to me—I had been waiting there for about a quarter of an hour I should think—she returned alone and joined me and her sister alongside the pavement on the other side of the road—before she returned 1 had heard cries for help, I should think about a minute before she returned—the cries appeared to come from the water—when the prisoner returned I asked her where the man was—she said "He is just a coming"—I heard the cries a second time—she. said "There is some one cry<lb></lb>ing for help," and she thought it was the man she had been with—she said nothing further about him at that time—Mr. Mole then came up—I</p>

               <p>still heard cries for help from the water "For God's sake, is there no one here"—I saw some persons go across from the public-house to the timbers, at the water's edge—I followed, with the prisoner and her sister, and stood on the quay watching; the prisoner pointed and said, "That is where the man went in"—that was by the timber—a light was brought and the people searched about—I saw a coat and hat taken from the water—a sailor jumped in and swam about to render assistance—I can't say how long we remained at the water's edge—after that we went up Snargate Street, we three together—I afterwards went home with the prisoner and slept with her that night—we talked about what had occurred and she told me she had pushed the man over because he did not give her enough money—she said he had had a little to drink—she said she thought his coat came off in the water—next day I went with her to the dead-house—before we went she told me to say that it was not the man—she said we had better all say that it is not the man, or else she would get into trouble—she said he had a longer beard than that, and he was taller—she said that before we went to the dead-house, and after—I saw the body at the dead-house; it was the body of the man I had seen the previous night.</p>

She said the man had had a little to drink; these were the words—I think I said before the Magistrate that she said the man was tipsy—he could walk tolerably straight, not <hi rend="italic">zigzag</hi> or crooked—I could see by his walk that he was a little tipsy.</p>

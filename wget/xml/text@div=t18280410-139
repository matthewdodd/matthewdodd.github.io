On the 12th of March I sent for an officer, about seven o'clock in the evening - the prisoner was called up stairs, and I charged her in his presence with taking a watch-case, a night-cap and a pair of trousers; she said, she knew nothing of either of them - she denied knowing anything about them three or four times; we asked her about them separately, and she denied them all; we said it would be necessary to see what was in her box - she said she had no objection, and we went down for that purpose; in going down she said she believed there was an old pair of trousers in the box - we found this new pair of trousers, and this watch-case in the box; the other articles have not been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you not removed just before? A. Yes; I had given the prisoner directions to pack up the things; I know these trousers had been in my drawers some weeks before, but I do not know where they were the day we were packing up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner ask you whether she should begin to pack up any of the things, and you said Yes? A. She never asked me that question to my knowledge; I cannot swear whether she did or not - she might have done so; we removed on the 29th of February, and on the 12th of March she was taken up - we packed up the day before we removed; I cannot say the prisoner packed up any of the things; I desired her to bring me the things, and I packed them up myself - I did not direct her to pack up anything except the breakfast things; I never ordered her to pack the things that were in the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell her to pack up all the things she saw, and then the things in the desk? A. I cannot tell - I had mentioned to her about these things four or five days before she was taken up; I cannot say that I was present when my wife said anything to her about the watch-case, but there were five or six conversations about it; we did not exactly tax her about it - my wife said, "Mary, I don't think I have lost my watch-case."</p>
               <p>Q. And did not the prisoner say, "We had better look for it - I am very uneasy, let us look in the boxes"? A. I will swear she did not say that in my presence, nor did my wife reply, that it was no use to look, it was too far gone to be recalled; the prisoner did not go the same night and look in a chest belonging to my wife, and find several of her own things, to my knowledge - I went to Mr. Craddock on the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your wife say that Mr. Craddock had persuaded you to go to the Cannon public-house, and find the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100080"></xptr>man who had moved the goods? A. No; the prisoner was apprehended on the Wednesday following - I did not go after the man who moved the goods, because he was not near the premises when anything could be taken away - he is not here; she did say, "I thought I had put an old pair of trousers into my box out of the cupboard," but that was after she had denied it - she said she put them in in a mistake; I went to the house I removed from on the Sunday morning, because I did not wish to cast a stigma on any one.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you swear you had seen these trousers after having removed? A. No, nor for some weeks before.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard the prisoner charged with taking these articles; I asked her if she knew anything at all about them - she said, No; her master said, "Have you any objection to have your box searched" - she said, "Not the least;" in going down stairs she said she believed there was an old pair of trousers in the box, which she had put in in moving - these trousers and this watch-case were found in the box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was not the box very full? A. Yes - she told me many of her things were mixed with some articles of her master's; I do not know whether two gowns of hers were found - I did not find two old dusters in her box.</p>
               <p>MRS. WHINFIELD. I am the prosecutor's wife. I had some conversation with the prisoner some days before the officers came; she did not say she had an objection to my searching her box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did she not say, "I am very uneasy, Ma'am - let us look into the boxes and drawers?" A. Yes, and we searched together in my boxes and drawers; she did not refuse for me to look into her box - I did not ask her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say in the presence of your husband, that it was no use to look, you thought it too far gone to be recalled? A. I believe I might; there was an apron or two of hers found in a chest of mine - we packed the things rather in a hurry the day before.</p>

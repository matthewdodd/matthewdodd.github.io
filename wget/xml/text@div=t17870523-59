               <p>Mr. Sheridan prisoner's Counsel. I do not find you feel the ties of nature very strong, but I hope you will feel those of truth; how often have you caused your brother to be arrested? - Never but this once.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, you never had him arrested but once? - Never.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you or did you not make a bill of sale for all this furniture? - I acknowledge I made a bill of sale, but he never had a bill of sale before in his hands.</p>

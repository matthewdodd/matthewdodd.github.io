On the 23rd of January I was opposite his door, and saw a lad bring a pot of honey out, and give it to the prisoner; I suspected it was stolen, and pursued the prisoner - he put down the pot about twenty yards from the shop, and then ran; I pursued, and took him back to the shop - the boy with the honey got away; the prisoner said he was not the person, I was mistaken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What hour was this? A. About half-past eight o'clock in the evening; I had not known him before - he was searched, but I believe nothing was found on him; I have not inquired about his friends - I believe they are respectable.</p>

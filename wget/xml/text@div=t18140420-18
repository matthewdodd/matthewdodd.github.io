             is the tenant of the house. I locked my room door on the outside; there is a door inside of this woman's room that goes into mine; that was unbolted. The prisoner lodged in the room adjoining to my room, the front room.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a door goes from one of these rooms into the other - A. Yes, there is no lock to that door; there is a bolt; I left it unbolted. I returned home about eight o'clock in the evening; I did not find it out until the next morning that it was broken open; I saw it out further than it ought to be I thought; I went to put it in. I did not observe the box the night before, when I went to bed; I left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200013"></xptr>the box locked. The next morning the lock was broken open, and the side of box was broken in; I had all my own clothes in the said box, and twenty-three pounds in bank notes. I lifted up the box lid; every thing was gone out of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lodged there - A. About thirteen weeks. She was there in the morning when I went out. On my return she was gone. We found the prisoner on last Thursday week. I have seen some of the property since; the officer has them here. My husband was present when some little trifling things were found in her lodging.</p>

            ; I live at No. 10, in the court the other witness has spoken of. My husband let out part of the house in lodgings; he himself being the occupier of the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand the prisoner lodged in one of your rooms, and Mrs. Mason and her husband lodged in the other adjoining - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you occasionally employ the prisoner - A. I had engaged her to work for me half a day the day she committed the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q. In what kind of work - A. Washing of clothes. She told me that she could not come for the whole afternoon, she was going out for needle work, she would come part of the afternoon. She came to me at two o'clock; she left me at three o'clock, and stopped away until about five o'clock. She came back; she did no more work for me. She told me she was going for needle work; I did not hear her go out. About half past five her husband came home for his tea, and when he was at tea I went up for a pair of shoes; it might be half past seven. When the husband came home he asked me whether his wife was at work for me; I said, no. I saw no more of her until she was taken on the 7th of February. She owes me a month's lodging now.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 7th of February, in the Strand, about half past ten o'clock at night; I took her to St. Ann's watchhouse; she then told me that she lived at No. 5, Union-street, Chandois-street. I went there on the same evening, and there I found several little articles. I left her in the watchhouse. I was with Mrs. Saunders when I met her in the Strand. The prisoner went by the name of Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Saunders. What name did the prisoner go by in your house - A. Evans.</p>
               <p>Jeffries. A person of the name of Brown keeps the house in Union-street; a great many females lived in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who shewed you the house in Union-street - A. A girl of the name of Silvester; it was a garret, a bed room. There I found this tin case, a Prayer book, and a looking-glass; it is not mentioned in the indictment. The next day at the watchhouse she confessed that she had pawned the articles. She went with me on the Saturday morning to Mr. Alder's in Berwick-street; she said, she had pawned them, and they were there; she had destroyed the duplicates. At Mr. Alder's I found these four gowns, three petticoats, and a shawl. The prisoner said the two shifts were the articles that she had pledged at Mr. Latham's.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Look at these things the officer has produced, what may be the value of these things - A. I think three pounds. I have examined them; they are my own. As to the bank notes, she told me she had spent them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told Mrs. Mason I knew nothing of the money.</p>

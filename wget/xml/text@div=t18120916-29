On the 25th of July, a little past nine in the evening, the prisoner and another soldier came into my shop; the other soldier I served with a quarter of a pound of cheese at the counter, the prisoner stood on the door-sill; they went away. In a few minutes after the prisoner was brought back by a man, and the man charged him with stealing bacon out of my shop window; the prisoner said he was very sorry for it. The bacon was brought back in about five minutes after the prisoner. The prisoner was there when the bacon was brought back.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Cutling, a cheesemonger at Bow. I was coming by Mr. Anderson's house a little after nine at night, I saw two soldiers standing at the window. I saw one open the door and go in; as soon as he was got to the counter the other ran in and took hold of a small piece of bacon, put it into his cap and put it upon his head; in the course of two or three minutes he took up another piece, and put it under his arm and marched out of doors with it; when he got out of the shop he walked away, I pursued him and took him an hundred yards off from where he stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever out of your sight - A. No further than while I called for the constable, that might be about two minutes I then found him standing still in the same place where I left him; his comrade was not with him</p>
               <p>Q.Had he the bacon with him at that time or not - A. No, he had dropped it. I saw the bacon afterwards, it was on the ground, about two yards behind him. I told a young lad to give it me up. I took the prisoner back to Mr. Anderson's, and the boy followed with the bacon. I told the constable to take his cap off; he took it off himself, and the bacon fell out of his cap on the ground; the constable took charge of the bacon; his name is Starke. The prisoner was very much in liquor.</p>

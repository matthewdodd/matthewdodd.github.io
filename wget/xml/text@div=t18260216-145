               <p>MISS MARY PULLEN. I live with my father, at Cannonbury; I had occasion to come to town on Wednesday evening, the 11th of January, and came in a hackney coach, which came up to our door about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening; I cannot tell who drove the coach, nor the number - I brought some property to town in a small brown hair trunk, which was not locked - there was a little black case in it, which contained a pair of pearl ear-rings, a pearl brooch, and two necklaces of mine, and a pair of pearl<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160070"></xptr>>ear-rings, belonging to my sister, Anne Sophia Pullen; I had put the property into the trunk, which I packed up, and delivered to a female servant attending us, to put into the coach - I did not see her put it in, nor did I see it in the coach; I got to my father's house, in Fore-street, City, about seven o'clock, but did not miss the trunk till the following morning; I saw the property again on the Tuesday after I came to town - I made some inquiries about the trunk, and it was brought to me by my servant about nine days after - but when I opened it, the little black case was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. The box was not locked - and you have no recollection of the coach or the coachman? A. No, not at all.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Pullen; his town house is in Fore-street. I remember Miss Pullen coming home on Wednesday, the 11th of January, and some inquiries being made about the trunk the next morning, it was not to be found; Hughes, the coachman, came to our house on Friday, the 20th of January, before eight o'clock. I had before that seen an advertisement about these ear-rings; I opened the door to the prisoner; he said he had brought the trunk which had been left nine days in his coach; I said, "I will call my master;" he said, "I cannot stay, but I will call again to see that the articles are all right;" - he went away, leaving the trunk, and never called again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has not Mr. Pullen other servants? A. One more, but I always open the door - and I can say, the person who brought the trunk, did not call again; he called on the Friday - the advertisement was in the paper on the Tuesday before; we had the number of the coach from the man servant - I had seen the trunk about three o'clock, when it was packed up to come to town, by Miss Pullen; I did not see it put into the coach.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Reeves, pawnbroker, of Snow-hill. On the 13th of January, the prisoner Watson, came to our shop, and brought two pair of earrings, a brooch, and two necklaces; the ear-rings and brooch were pearl - and I asked if he wanted to sell them; he said, he did not particularly want to sell them, but what would I give for them; I offered him 5s., to ascertain if he knew what they were; he said, "You shall have them for 7s." I then questioned him as to where he got them - he said he had picked them up the night before in Blackfriars Road - I told him I should stop the ear-rings, as they were real pearl, and advertise them, and if there was a reward offered for them, he should have it - he said it was perfectly right - that he had picked them up the night before; I asked his direction, and he said his name was Thomas Watts, or Watson, No. 40, Thames-street, and said he would call again in two or three days; this was on Friday - they were advertised the following Tuesday, in the Times newspaper of the 17th of January; on the following Saturday, he came and asked if I had heard any thing about the ear-rings - I asked him to come inside the counter, which he did, and I told him if he would wait a minute, I would speak to him; I went to the further end of the shop, when he lifted up the flap of the counter, and ran out - I ran after him into Seacoal-lane, about two hundred yards - he ran as hard as he could - our apprentice, who was on first, caught him - I then came up, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WATSON. I did not exactly run, I was walking very fast. Witness. He ran, and I pursued him for two hundred yards - our apprentice can prove he ran.</p>

In consequence of hearing of this loss, and seeing the advertisement in the Times newspaper, I accompanied my daughter to Mr. Reeves, and she identified the box and property; an inquiry was set on foot for the coachman; on the day before the trunk was delivered at my house, I sent two or three different people to inquire, and heard that the trunk was delivered at my house - the coachman said before the Magistrate, that he drove the coach and received the money.</p>

            . I am a Marshalsman. When Watson was brought to Guildhall, on the 24th of January, he was remanded; Mr. Pullen gave me the number of the coach to find where the master lived, and to get the man if I could. The prisoner, Hughes, was out with the coach No. 154, but I took him about half past one or two o'clock on Tuesday morning; I went and searched his lodgings; he stated, without being asked, that he was the coachman - that he had brought the Miss Pullens from Highbury, and had had the trunk, which he had taken home himself to Fore-street. He said he had kept it, I thought he said five days, but I understood afterwards, it was nine days; that he had kept it in his lodgings, in a court just by Worship-street Office, but he knew nothing about the jewels - the next day he came before the Magistrate, and was committed.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>HUGHES' Defence. The servant said wrong about my keeping the trunk nine days in my coach; I took the box out that night, when I found it under the seat, close by the nose bags, in some straw; I gave it to my landlady to take care of till I took it home; she took it to my bed-room -Thomas White lodged and slept in the same bed; he asked me whether I had looked into this box; I said no, I did not mean to look into it, I should take it home; but I was very busy; I used to go out soon in the morning, and was out late at night, and my master was ill; but one morning I had my horses shod, and took it home, and delivered it to that young woman - I told her I had found the box in my coach, and had taken care of it, as I had not an opportunity of bringing it - she said, "I do not like to take it in, you had better wait;" I said, I could not wait, but I would call again - I had not an opportunity for two or three days, and then Mr. Harrison took me.</p>
               <p>WATSON'S Defence. I was at Mr. Dixon's Repository, in Barbican, and met a young man named Thomas White; he said he was working in the Curtain Road; he told me he had found a little trinket case between Rowland Hill's Chapel, and Blackfriar's Road - I questioned him if he got them honestly, and he declared that he had; he asked me to go with him to ascertain the worth of them - I took it for granted he had got them honestly, as I had known him for eighteen months; he wished me to go to a Jew's, and I said that is a wrong place; we were going by Mr. Reeves', and I went in there; I told him they were picked up in Blackfriars Road, and wished to ascertain the value; he said they were only mock, and he would give me 6s. for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160071"></xptr>>them; I said I would have 7s.; and then I said, would he give me 6s. - he then went into the parlour, came out, and said he had been mistaken, they were pearl; I said, I would call again, and then I was taken ill, and was blooded; but I called again on the Saturday, and asked if he had found an owner - he said he had, but he did not know whether he was the right owner; he then went to the back of the shop, and I certainly was rather flurried, and did make an attempt to go away, but not because I was guilty.</p>

               <p>COURT to MISS PULLEN. Q. What was the value of the jewelery that you and your sister lost? A. I do not know; the other part of the property is of very little value indeed.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you bring any body forward to shew it was put into the coach? A. I never saw it put in.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How many servants have you? A. Two female servants; the young man who knew the number of the coach, lives in London.</p>

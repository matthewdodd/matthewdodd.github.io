On Sunday, the 5th of December, about one o'clock in the afternoon, I went down to the Fourteen Acre field, and found a very valuable ram had been killed; the skin and three feet were cut off, and left, but the carcase was gone. I traced the footsteps of two men over the hedge and up to Elstree, to a cottage in which Clark lived - Cartwright lived farther down the village. Next morning I got a warrant to search Clark's house first, and found part of a very fine fat shoulder of mutton, dressed. Clark came in at the time, and we asked him where he bought it? He said at Watford, but afterwards said he thought it was at Jonathan's of Edgware. We then went to Cartwright's, and found two bits of fat mutton, they were parts of a shoulder, and a bag, which was fresh with fat and blood, as if hot meat had been in it. We took them into custody, took a shoe off each of them, and compared them with the foot-marks - they matched in length and breadth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any blood near to where the skin was found - A. Yes, the sheep appeared to have been killed there. It was a wet day; I could trace them step by step on the grass, and lost the trace between two and three hundred yards from Clark's house. On Tuesday, the 7th,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120007"></xptr>Pinnimore fetched me to the Artichoke, public-house, where I found some mutton; the shank of the shoulder matched with that found at Clark's - they appeared both to belong to the same sheep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The mutton found at both the houses was dressed - A. Yes. The shoulder-bone found at Clark's matched the shank.</p>

            . I am constable of Great Stanmore. I had a warrant, and searched Clark's house, and found part of a shoulder of mutton, dressed; I also found part of a shoulder, undressed, at Field's, who keeps the Artichoke, public-house - it corresponds with the other; there is a splinter in the bone, which matches with it; I found two small pieces and a bag at Cartwright's. Three days afterwards. I saw the mutton at Field's, and compared the feet with two legs, which were found in a hollow tree. They appeared to match exactly when I first saw them, but they have been so long in the bag that the sinews are contracted. I am a butcher myself; they were jointed in a different way to what butchers would do them. The bag found at Cartwright's was very greasy and bloody - the fat of mutton was very plainly to be seen in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he had bought a sheep's head, and put into the bag, it would have this appearance - A. No, there was suet and kidney fat.</p>

            . I am a butcher and farmer. On the 7th of December, in the afternoon, a man came to say some mutton was found in a hollow tree in my field. I went to the hollow tree - several men were round it - it was taken out before I got there. I found two legs of mutton, part of a loin, a neck with part of a loin to it, part of two shoulders, and other parts, cut in a very unbutcher-like manner; they were taken to Field's next day (Wednesday). I was present and saw the part of the shoulder which the constable produced - the bone appeared to correspond. I have no doubt but it belonged to the same animal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The bone was dressed - A. Yes; the other was raw. There might be a bone to fit it which did not belong to it - it matched to a nicety. Roasting would not alter it much.</p>

                  </hi> I am a chair-maker, and live in Sidney-street, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road; I have two workshops; the prisoner had been working for me about seven weeks. On the 7th of April I missed two saws, a cramp, and a plane—the prisoner had been working at the shop which I missed them from—I had discharged him on the Saturday night, the 3rd of April, and on the 8th of April he came and asked me for work—I told him these articles were missing, and asked if he knew anything about them—he said yes, he had taken them—he owned to three them—he said he had pawned them—I called a constable, and gave him into custody—I saw him searched, and the duplicated were found on him—one was for a saw which belonged to me, but which he did not tell me of—these are the articles—they are all mine.</p>

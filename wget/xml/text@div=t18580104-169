                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman. I was residing at Dolly's Coffee House, Queen's Head Passage; I had a bed room there. On Tuesday night, 1st Dec., I missed from my room a watch, a chain, a ring, and a stud—theyhad been left on the dressing room table—I had seen them that morning, about a quarter before 8 o'clock, and I missed them about a quarter past 12 o'clock at night—it was either the night of 30th Nov. or 1st Dec.—I mentioned to Parks, the waiter, the same night, that I had lost them—I do not know where the prisoner slept—my ring was shown to me by the police officers—Ibelieve I have seen my watch, but it being a Geneva one, and there being so many of them, I could not swear to it—the house is the dwelling house of Esther Dewhurst; it is in the parish of St. Faith under St. Paul's.</p>

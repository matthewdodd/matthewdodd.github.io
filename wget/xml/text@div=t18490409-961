                  </hi>. I live in St. Pancras. On 3d March I went into the Lord Somers public-house to get 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver changed for gold—I put the silver partly on the bar and partly in the barman's hand—he told me he could not give me the full amount, but only a sovereign and a half—I put the four half-crowns in my purse, and omitted to take up the gold which he had put down—I turned to go out, and two women came in—the one was a short stout woman, the other was the prisoner—the other pushed very much against me, and the prisoner said "Mind the lady"—that caused me to notice her—I went away about five steps, and then recollected that I had not taken up the gold—I went back and said I had not taken it—I then missed it, and the prisoner was gone—I said "Where is the tall woman?"—they said she had put down a penny and gone out for a loaf—the stout woman was still there—she tried to get away, but I insisted on her accompanying me to the station-house, and by the description of the prisoner she was known—the prisoner was taken afterwards—she refused to tell her name.</p>

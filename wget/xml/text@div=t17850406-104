               <p>I was one of the owners of the ship Elbe, I went to the prisoner's house; I had an information that Payne, who has since been convicted and executed, was concealed there; I went on the 31st of October, it was some time after the robbery; the prisoner's house is down an alley in Half-moon-alley, an obscure place; after rummaging every room in the house, he told me I was a day behind the fair, or a day too late, for he was gone one hundred miles out of town.</p>
               <p>What was the amount of the robbery? - Twenty-seven or twenty-eight hundred pounds, about two thousand five hundred pounds in dollars.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott, one of the Prisoner's Council. Who was it that made the first application that you received respecting Mr. Barlow? - I believe it was Mr. Samuel, the proprietor of the watches; I went myself the first morning.</p>
               <p>Did you acquaint Mr. Barlow what your business was? - There was myself, Mr. Samuel and his son, and they had two or three constables; I went to find Payne, at the first sight I had no idea of Mr. Barlow having any of my property; I sent a message by my servant, and he came to me.</p>
               <p>When you sent your servant, did you send word what business you wanted him upon; - I believe I did not, but my man knew the business; Mr. Barlow came the same morning voluntarily; I asked him to refund the money, he said he had none; I went then to Sir Sampson's immediately; and I believe he was sent for to Sir Sampson's; I believe he came there voluntarily, there was no warrant.</p>
               <p>What was desired of him at Sir Sampson's? - He was questioned relative to the property, why he did not give up the property; he was required to give up eighty pounds.</p>
               <p>Was he told if he would admit having the money in his possession that he would be discharged? - He denied having it, as far as I recollect; I recollect the circumstance of the girl charging him with the delivery of the money, so much in cash, so much in bank notes, tied up in a particular manner; it was upon his examination before Sir Sampson; the girl's name is

             as well as I know Barlow, I was at Barlow's house every day in October last; I always understood this Payne was a thief, that he got his living by robbing on the water; I have frequently been in his company half an hour, and he used to say, I must go to work to night, that was, I must go a thieving; he used to say, I have appointed so and so, I did not know the persons, but after I heard of the robbery of the ship Elbe, when I heard it I said to my wife, damn it, I will lay a guinea that Payne is in that robbery; I instantly went and found Payne, smoaking his pipe by the side of the fire; when I went in nobody was in the room but Payne, and when I read the advertisement to Payne, he trembled very much at it, and was agitated very much: I saw Barlow in the entry, and said to him, I really believe Payne<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060143"></xptr> is in this robbery which is in the paper, for he trembles so, you would be amazed at it; Barlow said, what robbery; then I went in and read the same advertisement to Payne and him, then I went away, and in the afternoon I came to the window again, we happened to have some oysters for supper, and Payne, and Barlow, and my brother and me joined together, we had half a bushel; I staid there till eleven, then went home; as soon as I was up in the morning Payne was there, and the next morning also; I suspected he lay there, but I did not know it at that time; the very next day I came down to the door, there was Payne with Mr. Barlow's red coat on, and a hat, I will swear to the coat; then I said to Payne, why Barlow's coat fits you like a smock frock, it touches your heels; there was a fight at Islington, and I said Payne will you go and see the fight; and Barlow said no, there will be too many eyes there, that was the day before he went off: I saw some gentlemen come after Payne, and when they asked for him, I heard Barlow say, you are come too late for the fair, I went with Barlow to see if Payne had got off safe, or if not, Barlow said, he would tell him to get off directly; there were three or four of us went; says he, he is not affraid of little spider, but he is afraid of Dolfin; says he, he says he is not afraid of transportation, he is only afraid of being hanged; he could not bear to be hanged.</p>

               <p>Was that before Payne went off? - Yes, more than twenty times before Payne went off.</p>
               <p>Who was this spider? - I believe May Cooke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, another Council for the prisoner. You have known the man at the bar eighteen months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Habits of intimacy all the time? - No, there has been some coolness between us since Payne's affair, I never was out with Payne but once.</p>
               <p>What robbery did you commit then? - You do not understand me so; I never was out with him but once to spend the afternoon.</p>
               <p>But you knew him for eighteen months, and always suspected him for a thief. - No, no, you run on too fast for me; I suspected him to be a thief a considerable time before this.</p>
               <p>How came it you did not inform some Magistrate that he was at this house of Barlow's? - I had something else to do, I have four children to work for.</p>
               <p>You made one of the party at oysters, now how came you to sup with him? - I supped with Mr. Barlow.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you became acquainted with Mr. Taylor? - Last Friday.</p>
               <p>How came he to find you out? - Ask him, you shall not have it from me, I do not know.</p>
               <p>How did he find you out? - Ask him, I will not tell you, for I do not know, I was informed he sent a man to enquire for me.</p>
               <p>What did Mr. Taylor say to you when he first met you? - I positively cannot tell you the words, he asked me my name, and I have had a subpoena served upon me if it was nothing but what I expected, when I heard that the man had robbed the man of eighty, and stripped him in gaol, what could I expect.</p>
               <p>What are you, and where do you live? - By my hands.</p>
               <p>To what use do you apply these hands to? - To making chairs, and mending them; I live in Long-alley, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Have you been at work yesterday, for the day before? - No.</p>
               <p>What have you had from Mr. Taylor? - I have not seen the colour of Mr. Taylor's money yet.</p>
               <p>You say you saw Payne at Barlow's house through the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But at that lucky juncture when you got this glimpse of him, anybody else might have had the same glimpse? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had the misfortune to live with Payne? - I never lived with him, I kept company with him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060144"></xptr>Did you see Payne and the prisoner together at any time after that? - Yes, the day after the robbery, I saw Payne at the prisoner's house with me.</p>
               <p>What passed between Payne and you? - I took the paper and shewed it to him, and he read it, he took very little notice to me about it, the prisoner advised me to take an empty room, or a ready furnished room, and he directed me to Butler's-alley, and I could not get one, we continued at Mr. Barlow's while I was seeking for a lodging; I think he was there three days, he was there in the back room, and locked up; sometimes they put him in the necessary, when any of Barlow's girls were coming, he was put in a place of concealment; there was one girl he was affraid of, for Barlow said, she was a bad sort of a body, and had lived in a bad place; on the Thursday following this robbery, Payne brought me four guineas, and three ten and one twenty-pound note, on the Thursday night following, and on the Friday night following he brought me forty guineas, and six tens and one twenty more, and he bid me take care of them, and not let Barlow know any thing of them, and he bid me good night; he went away, I saw no more of him till Thursday, then he staid at Barlow's till the last of his going off; I laid with him, therefore I know he was there; Payne was to come to dinner, but he did not, and Barlow's sister came in about one o'clock, and she said, Poll, Ned is taken, she said to me, you will be surely hanged or transported for life; I went to my room and fetched these guineas and notes away, and I came to Barlow's and said, what shall I do! says I, what shall I do! says he, suppose we put the notes into the tea kettle, no, says I, that will spoil them; this was the Sunday evening, and he put the guineas in the drawer, and said, gold cannot be sworn to; on the Monday morning I gave him these eleven notes, and I went to Edmonton, and his sister came down, and said, Ned is not taken; and I came to Barlow's house, says I, come Jack, give me my money and my papers, and I will go home, so he gave me the money in a stocking, says I, where are my papers, he said you must stay for them till eight o'clock, and then he gave me four notes instead of eleven, and I came back immediately; he said hold your tongue, I will go and seek for them, and he came back, and said, he could not get them till five in the morning; says I, Payne will be here in the morning, and he will murder me; the next morning Payne came to this man's house, and Barlow came to me, and said, I have got Ned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How long from that time was it before Payne went to Lynn, in Yorkshire? - Upon my word I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This woman asked me to lend her a guinea, so she is persuaded to do this, I am as innocent as a child.</p>

            . I live in Lad-lane. I am out of place. On the 15th of June, at quarter past ten o'clock at night, I met the prisoners together in Whitechapel; they asked me to treat them (I had been drinking, and was not perfectly sober), I went with them to a house up a court in <placeName id="t18210718-68-crimeloc395">Houndsditch</placeName>

I had my money safe in my breeches pocket, when I was in the room I felt it safe; the three sovereigns were twisted tight in a 1 l. and a 5 l. note. In about quarter of an an hour Palmer went to the door and called Evans, she came; and I saw Palmer put something into her hand, I went to my breeches and missed my money, she then ran away; Evans remained. I followed Palmer to the end of the court and stopped her, but found nothing on her, I have never found it. I took Palmer to the watch-house, and afterwards found Evans there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HONE. Q. You had been drinking - A. Yes, I was elevated, but not intoxicated; I had been drinking ale and beer at Blackwall with three friends, I do not know how much I drank. I gave Evans a sovereign to change to pay 2 s. for the room, she gave it to Palmer, I never got it again. I twisted the sovereigns in the notes before I entered the house.</p>
               <p>PALMER'S Defence. I saw him with two girls, he took us to a house, and said he only had 1 s. I refused to stop with him, and he gave me in charge.</p>

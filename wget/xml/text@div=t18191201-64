On the 10th of September I went out about eight o'clock at night, and made the house secure. It was dark then. I returned between eleven and twelve o'clock; I found the window open, the garden-pots taken down from the window, and the cups and saucers moved from one part of the table to the other; I missed the articles stated in the indictment; part of the clothes-line was cut from the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. I spoke to him about three weeks before - that is all. On the 29th of October I went with Attfield to the prisoner's room, and under his bed, sewed up in a bundle, I found the coat. He had let me two rooms in the same house with him. I had lived there seven weeks before I found the goods.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What led you to search his bed after being seven weeks in his house - A. I missed other property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Q. Did you not sleep with me - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Trapp who robbed the Post Office - A. Yes; I knew him about seven weeks before he was convicted, in consequence of a cousin of mine who was in the Post Office. I never saw him in the prisoner's house. I had passed a 50 l. note for him at the Bank. The Solicitor of the Post Office sent for me. I went, and he said he should not want me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not locked in my room when the Bow-street runners came - A. I was in my own apartment in his house; they only came to desire me to attend the Solicitor.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Pitcher to the prisoner's house on the 29th of October, to search for other property, and found four or five old sheets sewed together, and a coat in them. The prosecutor said that is the coat that was taken from my house in Richard-street. I also found two pieces of clothes line, which he said were taken at the same time. I found neither the carpet or bed. The prisoner stated these things before the Magistrate which he has now done. The Magistrate committed him from day to day to bring evidence, and offered him any one to go any where for him; he brought nobody forward.</p>

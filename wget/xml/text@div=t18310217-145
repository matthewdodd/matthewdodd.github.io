The prisoner had been in our service a week and three days - I had given her warning, and she was about to leave us. On the 4th of February she came to the counter, out of doors, for me to pay her her wages - I thought she appeared much stouter than usual; I told her to go into the kitchen - I went, and asked her what she had in her pocket; she said a couple of dirty caps - I desired to look at them, but instead of dirty caps it turned out to be a bundle of coffee tied up in a piece of rag which she had found about the house - I then made her pull off her pockets, and found in them some more coffee, fancy biscuits, sugar and bread - I told her I would search her, and she ran up stairs into the back bed-room - I called my husband to mind the place, and in a few minutes I followed her up stairs - she was then in the act of throwing some dirty clothes from her, but I cannot say what they were, as there were a great many dirty things about; I found upon her a pillow-case, two napkins, and a flannel - I sent for an officer, and gave her in charge; these are the articles I found on her - this pair of stockings was pulled off her in the room when she was committed: they are all my husband's property - there were other articles on the floor in the room where she was undressing, but I cannot say that she pulled them all off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Was not the room quite covered with dirty things? A. No, not quite- it was not our washing-day; we had washed three days before; there were a great many rough dry things about, which had been dried the day before - she had the flannel waistcoat on, with her arms through the sleeves, and the stockings were on her feet; she had a small bundle, but none of my property was there - I found some of her things in the house afterwards, which I gave to her cousin; there was a pair of stockings, and a bundle of things - I saw the officer with her bundle in his hand, but I did not exactly look at it - I was too much confused; I cannot say it was not as large as this bundle.</p>

            . I took the prisoner, but did not see any thing produced from her person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not she say she had put them on by mistake? A. Yes, and that she was going out washing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was my own stockings she brought against me; her stockings were not worth 3d.; I had been out, and got mine wet in the snow - I put that old pair on, left mine there, and when she came against me, she said she could not bring any thing against me but my own stockings - I was not going to leave her; I got up at three o'clock in the morning to wash, and I put that old jacket on to keep me warm - the napkin I had no business with; the pillow-case and napkin were in the room, and she said I had them on me, which I had not - the coffee and other things were under the bed.</p>
               <p>PHOEBE MANDLESON. I carried the coffee and sugar up in my hand which I had taken from her in the kitchen -I spilt some on the bed; she had got biscuits and fancy bread; I had had no quarrel with her; I was going to send her to another place - she did not suit me; it had not snowed that morning; she had been out some days before- she had not been washing that day; I am positive I took the pillow-case from her - I unpinned it from round her person.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 17.</p>

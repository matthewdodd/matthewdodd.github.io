On Tuesday night, the 23rd of May, I was on duty in Vine-street station—about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I went below to watch the prisoners—the prisoner was confined there—he was using very bad language to the police in general—about five o'clock, as I was outside the cell, he struck me in the face, just between the eye-brows—I do not know what with—the blood immediately gushed out a great deal—I went to Mr. Tothill's, a surgeon—I had not said anything to the prisoner previous to his doing this.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 23rd of May I was in Vine-street station for begging—I was there when the prisoner was brought in—he appeared to be half drunk—I saw a policeman come into the cell where we were confined—I heard the prisoner say that they were a set of b----y Peelers and paupers, and he would expose them before the police-commissioners—I saw him take a knife out of his pocket, open it, and put it into his right-hand trowsers pocket—about a minute and a half after I saw him thrust his hand through the aperture of the door, and stab the policeman—he then wiped the knife between his thumb and finger, and put it into his pocket—I then saw him go to the water-closet in the cell, open the lid about five or six inches, and put the knife underneath.</p>

On the 24th of May I was on duty in Vine-street station—I saw Builder coming from the cell where the prisoner was confined, with blood running from the tip of his nose—I after<lb></lb>wards went into the cell, and found this penknife at the top of the soil of the water-closet, as if just dropped—it was closed.</p>

               <p>five o'clock, he had a punctured at the lower part of the fore<lb></lb>head, near the left eye-brow, about half an inch deep—this penknife would inflict such a wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

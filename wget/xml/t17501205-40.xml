            . I shall be thirteen years of age a fortnight before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the consequence of taking a false oath?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. Yes, sir, if I forswear myself I shall go to hell. She is sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us the truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. The prisoner was my master, he lived at Blackwall; I was put apprentice to him; I cannot justly tell the month.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to you?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. My mistress went to bed, and my master was making candles ; my master bid me go down into the cellar to stay till the officer came; I went and sat upon the cellar stairs; he did not say any thing to me, but came and wanted to feel up my petticoats; I prayed him to get away; the officer coming he did not then (this was last haymaking time) the next time my mistress went to bed (this was about a fortnight after that time ) my bed was in the kitchin, and my mistress was in the one pair of stairs room; I had been asleep, and my master came and pulled the bed cloaths off me, and got upon me ; he put something into my body.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he put into your body?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. It was his nastiness.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by that word?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. I mean his y - d.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he put it into you?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. I am sure he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. I prayed him to get away, and cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do then?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. There was something wet came into my body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you willing he should do so?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use any force with you?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. He held me down with his hands, by my shoulders.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue in that posture.</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. About five or six minutes; then he went up to bed. I liv'd with him about a month after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing of this to any person?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. I did not till after I came home to my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. Because I was asham'd to speak of it; I told her the same day I went there, I had a great running upon me, I could not walk as I us'd to do.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first thing you observ'd, after you awoke?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. My master was then upon me; and the bed-clothes were off.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been awake, before he did any thing to you?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. He wak'd me directly; he put his y - d into my body, as I awak'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. He said nothing at all, but bid me hold my tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mistress hear you, when you cried out?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. No, not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master undrest?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. No, he was not, his cloaths were unbutton'd before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any talk with him after this?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever ask you to let him do so again?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. No, he never did.</p>

            . I am a midwife; the child's mother brought her to my house, betwixt two and three months ago; she told me, her child had receiv'd some great hurt, and desir'd me to examine her; the child had been very much hurt. I ask'd her if the child had been with any man, she said, yes, with her master; she had a running upon her, I believe a man had been offering some violence upon her, but I don't think he had enter'd her body; she was not open, as people are after such - and she had no laceration : I believe there had been a great pressing on her body.</p>

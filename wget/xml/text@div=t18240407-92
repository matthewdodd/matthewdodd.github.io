The prisoner is my son, I had not seen him for five or six weeks - he was backwards and forwards with me up to February, but did not live with me. He sold garden-stuff about. I lent him the horse and cart sometimes. He always used to ask for it when he wanted it. I do not know where he lived.</p>

            , who lives in Ewer-street. On Saturday morning, the 27th of March, about eight o'clock, the prisoner brought this horse and cart, and sold it to my brother. I do not exactly know what he said, but heard the agreement - my brother gave him 4 l. 19 s. for them. He paid him 5 s. earnest, and the prisoner gave his address at No. 9, Bainbridge-street, St. Giles's; and in the afternoon my brother ascertained that to be correct, and paid him the rest, and took his receipt. My brother is not here he was in the country, when his summons was left. The horse was put into our stable, and the cart stood in the yard. Mr. Gough came on Monday and claimed them.</p>

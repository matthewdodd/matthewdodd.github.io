            . I am a watch motion maker. Me and my friend were out that morning: we went to have a bason of coffee, and as we were waiting for the coffee the prisoner came up and took his watch out of his pocket. I seized the prisoner; I never let him go until I handed him into the watch-house. The watch has not been found.</p>

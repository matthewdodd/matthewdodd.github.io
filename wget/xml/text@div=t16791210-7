               <p>On Wednesday in the afternoon, there was onely one

                  </persName>
             tryed, but upon two Indictments, both for <rs id="t16791210-7-off22" type="offenceDescription">

               stealing Tankards out of several Victualling-houses about <placeName id="t16791210-7-crimeloc23">Convent-garden</placeName>

            </rs>, calling for Drink, and whilst the peoples backs were turn'd, slip away with it. But as for <rs id="t16791210-7-off24" type="offenceDescription">
                     <interp inst="t16791210-7-off24" type="offenceCategory" value="theft"></interp>

               the second he had a cunninger sham: For coming into Company where one at least knew him, their Tankard being almost out, he tasted, and seemed to be in a rage, because they had not drawn him all Ale, which he swore was his onely Drink; and so snatcht up the Tankard and went away with it
            </rs> down stairs, as pretending to give order for such Liquor as he lov'd, but went away with the Tankard; but it being by chance missed very soon after, the rest of the Company several ways pursued him, and took him. He was found <rs id="t16791210-7-verdict25" type="verdictDescription">
                     <interp inst="t16791210-7-verdict25" type="verdictCategory" value="guilty"></interp>
               guilty
            </rs>, and seemed to be in so weak and sickly a condition, that he was scarce able to go or stand.</p>

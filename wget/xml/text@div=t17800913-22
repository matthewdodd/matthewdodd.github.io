               <p>I am porter to Mr. Hemans. The prisoner Williams came into our warehouse and stole these handkerchiefs, on the 18th of September, 1779.</p>
               <p>(It appeared the prisoner had been committed in September 1779, but had made his escape before the October session.)</p>
               <p>White. He came in and took a couple of pieces of handkerchief off the counter and went out of the warehouse, and I followed him; there were other persons in the warehouse, but I believe there was not any body else saw him. It was about four in the afternoon; they were at the farther end of the warehouse; I was in a desk above him; I believe he could not see me; he did not speak a word; he walked till he got out and then he ran. I followed him and overtook him about thirty yards from the door. He dropped the handkerchiefs just as I laid hold of him; here is a young man here who picked them up when I took hold of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner come from Mr. Heman's house with the two pieces of handkerchief under his left arm; when he got out he ran very fast; the last witness pursued him, and he then took the two pieces with his right-hand from under his arm and threw them on the causeway; I picked them up and took them to Mr. Heman's warehouse.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SPAWTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. These pieces of handkerchief (producing them) were delivered to me by young Mr. Hemans, in September, 1779, but I did not take particular account of the time; young Mr. Hemans is not here, the porter was present when they were delivered to me.</p>
               <p>White. I was present when the handkerchiefs were delivered to the constable; it was the same day the prisoner was taken; they are the same pieces; they were never out of my sight from the time they were picked up till they were delivered to the constable; they are Mr. Hemans's property.</p>

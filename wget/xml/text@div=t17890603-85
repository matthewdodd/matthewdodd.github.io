               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is she a woman to be believed on her oath? - I should not, if I was a juryman, believe her on her oath.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. How long have you lived in this court? - Two years; I lived in Dobey-court before this, I kept a house in Aldersgate-street of fifty or sixty pounds a year; I lived in the Old Bailey, opposite here.</p>
               <p>Where did you go to from the Old Bailey? - I went to live in Long-lane.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030117"></xptr>How long did you live there? - About three years.</p>
               <p>Have you not threatened Mrs. Fisher? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you not said you would do for her? - I do not believe I ever said so.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you never say so? - She abused me, and I might say something in return to her, but I don't know the words.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not? - No.</p>
               <p>You have not had any conversation with that woman? - Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Then you have never said any thing to her about coming here? - I never conversed with her before.</p>
               <p>Then you never had any conversation with Mrs. Fisher about her coming here? - No, I know better.</p>
               <p>Then you was not much acquainted with Mrs. Fisher? - No, not the least in the world, only as a neighbour.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see her in a court of justice? - I once saw her before one of the aldermen.</p>
               <p>Not upon this subject? - Oh! yes, I saw her before my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Then you had no particular connections or acquaintance with her? - I never spoke a word to her at that time.</p>
               <p>Had you any particular acquaintance with her at that time? - No,</p>
               <p>Had you any particular acquaintance with her before this time? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Then how dare you in a court of justice to swear that she ought not to be believed on her oath? - The reason I give is, she is a very drunken bad woman, and I should be sorry my life should lay in her hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Two or three nights ago, it seems you had been abusing one another? - I never conversed with her in private conversation.</p>
               <p>I understand that a night or two ago, you and this woman had some quarrelling on this subject? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In that conversation you say you abused one another, and you cannot tell what she said? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Grisley called nine witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Counsel to Mrs. Fisher. You know Burgess? - Yes; on the 27th of May I was sitting with two children that I have ill of the measles, and Burgess came home about half past twelve at night; my husband was in bed, he called out Fisher, Fisher; you black-faced b - h, where is your jackass fellow, you b - h? I said in the counter; he said then, you will go to the Old Bailey, you b - h; I said, please God I will; he said then, you b - h, I will do for you; one Mrs. Wood and her husband, that has now the care of my two children, heard the words; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He called you a great many abusive names? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Did you give him a word or two? - Yes, certainly I did, I called him as he called me; he called me b - h, and I called him dog.</p>
               <p>If I do not mistake you must have the best of it, your tongue seems pretty glib; did not he say he would come and blow you up? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>He would do for your evidence? - No, Sir; he got ground of me.</p>
               <p>Do you think so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I do not think that; was he drunk or sober? - Between both.</p>
               <p>Court to Sleap, the cooper. Do any part of those staves appear to have been sawed? - No, not the staves, the heads might.</p>

On Saturday night, 21st Feb., the prisoner and two others came to my door and asked the price of rabbits—I told them 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—they selected two, and I sent them in to be weighed by Lawrence—I was outside, and after they were weighed I heard something about a half crown—I went in, and received a half crown from Hennington, the butcher—I noticed that it was bad, and I told the prisoner so, and Cal<lb></lb>man, who got off, said, "Remember, some time back a party was <hi rend="italic">pulled</hi> for biting a sovereign"—I said, "I will run all chance about biting this; I have got enough now to transport you"—I had then got a shilling in my hand which the butcher had given me—a policeman came, and I gave him the half crown and the shilling.</p>

            . On the 14th of March I was in my back-parlour - I heard a noise in the shop and went out, and saw the prisoner - I went to her apartment, No. 32, Euston-Crescent, and saw this tea-tray there - the watchman took away.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the house with Mrs. Dixon - I knocked at the door and inquired of the landlady if she lived there - I then asked if she had brought any chairs, and she denied it - the prisoner made some resistance, but I got into her room on the first-floor - she said there was nothing there but what was her own - I found the tea-tray, with other property, which she said was given to her by a woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you see them openly in the room? A. No; she stood before them to conceal them - the landlady of the house has absconded since then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner say the landlady had given them to her? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My room was never locked - a person came and asked me if I would allow her to put a thing or two in my passage, as the landlady had got a distress in, and she was afraid she should lose every thing she had got - I allowed her to do so - and she said, as the watchman was watching, would I shut the door, which I did.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the night of the 2nd of February I was in company with Crosswell and Valentine. At the hour of ten o'clock we met the two prisoner's both together about an hundred yards from Mr. Whitwell's soap manufactory; I stopped Harris and asked him what he had got in the bag, and where he was carrying it from; he said he found it on the road near the turnpike gate; I took him into the public house to see what it was, I thought it was salt; they said they did not know what it was. I took them to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I stopped Toombs, he had that the bolster case under his arm; he said what he had got he found; I took him into the public house, I found the bolster case contained something white, I did not know what it was; I searched him. I found two pieces of the same sort in his pocket; he said he did not know what it was, nor how it came there.</p>

            . Q. I believe for some time past you have been employed by Mr. Whitwell - A. Yes. I know Toombs, I lodged in the same house with him; I knew Harris before the 2nd of this month. On the 2nd of this month I was in a public house along with them in Long alley, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any transaction passed between Toombs and you - A. Yes; I had lent him money at the time; I was in the public house, I told him I was very short of money, I had not enough to keep me the week; he asked me if I could not contrive some means for his paying me; he asked me if I could not get some soap down at Mr. Whitwell's; I told him I could not; he said he must have something got and something done; I told him there was nothing but some soda and some pearl ash where I watched; then they said they would fetch some bags; they did, and I put them in my pocket, and took them with me to the manufactory; they told me they would be there by nine o'clock, or soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had got there what did you do with the bags - A. I put these articles in. They came about half past nine, I unlocked the gate and put these bags down just by the gate post. Harris came and took the bags; there was another man at a distance, I could not see who it was; after they were gone I locked the gate and went in to watch. A day or two after I was apprehended and taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. So you were a watchman set to take care of this property - you thought it as well to be a thief as a watchman - A. They took me by surprize, gave me some liquor, and made me foolish.</p>
               <p>Q. They gave you some liquor, made you foolish, and then you thought you would be wicked - you got the property in the bags ready for them - A. They swore if I did not get it ready they would murder me.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that pearl ash - A. It is white ash in an unfinished state, it is not in a state for sale; I had a quantity of that in an unfinished state in my warehouse; the pearl ash is of the value of six or seven shillings; the other is soda, undried. I had a large quantity of that in my warehouse; the soda is of the value of twenty shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 155). I was at the corner of the Prince of Wales beer shop in Lambeth, at 2 o'clock on the morning of 15th April. I heard some glass breaking, and walked round and heard some one, as if inside—I called another constable, and then I saw the prisoner come from the roof of the skittle ground on to the wall—the roof of the skittle ground comes. down to the wall—he called out, "I am going to bed, good night"—I said, "Come down, you don't live there"—and when we got him down, I said, "I shall take you to the station house"—some other constables came and awoke the persons in the house—after I had taken him to the status, I went back and found that an entry had been made by removing part of the roof of the skittle ground—the glass was inside that, in the kitchen, it was the kitchen window—the skittle ground was completely covered in, and the sides of it were walls—the kitchen window was smashed—a pair of steps had been removed from where they were hanging up, and placed against the hole that had been made in the roof—I found on the prisoner a tobacco box, a duplicate, and some lucifer matches.</p>

               <p>I was shopman to Messrs. Bourman and Co.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, I was waiting on another customer when the prisoner came into the shop; she had been in about half an hour, and the person I was serving informed me she saw the prisoner steal some handkerchiefs; I jumped over the counter.</p>
               <p>What time of day? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Do not you know whether it was morning or afternoon? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>If your memory is so very uncertain, how can you undertake to recollect the circumstance, did you see the prisoner come into the shop? - Yes, she came to buy some cotton handkerchiefs; I did not wait upon her; the person that served her is here.</p>
               <p>Is that lady here that saw her take them? - No.</p>
               <p>You understand that she saw her take them? - Yes; on that I immediately jumped over the counter, and cried, Devonshire, a word we use when we suspect any body; then the people were all on their guard; I was going to untie her apron, but she undid it, and shook her cloak, and a little boy that is here saw the handkerchiefs drop.</p>

               <p>What happened afterwards? - When she went to the door I saw the handerchiefs drop from her; I am sure of it; they dropped from before her, near some boxes; she appeared to want to drop them from under her cloak upon the boxes, but they dropped upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Who picked them up? - I really do not know.</p>
               <p>Hennesey. The deceased Mr. Bourman picked up the handkerchiefs; the handkerchiefs that were given to the constable are the same that were picked up.</p>

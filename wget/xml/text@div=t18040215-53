             sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to Portsoken-Ward; on the 22d of January last, between the hours of six and seven in the evening, I stopped the prisoner with a bundle under his arm, and asked him what he had got; he told me clean clothes; I made answer, he might as well say coals, they were hard enough; I asked him again what it was; he said he did not know; I told him he must go along with me; he said, for God's sake, do not hurt me; I made reply, I'll not hurt you; I took him in a liquor-shop, the corner of Goodman's yard, in the Minories, and opened it, and it proved to be indigo; I took him to the Compter, and carried him before the Lord Mayor; I have the property here.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this your man? - A. No; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150038"></xptr>Q. Are you able to say this is your indigo? - A.No; I will not swear it; I really believe it is mine; I certainly have lost the indigo; he told me he got it of a man of the name of Wilson.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not all indigo marked alike? - A. Yes; there are three different sorts here; it is very unlikely for any man to have three different sorts of indigo, which three sorts I have lost, and, on weighing it, I have the deficiency in each to correspond.</p>
               <p>HUGH JONES sworn. - I live at Mr. Dechamp's; we had missed a quantity out of each chest; according to the marks that are found on the prisoner, they correspond with each other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please your Lordship, an acquaintance of mine, a seafaring man, ordered me to go over to the Borough to him, to meet him in such a place; I went there, and he gave me this indigo to dispose of; he told me he was going to see his father and mother, in Northamptonshire.</p>

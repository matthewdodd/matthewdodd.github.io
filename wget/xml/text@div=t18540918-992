On 29th July I was in my shop, about 4 or 5 o'clock, and saw the three prisoners standing opposite, in conversation—I saw Thompson take some<lb></lb>thing white from a piece of paper, and give it to Morgan—I at first thought it was a medal—they were standing still, and were about as far from my shop as across this Court—when I saw that pass from Thompson to Morgan they separated, and Morgan and Franklin went together to Mr. Rivers', the Royal William public house—Thompson went in the reverse direction—in a very few minutes I saw Morgan and Franklin come out of the public house—they walked to the bottom of the street, rejoined the other man, and they all went away together—I saw no more of them—I know Mr. Rivers, and I afterwards went and told him something.</p>

On Saturday, 29th July, about 5 o'clock, I saw the three prisoners pass my door, they were in the middle of the road—after they had passed, Franklin came back and had half a pint of beer in my house—it came to a penny, he paid me a pennypiece and went away—in a few seconds after that, the other two pri<lb></lb>soners came in—they asked for half a quartern of gin and cloves; it came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served them, Morgan paid me with a half crown; I gave him change—they then had another half quartern, and paid me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence—I still retained the half crown in my hand, and as they were going out I put it between my teeth and tried it—I was doubtful whether it was good or bad—I found it was bad—I went after the prisoners, and found them not many yards from my house—I said to them, "Give me the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I did not say why—I said, "Make haste, and give it me"—they wanted to know why—I believe they said, "What is the matter?"—I did not satisfy them—I told them to give me back the change, and one of them, I cannot say which, gave it me—they then returned with me to the house, and I then asked them for the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for what they had drunk; Thompson gave me a good shilling, and I gave him the change out of that—I then told them it was a bad half crown, and showed it them—I had kept it in my hand all the time—that was the first time I had given them to understand it was bad—I walked up the lane with them—we all went out of the door together, or nearly so, and when we got about 100 yards I sent a Mend to the station for a policeman; he came across the field—I met the policeman, and gave the two prisoners into custody—I afterwards saw Franklin in the main road—it might be 500 yards from my house—it might be a quarter of an hour after the other two prisoners had been taken—I pointed him out to the officer, and he was taken—we had a struggle with him in the road—I assisted the officer in taking him—I saw him put something in his mouth, and I and the policeman laid hold of him to prevent his swallowing it—I got nothing out of his mouth but a small piece of paper—I believe he then said, "You may go to b—y now; it is gone"—we took him to the station—the other two prisoners were there—Thompson said, "That poor man ought to have a little water"—nothing was said about their knowing each other—I gave the half crown to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale stationer, and live in Blackman-street, Borough. I have a warehouse and stable-yard in Great Suffolk-street, about one hundred yards from my dwelling-house—on or about Tuesday, the 19th of April, there was about twenty-five tons of paper, tied up in quarter of hundreds, and about thirty tons tied up in bags, about seven tons of old millboard, and various packages of rags—I had made considerable purchases of waste paper from the Excise-office shortly before—I had seven stacks consisting wholly of that paper—it was worth 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt., in quarter of cwt. parcels—that in the bags was worth about 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the warehouse was secured by a padlock—you ascend a flight of steps from the stable-yard up to the warehouse door—no body lives in it—I merely send to it occasionally as I want things—in consequence of information, on the morning of the 27th, I went to the ware-house and missed about seven tons, or rather more, of the excise paper at 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt, from the stack, about twenty sacks of that packed in bags—the value of the paper stolen was about 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were other things gone besides—I have seen some paper in the constable's possession—I never sell it in the state in which it has been found—I can undertake to say it never has been sold—I saw the warehouse safe when I was there on the 18th or 19th.</p>

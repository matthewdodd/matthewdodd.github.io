I am a lighterman and contractor, of 38, Fore Street, Limehouse—I have also a place at Blackwall, and have a steam orane there on a platform, for raising mud out of barges and putting it on the fore shore—the prisoner has been in my service on and off about two years, up to about six weeks ago, as engine-driver to the engine that worked the crane—I discharged him on a Friday, I think it was 30th April—he had then been eight weeks in ray service—next day, Saturday, about 7.30 a.m., I saw him on my premises as if he was going to work, but I had another man in his place—I told the prisoner I had discharged him for neglect of duty, and he had no right to be at the place at all—he threatened to punch me and do me violence, and we had high words—I told him I did not fear him as far as the violence to me was concerned—he left while I was there—the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> had occupied about half an hour—we parted, and I told him to leave the place immediately—I left on the premises Edward Jones, who supplied his place—I did not see the prisoner again till Sunday morning, when I sent for him and told him that I had had information from the police-officer that he had been tampering with the machinery, and that I should give him in custody—he said that he would make me pay for it—we got to high words again—the engine was perfect when I left it on Saturday morning—my engineer is here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer—on 1st May, I was in Mr. Shelbourne's</p>

               <p>service, and attended to the engine which works the crane, and over which the prisoner superintended—after working some time, I found it was very much to pieces, the eccentric and several things fell off, and several of the bolts were loose, a pump rod fell out; they should not have done so in half an hour, just by the working of the engine—when I went in the morn<lb></lb>ing the prisoner was there doing something to the engine, I do not know what, but I heard him knocking; I said, "Good morning, Jeffery, what have you been up to?"—he said "What the hell is the matter with you?"—he left off hammering, came to the end of the platform to me, and began using bad language; saying, that I had wormed him out of his job—he took off his coat, and wanted to fight—I told him I did not intend fighting for a job, I had always got on without—the engine worked, but not well, several of the keys were loose, but no damage was done then—on Saturday night, I found I could not get on with the engine, so I stopped her and put her right, and left instructions with the watchman that he was to get up steam it 3 o'clock on Sunday morning—I left her in working order—I went on Sunday morning at 4 o'clock, and found the blow-off cock turned on, and consequently the boiler was very nearly empty, I called the watchman's attention to it—I saw a quantity of salt on the plank which forms the frame of the crane, that aroused my suspicions, and I instructed a man to examine the tank while I stood by—I tasted the water, it was very strongly mixed, in my opinion with salt and soda, and made my tongue sore—we found salt and soda in the tank, the effect of which would be a very severe priming, which would drive out the top of the cylinders, or knock out the bottom; it would be likely to create an explosion, and so injure the engine—we took a sample of the water out of the tank to Mr. Shelbourne; I do not know whether it has been submitted to a chemist—the tank supplied the boiler—a large lump of salt and soda, about half a pound, was left, and some must have been dis<lb></lb>solved—if the top had been blown off, the damage would have been over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was any damage done really? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not—it is a fact that salt hardens and soda softens water, bat they are not used to generate steam—both together would cause priming—soda is only used to clean the boilers—the water for the tank is supplied from the machine opposite Brunswick Pier—it is slightly brackish there at spring tides—I believe the tides were making then.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If soda is used for the purpose of cleaning an engine, would it be put into the tanks in lumps? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, you would dissolve it and put it into the tank, and pump it into the boiler when there is as little steam as you can possibly work with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a consulting engineer and manufacturer of engines, at Burdett Street, Limehouse—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a diagram of the vertical boiler in question—there was found in this tank ten or twelve inches only of water, which was highly impregnated with salt and soda—the proper height is from ten to twelve inches above the top of the fire box; if it is below, the flames impinging against the iron would cause the iron to become thin, and an explosion might probably take place—the water was 3ft. some inches short, but it was fortunately found out before the watchman lighted the fire—I do not know that the water was 3ft. lower than it ought to be, but if it was down here it would be likely to create danger—the effect of salt in the water would be that priming would ensue, that is a strong beullition of the water, which would become steam, and the engine and the top or bottom of the cylinder might have broken—if the fires were lighted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186906070090"></xptr>
               <p>the boilers might have exploded, and the result would have bean damage from 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the water at Blackwall is very slightly impregnated with salt, not enough to damage a boiler—I cannot account for this by the water of the Thames.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What would be the effect of the priming? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The water boiling over into the steam pipes and cylinders, it would be almost certain that injury would result—sometimes we put a quantity of soda in, and gently simmer the water to get rid of corrosion, we afterwards fill it up with the freshest water we can get—the great thing is to keep salt from the boilers—neither soda or salt have any business there, except when you have to clean—for working purposes you cannot have the water too pure—soda will counteract the effect of salt, most decidedly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARRIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by counteracting: suppose the fire had been lighted, would the effect have been an explosion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, priming; and then damage would have resulted to the engines—priming would certainly have taken place if the water had boiled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the soda counteracts the salt, what harm would the salt do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Any foreign substance in the water, as salt, or soda, or mud, will make a strong ebullition.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at East Greenwich, and am watchman to Messrs. Lewis &amp; Stockwell—Mr. Shelbourne's steam crane is on the premises—I know the prisoner—on 30th April, I was on the wharf in the evening, and saw him at Lewis &amp; Stockwell's engine-house—he came over to my watch-box, sat there a few minutes, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, I wish to do you no harm, nor anyone else, but Mr. Shelbourne has discharged me, and for that I will give him a doing. I will get a certain quantity of soda, dissolve it in boiling water, and put it in the tank of the boiler; that will give the engine a severe priming, that no man can work it. It will not be discerned, the soda being the same colour as the water"—I said, "Do not do that yet, for the sake of me and yourself, as you will get me and yourself into some trouble"—he sat there a few minutes, went away, and I saw no more of him—on Saturday night, 1st May, about 11 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and his wife outside the gate, in the main road, about 200 yards from the engine—I tried to make him go and apologize for what he had done—I said, "I have no doubt Mr. Shelbourne will take you back"—he said, "B—Shelbourne, and George, too!" meaning the foreman—about 11.30 that Saturday night, I examined the engine with my bull's-eye, and found it perfectly safe—I did not examine the cock, but no water was dripping from it whatever, or from the ash-pan—about 12.30 I examined it again, and found water dripping from the ash-pan—I did not examine it till day-light, when I sounded the boiler with a piece of iron—I had orders to light the fire that Sunday morning at 3 o'clock—I make it a practice to try the guaging before I light the fire—I did so and found there was no water at all—I turned the guage-cock, and no water came from the guage-glass, which shows the height of the water in the boiler.</p>

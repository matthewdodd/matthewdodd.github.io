I am a labourer—on 11th April I went to Hampstead—I got there about 3 o'clock—I tried to get a lodging, and looked all over Hampstead, but could not do so—about half-past 1 o'clock in the night, the prisoner and another man came behind me and hit me on the side of the head—I could not see whether it was with a stick or a fist, but I fell, and when I was down, the prisoner caught hold of my handkerchief, screwed it up, and put his knee into my breast—one of them, I cannot say which, put his hand into my pocket, and took away 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a purse, and a knife—I have never seen them since—I was insensible from the blow, for a few minutes, and then the constable came and <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> the prisoner on top of me.</p>

On 12th April, at ten minutes to 1 in the morning, I was on duty near the top of Brewhouse-lane, and saw Baines go down the lane—the prisoner and a man named Grimm went down before him—after they had gone down some time I heard a disturbance, went down, and found the prosecutor lying on his back, and the prisoner holding him by the throat with his left hand, and kneeling on his chest, while Simms was rifling his trouser's pockets—he was stifled, and could not stand by himself—Crane got away, but I went after him, and took him—I had seen him a quarter of an hour before, and knew him by sight—Baines complained of being robbed, and I took the prisoner to the station, and charged him.</p>

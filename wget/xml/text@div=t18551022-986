                  </hi>. I am a printer of 6 Hercules-terrace, West-minster-road On Saturday, 8th Sept, I was at the bar of the Equestrian public house, Blackfriars-road, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, Saturday morning—the prisoner was standing next to me, not one foot from me—he began talking about fighting—I said, "It is rather too late for fighting"—he showed me a young man sitting on a bench a little further from him, and said, "Do you suppose I could fight him for money?"—the conver<lb></lb>sation n lasted a few minutes, I then went out, and the prisoner followed me, he had changed his hat for a cap with another man, he appeared like a gentleman, and I thought the other one had robbed him of his hat—I said that he had been robbed by the other man, a policeman passed and heard what I said—I went towards the Magdalen Hospital, met the prisoner again, and he had got his hat again—I said, "You have got your hat back"—he said, "Yes, Sir, I am very glad of it"—he was very polite to me because I said that he was a gentleman, and I asked him if he would like to have a glass of beer—I pointed to a house, and he said, "No, not so far as that, here is a house," there was a gas light, and I thought it was a public house, but it was not—it was in Warwick-street, three or four yards from Blackfriars-road—I did not go into that house, but when I was just by the gas light I</p>

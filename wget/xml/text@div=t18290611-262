My father had a number of bricks in a field - I went there on the 17th of March, and missed from six to seven hundred; there were a heap of bats on the other side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What is your father's name? A. Charles; these bricks were in a field which he had bought some time before - there was a private road across the field, not a regular thoroughfare for carriages; there were from twenty to thirty thousand bricks in that clump - they had been left regular, and I found the clump not regular.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH LOWE. I am a shoemaker, and live at the back of Hale's-place, where the prosecutor's bricks are, I know the prisoner, and on the 14th I saw him taking away some bricks, between nine and ten o'clock, from the heap on the left hand side - I saw him take one barrow full.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they brick-bats? A. Yes; some of them were very good ones.</p>
               <p>MR. DOWLING. Q.Was this at near ten o'clock in the evening? A. Yes; I followed him, and saw him wheel the bricks down the place where he lives - some of them were whole bricks; Mr. Vale is dead - he was examined one Thursday, and died on the Thursday following.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live at Northend. On Sunday, the 15th of March, I saw the prisoner take a barrow of bats from Mr. Thornton's ground, at the back of Hale's-place - I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to JOSEPH LOWE. Q. Did you see me on the 14th take any bricks or bats away? A. Yes, and many times before - I was crossing the road to get some strings for some shoes I had to take home.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is the reason you did not tell the prosecutor of it? A.Because I did not like to make mischief.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MARTIN. I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 26, Wood-street. I have known the prisoner nineteen years- I was at Queen-square, and heard Mr. Sadler say that I was the man who took the bricks; Mr. Gregorie told him to look round and see if he knew the man - he saw me in the corner and said, "That is the man," meaning me - he then turned round and saw the prisoner, and pointed to him.</p>
               <p>MR. SADLER re-examined. Q. Is that the fact? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Upon your solemn oath were you not told to turn round, and then pointed to him? A. No; I pointed my hand backwards without looking at the man, as I knew he had been there before - the prisoner was the only man in the bar; Mr. Gregorie asked me twice -I did not mean to allude to this man; I pointed behind me.</p>
               <p>MR. THORNTON. That is true; he kept his eyes on Mr. Gregorie, and pointed behind him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did you make any sign to him? A. No.</p>

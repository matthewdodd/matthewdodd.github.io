               <p>St. Albans, and is a corn-chandler—on the 3rd of Jan. I left my horses and cart in Gardner's-lane, Westminster, while I went to a public-house—I desired Richard Jenkins to mind my cart, and told him I would give him a penny when I came back—there was a bundle of hay on the copse of the cart, for the horses to eat—I remained in the public-house about three quarters of an hour—I then went, and met with the officer at a stable door, down a court, and I missed the hay from my cart—I went into the stable, and saw the bundle of hay which I had left on my master's cart—I could swear to it by the band and the tucks in the band—I had not given it to the prisoner.</p>

I was set to mind the cart and horses in Gardner's-lane—I did not stand by the horses' heads, because they bite—I stood by the side of them—there was a bundle of hay on some rails on the fore part of the cart, and two boys came and took it off—I did not catch either of them, for I did not know but that the countryman had sent them for it—they went down the lane, and up a court.</p>

I saw the prisoner, and went with him to his stable—I saw the bundle of hay there—the prisoner said he would not give it up without he was paid for it—Peters claimed it and knew it by the band—I asked the prisoner how he came by it, and he said he gave two boys 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for it to get a pint of beer—I took the prisoner to the station—he would not give up the key of the stable till it was taken away by foul means—after he was in custody he made an offer to Peters for the hay—there were about 40lbs. weight of it, as near as I can guess.</p>

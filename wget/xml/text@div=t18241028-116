            . I live in Charlton-street, Somer's Town. The prisoner was in my service about three months - in consequence of the disappearance of some articles about the 5th or 6th of October, I expressed my suspicions to her - she offered to have her box and drawers searched my sister searched them in my presence; I can positively state that some of the things found are mine; the handkerchief I had had in wear; the ring is one my wife had worn. This curtain and this handkerchief were taken from her box - and the other things from her person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. When did she come into your service - A. About July; my wife died on the 18th of last month. I cannot say at what time I had seen the things previous to their being found; she had the care of the things; I do not know that Mrs. Desermeaux did not give them to her; they are but of trifling value.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's sister. I missed a small parcel of linen, which I enquired about; the prisoner said she knew nothing of it, but owned that she had seen it in the room where I had placed it. The box which was searched was in the prisoner's own room. Mrs. Desermeaux had then been dead a week or ten days, and during her illness the prisoner had to go to every drawer and place in the house. She offered to shew me her box if I suspected her; I believe the box had been locked, but she opened it, and took up the things very quickly; I then put my hand into the box, and felt three bottles of wine, which she said her father had sent her - I left them in the box. I then found a towel with the mark cut out, and a pocket handkerchief marked D., which had not been used since it was washed - it was tumbled; I believe it to be Mr. Desemeaux's; and in her drawer I found a muslin curtain, quite clean, and upon looking over my brother's curtains I missed one. I found a pair of stockings with the mark D. picked out; an ear-ring, which was Mrs. Desermeax's - a garnet ring, and a necklace, which I believe were her's and a broach, but of that I cannot be certain; there was some money found. When the officer searched her he asked whose the garnet ring was; she said her master's, and so were the broach and necklace; the petticoat she said was her own, but in taking one of my sister's out of the drawer it was precisely like it, and very different to the way in which a servant would have them made; she gave no reason for keeping the things about her person, but appeared much confused.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you present when she said the things were her master's - A. Yes. I did not say I would not prosecute her if she told the truth.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner. I found the petticoat which Miss Desermeaux claimed in the box - the prisoner said nothing about that; I then searched her person, and found the ring, brooch, and necklace; the ear-ring had been found before I got there; these things were loose in her pocket. I asked the prisoner whose they were - she said her master's. They were all female ornaments - I found 23 s. on her person, which she said was her master's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The linen I had had two years; it was given to me by a young woman whom I kept company with; the handkerchief my mother gave me. The broach and necklace were not in the box; the handkerchief and curtain were taken into my room, because they were wet. Miss Desermeaux told me she would forgive me if I told all - I said I never stole anything.</p>

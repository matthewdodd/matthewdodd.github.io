I made inquiry after him, and found him in Piccadilly, at Mr. Hallowell's, about a fortnight ago; he told me he bought him of one Wankford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>J. Bardwell. I did; he was in my stable but a little before I lost my horse; he lived within two or three miles of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a house-keeper ?</p>
               <p>J. Bardwell. No, he has a lodging. I went before justice Fielding, and swore to my horse. Mr. Fielding summoned Mr. Hollowell to come before him; he came, and there swore he bought the horse of Wankford the prisoner; Hollowell had him in custody in New-prison before I came there.</p>

            . In the beginning of May, I believe the 5th, I heard Mr. Wankford was in town, with a horse to sell, at the King's-arms, by Tyburn-road. I had formerly lent him ten guineas, so I got a warrant and arrested him; after which Mr. Marshall desired I would come to some terms, and let him out. He told me there was nothing to be had; but that there was a horse of the prisoner's at his house, which he had lent him seven guineas towards the payment of, and the horse and he had eat out six pounds more, and he would not part with the horse under that thirteen pounds, and if I would buy him, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160018"></xptr> would bring him to my house, saying, he might be worth something more. He brought him, and asked sixteen pounds for him. I said twelve or thirteen pounds was the full value. I came to this agreement to set the prisoner at liberty, he delivering the horse to me, and I to pay to Mr. Marshall twelve pounds, and Wankford to give me a fresh note for eleven pounds, dated May 8. My original debt was ten pounds, or ten guineas, which I lent him ten years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the same horse that the prosecutor swears to?</p>
               <p>R. Hollowell. It is the same; and upon justice Fielding's order, I delivered the horse up to him.</p>

            . On the 13th of last April the prisoner brought a black gelding to my house, and there offered to sell him to divers people. He was arrested at my house by Mr. Hollowell; the next day he sent for me, and desired I would let Mr. Hollowell have the horse at, I think, fourteen pounds. I told him, he said he would not give such money. Then the prisoner said, if he would give him twelve pounds, or twelve guineas, for him, he should have him. I went and told him so; so they agreed as Mr. Hollowell has before said.</p>

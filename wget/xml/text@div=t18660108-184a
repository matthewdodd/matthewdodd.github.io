                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter</hi>). I came to this country on 1st June last—at the time I came, I was in company with a Russian gentleman—shortly after I came, I put myself in communication with Inspector Thompson—I came in the company of a person named Bayer—I first saw the prisoner about six, eight, or ten days after my arrival; I cannot say exactly—I saw him at Spencer's hotel, near London-bridge—I was in company with Bayer, Berrens, and Londinski—Bayer and Berrens are the persons who were convicted last Sessions—I came to the place with Bayer and Berrens, and Londinski brought the prisoner there—they introduced the prisoner as the person who understood how to make the plates for forged notes—the conversation was to the effect that we spoke about it, and I asked him if it was really true that he understood how to make these things—he answered Yes, he did understand it, and told me that on several occasions already he had worked in that line, and had been doing business with Holchester here; that he also had been acquainted with a man named Miller, who had already been taken in custody before for forged plates, and that he had been assisting that man in making those plates; that he had already managed a similar business in Riga, only they were betrayed there, and that he was ready to establish such a factory for me as well—something was said about a sample—I told him I wanted to be sure if he could make something and do something, and he promised to make a sample in a few days—there the matter remained, and it was agreed that he</p>

               <p>should make that sample at Bayer's house, under the supervision of the other people—it was said that, if the sample turned out well, a house was to be taken, in which the manufactory should be established—the manufactory was to make forged 25-rouble Russian notes—some short time after that, the prisoner came and brought a steel or iron plate with him, and told me he would engrave on it a sample, namely, an eagle—an eagle is on the genuine rouble Russian notes—there was nothing on the plate the first time I saw it, it was quite smooth—he afterwards showed me the same plate with the eagle of a 25-rouble note on it—after that, I told them to look for a house, on which the prisoner brought me a newspaper, saying that he had found a house in it advertised at Pinner—that was a very short time after I had seen the eagle on the steel plate—I went to Pinner with the prisoner and Bayer one evening in a hired carriage—the carriage was hired at Camber<lb></lb>well-gate—when we got to Pinner, the house was not any longer to let—we stopped and dined at the hotel at Pinner—I afterwards hired a house at 11, Russell-street, Camberwell—from time to time I was the prisoner, Berrens, Holchester, Bayer, Davis, and Silberman—Silberman I saw least of all—all those persons were convicted last Sessions—the first letter I received from the prisoner was in August—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter—he gave it me himself, into my hand—I was examined as a witness last Sessions—on my cross-examination by the prisoner, he called on me to produce that letter—it is now in pieces—he told me he had already written me an answer at home, and gave this letter into my hands at his own house in Portland-street, or something like that—I went to his lodgings because I was expecting an answer to my letter—I had previously written him a letter—I said something to him when I went to him as to his not having answered my letter—I do not recollect the date; it was immediately after I gave him the letter—I said something about his not having replied to the letter, and then he gave me the letter—on the back of my letter he wrote his answer (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "2 o'clock, afternoon, 22 August, '65. <hi rend="smallCaps">DR.

You will see by these few lines how much I have penetrated in this man; and apologizing that I could not do anything for you, I hope you will excuse my not personally coming to you, I being too much engaged in my business, and having been always exposed to un<lb></lb>pleasantness when I have stopped away.

I was in communication with the prisoner in May and June, 1864—I never saw him after June—it was about some persons engraving a Russian eagle—I have passed him in the street since, and he has seen me, but I have had no communication with him—when I saw him in May or June, 1864, I gave him no directions as to what he ought to do, nor have I been in conversation with him since.</p>

               <p>Bank-notes are manufactured in St. Petersburgh—I am acquainted with their manufacture, and am the person in Russia to whom the question of forged bank-notes is referred—a rouble is worth from 30<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 32<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I pro duce a specimen of rouble notes of all denominations—they have all got two eagles on them—here is a one-rouble note, and here is a two-rouble note—there are two eagles on each one on the front, and the other on the back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Can yon tell me whether the eagle can be engraved by hand, or is it done by machine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no authority to give an explanation of how the notes are manufactured, because it is kept secret in all the establishments—it is engraved on a plate, and it could be done both by hand and by machine—the time in which it could be done would depend entirely on the skill of the workman—such an eagle could be engraved by hand in a month I should say.</p>

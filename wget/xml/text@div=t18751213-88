                  </hi>. I live at 11, Lower Park Road, Peckham, in the parish of Camberwell, with my father, who is clerk to Mr. Joshua Williams, the Queen's Counsel—the house is one of a row—there are no cellars—there is a door in the centre and a sitting room on each side, the kitchen, offices behind, and four bedrooms above; one of them is a small room over the hall, and is occupied by the servant—the bedroom on the right is my father's and mother's, mine is on the left, and the room at the back of my father's is occupied by my sisters from Saturday to Monday—the prisoner was the only servant, she came the first week in August—on 30th October she was the only person in the house during the day, except my mother—no fires had been lighted in the upper rooms since last winter; there was one gas light in each bed room; the gas was not turned off at the meter at night, it was kept low; it was not turned on till we went to bed, and it was turned off in the morning when we got up; there was no leakage or any smell of gas—on Saturday morning, 30th October, I left home about 9 o'clock, my father and I usually leave together and return about 6 o'clock—my sister generally comes home between 4 and 5 o'clock on Saturday—When I came home on 30th I found the firemen there—communication was made to me, in consequence of which I went to my bedroom and found my cupboard had been burnt out; there was a row of shelves in it and a quan<lb></lb>tity of paper and bundles of unbound books belonging to my father were kept there—it was all right when I left in the morning—I found that the cup<lb></lb>board had been emptied of its contents, which were all burnt and blackened, the lower shelves were burnt nearly through and were black and charred; half their substance was gone, the upper shelves were not burnt quite so much, but they were all very much burnt, and also all round the cupboard, the wall, and ceiling—the fire had evidently commenced in the centre of the cupboard where the shelves were—the prisoner came up into the room with me and the firemen, and I said to her "Sarah, can you account for this in any way?"—she said "No, I know nothing about it"—I said "Somebody must have been here, a fire can't take place of itself," and I asked her when she was last at the cupboard—she said "I have not been there for a long time, I have no occasion <hi rend="italic">to go</hi> there"—I said "Are you quite sure you have not been there to-day with a candle, or light of some kind"—she again said "No, I have not been there for a long while"—then she said "Do you know, Mr. Henry, that there is some gunpowder in that cupboard"—I said "No, I was not aware of it," but I went to the cupboard in her presence and found a small tin canister amongst some bags and other things containing about a small teaspoonful of powder; I did not open it, I merely shook it, it had a double stopper—it was not near the part of the cupboard that was burnt, it was on the floor—I said to the prisoner "Well, but this has got nothing to do with the fire, it has not been near it"—it had been there, I should think, five or</p>

               <p>six years, I had quite forgotten it until she mentioned—that was all that passed then—I mentioned the matter afterwards in her presence, merely saying what an unaccountable thing it was, and so on—on Saturday morning, 20th November, I left home at my usual time, about 9 o'clock—there was no gas burning in my room at that time, nor any fire—my father left about the same time—before leaving I went into my mother's room, there was no fire or gas alight there—my mother was in bed—I returned home about 6 o'clock—my sisters and mother were at home—the prisoner was out—there was a fireman and a salvage man there—I found the place in great confusion—the upper rooms had been very much damaged by fire and the water had been all over the place—the upstairs rooms were all more or less burnt, except the servant's room, that was not injured—the greatest damage by fire was in my father's and mother's bedroom; that room was entirely burnt out, the ceiling was gone, and nothing but bare walls left—the rafters were most burnt on the left hand side of the room behind the door—there were a great number of pegs on the wall upon which dresses hung—they were all burnt, not a vestige was left; the room was entirely burnt out and gutted, only a few fragments of the bedstead and chairs were left; the only thing that was left at all entire was a chest of drawers, only the top portion of that was burnt away, and the two top drawers and the three lower drawers were scorched—there was a box under the bed, that was partly consumed—the other rooms were nearly blackened and scorched—there was a chest of drawers in my sister's room, they had not been touched by fire, not even smoked—my room was blacked and scorched—the servant's room was quit untouched, the staircase was very much burnt, the wall had to be pulled down—there were carpets in all the rooms, that in my mother's room was quite destroyed, the others were only damaged by smoke and heat—there there was oil cloth on the stairs, that was not burnt; the fire was kept principally above—we have settled with the insurance company for 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we claimed 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the damage to the house was quite as much; we are only tenants—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid by the insurance company for the damage done on 30th October—the prisoner came in about half an hour after my return on 20th November with her father, she brought in a can of beer for the men; that must have been about 7 o'clock—the father said "I have come to see about this dreadful affair and to try and have it all cleared up"—I said "It is a dreadful affair and it is as extraordinary as it is dreadful, this is the second fire we have had here within three weeks"—then I said to the prisoner "Do you know anything about this, Sarah?"—she said "No, I know nothing at all about it"—I then said to the father "Mr. Howse, Sarah's conduct has been very unsatisfactory for some time past, she is very untruthful, we can never believe what she says"—I said she had borrowed money in our name—her father then asked me if we had paid her her wages regularly—I said "Yes"—he said "She has not brought any wages home since she has been with you, and she has told me that you have never yet paid her any"—he shen asked her "Have you got your clothes all right?"—she said "Yes"—he then asked to be allowed to go upstairs and look into her box—we went upstairs with him and the prisoner into her room—she had a box there, it was locked—the father said "Where's your key? unlock the box"—she said "I have lost the key"—he said "I will very soon open if, then" and he broke it open, or the salvage man did at his request, and there was nothing in it but a heap of rubbish, a few articles of dirty linen, dirty bits of clothing, but nothing wearable, no dresses or underlinen—the</p>

               <p>father seemed greatly distressed, and asked the prisoner what she had done with the water-proof cloak he had given her, and that when she came to our house three months) ago he had given her a new outfit of clothes—he stopped in the house until about 11 o'clock—we remained up all night nearly, we could only lay down upon the sofa or chairs—about 3 o'clock in the morning my eldest sister called me into her room and in one of the top short drawers there was a small card box with some cotton wool in it—she called my attention to a heap of burnt paper in the centre of the drawer—the card box was burnt, and also the roof of the drawer very much scorched—that drawer fitted pretty closely—the burnt paper was on the top of the drawer—these are portions of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and these are two of the little boxes that were in the drawer—they contained gloves, handkerchiefs, and so on—the burnt paper was lying upon them quite at the top—the drawer was full—the prisoner was in her own room at this time—about 10 o'clock Inspector Edge came, and about 11 o'clock the prisoner was given into ous<lb></lb>tody for wilfully firing the house—I went to the station with her and saw certain pawn tickets produced by the female searcher.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was not our practice to turn off the gas at the metre in the morning; we turn it off at the taps in our respective rooms—I had not opened my cupboards for two days previous to the 30th October; it merely contained old books and papers, which remained there for many years—the cupboard is never locked; it was not part of the prisoner's duty to open it; it was merely fastened with a common button—the caniste containing the gunpowder had been there for many years, in fact I had forgotten it was there—it was mixed up with miscellaneous things—it did not lie exposed; I had to take out several things to get at it—I pulled them all out together on to the floor.</p>

Margaret Sherwood. I am the wife of Henry Sherwood—my son Henry is clerk to Mr. Fooks, Q.C.—my husband and son left home on the morning of the 30th October about 9 o'clock—I was left alone in the house that day with the prisoner—I usually dine about 1 o'clock—the house was in its usual state at that time to all appearance—I had not been upstairs since I came down about 10 o'clock—I usually lie on the sofa in the after<lb></lb>noon—it was the prisoner's duty to go up and attend to the rooms after the family had come down in the morning—she did so on the 30th October—it takes her nearly the whole morning—about 3 o'clock, whilst I was lying on the sofa in the sitting room my attention was aroused by a knocking at the door—I think I went and opened it—the prisoner was there and some woman—they had noticed smoke coming out of my son's room—a soldie came in and went upstairs, some water was got, and put out the fire in the cupboard—the prisoner went upstairs, and came down to me and said "Mr. Henry's room is on fire; "I went up directly—she had opened the door, and the flames were coming out—the books in the cupboard wer burning—I said to the prisoner I could not understand how it happened, and she made no reply—on Saturday the 20th November I left my bedroom a little before 10 o'clock in the morning—an old servant of mine named Sarah Mannning, came in about 10 o'clock or a little after, and I kept her to dinner that day—the prisoner was upstairs the whole morning; she came down to dinner, and then went up again—I had no occasion to go up to my bedroom; I remained in the kitchen—Manning left about two</p>

               <p>o'clock—the prisoner was in and out of the kitchen during the time—she dined with us—Manning never left the kitchen while she was there; when she left she called to the prisoner "Good bye, Sarah," and the prisoner answered "Good bye, Sarah"—she was upstairs in her bedroom at that time—I closed the front door after Manning, and then no one was left in the house but me and the prisoner—I went in the sitting room as usual to lie down—I did not close the door; I never do; I left it open about a foot-and-a-half—I was aroused by two or three knocks at the door—I got up from the sofa and found that my door had been closed—I went into the passage and opened the door, and some persons said "Do you know your house is on fire"—they went upstairs and got buckets of water, and tried to put it out but could not—I did not go up myself; they would not let me—a fire engine afterwards came, and the fire was put out—after it was put out prisoner said she wanted to go home to get some clean clothes, but I said "No, certainly not; do your work, and when you have finished your work then you can go"—that was before my husband and son came home, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and my daughter had not arrived—the prisoner left the premises to get some beer for the fire brigade men who were there—the public-house is not ten minutes walk off—she was gone about a quarter of an hour, and she went a second time for more beer for the men; she then remained away two hours and a half—I was in the room during the conversation between the prisoner and her father and my son—the gas fittings were all new in August and September last; we had not had the slighoest escape of gas; we found the fittings ourselves—while I was away for my holiday the gas pipe was continued from the hall into the bedrooms—this Paisley shawl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine; I kept it in the bottom drawer in my room, the lock of which was broken—I put it away the morning after my return in September, and never opened the drawer again—I wore the shawl a fortnight or three weeks after I returned from Sevenoaks—I do not remember seeing it between the first and the second fire—this night-dress and sheet are mine—I did not know that any of these things had been taken from my house and pawned before the second fire occurred.</p>

Do you think it was hanging in the room?"—she said "No, I have not seen it since I helped mistress fold it up on the Monday after she had been at Mr. Charles's"—that is my married brother at Brixton—I believe that' was on 24th October—I told her father that I had missed the sheet and petticoat from my drawer and that she had lost the key of her box; he asked her where it was—she told him she had lost it, and he ordered her box to be forced open—on the Saturday afternoon after the fire I tried to open the top right hand drawer of the chest of drawers in my bed-room, but could not; the key would not turn, and early on Sunday morning, about 3 o'clock, I unlocked it with a key and missed the chain and the lid of the box, and on opening the drawer further I discovered the burnt paper—I called my sister and brother and then closed it—I did not move anything, and I believe I</p>

I am attached to the Fire Brigade—on Saturday the 20th November, about 3.19, I was called to a fire at 11, Lower Park Road, Peckham, with the engine—the right hand room upstairs, as you look at the house, was in one mass of flames—I went up with a man with a hand pump and a bucket of water and extinguished the fire—the flames were right across the landing, making their way to the other bed-rooms—the door of the room where the fire was was not quite half open—the bed was behind the door facing the window—most of the fire was on the left side of the bed, and the ceiling there was burnt right through to the roof—there was only one gas fitting in the room—I did not turn off the gas—the pipe was doubled down nearly to the floor, but there was no smell of gas—it must have been turned off at the metre—the gas could not have caused the fire; it was not near the gas, and besides we should have smelt gas—there was a box under the bed, but we had to turn everything over to extinguish the fire; the bed and bedstead were burnt, every bit of them.</p>

I should say that the fire began under the bed on the left hand side—there was nothing to show how it begun—there were no ashes, and there was no fire alight on that side of the house, so that it could not have been caused by a chimney on fire.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector P</hi>). On 20th November I got to these premises about 4 o'clock—the fire was nearly out then—I was there on following Sunday morning at 9 o'clock and had a conversation with Mr. Sherwood, junior, who called the prisoner into the dining-room—I said "What time were you last upstairs on Saturday?"—she said "I did not go up after 12.30"—I had Sarah Manning called in and "This female says you were upstairs when she left at 2 o'clock, and that you bade each other good bye;" she said "I had just brought down the last pail of slops"—I said "You have just said that you were not up there since 12 o'clock. How do you reconcile that?"—she made no reply, but said that she was leaving by the back door with the slops—she was not in custody at that time and no one had said anything about giving her in custody—I left her in the room and went upstairs with Miss Sherwood and Vining, and she was afterwards called up to Miss Sherwood's room and the drawer where the burnt paper was found was opened in her presence and shown to me after</p>

               <p>she came up—I then took charge of the burnt paper; the smell of burning was still upon it—I said to her "Have you lost the key of your box?"—I she said "I have"—I left her in Vining's charge and went with Miss Sher<lb></lb>wood into another room—she was afterwards given into my custody.</p>

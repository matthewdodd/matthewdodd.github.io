               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in your house any time - A. Yes; about three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time he lodged there had you any transaction about a draft or bill - A. He ran up a bit of a score, about fifteen or sixteen shillings; he wanted to run more on, I told him I could not think of letting it run on any longer. In consequence of that he told me he would pay me in the course of a few days. On the 9th of May be brought me a bill, while he was lodging at my house; he gave me the bill, and told me that I could see that he did not wish to defraud me out of the money, for the property that he had. I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260030"></xptr>the bill, he wanted to have seven or eight pound on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say so - A. Yes, he gave it me for that purpose; I told him I could not let him have it; I had paid my brewer that day, I had not a farthing in my house except a few shillings; in consequence of that he begged for ten or twelve shillings in silver of me; he had ten shillings in silver of me, and three shillings in halfpence, he called for a pot of ale, he told me he would be with me on the next morning, to go with me to the bankers to receive the money of the bill; I kept the bill, he left it with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say you should keep the bill - A. He gave it me, and told me to keep it, he would go with me in the morning to the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give it to you for - A. He said as a security for the money I had lent him. He never came the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he lodged with you up to that time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not sleep with you that night - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any property or clothes at your house - A. I never saw any property that he had. On the next morning as he never came, I was rather dubious of the bill; I went to the bankers with the bill, it was not paid. The officer has the bill, he had it at the magistrates.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you give the bill to - A. I gave it to the officer at Union-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner after that, he did not come on the next morning - A. No, I never saw him till he came up to Queen-square; he was taken up on the 10th, I think this was the 9th.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took him the day after he gave you the bill - A. No, it was the 9th.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what you are talking of - A. On the 9th of May he gave me the bill, he said he was to come the next morning to go to the bankers; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him - A. At the Crown and Cushion, at the foot of Westminster bridge, in the afternoon of the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him - A. Yes; I told him I thought he had used me very ill, and that he was my prisoner; I sent to Mr. Astley's immediately for two officers, from that he was taken to the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand you lent him some triffle of money - A. Thirteen shillings altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. He left the bill as a security with you - A. Yes, he would leave it with me for the money that he had of me.</p>

               <p>Q. to Fairfax. You said that the prisoner lodged at your house some time - A. About three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did he go by - A. By the name of Sinclair.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what christian name he went by - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But he went by the name of Sinclair - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you talk with him at all when the bill was given you - A. No, no great deal; there was no conversation at all, only he said he would come in the morning, he did not wish to defraud me out of the money; nothing else, only called for a pot of ale; he said he had just received it at the pay office.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he said that - A. Yes; he said he had just received it at the pay office; he did not say any more, nor did I ask him any more about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There was no more conversation with him on that bill, than there would be with any other bill - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he said he had just received it at the pay office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I have but lately returned to England; I have been <rs id="t18090626-35-deflabel207" type="occupation">employed in the naval service of his majesty</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18090626-35-defend426 t18090626-35-deflabel207"></join>. I was coming home late to this man's house in the evening, I found the bill; I did not offer it to him in payment, I asked him to lend me a few<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260031"></xptr>shillings on it; he said he was very sorry I had not asked sooner, he would have given me the full amount; I told him I only wanted a few shillings; had I known this to be a forged check; I certainly would not have tendered it to any man that knew me. In the second place, I would wish to state, since I wish to make myself the amienable victim of the laws of my country. When Mr. Fairfax came to me at the public house, I wanted then to have paid him the money; I was anxious to pay him, it was in my power but he would not accept of it. Instead of his stating what he has to your lordship, that I wanted seven or eight pounds, I asked for seven shillings, he said I might have seven or eight pounds. My lord, I have been to all parts of the world. I have been a number of years at sea; it may seem rather strange that I have not brought some person or persons to my character; at such a time as this, it is a very pleasing circumstance to have some person forward; but having been in the major part of my life at sea; I am only known by the officers, and I was about returning to my ship when I was apprehended; that ship has since sailed. Had that been in England, the officers would have come forward and have given me a character. If I had been the culprit that my prosecutor has represented me to be, I am amienable to the law. What he has stated does shew the ungenerous disposition of that man; it was over the water where he first saw me. He has stated that he first saw me in Queen-square; he first met me over the water, I was going to the theatre that night; a young man whom I did not know, asked me to go to the theatre, I agreed to go, as I was about in a few days going to return to my ship. On that evening I was going over Westminster bridge, I met a soldier, he knew Fairfax, I had seen him at his house; I asked him if he would have any thing to drink; we went into a public house, I told him my intention was to go to the theatre, that I would wait till eight o'clock to go in at half price. That man was employed by Mr. Fairfax to look after me, or I do not know why Mr. Fairfax should know I was going there; this soldier went out and brought Mr. Fairfax. When he came in he wished me good evening, I returned him the compliment, I told him I was very sorry I had promised to have called on that day to have paid him the thirteen shillings and had not, he must certainly doubt my veracity in coming to pay him; I would then pay him; as such I put my hand into my breeches pocket, took out the money to pay the debt that I owed him; he for a moment paused, and at length he said, I shall not take the money, I would rather drink your blood than have the money; I said if you must be so, and you are determined to send me to jail, this money will be of service to me, because if I pay you it will strip me of every farthing I have. My lord, I am guiltless; I am bound to plead I am guiltles from the natural impulse of my nature. I am doubly bound to plead that I am not guilty, because I am not guilty; and if I was guilty I should rather have gone to a stranger, and not to a person I knew.</p>

I was surprized, there being no body in the house but us two, and thought he should not be there: the cook immediately came in, and I asked her who she had had in the house; she said no body but the painters, who had been unloading the paint, and were gone to breakfast and would return presently; I said she had left the door open, and there had been a man in the house who had not the appearance of a painter, and asked if the plaisterer had sent another man; she said, no; I told her I had met a man in the house, who I believed came on no good design; she said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177607100010"></xptr> the painter would be there presently, and I might see if he was the man; the painter came, and I saw he was not the man; I then suspected it was a thief, and went up into the room where I saw him; there I found a cloth which I had put over a cabinet to keep it from the dust, removed, and the cabinet broke open and all the things mentioned in the indictment gone: they were found pawned at five different pawnbrokers: I am very sure the prisoner is the man, because he spoke to me: the things are my property; there was nothing of my mistress's gone; I was at the drawer, and saw them the night before. I told the painter we were robbed, and asked him if he saw any body in the house; he said he saw a man come in as he went out, and that he appeared to be a plaisterer; by the description he gave of him, I knew he was the man I met; I can swear positively that the prisoner is the person.

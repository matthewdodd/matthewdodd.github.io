            ,; on Lord-Mayor's day, I was going through Cheapside, between twelve and one o'clock; when I came to Queen-street, a great crowd obstructed my passing; I stood up at a door-way, till the crowd apparently was dispersing; there appeared a possibility of getting a cross the end of Queen-street, and I attempted it; I was looking carefully if any carriages were passing, when the man prisoner said, madam, you seem flurried, I said, I was; he said, madam, don't be afraid, I will take care you shall not slip in crossing, and thought he made an attempt to prevent my slipping, he obstructed me, and raised my leftarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an idea at the time, that the obstruction was on purpose? - A. No; a carriage was then turning round, and I made a run; at that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010009"></xptr>time, something appeared to stop me, but I cannot say what; I did not feel any thing about my pockets, and at that moment I heard a voice behind me, saying, ah, have I got you, you could not let the lady pass; I don't know who it was that said so, I was frightened, and ran into a linen-draper's shop, there I found my pocket entirely emptied, it was twisted in a heap under my white petticoat; at first I thought my pockets had been cut off, then I went to the Compter; I lost a pair of spectable, a thimble, and a purse containing two seven shilling pieces, and a sixpence; when I got to the Compter, I immediately said, that was the man that made an attempt to hand me across the road; the officer stood by, and asked me if I had lost any thing, I told him what I had lost, and he shewed me my spectacles, which I knew to be mine, and a thimble which I cannot swear to, but I believe it to be the same that I lost, I have not found any thing else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.There was a very considerable crowd on this day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not lose your property before you got to Bow-church? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had your spectacles? - A. I dare say, ten years.</p>

               <p>Q. How came Mr. Pring to bring you here? - A. Because he knew me, and heard me cry halves, when the prisoner picked up the spectacles and thimble.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to cry halves? - A. Because I was a tailor, and wanted a thimble.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know why Mr. Pring brought you here? - A. No, he came to me last week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you a subpoena here? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you what you were to come here for? - A. He said, you saw a person pick up a pair of spectarles and a thimble, did not you? and I said, yes; that was the way he brought me forward.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the First Regiment of Guards, which is at the Tower. On the 15th of Nov. I had been to Kensington, and was going to the Tower—I met the prisoner in St. James's Park, between the milkhouse-gate and the Green Park-gate—she came <hi rend="italic">blunt up</hi>, caught hold of me, and asked where I was going—I said, "Home"—she then wished me to go to the side of the rails with her—I said I would not—I bad a large portfolio under my left arm—I was in private clothes—I felt her hand down to my person, and with my hand that I had loose I tried to keep her off me—I had my money in my right hand pocket—I felt her hand all about my person—I did not feel it in my pocket—I might be talking with her about half a minute—as soon as I could get shot of her I felt, and missed my purse, which had in it a half-sovereign, a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and three half-crowns—it was in my pocket the minute before—I took it out as she was coming up—another woman was talking to her, and she stood a yard or two off—I said to the prisoner, "You have given it to that other woman, "who was close to her side then—the prisoner stood in front of me, and the other one <hi rend="italic">sidled</hi> round and got on the side of her; and when the prisoner gave way, the other one</p>

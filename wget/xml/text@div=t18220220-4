On the 27th of January, I was in the house with Goodwin and some of the servants; the library window was down, but the shutters not put to, nor the sash fastened - my master sent me round to the stable about a quarter before six o'clock; it was getting dark, there was not light enough to see a man's face - I saw a man standing in Cleveland-row, opposite the library window; I believe it to be the prisoner, but there was not sufficient light to swear to him. When I got about two yards from him, he called out,</p>
               <p>"Jump out." I looked round, and saw a man jump out of the library window, with two books in his hand, which he threw on the ground - he ran about twelve yards and I followed; he pulled something out of his pocket which he struck me with, and it cut a piece off my hand; the person who called out</p>
               <p>"Jump," ran in the same direction; they ran towards the Park. I saw the prisoner in custody in three minutes. I found the books by the window, and more were on the window cill ready to be moved.</p>

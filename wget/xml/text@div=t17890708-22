               <p>I don't know the prisoner; on Saturday night last the 4th of July, I lost six iron bars belonging to a copper; they were laid loose, and an iron furnace door hung upon hooks, two tin sauce-pans, a large pail and twig basket, they were in a wash-house, they were there in the day, they were not missed till I saw the prisoner with the things going out.</p>

               <p>I went out about five with two score of lobsters, and next door to that Gentleman a woman bought them; she told me she could not pay me then, but bid me call as I came back; I was very much in liquor, I thought it was the next house, I threw myself over these things that stood in the passage; the man came and saw me lay, he kicked me and said, you drunken b - h, what business have you here? get up.</p>
               <p>Meak. She was sitting up, not laying down, I cannot say whether she was in liquor or no; I did not say any such words to her.</p>

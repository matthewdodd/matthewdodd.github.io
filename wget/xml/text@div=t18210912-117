            . I lodge in the kitchen of George Housham's house. On the 12th of August at the six o'clock in the morning I saw my things safe. I went to the Angel, public-house, and returned about half-past six o'clock. The prisoner and another woman followed me out of the Angel, public-house, and asked me for something to drink. I gave them a glass of liquor, they went home with me and staid about an hour. I fell asleep. I was not sober. My landlord awoke me and said I had been robbed. The women were then gone and the property. Between eight and nine that morning, the prisoner passed the door and I took her, only three shillings were found on her.</p>

            . This house is mine. I heard somebody talking in the kitchen, and soon after the prisoner came out with a pint pot, an Italian iron, and a saucepan in her hand. I found another woman below, the prisoner came back with some liquor, but without the saucepan or iron; she stopped about twenty minutes then came up with a paper box. I ran after her and said, that is not your's; she said, it was not mine. I went down and found Crook fast asleep with the woman, and told him he was robbed; he came a little to himself at last, and said they had left him nothing but one penny. In about half an hour the prisoner came by and he took her.</p>

               <p>Court. How came Dominiceti to pay you a debt due from Forman to Harris? - I was in some particular circumstances; I went to France; when I returned Forman, who was my servant, had entered into partnership with Ramponi; he had these things of Mr. Harris my brother at Bath. I found he had got in debt, and told him he must get out of it as well as he could; he said Mr. Dominiceti would see him out, and he brought Dominiceti with him to my house and he gave me this note; Dominiceti said I am always doing good; I must get these poor devils out as well as I can; he gave me this note for six months and the rest in cash.</p>
               <p>Did you give a receipt at that time? - I signed that receipt; the doctor dictated it, my wife wrote it, and I signed it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Your servant Forman and Ramponi, as you understood from Forman, entered into partnership together? - Yes.</p>

               <p>This was for Birmingham ware? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon this Forman and Ramponi disagreeing they dissolved the partnership? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the partnership was dissolved you wanted to have the twenty-four pounds fourteen shillings and six-pence, and Dominiceti came with Forman and paid you in this way? - Yes; that was the very way of it.</p>

               <p>You wrote that receipt by the direction of Dominiceti? - My wife did.</p>

               <p>After you had drawn the account? - After I had drawn the account for him, by the appointment of Dominiceti, I called at his house at Chelsea, to see if there was any difficulty on either side; when it was on both sides approved of, I brought it to Dominiceti ready to be cast up; it was agreed to on both sides.</p>
               <p>It was not cast up then? - It was not; I brought it to be cast up, and accordingly it was cast up in the doctor's presence; but Ramponi went out before it was cast up. At the time Dr. Dominiceti was going to sign it and had the pen in his hand, he said to me Dodsworth stay. I recollect to have a note which I paid to Mr. Paris for Ramponi, and accordingly the note was produced to me, and he desired me to charge it to his account against

               <p>You say he produced the note; look at that note? - This is the very note.</p>
               <p>He desired you to charge it to Ramponi? - And I did so.</p>
               <p>When it was given you to charge to Ramponi, was it in the state it is now? - It was in the state it is now except those two wafers.</p>
               <p>At that time was Ramponi in the room of gone? - He was out of the room.</p>
               <p>Who was in the room with you at that time? - None but the doctor and I.</p>
               <p>Where was the doctor's son, the young doctor? - He was in town; I believe in Panton-square.</p>
               <p>Was he in the room? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Where was Ramponi; was he gone? - No; to the best of my knowledge he was in the doctor's house.</p>
               <p>At what time, and in what manner was it afterwards discovered, that that note was in the state it is now a 20 l. note? - After that note was inserted the account was cast up.</p>
               <p>Court. The sum total as it stood before was cast up, and the prisoner was going to sign it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it was added to the other total? - Yes. Then Ramponi was called into the room, and the doctor informed Ramponi, that the account current was ready to be signed. Ramponi was going to sign the account; but observed to the doctor that he had charged him with this 20 l. note, which he should not have done. The doctor asked him the reason; he said, doctor you are to recollect that I paid into your hands the sum of 30 l. 12 s. 11 d. the amount of Mr. Van Dutchet's bill, not only to discharge the note, but to discharge the whole bill of Mr. Paris; there was some altercation upon the occasion, when the doctor said, I must have laid out that money for you for some other purposes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130052"></xptr>What did Ramponi say when the doctor said he had laid out that money for some other purposes? - Ramponi said, very well, sir. I said, will it not be better doctor to put this among the other charges? because there were some passages in the account current they did not approve of, and a memorandum was made of it to be settled another time.</p>
               <p>Court. There were some charges not liquidated then? - There was some charges in the account current that were disputed, and were to be settled at another time, which memorandum was signed by Dr. Dominiceti; this was added to the memorandum.</p>
               <p>Read from that memorandum in English what relates to this charge; I see the memorandum is in Italian.</p>

The following articles to be considered, repeated, and for the discussion and effectuation of them, the parties are ready to refer themselves to two common friends, a satisfaction relating to two promissory notes of Mr. Sackney of 20 l. each, charged to Dr. Dominiceti, to what relates to the workmanship for the opening and shutting three doors, to whatever relates to Mr.

               <p>Is that all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have not mentioned a word of this note? - It was inserted after Dr. Dominiceti's signing it.</p>
               <p>Read what was done after that? - After this was drawn the doctor signed it; then the article relating to the 20 l. was inserted. (Reads) The surplus of the amount of the 20 l. note of Mr. Parys.</p>
               <p>That addition finishes the memorandum? - Yes; although it was signed before that was inserted.</p>
               <p>Read what relates to this note in English literally as it is in the memorandum. - The surplus of the amount of the 20 l. to Mr. Parys.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I think you say, during this transaction nobody was present but you three, Dr. Dominiceti, yourself, and Ramponi? - I beg your pardon, Ramponi was not present, it was only Dr. Dominiceti and I except the black servant, who went backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>How long after the account had been signed was this memorandum signed? - The memorandum and the account current were both signed at the same time.</p>
               <p>Was not the doctor's son present? - No; he was not.</p>
               <p>How came he to be a subscribing witness then? - He came between the hours of six and seven that he might sign the memorandum; we waited for him, that he might witness it.</p>
               <p>And not the account current? - There was no witnesses to the account current.</p>
               <p>How long after the account current was the memorandum signed? - They were both signed at the same time.</p>
               <p>Within five minutes of one another? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came the young doctor to witness it if he was not there? - It was lying on the table when he came in, and he signed it; we waited for the young doctor three quarters of an hour; he was busy in town.</p>
               <p>The sum paid for Parys was 24 l. 14 s. 6 d. whereas the sum charged in this account is only 20 l. is there any charge of the 4 l. any where? - No.</p>
               <p>You told us just now that the doctor after the items of the account had been inserted and cast up, said to you, stay, I recollect I have a note of Ramponi? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he produce the note? - Yes; he took it out of his pocket-book.</p>
               <p>He recollected that circumstance and added that to it out of his pocket-book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it was not a dispute whether he had paid 16 l. or 20 l. or 24 l. it was agreed afterwards to set it down and see what Parys's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130053"></xptr> bill came to? - There was not a word mentioned of Parys's bill.</p>

               <p>When Ramponi was going to sign he observed to the doctor that he should not have charged this 20 l. the doctor asked why; Ramponi said,</p>

The doctor said, I must have laid out that money for you for some other purposes; Ramponi said, very well, sir; then you said, it was better to put that among the other charges, to be settled another time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Whether there was not a doubt between the parties how much he had paid to Parys? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how came it to be entered in the memorandum</p>
               <p>"the surplus of the amount of the 20 l. note to Mr. Parys," how came that to be entered in that way unless there was a doubt between the parties what was paid to Parys? - There was not a doubt about the sum paid to Parys.</p>
               <p>Did not you formerly live at Dr. Dominiceti's, in his service? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long a time? - Almost a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>How came you to be dismissed from that service? - because I did not like to transact business in the way Dominiceti directed.</p>
               <p>If so, how came you to write such strange letters (shows him a letter) is that your writing? - This is my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Was not that wrote in answer to a letter from young Dr. Dominiceti, charging you with forgery, upon your oath? - I do not recollect to have received a letter from young Dr. Dominiceti about the forgery.</p>
               <p>I mean a letter charging you with forgery? - I do not recollect receiving any letter from the doctor.</p>
               <p>From the young doctor? - I do not recollect receiving a letter from him.</p>
               <p>No; don't you beg in your letter in answer to his,</p>
               <p>"no, never was it my intention to exculpate myself, much less to lay the crime on others; what you charge me with I tacitly confess"? - Is that the contents of my letter?</p>
               <p>Translate it yourself. - (Reads) Much less to appropriate those faults to others, and whatever I declare myself I do rectify.</p>
               <p>Was that in answer to any letter you received from young Dr. Dominiceti? - I do not recollect to have received any letter on the occasion.</p>
               <p>What is your business? - A writer. I was employed three years by Mr. Martinellis, as an emanuensis, in writing the history of England.</p>
               <p>How long have you lest that business off? - Six years.</p>
               <p>What have you done since? - I instruct gentlemen and ladies in the languages.</p>
               <p>You have been abroad I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Craigh? - To my mortification I do?</p>
               <p>Why to your mortification? - Because I did not act as an honest man would have done.</p>
               <p>Explain yourself; how long have you commenced this new trade of honesty? In what did you not act the part of an honest man? - Being with some officers, they directed me to act a part an honest man would not have done.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Mr. Craigh is Governor Advocate at Gibraltar. How long have you acted the part of an honest man? - I have endeavoured to act the part of an honest man since that.</p>
               <p>Pray, upon the settlement of the account, as I have it, there was due to Dr. Dominiceti<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130054"></xptr> on the balance 343 l. 17 s. 3 d. is that right? - Yes; it appeared so.</p>
               <p>In order to make this balance of 343 l. there is an item I see of the difference of 4 l. in the account. I wish to know as that was the balance due to Dominiceti; what were Ramponi's circumstances at that time, was he solvent? - I think he was not.</p>
               <p>Did not the doctor propose, if he would give him security, to take 10 s. in the pound? - He said if he could pay him the sum of 100 l. he would discharge him of the whole.</p>
               <p>I see according as you make the account, the debtor side is 944 l. 2 s. 4 d. the creditor side is 600 l. 5 s. 3 d? - It is.</p>
               <p>I see the first item in the account is to the amount, in sundry promissory notes paid for his honour, 1776, 1777, and 1778, 400 l. 17 s. 6 d. Had not Dr. Dominiceti been extremely a friend to Ramponi? - I do not know, Ramponi as far as I understood had paid the sums of money into his hands before he gave the notes.</p>
               <p>How comes it to pass, if these various sums of money had been paid by Ramponi into the hands of Dr. Dominiceti, for which the doctor should be made debtor, that none of those articles are charged in the account, nor entered to be referred; how came that about? - I cannot say; I

             the account between them as far as they gave me instructions.</p>
               <p>They signed and approved of the accounts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to say there were sums advanced by Ramponi? - I understood Dr. Dominiceti had cash lodged in his hands before these notes were given.</p>
               <p>This article of 20 l. for the note was inserted after the account was cast u p? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The account was cast up on the debtor side 928 l. 2 s. 4 d? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the 20 l. is added, making 944 l. 2 s. 4 d. which in fact is adding but 16 l. how is that? was that a mistake in casting up, or was it agreed that it should stand for 16 l. only? - There was no agreement made, nor nothing about 16 l. mentioned.</p>
               <p>How came 928, and 20 added not to be 48, but 944 only?</p>
               <p>Court. The figure appears to have been altered.</p>
               <p>You had cast it up 928, and only added 20, instead of making 8 and 8 16, you make 8 and 8 12, you make 8 added to 0 to make exactly 4; how do you account for that?</p>
               <p>Court. If that balance was paid, Ramponi would answer for the note at 16 l. only.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>In both the papers, the 8 is altered to 4.</p>
               <p>I believe the way in which this balance was settled between Dr. Dominiceti and Ramponi was, Ramponi gave a note for the 43 l. and a bill of sale on his goods for the 300 l.? - He did so.</p>
               <p>First of all, as to the note, he is in Newgate at Dr. Dominiceti's suit? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was the 300 l. satisfied? - By the bill of sale.</p>
               <p>What did the sale produce? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard? - No.</p>
               <p>How is it that you cannot recollect why you altered the figures in the accounts? - I cannot recollect indeed.</p>
               <p>Court. It is impossible that you should not recollect; it is a strange thing; it may not happen in the whole course of a man's life? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Counsel. It happens in truth according to the casting up, that the doctor is paid but 16 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the papers, and see if the fours in the original account have not been eights? - It appears to have been an eight.</p>
               <p>How came you to alter the 8 and make it into a 4? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. You appeared to me to be very exact in giving this whole account of the transaction. I understood you as telling the whole that passed word for word; now the particular thing in the whole account you do not recollect? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>I wish to ask you a few facts. Did you make the eight into a four? - I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130055"></xptr> collect it appears to me that I did; the circumstances I cannot bring to mind; it appears to me to be altered by my own hand.</p>
               <p>Court. If it was altered by him, it was certainly by the direction of the parties.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecution.</p>

               <p>Describe the situation of your warehouse, and how it is connected with your house? - The warehouse is in a yard, of which the wall joins the Excise-office, it is the partition wall over the warehouse and my bed-room; there is a gateway from the street, separate from the door of the house, where the carriage part of my warehouse business is transacted, my parlour is part of the old South-sea House, and the rooms that are over that parlour are not mine, they are lodgings belonging to the South Sea-house, my two compting-houses run from that parlour likewise, making part of the South-sea House a door to the South-sea yard, and to that door people come through a gate in the South Sea-house; this, gate is common to me with Mr. Grindall; he has for a long series of years had recourse to that yard, and his coachman had a key; there is an access<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190034"></xptr> to my warehouse door through my kitchen, but that is only relative to my family, there is no communication between any part of my house and the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Court. How is this warehouse held? - It goes with the lease; there is a gate way as I have told you, and over that gateway there is a dressing-room which joins to this bedroom where I sleep, and all the rest of the house is drawing-rooms, and so on, which run into one another; I was out of town when this robbery was committed, I came to town on Monday morning, I had lost a bale of Piedmont silk, B.B.C.No.7, consigned to me from Messrs. Bruisset and Co. of Turin; it was sent to me to be disposed of with eleven other bales; it came to me for 200 weight of Turin, that is always delivered in here for 160 lb.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of it? - From 260 l. to 270 l. this is my own-ware-house, nobody has any concern in it, and nobody has a right to go into it unless the people of my own house.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Teissier; I went out on the 3d of September at a little better than half after seven at night, and returned a little after eight; when I returned I saw three men, one opposite the gateway, and one on each side of the street.</p>
               <p>What gate do you mean? - The gate that goes into the yard where the warehouse is; the gate at that time was open; I saw the little door open, and I went and knocked at the door, and my fellow servant let me in with a light, I told her there were three men at the gate, and we looked and saw the warehouse-door open; I went to the Rose and Crown and got two porters; they looked all about and they saw nobody; we could not tell what was missing that night till Mr. Close come; the next morning he came and looked over the warehouse, and said there was a bale of silk gone; when I went out for the porters, I did not perceive any man, I ran out in a hurry, I did not take notice; it was not so dark when I came home first but I saw the men.</p>
               <p>Should you know their persons again? - No, the two men at the gate appeared to me to be dressed in dark coloured cloth, and one a shortish man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Are you sure as to the time you came home? - Yes Sir, I heard the clock strike eight as I came up London Wall.</p>
               <p>How far was that from your house? - Very near, I was at home in a very few minutes after; the clock struck eight when I got home.</p>

               <p>I am one of the servants; I was at home this evening, I went out with a candle, when the last witness came in, I opened the door and she told me the little door belonging to the gate was open; she said there were two men at the gate and one opposite, I went out, and as I was going out to shut the gate, I saw the ware-house door open, that alarmed me much; we returned into the kitchen and locked the door, we went to the front window, and could see nobody, she went to the public-house and got some porters to see what was the matter; she came to the back door.</p>
               <p>Is that a usual communication to the house, or do they go by Broad-street? - They come by the front door, because the little gate is always locked at dusk, that surprised me and made me ask who was there.</p>

               <p>Mr. Morgan. He is an accomplice</p>
               <p>Court. Have you the record of any conviction against him?</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. My objection is, that in a capital case like this, this man is an accomplice, and is so acknowledged, and has been stated to the Jury as an accomplice by Mr. Silvester in the opening, thefore, I apprehend your lordship will not examine him.</p>

               <p>Court. An accomplice is by law a competent witness, the credit of his testimony is to go to the Jury, that is a rule of discretion that always prevails with Juries upon the ground of common sense, that that accomplice should not have credit unless his testimony is supported; I hold it the most satisfactory way to receive the testimony of the accomplice in the first instance, in order to introduce the circumstances that gave him credit; I can conceive thousands of circumstances that would not be evidence till the evidence of the accomplice is heard.</p>

               <p>Where did you live before? - I drove the Shrewsbury coach before.</p>
               <p>How long ago was it when you drove the Oxford coach? - I never drove the Oxford coach.</p>

               <p>Do you remember being in custody on charge of stealing a parcel? - No, never in my life; I defy all the world to say I ever was before a justice or a court; I never was in custody for stealing a parcel from any coach of which I was the driver, or of any other coach; I came from prison here, I cannot tell the day I went to prison, it was on a Thursday after the 3d of September, about a fortnight.</p>

               <p>The reward is one hundred and fifty pounds on conviction, and two hundred pounds more if full information should be given to the satisfaction of the Jury; is that so? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know at this moment that a greater reward is to be given if a full plump round story is told than merely if you come to give evidence? - I will say no to that; I do not swear out of fee or reward; I do not swear to take the men's lives away for the reward.</p>
               <p>Why did not you discover the robbery the next morning? - Because I was in danger of my life; I was afraid of being shot; I put it off six weeks, and told them I would have nothing to do with it till they forced me to do it; I was apprehended before I made any discovery.</p>
               <p>What were you taken up for? - Upon suspicion of having been concerned in this robbery.</p>

               <p>You swear that you never have had any conversation about the commission of this robbery previous to the time of its being committed, except with the prisoners at the bar? - I never had.</p>
               <p>Had you no conversation of that kind with a man of the name of Bray? - I had not.</p>
               <p>You fixed on Saturday, as most convenient for effecting this robbery? - I did.</p>
               <p>You say in your evidence, that one of the prisoners picked up a piece of turnip, and cut it, and put some writing paper upon it, and took the impression off the key, and then said, Dan let us go, did you see the impression? - I gave the key, and saw the impression taken of, I never looked at the paper.</p>
               <p>How can you tell that any impression was made? - Because he looked, and said this will do.</p>
               <p>Then you saw a piece of paper put on the turnip; you say that one of the prisoners demanded something for lumbering the goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you understand that term? - I do not.</p>
               <p>You could not conceive what it meant? - I could not.</p>
               <p>You did not give him the half-crown? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>What, you gave him the half crown for lumbering without knowing what it was? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you make your information? - Before Justice Blackborough five days after I was committed, about seventeen days after the robbery.</p>

               <p>Did you never see the man that called you that night? - Never before or since, I was hired by a man, he took me to Broad-street, he went on the coach box, nobody was in the coach at that time.</p>
               <p>What part of Broad-street? - The corner of a court, I cannot say I know the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190038"></xptr> name of the court, there is a fruiterer's shop at the corner.</p>
               <p>How near is that to the Excise-office? - Close to it, almost opposite to it; when I had been there about two minutes, the man came to me, and ordered me down Winchester-street, I went down about four doors on the left hand, the man on the box went over the way to speak to two men that were standing by the Excise-office rails.</p>
               <p>Is that near the gate-way? - The Excise-office gate is very nigh it, I stopped there on the left hand, and waited there about a quarter of an hour, I was feeding my horses and somebody came and put something into my off door, and shut up the door again, and the man that was on the box before got up again, and told me to drive down London-wall, down Coleman-street, up the Old Jury, down Queen-street, down Thames-street, then to Puddle-dock, to the White Bear.</p>
               <p>Who keeps that house? - One Mr. Nodes.</p>
               <p>When you came to the White Bear, what did you do? - The man got off the box and he opened the door, and I got off the box to let the man out with something that they had in the coach it seemed to be a bale of something, but I did not know what it was, I helped to carry it in, and the other two men, we had a glass of brandy in the bar, it was put in, and they ordered me to turn about, then two men came out and ordered me to drive into Widegate-alley, Bishopsgate-street, we stopped at the corner of Catherine Wheel-alley, and staid there about half an hour, then they came back to me in company with a third, they all got into the coach, then we went back to Nodes's, and I stopped at the door about a quarter of an hour, I went into the house, and I asked them if they were going to discharge me, they said no, they should want me again.</p>
               <p>What were they doing in the house? - I cannot say, they were busy among themselves; these three men were by themselves, and another man in the back room with them.</p>
               <p>What had they with them? - They had the bale withinside Mr. Nodes's bar, when they went in they asked me to lend them a knife, I told them yes; they cut the ropes and things, and threw them, as I think, into Mr. Nodes's bar.</p>
               <p>What was in the bale? - I do not know, it was somewhat, they shewed it about, I cannot tell what it was, it appeared to me to be yellow, but I could not distinguish the colour, it being dark.</p>
               <p>Was it this colour? - I cannot say, they had plenty of candles, but it is hard to discern such a colour at night-time, then they took a brown bag out of the coach, and put the contents of the bale into the bag, and put the bag into the coach again, and I carried them to Wentworth-street, Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Who went there? - Two people.</p>
               <p>Only two? - Only two, then they took it out and went away, and told me to wait till they returned, they were gone, I suppose a quarter of an hour, when they came back they ordered me to drive to Mr. Nodes's, which I did, then they said, come in and take your fare, and I had a glass with them, I was there the value of ten minutes, and they gave me six shillings, and discharged me; the second time I was in the house ten minutes, and the first time when I gave them the knife to cut the package, I was seven or eight minutes; there were seven or eight people in the back room; I do not know any one of them.</p>
               <p>Look about and see if you know them? - As I am upon my oath I do not know any body there.</p>

               <p>Do you remember any persons coming to your house in a coach on the 3d of September in the evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many persons? - Three.</p>
               <p>Look round and tell us which they are? They are all there one after another, Mr. Beaman came first, Vandeput and Storer came in at the front,

            , the coachman, and East, came in at the side door; they brought in a large bundle, they put it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190039"></xptr> down on the outside of the bar, in about a quarter of an hour Beaman came in and joined company with them.</p>
               <p>Did they take their bundle into the parlour with them? - No Sir, they left it at the outside of the bar, it was a large bundle as big as a sack, the package was a kind of package such as they pack cloth in, of coarse cloth, it was tied with a rope, they staid after Beaman came in some time, but Vandeput and Storer went away in the same coach; they were gone about half an hour; they came back and brought a person with them whose name is Farmer, and they went into the parlour; Beaman and the other continued there after the others came back, here was a skain of silk produced in that parlour which I heard them say was taken out of that bundle.</p>
               <p>Court. Who said it came out of that bundle? - The four prisoners; it was of a yellowish colour to the best of my knowledge; it was candle-light, but something of that colour; I heard some conversation that Mr. Farmer had agreed to give half a guinea a pound for it.</p>
               <p>What did they do after that? - Then they returned and cut the cords on the outside of the package, and put it in a large bag which they had in the coach, some of the cord they took away and some they left behind, and that they desired me to burn; there were three of them went away in the coach, Mr. Farmer followed the coach, and East went home a little in liquor; he did not go in the coach.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt in point of certainty that these are the men? - These are the men that were in my parlour, all four of them.</p>
               <p>You, I believe, did not observe the marks on the package? - I did not, I afterwards saw some of the prisoners at Bridewell, that was Storer and East; they asked me if any thing had transpired, I said nothing that I knew of; they asked me who told me they were there, I said Mrs. Beaman, then came in a person that whispered them, and they told me the subject of that whisper was, that nothing could affect them.</p>
               <p>Had you at any subsequent time any conversation with Beaman after this robbery was committed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was that? - He shewed me two picklock keys that he said did the business; they were large keys, as big as street-door keys.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Where did you come from just now? - Out of the room just by.</p>
               <p>That will not answer my question; where have you resided now, for a few days before you came here to-day? - In New Prison; I have been there almost a month.</p>
               <p>Perhaps on this account? - Yes, I fancy so.</p>
               <p>Where is your home that you have now? - At Puddle Dock; I lived there about two months; I kept the Gentleman and Porter in Ball-lane, Spital-fields.</p>
               <p>There are no thieves thereabouts? - That was the reason I left it.</p>
               <p>What! because it was an honest neighbourhood? - Because it was not; I lived there about a year and three months.</p>
               <p>You had not the good luck to be prosecuted during the time you lived there for harbouring thieves? - I never had a word said to me; I always kept the house quite clear before that; I kept the Little Lion in the Borough; I never was inside this place before in my lifetime.</p>
               <p>I am very sorry you was not here a long time ago; when they brought this bale and put it down, did you know them before that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was either of them in the silk way? - I knew but very few in the silk way.</p>
               <p>Did any of the prisoners deal in silk? - - Not that I know of; I have seen them all before, but not often.</p>
               <p>Did not you know that not one of them had anything to do with silk? - Not before it was brought to my house; I did not know anything of any of their businesses.</p>
               <p>Now, you have been telling us about the ropes, and the outward case being cut, who cut them? - I did not cut them.</p>
               <p>Who did? - The prisoners.</p>
               <p>All four? - No, not all four.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190040"></xptr>What did they desire you to do with the case and the ropes? - To burn them.</p>
               <p>What was done with them? - They were burnt.</p>
               <p>Did you see them burnt? - I saw them while they were burning.</p>
               <p>Who put them on the fire? - My wife, I was backwards and forwards.</p>

               <p>Why did you suppose they desired the case and the ropes to be burnt? - Because I did not believe they were come honestly by.</p>
               <p>Court. How many times before this had you seen these men? - I had seen them three or four times at this house to drink a pint of beer, and I had seen them at the other house, but not lately; I had been out of the other house three months, I know all their persons, I am not mistaken, I know them all particularly well.</p>

            , they brought in a bundle, and put it on the outside of the bar, it was marked B. B. C. in a round ring, two B's at the top, and a C. at bottom.</p>
               <p>Was it in that form? - Yes, they called for some brandy and water, and went into the parlour, and Mr. Beaman came after and joined company with them, then they unpacked it, and put the contents of it into a brown bag, I was in the bar and saw them do it, and they took it away in a coach.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these are the men? - I am sure as to their persons.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. I suppose you have a perfect recollection of all that passed? - No, Sir, I did not hear all that passed, I was in the bar, they did cut the ropes the outside of the bar, and put it into a brown bag.</p>
               <p>Did you see anything likewise of the burning of the bands? - They left them behind, I burnt them, they were of no use, I could not cut off the knots.</p>
               <p>Was that the only reason why you burnt them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, pause a little, recollect, if you mean to say so seriously upon your oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You mean to swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you do it of your own accord, or had you any directions for doing it? - They said they were good for nothing.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing else? - They did not desire they should be burnt, as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with your husband on the subject? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Did he happen to see the burning of the bands? - Yes, after they were flung on the fire; he did not say any thing to it, he did not think they were of any consequence.</p>
               <p>Therefore you burnt them as you would do any other cords? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No other reason upon the face of the earth? - Certainly not.</p>

               <p>What did they do with this package as you call it? - They cut off the outside package and the ropes.</p>
               <p>What became of them? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What became of the inside? - They took a brown bag out of the coach and put the bundle into it, then they put it into the coach, and the coachman went away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Did you go to the coach with them? - No.</p>
               <p>You staid in the tap-room? - Yes, to wait on the customers, I did not go out with the men when they took the bag, nor when they fetched the bag.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to say that they took it out of a coach? - Because the tap-room door stood open and I saw them take it out.</p>
               <p>What covering was it in? - Straw colour.</p>
               <p>A piece of cloth? - Yes, pretty large.</p>
               <p>Was it matting or cloth? - It was like a mat.</p>
               <p>It would not do to put down at your street door to wipe your feet on? - It was not such as that, my mistress said she burnt it.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing said about burning? - No, my mistress told me she burnt the large outward wrapper as well as the bands; I do not know the names of all the prisoners, I know the name that one is called by, but I do not know that it is his name, his name is

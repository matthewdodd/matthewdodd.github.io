               <p>Honory Mitchel. I am wife to the prosecutor. I missed a pair of sheets out of the prisoner's lodging, I took her up, and she owned she stole them at the justice's, before me and my husband.</p>

               <p>C. to H. Mitchel. Look at this sheet.</p>
               <p>H. Mitchel. This is my sheet.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had been ill, and had got no money, and I asked Mrs. Mitchel, she gave me liberty to take and pawn the goods, so that I did but bring them again.</p>
               <p>H. Mitchel. This is all false, I did not know of her taking them, neither did I give her leave to take them; when I took her up, she owned she had pawned the sheets. I offered to lend her money to fetch the sheets out of pawn, but she would not tell me then where they were pawned, till I took her before the justice, then she told me where they were.</p>

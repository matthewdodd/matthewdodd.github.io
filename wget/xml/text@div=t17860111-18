               <p>I live in Oxford; last Thursday night I came from Oxford very much tried and wet with travelling, I came to <placeName id="t17860111-18-crimeloc88">Hounslow</placeName>

               <p>How high is the window? - Only one floor, I believe nine steps high, I followed the prisoner and found her at the ship, I took her at Staines with the buckles in her shoes and the pin in her bosom, then she said I would not give you a d - n for your money, and as for your purse I burnt that, and whatever you can do to me I will stand that, I would not give you that for your money, snapping her fingers.</p>

               <p>Court. Are you a gentleman's servant? - Yes, Sir, I live with a gentleman for the present till I can find an opportunity of going home to the West-Indies, I am not in a proper service.</p>

               <p>Did you frequently pass through Hounslow to town? - Yes, Sir, generally, I have often been in this house which is a place I always lodged at ever since I was first paid off from the ship.</p>

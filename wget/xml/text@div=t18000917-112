             sworn. - I let lodgings: Six months ago, last Monday, I let the prisoner an apartment at five shillings per week; he told me he was a married man, and last Monday morning, between five and six o'clock, I saw him going down stairs with a flannel bag before him, and his wife creeping softly after him; as I heard him unbolting the street-door, I went out to him; I asked him where they were going at that time in the morning; he said, he was going to have his wife churched, she said laid in; I asked him what he had in his bag, and he said, his working tools; I told him to stop a minute, while I went up to see if he had left my apartments safe; I went up, and missed a cotton counterpane, a blanket, and a sheet; I told him, I believed, he had my property in his bag; he turned out some things, among which, was a small box; he said, I have made use of your property, but here are the duplicates, I hope you will not hurt me; I then datained him, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they things that you had let with the lodging? - A. Yes.</p>

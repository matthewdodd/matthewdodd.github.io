(I think they call them) then I took one bundle, and Harper took the other bundle and the halters, and we carry'd them to Rowland's house, when we had got them there, Rowland push'd them into a closet under the dresser; some time after that, he was afraid they would be found, so he put them in a sack and buried them in some dirt under a pair of stairs in the entry.</p>

I had a warrant brought to me on the 3d of June to search Rowland's house for some coach seats, we had search'd two rooms, and in searching under the stairs there were these ropes and halters; they were brought into the room, and he was ask'd if he knew any thing of them, he said he did not nor how they came there. I did not take the ropes away that day, but took the prisoner before justice Lediard. After he was gone to Bridewell, I fetch'd the ropes, and had them carry'd to my house, and they have been there from that time to this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Aleph Palmer, of Walthamstow. The prisoner came into our service about 21st July; she received warning, and was to leave on 21st Aug.—on that evening, just before she was going, I requested her to take her things out of her box—she went and unlocked it very reluctantly, and I said, "Emma, I wish to know the contents of your box"—she said, "It is unlocked, you can look in"—I said, "No",; you shall take the things out"—she took out five yards of plum coloured silk, two pocket handkerchiefs, one pair of stockings, and three yards of ribbon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "They are not yours," and she said, "No, they are not"—they are my property—there were three handkerchiefs taken out, but one of them turned out not to be mine—I gave it up, and the Magistrate said it was not to be introduced—on turning from her box I raised the pillow of her bed, and found this silver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) tied up in a piece of paper, and there was ano<lb></lb>ther piece of paper in this, containing 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in an envelope—there are some broken up spectacles among this silver—they were not broken up when she came into the service, they had one glass out, I have known them forty years—here is a tea caddy spoon with a crest on, which is mine, I can produce others like it—I gave the prisoner into custody that night, and on the follow<lb></lb>ing morning in an adjoining room, I found a silk handkerchief, a scarf, and a shirt, in a box under the bed, and on the table under some cuttings which a dressmaker had left, I found two teaspoons and a pair of spectacles which I had been asking the prisoner for for some time—I found part of a shirt, and a small tablecloth placed under the dirty linen—I have also lost a silver cream ewer, and a dessert spoon, and a quantity of velvet, which have not been found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I told her after a week that she did not allow me half enough to eat, and the coals were locked up, and she asked me to stop several times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not—she asked me to allow her to stop a week after her time—on 13th she asked me to allow her to go out, and I said positively I would not be left alone, and Mr. Palmer was out on business—after that she left the house and did not return till after 10 o'clock at night—when Mr. Palmer came home, I was very ill—he was very angry, and next morning he spoke to the prisoner, and asked her to take her money and leave.</p>

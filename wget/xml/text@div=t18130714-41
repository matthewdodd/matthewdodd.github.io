               <p>Q. Did you do any thing to get that bill endorsed by Grant and Company - A. I generally write the endorsement of Messrs. Ladbroke and Company, for them to sign it. The endorsement to Ladbroke and Company is all taken out. This entry is in my own handwriting, as transmitted to Ladbroke, and it is debitted to Ladbroke. I certainly did write the endorsement of Ladbroke, although there is no trace of it now. In the regular course of my business I should write</p>

               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any reason for knowing that any alteration was made upon that bill - A. None, whatever; he only knew they were stolen. Stanley had no knowledge of any alteration on this bill; Birkett told me he had not.</p>

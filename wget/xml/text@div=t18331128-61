I was removing from there on the 25th of October; the prisoner was there at the time; he was up in the loft between six and seven o'clock, putting on some tiles for the landlord of the house - I had a pair of wheels of a child's chaise there which belonged to Mr.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Pige, a pawnbroker, of No. 155, Church-street, Bethnal-green. I produce these wheels - on the evening of the 25th of October, a lad about the same height as the prisoner pawned them - I cannot swear to the prisoner, but I believe him to be the lad - he pawned them for 3s. in the name of John Thompson, Swan-street - I did not know him before; I might have seen him once or twice- I think I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have less doubt about him now? A. I have not less - I have some doubt, though I had seen him before - he had been in the habit of pawning for his mother - I did not know his mother till I saw her at the office - he told us he came from his mother.</p>

            . I am gatekeeper to the Customs. On the 7th of December, between the hours of nine and ten, I and Mr. Durham were a few peces from the gate, I met the prisoner with an empty bushel measure, and a pass, he presented the pass when he came to the gate; I asked him whether he had any thing in the bushel measure; he said, no; I told him I must see; I laid hold of the measure, and underneath his smock frock, I saw this cake of copper, that was in the London Dock, Mr. Durham took the bushel measure; I took the copper from him, and took it to my box; the prisoner ran away, he was pursued and brought back. I produce the copper.</p>
               <p>ARCHIBALD MACDONALD. Q. Do you know of any copper being within the London Docks. - A. There is plenty, some of the same marks, and some of the same quality: it lies on the west side of the dock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the jury, I have never been before a court of justice before The copper taken from me, I had no intention of stealing the same being given to me by a person in the dock, alledging, he wanted it for a sample, unconscious that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100030"></xptr>I was doing wrong; I acceeded to his wish when I came to the gate, although I had a pass I was stopped with the property, I informed them I was not carrying it for myself, I was carrying it for another person coming out of the Dock before me, who on my apprehension absconded. I was advised to run away, I therefore beg my crime may be considered to arise from ignorance.</p>
               <p>Q. to Durham. Did the prisoner say to you that he was employed to carry this out - A. He did not to me, he did before the Justice.</p>

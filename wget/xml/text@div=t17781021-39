             jumped into the boat; he stabbed me with a knife, and then took up a blunderbuss, and said, You bloody bugger! if you don't go out of the boat I will blow your brains out! there were others in the boat. Knowing if I went into the river I should be drowned, I asked him where he would have me go to; he said draw along the lighter, which I did; and he bid us all get out of the boat; before we could get out he fired the blunderbuss; it was charged; I had seen the captain charge it, and a brace of pistols; it was in the stern of the boat. If a man, who was in the boat, had not that instant tossed the mouth of it up I believe it would have shot me, and all that were in the boat. When he fired it he gave it to another man to load again.</p>

I went after him, he said, If you come after me, you bugger, I will blow your brains out! and he snapped a knife at me, which he had in his hand; I pursued him still, and knocked him down, and secured him; when I took him, he said he was afraid he was a dead man, for he had jumped into the boat, and taken a blunderbuss, and fired it at the boatswain; and had likewise stabbed him in his thigh; he begged we would let him go, for he said he was a dead man if he was taken!</p>

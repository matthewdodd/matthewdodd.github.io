               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge at your house - A. No; he did lodge there two or three nights, one week before the robbery. Having been robbed, on the night of the 23d, of a box like that, and all the halfpence, I went to Lambeth-street office, they advised me to set a watch. I did; and, on the 24th, about half past one, I was alarmed by the man that I had set to watch. I went down stairs and unlocked the door. I called to the man that I had set to watch. I found him in the yard: I went to him; I asked him what was the matter? he said, he had got a bird in the cage. I found the prisoner in the parlour, with the box with the halfpence in it, by his feet. He was at the back part of the premises, about ten or twelve yards from where the box was taken from; he within the house: in that room there was a window broken. He had got the drawer about twelve yards from the bar, where it was kept. The drawer contained halfpence and pence. I immediately seized the prisoner and took him to the watchhouse, and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he come in - A. On the night before there was a smaller window broken. On this night the frame of the window was cut, and the glass was broken out; that is the way he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, was that window safe on the over night - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this your tap-room - A. No, the back kitchen.</p>
               <p>- I am a Portugueze sailor. Master Bolingbroke told me to keep watch in the parlour. I kept watch. A window was broken. Some person came in: that person that broke the window came in, and went to the bar, and took the till out. I heard the shaking of halfpence. I opened the parlour door, and went out. The man put the till close to his feet, down on the floor: he brought the till to go out the same way. He left his jacket outside. He went to reach his jacket. I asked him what he was going to do; he answered me, he wanted to go out. I told him he could not go out to stop. I knocked against the house, for the master to come down, and I left it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him come in at the window - A. No. I stood close back. I heard every thing from first to last.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. This window; where was it - It shews a light into the kitchen and tap-room; it is a window in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, the person got into the yard first, before he got in at the window - A. Yes. This is the drawer; it is my drawer. I found it near his feet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had not got hold of the drawer; a boy had taken it, and put it by my feet.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Prussian: last Saturday was a month I was discharged from my ship, the Isabella; I came to St. Catherine's, and bought some clothes; I bought a great coat and a pair of trowsers; I saw the prisoner at Towerhill, I went to the Black Boy with the things, it was about ten o'clock at night; he said it was too late to go home to my lodging, and I went home with him, and paid three shillings for my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040011"></xptr>bed; I put my watch underneath the pillow, and my property upon the table; I went to sleep, and waked about one o'clock; he went to bed with me, and I felt that the man was gone with my property, I lost my watch, and the great coat and trowsers; on Monday I went for the Justice to look for him, and we went to the India-house, and there I saw the prisoner, and he had got these trowsers of mine upon him; I cried out in the street, hold fast the thief, hold fast the thief, and I gave him to the constable; I know the trowsers by there being a bit put in at the top, I am sure they are mine.</p>
               <p>ALBERT FRANK sworn. - I am a Hamburgh man: Spokenburg and I saw the prisoner at the India-house, and he told him if he did not stop, he would give it to him; and then he cried out, and he was stopped, and we found these trowsers upon him; he said he made a mistake, and took his trowsers instead of his own.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: I apprehended the prisoner in the City.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise? - A. No; as I was taking him to the Compter, he said he was with the parties; he said the watch was pawned for two pounds, and he had the duplicate in his possession, but the watch was taken out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The Man asked me if I could get him a lodging, and there were four of us, there were two other men slept in the next room; I got up in a hurry and took the wrong trowsers, I left a much better pair behind than my own.</p>

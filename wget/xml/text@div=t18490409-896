                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to the Westminster Fire Office. Mr. William Beckwith France is one of the trustees, and there, are others—this receipt is the prisoner's writing—(read)—"Policy 89,677, insuring 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on premises and goods—Received, for one year's premium and duty, to 29th Sept., 1849. 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Henry Edward Russell"—Mr. John Cranage is one of the proprietors of the office—on 12th Oct. the prisoner was a clerk; it was his duty to receive money on account of the establishment, and enter it in the cash-book of the office, as well as in his own private cash-book—this is his own private cash-book—here is no entry on 12th Oct. of a receipt for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—each clerk in the office has one of these private cash-books, and from this he enters it into the office cash-book—this is kept exclusively for himself—here is the office cash-book—it is not entered here—here is the register in which the policy appears—it was his duty to write it off in the register, against the policy—that would be the first thing he did—it is not written here, but here is written on 14th Oct. a new policy in the name of Thomas Drake, and it is erased, and not brought to account—the effect of that on the persons in the office would be, that in making up the account of premium paid, the money would not be brought to account—it is officially erased, there appearing no reason why there should have been a new policy—we do not issue a new policy unless there is an alteration; it is entered as "New Policy" in the prisoner's handwriting—there is no authority for that at all—it was the prisoner's duty at three o'clock in the afternoon to make up his account, and bring the money to me on the days he received it—I balanced an account with him on 12th Oct., at three o'clock—I have the book here, it contains no item of this—it was his duty to furnish a receipt to the person paying the money, and to make a corresponding entry in the margin of the receipt of the date and amount—here is no entry of this sum—here is an entry to the Earl of Bradford of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—No. 327 is the counterfoil of the receipt he gave to Mr. Bompas, and that he has entered to the Earl of Bradford—Lord Bradford is an insurer at the office, and that account was brought in on 16th Oct.—there was a payment of Lord Brad<lb></lb>ford's on 16th—this is the foil in the book—he gave a receipt to each party—here is one receipt, and of course he gave a receipt to Lord Bradford—the effect of leaving a counterfoil in blank would at once have discovered that the money had been paid—he has entered a transaction of the 16th on the counterfoil of the 12th, because every receipt cut out must have 8 counterfoil—the prisoner continued in the service till 7th Feb.—I had no notion of hit being about to leave—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was received either on 8th or 9th Feb.—it is the prisoner's handwriting—this other letter is his writing—he never came back after the receipt of these letters.</p>

On Tuesday night last, about twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Little Ebury-street, Pimlico, at his own door, No. 8—I asked if his name was Demden—he said, "Yes"—I told him I was a policeman, he must consider himself in my custody for presenting a forged check for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi> at the Union Bank—he said, yes, he did present one, but was not aware it was forged, and that it was sent to him by a person named Arnold—I said, "Have you the check in your possession?"—he said, "No; but I have the letter: I met Arnold against the Egyptian-Hall, Piccadilly, and gave him the check back, and we had no conversation"—I searched the prisoner at the station, and found this letter in his pocket—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Dear Demden, have the kindness to present this for payment, and meet me with produce at Davis's, this evening; we will have a cigar together. I have an appointment for the whole afternoon, and cannot attend to it my<lb></lb>self. G. Arnold. Directed,—Demden, NO. 8, New-street, Spring-gardens, Charing-cross.")—I found several memorandums upon the prisoner—I found the piece of paper produced, upon the table in Lord Abinger's library, at Spring-gardens, not in the prisoner's lodgings—I have ascertained that he had permission to go to Lord Abinger's library—I did not show the prisoner the paper—nothing passed as to who Arnold was—I have inquired at No. 3 and at No. 8 Walcot-square for him, and have not found him—I found seventeen duplicates at the prisoner's lodging.</p>

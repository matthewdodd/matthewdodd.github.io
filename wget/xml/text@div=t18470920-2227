                  </hi> I am the wife of George Hat Clarke—we keep an eating-house and coffee-room. On Monday morning, the 6th of Sept., I was in my shop at Woolwich—I heard a noise in a small room near the street door, looked into it, and saw the prisoner—I asked what he wanted—he said a cup of tea—I told him it was not his place to go there, and accused him of talking something—there had been a bead purse on the table, with 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I shut the door and called my husband—before he came the prisoner dropped a silk handkerchief, which I had left in the cradle behind the door—my husband came—the prisoner said he had not got anything, but afterwards pulled the bag and money out of his right-hand pocket, and put them on the counter.</p>

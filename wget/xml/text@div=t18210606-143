            . I am a gold and silver refiner, and live in Well-street, Oxford-road. On the 19th of April, about eleven o'clock in the morning, some gold was shown to me, as having been brought by somebody; the prisoner and his mother called about it on a Sunday, seven or eight days after, and said, they come to fetch the money or gold which had been left, the mother claimed it as her's; I told her to leave her address, and if all was right, I would send my foreman with the money; she gave her address, No. 4, Smith-street, Northampton-square; I sent round to the trade, and saw Mr. Dugard a day or two after, he claimed it; I did not see either of them again, till the examination; I had asked the prisoner, where he lived, he said at Morris and Fields, gold chasers, St. John's-lane, I sent to them about it.</p>

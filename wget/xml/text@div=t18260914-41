On Tuesday, the 27th of June, I went to bed' about eleven o'clock; I was the last person up, and fastened every place secure; I fastened the window in the shop door; I was alarmed by Mrs. Hudson about five o'clock in the morning; it was quite light; I came down, opened the shop door, and found the shop all in confusion- two panes of glass had been cut out of the back door of the shop, a spar cut out of the window, and the two bolts undone; they had got in that way; this shop door looks into the back yard, which leads to the workshop, and has no shutter to it; they must have got over a wall in a court into Hudson's yard, then over another wall into my yard; I found on the water-butt in the yard, a basket in a sack containing this property - the sack was not mine - the basket was in my shop the night before - it contained two hundred and twenty-eight smelling bottles, two decanters, twenty-three ink-bottles, and thirteen ounces and a half of silver, which were all packed up in different drawers in the shop when I went to bed; eight drawers were broken open; it must have taken some time to get them; they must have been in the house at least two hours; my iron chest was moved out of its place, and put on the counter ready to be taken away; the property is worth above 20l.; here is a bottle which had two or three spots of tallow grease, which was not on it the night before - I found a phosphorous box and matches coucealed among some ink bottles; the thieves must have dropped the tallow on the bottle - it laid behind the counter - they must have used a candle.</p>

            . I live next door to Heeley - my yard is the first from the court. I got up at five o'clock on this morning, and about twenty minutes past five I was at the first floor back room window, where I sleep, and saw three men in the yard, one was a red headed young man, who I knew lived in the neighbourhood; it was Haycraft - I knew him well - he was waiting in my yard - the other two were in Heeley's yard - they were strangers; I was within six yards of them, and had them in sight for a minute or a minute and a half; I looked at them particularly; I came down stairs directly without giving any alarm; I went into the street, and saw Haycraft with a pair of half boots in his hand, standing at the corner of the street; I suppose he had heard me speaking to my wife, and had got out of the yard; they had opened my yard door, which was bolted the night before; I had only got my trousers on; I ran up to finish dressing, which did not take two minutes; I looked out of window, and saw two men come out of Heeley's house - one of them was sitting on the water-butt by Heeley's wall, handing the sack to the other, who was sitting on the wall; it appeared very full and heavy; I believe them to be the same two men as I saw before; Morgan was the one who sat on the wall handing the sack to the other; I am certain of him; by that time Haycraft had returned into the yard; I ran down stairs again; I sent my wife to alarm Heeley; I gave an alarm, and they all three ran off immediately; I did not pursue, but went to the yard door; I found Morgan in the watch-house half an hour afterwards; he was in the same dress, and I am positive of his person; I saw Haycraft in prison eight days afterwards, and am positive he is the man.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 28th of June, about half-past five o'clock, I was coming off duty at White Conduit-house, and on Clerkenwell-green I saw the two prisoners with another man, without shoes - they were walking sharply, and about three minutes walk from Saffron-hill; I saw the one who escaped with his hand in his pocket, and said to Loadsman, "We will follow these men, there is something wrong;" they were all three in company - they turned down a court - we followed them into Turnmill-street, got before them and desired them to stop; they immediately buttoned up their coats, and began to shew resistance, and threatened to strike us; Haycraft and the one not taken ran; I followed the one who escaped, and lost him - he saw us close behind him, put his hand into his pocket, and threw out this sugar basin over a wall; I got over and fetched it; I am sure he was in company with the prisoners; I ran back, and assisted in securing Morgan, who was taken on the spot.</p>

            . I am an officer of Clerkenwell. I was with Pottinger - his statement his correct - the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140031"></xptr>soners were in company with the other man; I had a dreadful struggle to take Morgan when we went before to stop them; Haycraft and another ran - I seized Morgan - he attempted to resist; I drew my sword-stick on him - he snatched it out of my hand, and made a blow at me - I warded it off - he threw it away and ran; I forced him into a little wicket, and caught him by shutting a gate upon him - we were twenty minutes fighting; Haycraft was apprehended afterwards; I am sure of him, and that they were all three in company.</p>
               <p>MORGAN'S Defence. Two men were going on before me - the officer came and told me to stop, saying he wished to search me, as he did not like the looks of the two persons before; I stopped to be searched - the other two ran off; I crossed the road, and he pulled out his sword, and said if I did not stand he would run me through.</p>
               <p>HAYCRAFT'S Defence. I never saw this prisoner before.</p>

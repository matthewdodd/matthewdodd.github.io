It appeared the Prisoner made himself acquainted with a young Gentleman, a Clerk in the Admiralty-Office, and was concerned with him in Busines of that Office, after a lawful Manner, for about a Year, when he persuaded him, having first suddled him, and after many Repolses , to copy out an Order of his drawing up, which was conformable to those of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, for taking off and R's, and then burnt his Original, and engag'd him to sign it with 3 of the Commissioners Names, by Virtue of which he received about 40 l, that had been due to the said Elisha Johns but for the said R's, by which it was forfeited to the Crown.

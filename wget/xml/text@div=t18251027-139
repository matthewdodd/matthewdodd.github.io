            . On the 5th of October I went, by Mr. Hoskins' order, with a writing, a dressing-case, and bill of parcels, to take to Craggs and Yates, No 205, Upper Thames-street; I was not to leave them without the money. I got there at the time appointed - saw the prisoner Grey, and asked him if Mr. Yates was within - he said he was not, and asked what I had got there - if it was a portable writing-desk and dressing-case, for Mr. Yates; I said "Yes, Sir;" he then took a letter out and said "I have just received this note from Mr. Yates, saying he will not be here this evening, nor before eleven o'clock in the morning;" he told me to leave the goods - that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270060"></xptr>they would be perfectly safe, and to call at eleven o'clock in the morning, and I should get my money. Johnson then came in at the same door as I did, and asked if Mr. Yates was within; Grey said he had just received this note, saying he would not be there till eleven o'clock in the morning. Johnson turned round and asked me if I had brought those goods for Mr. Yates; I said I had; he said if I left them they would be perfectly safe; I made no answer but left them, as they said they would be safe, and seeing other goods there I thought they would be safe. Johnson and I came out together, and went up Thames-street; he went up a turning and I returned to the counting-house, having brought two bags away which I took them in - I returned to put them over the goods, to prevent them being scratched; I saw Grey and asked if I might cover them; he said "Certainly, it is a pity they should be scratched;" I covered them up, and went home. Mr. Hoskins blamed me for leaving them without the money, and sent me the same evening to make inquiry about them, and next morning at 11 o'clock I went again. Mrs. Lodge opened the door - I waited an hour and a half but saw neither of the prisoners - nobody came while I was there - my goods were gone but the bags were left; in the counting-house, on the ground floor, I saw a large account book on the desk; "Craggs and Co." was written on the door - I never saw them again till they were apprehended, and have never got goods or money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The appearance of respectability induced you to leave the goods? A. Yey; their saying the money would be safe. I did not go there after the next day. Gray asked if I had a writing-desk and dressing-case for Mr. Yates.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Rochford, pawnbroker, Jermyn-street, St. James's. On the 5th of October, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, Yates and Johnson brought this dressing-case and desk to pawn, with other property, and asked a larger amount than I choose to give - I at last lent 3 l. on the desk, and 3 l. on the dressing-case, in the name of Yates, Watling-street - they were both together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not said at the time that it was Yates' property? A. The transaction was with him - I knew him before. Johnson observed that he thought Yates had paid a great price for it, and asked me the value of it, whether he said he had paid, or was to pay, I cannot recollect. Yates had pawned things before, and redeemed them.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How many times has he pawned goods at your house within the last six months? A. Not above once - perhaps within the last year he has been six times at my house; he once brought some knives - I did not know where he lived, only by the address he gave me.</p>

            . I am the wife of Joseph Lodge; we have lived at No. 205, Upper Thames-street three years - I let the counting-house to Yates; he came on the 5th of August: he was absent fourteen days; Craggs and Co, was written on the door; the other two prisoners came backwards and forward sometimes every other day, and sometimes every day - they never stopped long. There are two ways of getting out of the counting-house - one leads into a court, and the other into the street. I have seen goods brought there several times, but do not know what became of them. Gray was very frequently there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the name of Craggs and and Yates put up? A. No; Craggs and Co.; it is on the door now.</p>
               <p>YATES, in a long address to the Court, denied having purchased the goods with a fraudulent intention, but in the regular course of business, with a bill of parcels - that Johnson was a considerable creditor of his - the purport of his frequent visits was to obtain money from him; and Gray was his clerk, and totally ignorant of the affair.</p>

The bill was made out to Yates only; I kept the receipt.</p>

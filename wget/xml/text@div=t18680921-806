                  </hi>. I am a police constable attached to the Post Office, and have been for seven years—I have been in the Metropolitan force twenty years—in consequence of directions Smee and myself watched the inland department—on the evening of the 3rd September, about 6.20, I placed myself in such a position as to command a view of the stamping—tables—I saw the prisoner standing at one of the tables—I saw a small picket in front of him oh the table, which he took in his left hand—he then turned his head round, and as he turned it back he put his left hand into the left side of the skirt of his coat—he turned his head to the right, as if looking round the office. I saw no more of the packet after he put his hand in—I am sure he did not put it back on the table—I saw his hand come from under his coat, without the packet—shortly after that Smee came up—I then saw the prisoner come across from his own table to another one opposite—he then had a slip of paper in his left hand—while he was at the second table he took up two or three packets in his hand, one by one, at if he was weighing them, which he put down again—he then took up another, and put it in his left hand, under the slip of paper, and turned to the stamping-table where he was at first—he carried the packet till he got to the table—he stood there a few seconds talking to someone—he then put his right hand up towards the paper, which was in his left hand, and with the left hand put the packet in the left-hand side of the skirt of his coat—Smee then went round into the office, and took him into a private room—I went into the superintendent's private room about five minutes after, and saw on the table two packets—this was one of the packets, addreesed to Miss Rosenbrock—these two packets resemble the ones I saw him take—at the time he went to the second stamping-table there was no one there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable attached to the General Post<lb></lb>Office, and have been so for about fourteen years—on the evening of the 3rd September I joined Rumbold, and he made a communication to me—I could see the stamping tables from where we were—I saw the prisoner there stamping letters on the right side of the office—after he had finished stamp<lb></lb>ing the letters he had before him, he walked across to the tables in the centre of the office, where the packets were lying—he had a small piece of paper in his hand—he took a pen from behind his ear, as if he was going to write something—he took up two packets, and put them down again, and then took up a third, which is the one produced—he felt it as if he were feeling the weight of it—he then placed it in his left hand, under the piece of paper he had in that hand, and walked back to his own stamping table—he spoke to</p>

               <p>someone for a few seconds, and then took the paper from his left hand into the right, and dropped it down between the coat and the lining, and when he took his hand out there was no packet in it—I went up to him and told him I wished to speak to him in a private room—I then took him into Mr. Pawley's, the superintendent's office—I said, "I have reason to believe that this man has got something in his pocket which does not belong to him"—the prisoner said, "No, I have not, that I know of; if I have, it must have fallen there when I was collecting packets"—Mr. Pawley said, "You are not collecting any packets, your duty is a stamper"—the prisoner then said something I could not hear—I said, "Well, then, will you allow me to search you"—I searched him in Mr. Pawley's presence, and in the lining of the coat, between the lining and the cloth, I found these two packets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the coat—the pockets are outside—the lining is torn on both sides—I said, "How do you account for these being in your possession?"—he replied, "I don't know, unless they must have fallen in when I was col<lb></lb>lecting packets"—Mr. Pawley said, "Why, you had no business to collect any pockets, your duty is as a stamper, the packets would not pass through your hands, in any way, in the office"—he was then taken into custody—I afterwards saw the packets opened, one contained a pair of stone ear-drops, and the other a needle-case—there was nothing else in the lining but the two packets—the prisoner could not see us from where we were.</p>

His first duty would be stamping—Mr. Martin would not tell him to go and sort packets—there was no ink on the pri<lb></lb>soner's table, but there was on the other—I am in the room the whole time—I go on at 3 o'clock, and come away at 8 o'clock—I was in my own room when the prisoner was brought in—I saw Smee take the packets out of his pocket, and he said, "They must have fallen in."</p>

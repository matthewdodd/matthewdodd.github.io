               <p>Q. They took a cottage of you? - A. Yes, about a fortnight after last Lady-day.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a cottage is it? - A. One room.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it elevated from the ground? - A. Yes, it consists of one room and a cellar underneath it; there are four windows, only one was stopped up by the prisoner and one door to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Towards Christmas last did you observe any thing about this cottage? - A. The Saturday before Christmas day I was walking in my garden, near the window that looks into my premises, and I saw him cutting white metal in the form of sixpences. On the 19th of January I was listening at the window and heard the prisoner at work; he was almost ready to go out, which he usually did every evening; he used to be at home at work all day and went out in the evening; I heard the prisoner count forty-one, what he did not say; I heard him say he thought some were not very passable; a young woman in the room answered she would pass them; I used to see this person, whom I call a young woman, coming there every evening, and in the evening the prisoners and this young woman used to take a walk, and sometimes they were out all night, that I learned from the children.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you yourself seen that young woman with the prisoner walking out of an evening? - A. I have seen them go out of an evening, and the woman at the bar with him.</p>
               <p>Q. That woman at the bar is the wife of the prisoner? - A. I believe she is, she passes as such.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing more before you gave the information? - A. The instant I heard him count forty-one I thought it was near the time he usually went out in an evening; I went down to Marlborough-street and gave the information, I then went with three officers to the house; they are here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a dyer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The man prisoner took this little house of you: what distance is your house from that? - A. It may be three or four hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there many houses there? - A. Yes, there are a continuation of buildings in the row that comes from Gloucester-street, leading to Portman-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these people paid you any rent? - A. I received one pound from them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. I cannot particularly call that to my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been a good deal in arrears for rent to you? - A. There was half a year's rent due.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him notice to quit? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any quarrel with him about it? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some rent due to you? - A. There was half a year's due.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. The first you observed of this was before Christmas; was there any body in company with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A. In the evening, about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were looking through the window where there was a light? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not blinds against this window? - A. There was a child's coat, with holes in it, which hung up at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there were window-shutters for security? - A. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms are there in the house? - A. One room; the room under it is uninhabitable.</p>
               <p>Q. How many feet from the ground may the room be that they inhabited? - A. Six feet.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not convey a ladder there to look in at the window? - A. There is always a ladder of my own against the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you climbed up the ladder to look into this window? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner must have known of the ladder, it being always there? - A. I removed it if I wanted it, else it remained there; it was not on his premises.</p>
               <p>Q. It was against his house? - A. It was in my premises, in a garden that I keep myself; the ladder was in my garden that comes close to the back of the house; it was standing close to the side of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked through the window, notwithstanding the coat was against the window? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first communicate what you had first seen to any body? - A. I never communicated that to any body.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Christmas was it that you communicated what you had seen to the officer? - A. On Saturday the 19th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you suffered a fortnight or three weeks to elapse before you communicated it at the office? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no quarrel with the man before you went to the office? - A. I never had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. The ladder is at the bottom of your garden? - A. Yes; there is a little place of my own, and the ladder leans against it.</p>
               <p>Q. The bottom of the ladder is fixed on your premises? - A. Yes; and leans against a place of my own, by the side of the prisoner's house.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are a Police-officer of Marlborough-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the house of the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it? - A. On the 19th of January, about half past seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How many officers went with you? - A. Petherick, Lovett, Warren, and Hillier, the landlord of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it must be dark at that time? - A. Very dark and wet.</p>
               <p>Q. No advantage of lamps at the back of the garden? - A. No, it was quite dark, and no lamps in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me, when you came to the house, how you placed yourselves? - A. When we came near the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200071"></xptr>I left the other officers and went with Hillier, who was to shew me the way.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the house, did you see or hear any thing? - A. I went to the back of the house, there was a ladder placed against it; I went up the ladder to the window, which had a cloth or coat hanging before it, there was no shutter, only this thing in the inside, this was the only blind to hinder me from seeing into the room; I heard a noise of rubbing or filing, which I conceived to be so at that time, and I saw a shade of an arm passing backwards and forwards, I waited there till I was satisfied; I had a warrant to apprehend the man at the bar, I told my brother officers what I had seen; we went altogether to the house, I desired Petherick to go to the back of the house to watch there, while we attempted to force the door of the house; the first time we put our shoulders against the door and pushed it the woman screamed out, and the man jumped up, and cried out, who is there? the woman cried out, fetch the pistol; the man came immediately to the door, we kept still trying to force the door, we had forced it almost open, so that we could put our arms in; the man prisoner at the bar then said, he would blow our brains out if we attempted to come in at the door, he was standing with the pistol in his hand at the door; when we found we could not force the door, we took our cutlasses and cut the frame of the window away at the side of the door; he came to the window, and said, he would shoot any of us that came in; Lovett said, he might shoot if he liked, he could only kill one; I heard Petherick crying out at the back of the house, that if any body offered to come out of the window at the back of the house he would shoot them; I ran round to Petherick, and saw the window was open, I thought I could get easier admission there; I got on Petherick's shoulder, and got in at the window, and before I had got in at the window, the prisoner had fired his pistol through the front window where we had cut away the frame from the sash.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand he did it by the desire of somebody? - A. He fired it off without any intention of injuring any of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you succeed in getting into the house? - A. I got into the room immediately, where he was standing; as soon as he fired off the pistol, he stooped down and unbolted the door; I got in and seized him, and the other officers came in; I hand-cuffed him immediately, and searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. On searching his person, what did you find? - A. Five sixpences folded up in a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in a state, at that time, fit for common circulation? - A. We found one piece that was fit for circulation, and one blank, they were both loose in his pocket; these are the five that were in his pocket, folded up in that piece of paper, (produces them); they were then just as they are now.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the same pocket? - A. Yes, altogether; only five were folded up, and these two were loose.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing else on his person? - A. In what state were his hands? - A. I did not observe any particular mark on them, his face and hands were dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the woman? - A. Lovett searched the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what more you observed yourself? - A. The woman prisoner desired one of the children to pick up his hat that was laying on the ground; I observed a great number of blanks lying on the floor, I took the prisoner's hat and shook it, and in his hat I found these two other blanks, I did not pick up the blanks; I said to my brother officers, take care of the prisoners; and then, after all was right, and the prisoners secured, I searched the room, and found a small box of tools; and as soon as I began to search it, I found this bit of scouring-paper, and that blank lying on it, upon the tools, and in the box I found these tools: there are two punches, an awl, a piece of cork, and two pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these tools nearly altogether, or spread about the room? - A. They were all in a little open box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing more? - A. A pair of pliers, a file, and some more scouring-paper that had been a little used; the file had metal in its teeth as it has now; I found a little bag, and two pens, a small hammer, a dirty cloth, and some old gloves; and in the little box I found something, but I do not know what it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass before your eyes? - A. I saw Lovett search the woman, but nothing particular passed then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it you, or any of the other officers, that observed the woman throwing any thing out of the window? - A. That was Petherick.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it you that went in company with Petherick to the house of the prisoner the next day? - A. Yes; we went to make a further search.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find then? - A. I found under the stairs, under some tiles concealed, a bottle of aqua-fortis; the tiles were placed shelving against the wall, and between the tiles and the wall there was a vacancy, and there the bottle was put, and a little pot with blacking and a brush in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you tried it, so as to know that it is aqua-fortis? - A. It is burning stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. You were enabled to discover this bottle by the means of one of the prisoner's children? - A. I was; and I brought it to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You have already told us, that at the time you went there it was dark? - A. Quite dark.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not surprized at a person presenting a pistol at the time you went? - A. No, I knew he would.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give notice that you were Police-officers? - A. If we had told them that, they might have concealed what we found; we thought of bursting the door upon them; Lovett and Petherick told me what we were to expect.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not, at that time, find any aqua-fortis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came before the Magistrate, you were told it would not do very well without that? - A. I was so informed, and I went again.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the aquafortis outside of the house, under the stairs that led to the room, which is open to the yard or garden at least? - A. It is a little place that I could just get into.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an officer belonging to Marlborough-street? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get into the house? - A. I did; I found three bad sixpences just by the man prisoner, as he sat in the chair, upon the floor, they seemed to be in three different states: one is more ready for circulation than the other, there is one that is fit, or very near fit, for circulation, I am not competent judge enough to say which.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. It is not such a one as you would take? - A. I might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did you go with Foy the next day? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that you found the aqua-fortis? - A. Under the stairs, placed under some pan-tiles, there I discovered that bottle of aqua-fortis, and a little bottle of blacking; I put it to my tongue and tasted it, it was of a saltish nature.</p>

             sworn. - I went with the other officers, I know no more than they do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you examine the hands of the prisoner? - A. I did not, I only saw they were dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that none of you examined to see whether there were marks of aqua-forts on his hands? - A. I do; it was very dark, and we were busy; I did not observe any thing particular on his hands.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You, I believe, have skill enough to give us an account of these different instruments? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all, look at the scissars? - A. The blanks appear to have been cut out of a plate by these scissars.</p>
               <p>Q. The scissars are a fit instrument for that purpose? - A. They are; in this paper appear to be some clippings, which they call sissel; and here are several blanks which appear to have been just cut out, and these scissars would effect that purpose; the pliers would be necessary to hold the blanks during the process of filing, and preparing it for colour.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Does not that mark the money? - A. That would be taken off afterwards; here are two files which would be used in filing the surface and the edge; the teeth of one of the files are very large, and the other very fine, and is generally called a float; the sand-paper would be used to take out the scratches of the file; it appears to have been used; the cork would be used to take out the scratches of the sand-paper, and give it a complete polish; the sand-paper follows the file, and the cork follows the sand-paper. The blank in that state, after having gone through the process, would be fit for colouring.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any blanks there that have been coloured? - A. Here are several that have gone through that process, fit to be coloured.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any coloured? - A. Here is one in the paper which is complete and fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the five that Foy found? - A. These five are also fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. You will be so good as to inform the Jury the use of the aqua-fortis? - A. After the blank is in this state it is put into pickle; the aqua-fortis being too strong of itself, it is lowered with a little water; the action of the aqua-fortis is to produce the silver upon the surface, all metal having a portion of silver in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Is that aquafortis? - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Explain the use of the cream of tartar? - A. After they are taken out of the pickle it is usual to boil them with an equal quantity of salt and cream of tartar, which brings the colour more to the surface and cements it; after having been boiled, they generally scour them with cream of tartar and throw them into cold water, and dry them with a linen cloth; the blacking is the only thing which takes off the brightness.</p>
               <p>Q. All the articles there found are the instruments necessary? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And would coin one of these sixpences? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Should they not be put into bran and dried over a fire? - A. Where there is a large quantity it dries them quicker than a linen cloth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Look at those five again? - A. These five appear to be perfectly finished.</p>
               <p>- FRANKLIN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. Look at those pieces? - A. They were never coined at the Mint; they are all counterfeited.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You would not take them for sixpences? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoners left their defence to their Counsel.</p>

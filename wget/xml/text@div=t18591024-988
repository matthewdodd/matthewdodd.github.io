                  </hi>. I was fourteen years old last June—I was in the service of Mr. Barrett, a pawnbroker in St. Giles's—I received my wages 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 29th September, and went to Woolwich to look for a place—I came up to London in the evening, and went to a coffee-shop in the London-road, kept by Mrs. Turner, I believe—the prisoner Flack and another man slept in the same room with me—we had separate beds—I got up about ten o'clock in the morning, counted my money, and there was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—Flack saw me count it, but he pretended to be asleep at the time—after-wards when we were getting up he said, "You want your hair cut very badly"—I said, "I will not have it cut"—I afterwards left the coffee-shop with him—I said that I was going towards Baker-street—he said that he would show me the way if I went with him—I did so, and we met Brown—Flack said something to him, but I did not hear what—Brown went into a house and beckoned to Flack, who asked me to go in—I told him I would rather not—I was just on the door-step, and Flack pulled me in and shut the door—I went into a front room; the door leads into it—the four prisoners were there, and I believe they all assisted in throwing me down at the foot of the bedstead—some of them held my legs, one held my throat, and held his hand over my mouth, and the other searched my pockets—they had their hands over my eyes so that I could not see which, but one held my legs—they took from me my purse with 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it, and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence from my waistcoat pocket; all the money I had—Flack, Brown, and Dimmock then went out at the back door, and Bolton went on talking to me, and just as I got up, the front door opened and some others came in who asked me what was the matter—I did not tell them, because one of the women was with them, and she knew—I asked them to let me go—they said that they would in a few minutes, and in about five minutes they let me go out, and I went for a policeman and got one in five minutes, and we went back—I did not know the street or the house before, but when I went with the policeman I knew the room again by the furniture and by a picture hanging over the mantelpiece, of half of a man and half of a gull—I know Bolton because she is very much darker than the others, and her hair is so dark—she had a light spotted frock on—she had the same frock on when I went back—I am certain of Flack and of Brown also; I noticed that his trowsers were patched rather—I am also certain of Dimmock—the policeman took the two women at the house—I went with them to a beer-shop, saw some persons sitting there together, and pointed out Flack and Brown to the policeman.</p>

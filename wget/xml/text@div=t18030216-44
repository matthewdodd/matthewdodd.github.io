On the 20th of January I found one of the boxes standing upright, and one was turned down on one side; I left both standing upright; there were fourteen pieces missing, and some broke; I made a memorandum at the time of what was remaining.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you found these things, was there any conversation between you and the prisoner? - A. I told him, I came to seek for china; he said, he had got none, he had some Staffordshire ware, which he shewed me, in a corner cupboard; I desired Harding, the constable, who was with me, to get on a chair, and reach me a cup which I saw on the top of the cupboard; he gave it me down, and I said, search for more, this is the china I want; and he gave me down the different pieces; I had a pattern from the Custom-house warehouse, it matched that pattern; I told him, he must go along with me to the Custom-house; he said, with all his heart; he said, he had bought the china of Parsons, and gave him half a pint of gin for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.This china was on the top of the cupboard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body going into the room might see it?- A. Yes, if they went to that corner; the cupboard is in a corner behind a bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that a part of the china that belongs to you? - A. It appears so to me from the pattern and the number of pieces; I believe this to be the number that belongs to the box, it was assigned to me by my son, from India.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp Q. Do you mean to swear to china? - A. I cannot swear to it, I think it is the pattern, and the same china, it corresponds in every respect with that left in the box.</p>

             sworn. - I am an Excise watchman; the prisoner was an Excise watchman; I was on the watch with the prisoner in Sam's-passage, in the latter end of November, I was at the upper end, and the prisoner at the lower end; I cannot recollect the day of the month or the day of the week, it was between the 25th of November and the 1st of December; Abijan Penny came to me between two and three o'clock in the morning, and asked me to lend him my stick, it is a stick with a hook; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he told me, he would tell me presently; I lent him my stick, and a short time after, he shewed me some china.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he do with the stick? - A. He stooped down towards the warehouse window where the china was, he tied my stick to another stick which he had, it was a cellar window, I saw him put the sticks between the bars, I did not see him take any china out; I heard some china rattle, and heard some make a noise, as if breaking. A few minutes after, the prisoner shewed me some china cups and saucers, the cups had handles, they appeared like coffee cups, being dark, I could not observe the pattern; he told me, he had got it out of the warehouse, and pointed towards the cellar. I had a heavy charge of wine; he was relieved in the morning before me; when he was relieved, he told me he had got the china in his great-coat pocket, and pointed to his left side; he told me, he was going to Billingsgate, there was a fish cart going his way home, to Holborn, and he would take it home in that cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you come here in custody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give any account of this? - A. A few days after, when Grigg came into the passage, he belongs to the Excise watch; we got into conversation, and I mentioned about the china.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you forbear to mention it, because you expected yourself to be taken up, if it was known, and tried for it? - A. Yes, that was the reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give any intelligence of it till<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160037"></xptr>you thought he would be taken up, and then you would be taken up, and tried for it? - A. No.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Roebuck public-house in Cannon-street-road. On Saturday, the 8th of January, a little before six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my house—in consequence of sus<lb></lb>picions I entertained I watched him—I served him with half-a-pint of beer—he took it into the tap-room, and about two or three minutes after, I saw him hiding two pint pots under his smock-frock—he then walked out of the tap-room—as he was coming out I went up, took hold of him and said, "I have caught you at last"—he immediately drew forth the two pint pots, and said if I would forgive him, and allow him go at large, he would bring the others back which he had taken—one of the pint pots which he produced is my own, and the other was in my charge.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody by Mr. Eltof in his house, charged with stealing these two pint pots, which I produce—he said he was very sorry, and if Mr. Eltof would let him go, he would go and fetch back the others that he bad stolen.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the prosecutor's house on Saturday even<lb></lb>ing, the 8th of January, standing at the bar—as the prisoner was leaving the bar, Mr. Eltof touched him on the shoulder, and charged him with stealing part of his property—he instantly pulled two pint pots from under his smock-frock, put them down, and begged hard for forgiveness—Mr. Eltof accused him of taking his property previously, and the prisoner said if he would forgive him he would restore him the other property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not he say, "If I let you go, will you bring the others back?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I assure you the landlord did say so; and being distracted and broken-hearted, and hardly knowing what I was about, I said, "Yes, in the name of G—let me go." I have been many years in the East India Company's service, and have habituated myself to eating opium, having suffered much from weakness. Whenever I am out of work and low-spirited, I take more than usual, which causes quite an aberration of mind, so that I do not know what I am doing. I was in the act of fetching my own beer, and took these two pots in my hand, seeing them lying there. I was going to place them on the bar, which I was frequently in the habit of doing, when the landlord seized me by the collar.</p>

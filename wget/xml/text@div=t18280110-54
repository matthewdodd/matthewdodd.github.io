The prisoner came to assist my servant on Christmas day; I had known her for about nine months, by visiting her master. About twelve o'clock at night, when she was gone, we missed a table-spoon, a desert-spoon, and a silver handled knife; I sent a person for her the next day - she came, and denied any knowledge of them; I told her, if she would give up the property there should be no more come of it: she was searched, but I was not present - the desertspoon and knife were produced, but she said she knew nothing of the other spoon; I did not believe it, and gave charge of her. The other spoon was found in my coat pocket a day or two afterwards.</p>

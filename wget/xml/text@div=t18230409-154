            . I am watchman of St. Andrews. On the morning of the 14th of March, about three o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Shoe-lane, with a bundle under his arm; I asked him what he had got, he said it was his own property; I took him to the watch-house and found it was 39 lbs. of gutter lead; I went to where he said he lodged, and found he had left there some time; I went to Red Lion-yard, about ten o'clock in the morning, and found more lead lying there; I compared it, and it corresponded exactly, with about 27 lbs. in the yard; it appeared to me to have come off the roof,</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house by Batton with the lead; I questioned him, he said he found it in the neighbourhood of Highgate; I said it was an unusual hour; he said he was looking for work, which made him so late, it was tied in a neck handkerchief, and he had no handkerchief on, I found a knife on him which appeared to have recently cut lead, it was fresh broken, the edges of the lead were quite bright; I saw it matched with what was left, in the yard it corresponded.</p>

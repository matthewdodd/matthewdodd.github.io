                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector R</hi>). On 14th June, shortly after 10 o'clock p.m., I was on duty in Seven Dials with Roots and Andrews, and saw the prisoners and another man leave the Grapes public-house and go through Covent Garden into the Strand—the man not in custody and Crow entered the Vaudeville Restaurant—I looked through the glass door and saw Crow pass a half-crown in payment for some drink—they came out and joined Hall, and went through a bye-lane down a court to the Gaiety Restaurant—Crow went in, the man not in custody went round the corner, and Hall remained outside—I entered by another door, and heard Crow call for a glass of bitter and tender a half-crown—I went to the door and gave instructions to the officers outside, and as I returned, Crow passed out—I followed him, seized him, and said "I shall take you for passing coun<lb></lb>terfeit coin in the house"—he said "I have not been in here"—I took him inside and said to the barmaid "This man has given you a bad half-crown"—she said "He has not, I have not taken a bad half-crown"—I said "I saw him give it to you"—she said "He gave me a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">bit</hi>"—I said "You look in your till and see if you have not a bad half-crown"—she looked, and said "There is only one half-crown here, and that is bad; I made a mistake, he did give me a bad half-crown, and it was a gentleman standing by the side of him who gave me the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">bit</hi>"—a gentleman there said "He gave you a half-crown, I saw him"—I don't remember that Crow said anything to that—I sent two officers to the station with him, and went in search of Hall—we found him in the Wellington public-house, drinking out of a pewter pot—Andrews and I got hold of him, and I said "We shall take you in custody for being concerned in passing counterfeit coin"—he said "You hare made a mistake"—we took him to the station, and Andrews searched him, and took from his pocket these eight counterfeit half-crowns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) wrapped up separately, with paper between each—I found on Crow</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> No bad money was found on Crow—I never at any time told Mr. Romano that Crow was the man who had passed the bad half-crown in his restaurant—I know that he has a doubt whether Crow is the man—he saw Crow at the station, and he could not identify him—I will not swear whether Crow was placed with others—Crow was standing up in the inspector's room—I cannot say positively whether I told Mr. Romano that that was the man I had in my charge who had passed the bad half-crown at the Vaudeville, but, if I did, it was certainly not till after Mr. Romano had said that he was not the man—I should not have said it before, because It would not have been just to the prisoner—Crow was not standing alone; Hall was there, and several others—I have made enquiries about Crow, and find that he was in the service of Mr. Whitehouse, the optician, of Coventry Street.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Spencer, a pawnbroker, in Denmark-street: this spoon was brought to me by a woman who lives in some of the back streets, in St. Giles's; she said, it was a lodger's of hers: it being broke, I stopt it, suspecting it not honestly come by; she went and fetched the prisoner, who said it was her property. I asked her how she came by it? she said, she found it at Charing-Cross, just in the condition it is in, and that she said she would say it to the last. I said I should advertise it; I gave it to the constable, and he carried it to Justice Welch's; he ordered him to fetch the woman: she stood in what she had said. Mr. Welch had it advertised; how he got information who was the owner, I can give no account of, any farther than hearsay.</p>

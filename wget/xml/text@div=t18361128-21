                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Fleet-street. The prisoner was my porter—on the 29th of October, I sent him to Mr. Oliver with a coat and waistcoat, and a bill amounting to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., with directions to receive it if Mr. Oliver paid it—he has never paid it to me—about a fort<lb></lb>night after another porter was sent for the money, and that caused inquiry.</p>

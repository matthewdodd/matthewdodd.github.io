               <p>On the 22d of July, in the evening, a little after six o'clock, I took a walk out in <placeName id="t17790915-32-crimeloc161">Mary-le-bonne fields</placeName>

I staid there about three quarters of an hour. The prisoners went out first. It being fair, I thought I would take a walk as far as a house called the Jews-harp. There is a narrow passage that goes into the fields; as I was going through that passage Bristow laid hold of my arm, and pulled me into a necessary belonging to the Queen's-head and Artichoke, and asked me what money I had in my pocket. I said I had only a few halfpence. Bristow put her hand part of the way into my waistcoat-pocket. I took hold of the money on the outside of my pocket, and begged to have the privilege of making them a present of it myself. I then took out my money, and put it in my mouth.</p>
               <p>You refused to give her the halfpence? - Yes; then Bridgwater lifted up her fist, and began beating me about. I said what is the matter; let me out; I do not know you; I never saw you to my knowledge. No, blast him, says the other, bolt the door. They bolted the door, and Bridgwater kept her back against it, and got my head beside her belly. I had put my watch in my waistcoat pocket for fear of losing of it. They let my breeches down behind, and then they left me. As soon as they were gone I missed my watch. I went into the fields after them, and begged and prayed of them to give me my watch; they danced and capered about the fields, and would not give it me. I went and got assistance, and had them taken up. When they were brought to the watch-house, Bridgwater said to me, God bless you, Sir, I take you to be an honest man, but I do not know whether you are a man or a woman.</p>
               <p>She might have known that? - Yes; it was against my consent.</p>
               <p>Have you found your watch? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wormald, the prosecutor, came to me, and said he had been robbed of his watch by some women, who were in the fields. Mr. Small and I went and took them. I took Bristow; she said she would go peaceably. Mr. Small came up with Bridgwater; she seemed to go peaceably with him at first, but soon after struck him on the breast. I quitted the other, and came up to her. She said, I looked something like a man, she would walk quietly with me. We had not got far before she served me in the same manner, and got quite away. I was some time before I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150032"></xptr> recovered myself. Some of Mr. Wellings's people came to my assistance, and we secured her again; four or five of us could hardly manage her. I put a pair of hand-cuffs on her with a great deal of difficulty, and she kicked and bit my arm. At last we got her to the watch-house; she then said, if I would go back with her into the field, the watch should be produced; it was then about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did she confess taking it? - No. I would not go with her by myself, but asked her to tell me where it was, or let somebody go with us, but she would not. The next day, when she was before the magistrate, she said it was bid in the necessary. A person went to look for it, but it was not found. She said she was innocent of the affair.

               <p>BRIDGWATER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at the Queen's-head and Artichoke; this man was in the skittle-ground, much in liquor. I went to draw a pail of water, and saw him go into the necessary. He came into the skittle-ground again, and said he had lost his watch, and would take up some of us for it. He struck me with a stick he had in his hand, and threw down the water. I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>BRISTOW's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at this publick-house, talking with Bridgwater. We went out, and were going by the necessary, and this gentleman pulled me in. I asked him what he wanted me to do; he said I must whip him. I went out, then he pulled me in again and this young woman, and bolted the door; he then took out his handkerchief, and tied some knots in it, and said we must whip him. I did not know what he meant; he afterwards said he had lost his watch. I never saw any thing of the watch.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. I do not see what occasion they had to unbotton your breeches to take your watch? - They are the persons that robbed me of my watch; they have made it out that I was in liquor; I was as sober as I am now. If I was on my deathbed I would say the same.</p>
               <p>Bristow says you pulled her into the necessary? - They were both there before. Bristow pulled me into the necessary. I am above sixty years old; I could not stand against these creatures. I gave four guineas for the watch thirty years ago.</p>

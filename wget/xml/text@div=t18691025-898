                  </hi>. On the night of 11th September, the prisoner came to my house, and I served him with a glass of ale—he gave me a half-crown—I tried to bend it, but could not, and put it in the till, being very busy—about a minute afterwards I went back to the till, saw that it was bad, and placed it at the back—there were no more like it—it had William the Fourth's head on it—about ten minutes afterwards the prisoner returned, and tendered another half-crown, which I bent, and told him that was the second half-crown he had tendered in ten minutes—he threw down a shilling, and said, "Don't put your hands on me; your master knows me very well—he was given in custody, with the two bad half-crowns.</p>

I was called to the Mogul Tavern, took the prisoner, and saw this bad half crown—next day I received this other half-crown from Stubbs—as soon as the prisoner got outside the bar, he struck me on the face, and kicked me on the shins, and, at the corner of Long Acre, he took something like money from his pocket, and threw it on the ground—it was too dark for me to see it, and there was a crowd—I searched him at the station, and found 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, in different pockets; but there was nothing in his right-hand pocket, from which he threw something away—I found this half-crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his cell, next morning.</p>

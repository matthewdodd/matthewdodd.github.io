                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live at 9, Prospect Place, Sydenham—on Saturday afternoon, 27th September, after leaving my own employment, I went into the Telegraph public-house, Forest Hill, to have a glass of ale with the deceased and three or four other friends—the prisoner, his brother, and a friend were there—a dispute arose between the landlord and the prisoner's friends about some wood, and about half-an-hour after I and my friends left the house—the prisoner and his friends followed us up Park Road—the prisoner's brother said to Bull, one of my friends, "Give us a light"—Bull said "I don't know whether I have got a light, I will give you a light off my cigar," and when he went to give him a light, he had no tobacco in his pipe—Bull said "You have no tobacco"—he said "Give us a piece"—Bull said "I have not got any, I don't use it"—he said "Give us a cigar, then"—Bull said "I have not got one"—he said "Give us the short end of what you have got in your mouth"—Bull said "No"—what passed between Payne and the prisoner's brother I can't say, but they began to fight, and they fell down—the deceased went to help</p>

               <p>the prisoner's brother up off of Payne, and after a minute or so, I saw him on the ground with two on the top of him—I ran across the road and helped him up—he was not much hurt—after I had helped him up, we stood for two or three minutes; the deceased stood sideways like to the prisoner, about 5 or 6 feet from the kerb—the prisoner then stepped from the kerb and struck the deceased on the chin, and he went backwards, and a carriage that was coming by went over him; he fell between the horse's hind-legs and the front wheel—I can't say whether the prisoner could see the carriage coming; he stood right on the kerb, facing across the road—I could see" the carriage coming down the road—after striking the deceased, the prisoner went away as fast as he could with his barrow, and his brother, too—I and two policeman and a man on horseback went after him and stopped him—I don't think any of them were the worse for drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, at Lewisham—on Saturday, 27th September, I was with the deceased and others at the Telegraph—when we came out there was a scuffle, the prisoner was one in it—it only lasted a minute or two—then Payne received a blow on the nose from the prisoner's brother—I can't say whether it was the prisoner that had the scuffle with the' deceased, but after the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was over they were standing talking about it—the deceased stood in the road, about 6 feet from the kerb, and facing the kerb, and I saw the prisoner rush from the path and strike him—there was a carriage passing, and as he fell the carriage was immediately on top of him, and the wheels went over him—the deceased was not standing in a fighting attitude, he stood unconcerned—he did not see the blow delivered at him, neither did he see the carriage coming—it was a deliberate blow, not a shove—there was a graze on his chin after I got him home—that could not hare been caused by the fall; he fell backwards, and I heard him groan as the wheels went over him—I helped pick him up and took him home, and was with him when he died at 7. 15 next morning—I did not see the carriage coming till it was on him—I was talking to another party; it was so near to him that it was impossible to prevent its going over him—there was not time for the coachman to pull up.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I live at Farnborough House, Sydenham—on Saturday afternoon, 27th September, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was in my carriage, drawn by two horses, passing through Forest Hill—I saw something come up against the carriage, and immediately felt a jerk—I stopped the carriage at once, and got out and found that a man had been run over—I ordered him to be taken in a cab to his own house, and I followed to see what was the result of the injury—I found that he had sustained some internal injury, the nature of which I could not determine at the time—there was no external mark—I prescribed for him, and ray assistant attended him until his death—I subsequently made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination by order of the Coroner—I found that the bowel was com<lb></lb>pletely severed in two places, and there was considerable hemorrhage in consequence—that was undoubtedly caused by the wheels going over him—there was a slight graze on the chin—I should imagine that was caused by contact with the ground—there were no marks of violence about the face—the carriage was going unusually slowly just at that time.</p>

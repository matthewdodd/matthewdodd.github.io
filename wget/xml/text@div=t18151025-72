               <p>WILLIAM RUMBLE. I am a slop seller. On the 23rd of September, at about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me, and offered to sell a jacket, a pair of trowsers, and a handkerchief; he asked thirty shillings for them. I examined them, and knew them to be part of what I had sold to some one; I did not know exactly to whom; but I knew I had not sold them to the prisoner. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250027"></xptr>aid, they were his own, and he had bought them at Plymouth. He then said, as I knew the clothes, he would tell the truth; he was selling them for another man. I told him if that was so, to leave the clothes in the shop, and fetch that man. He went out for the purpose of doing so, but never returned. In about two hours afterwards, the prosecutor came in to enquire, and then I shewed him the clothes, and described to him the person of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL MORRIS. I apprehended the prisoner, and I produce the clothes.</p>

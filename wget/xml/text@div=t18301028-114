               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you find the locks all right? A. I did not examine the locks - I found nothing to excite my suspicion; other workmen were there before me - I left nobody there on the Saturday night; this is a warehouse under repair - it belongs to Long and Son; I do not think any body lives in it - they are extensive premises; I may have left somebody behind - Long and Son's men fastened the doors; I did not see them fastened - they are labouring men; I do not know how many of them there are - the prisoner was not one of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it a warehouse alone? A. The warehouse is at the back of the dwelling-house - you must go through the house to get to it.</p>

            . I am a constable. Tapp met me in the street, and pointed to the prisoner - we went up to him; Tapp said, "Let me took at those tools?" the moment he spoke, the prisoner put them off his shoulder on to the ground - I directly took him into custody; I afterwards took him into a public-house, and asked how he became possessed of them - he said it was all right; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280055"></xptr>what he meant by that - he said he had bought them, but did not say of whom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he had stolen them, he had plenty of time to sell them? A. He put them off his shoulder when the witness asked to look at them; he had the basket on his shoulder, as workmen usually have.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did he take them off his shoulder? A. He took them leisurely off.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that on Thursday, the 30th of September, he met a man in Fleet-street, who stated that he was going to leave town, and wished to sell his tools; he appointed to meet him at the Tiger public-house, over London-bridge, where he bought the tools for 14s., and carried them home with the saw in sight.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JESSE TAPP. Q. On what day did you leave your tools safe? A. On the 2nd of October.</p>
               <p>JOHN THOMPSON. I met him with the tools on Friday, the 8th of October.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's cousin, and live in Abchurch-lane. On Saturday evening, the 2nd of October, I saw him at my house, at half-past eight o'clock - it was the Saturday before he was apprehended; he staid till half-past eleven - I let him out, and he went away; he was going to his lodging in Rosemary-lane, which is about a mile from my house - he did not tell me where he came from; I heard from other persons that he had come from the west end of the town - he bore an honest irreproachable character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has he not been in custody ever since he was committed? A. Yes - I do not know the Tiger public-house; I was never desired to go there.</p>

            . I keep an eating-house, No. 41, Rosemary-lane. The prisoner lodged with me - I remember his coming in on Saturday night, the 2nd of October, at a quarter before twelve o'clock; I saw him come in - he had no basket nor tools; I saw him go up to bed, and saw him next day five or six times - he brought no tools into my house; he did not keep any there - I understand he is a carpenter.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the Tiger public-house, on the other side of London-bridge? A. No - I was never desired to go there.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Do you know what time he came in on Sunday night? A. He did not leave my house from Saturday night till nine o'clock on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What part of the house did he live in? A. The back room; I occupy the lower part of the house - he would not pass through my room to go to his own, but no one can go out without my seeing them; they pass my room door-it is open all day; I lock the door at ten o'clock at night - I do not think even my servant could go out without my knowledge; I do not take in occasional lodgers.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOHN THOMPSON. Q. Where did you take him? A. The prosecutor met me in Tower-street, and he was stopped in Postern-row - I asked who he bought them of; he did not feel inclined to tell me, he said, it was all right - he did not attempt to escape.</p>

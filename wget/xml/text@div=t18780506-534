                  </hi>. I am a labourer and live at 137, Rotherhithe Street—on the evening of 21st April, at a few minutes past 11 o'clock, I was going along Rotherhithe Road; the two prisoners came up; Markgraf said "Please can you tell me the way to the Commercial Dock?"—I said "Yes, straight down the street"—he turned round at once and said I was a liar—they were both standing together—I said "All right, I am going home"—as I was turning off the pavement one of them took the watch out of my pocket; Eliske had it, I believe; he took it from my pocket—I was stabbed then and fell down on the ground—I did not see</p>

               <p>any knife—I believe Markgraf had hold of me when I fell down, when I was falling—I did not know that I was stabbed at the time, I afterwards found that I had a wound in the right side of my chest—Seager was just coming over the bridge at the time; he was about 3 or 4 yards from me, coming towards me; there was nobody else near—when I fell down my watch was gone—Seager came up as I was on the ground; he asked me what was the matter—the prisoners ran away; I was left on the ground—Seager followed them till I recovered—I got up and ran after them—I saw them again in a house in Silver Street, Rotherhithe—Seager gave me my watch and told me he had picked it up as he was running after them—I was quite sober—Eliske <hi rend="italic">punched</hi> me in the forehead, but it was the other man who knocked me down—the value of my watch is about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

This was on Sunday night—I had had a glass of ale before the houses shut up, only one glass all the evening, I am quite sure of that—Seager is a friend of mine—he had not been in my company during the evening; it was a very dull night, raining heavily—Rotherhithe Street is not a very light thoroughfare; there are lamps all along the street—this was a little more than a quarter of a mile from Commercial Dock—the first thing that happened was Markgraf asking me the way to the Commercial Dock—I did not turn and point to a large doorway that was painted black; that I swear—Seager came up at the time I was on the ground, I did not see him before; I won't swear he had not come up—I did not see Eliske hand Seager his lighted pipe, or a lucifer or a vesuvian—I did not hear Eliske ask Seager the way to the Commercial Dock, or hear Seager say "Go straight down the road"—Markgraf said to me "What for you tell me a lie?"—I did not say "What, you call me a liar"—Markgraf did not say "Yes I do, because you tell me a lie"—I did not thereupon strike him a violent blow under the chin, I never rose my hand—I did not knock the pipe out of his mouth—there was not a regular set-to between us, me striking him and he striking me, and both of us closing together and falling on the road—I have sworn to-day that it was Eliske who took my watch—they were both round me—I believe I said before the Magistrate that it was Markgraf who made a snatch at my watch, I said "Markgraf snatched my watch from my pocket as I was turning round to go away"—I had not got into a row and fight with them—I do not know that they are respectable men on board a German ship lying in the Commercial Dock—the captain spoke broken English before the Magistrate, I could not understand him—Markgraf can speak pretty near as plainly as I can.</p>

I am a labourer and live at 60, Lower Queen Street, Rotherhithe—an the night of 21st April I was coming down Rotherhithe Street and saw the two prisoners speaking to my friend at the corner—I have known the prosecutor about 18 months—I did not hear the prisoners say anything—the prosecutor said to me "Here, I want to speak to you"—I went to him, and he said "These two men have asked me which is the way to the Commercial Dock, you tell them"—I told Eliske, and he said "I think he tell me lie"—I told him "Straight on," and I said "Would you oblige me with a light for my pipe?" and he gave me one, and then I turned round and saw Markgraf standing out in the road with the prosecutor—I was standing with my back to them about 10 yards or a little more distant—when I</p>

               <p>turned round from getting my light from Eliske I saw Markgraf on the top of Plumpton on the ground with a knife in his right hand—then Eliske rushed from me and hit Plumpton about the hip, and I rushed to them directly, when the prisoners got up and ran away—the prose<lb></lb>cutor said "<hi rend="italic">Alf</hi>, my watch is gone"—I ran and tried to apprehend them about 20 or 30 yards—Markgraf dropped the watch in the gutter—I stopped to pick it up and they gained upon me—I ran again and saw them go round Silver Street into some house in Silver Street—I lost sight of them when they turned the corner—it was a very dull night and raining—I was close to the prisoners, I can swear to them—I gave the watch to the prosecutor—I was going to run for a constable—I saw them given in charge—I was at the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Rotherhithe—on the night of the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. st, just before midnight, I was called to the police-station and saw the prosecutor there on the floor suffering from an incised and punctured wound on the right side of the chest, about 3 inches below the arm pit—it extended down to the rib—I was able to pass my finger in and feel the rib—it then extended upwards for at least 2 inches, and probably farther, but not wishing to make it worse than it was I did not more minutely probe it—it was most certainly a dangerous wound—it had caused a very considerable amount of hæmorrhage—the whole of the side of the chest was swollen as big as my two hands from the effusion of blood into the structures, and had the stab not been turned, by the knife striking the rib, it must have penetrated the cavity of the chest and wounded the lung most severely; as it was he had lost a very con<lb></lb>siderable amount of blood and was in a very exhausted condition—this dark-handled knife would not have produced such a wound, but this other would—I say this very advisedly—I had the two knives shown to me at the time and have compared them <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi>—the wound would have been inflicted by such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">This white-handled one</hi>), a knife of this width and depth of blade, but not by such a knife as this, the blade is too short and narrow—the blow must have been delivered with very great force—a very considerable quantity of thick clothing was cut through—the wound was barely healed on 4th May—it is now quite healed.</p>

To the best of my judgment such a wound could not be caused by accident, on account of the force with which it was delivered—it was not a mere accidental scraping against—I do not think the effect would have been the same if the body came against the knife—I think it must have been delivered deliberately and with great force—that is my opinion—it is merely matter of opinion.</p>

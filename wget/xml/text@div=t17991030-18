             sworn. - On Saturday the 12th of October, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was sent for down to Fleet-market to take my son away from a parcel of pick-pockets; I saw the prisoner at the bar put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, in <placeName id="t17991030-18-crimeloc105">Fleet-market</placeName>

               <p>Q. You did not know his name? - A. No, he did not stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the handkerchief taken out of his pocket? - A. Yes; I took Stanton in my house the next morning, between two and three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Stanton before? - A. Yes; I have seen him in the market, many times, picking pockets.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know no more of it than the child unborn: Mr. Tyler said, before the Justice, that he would do all he could to get me transported, that he might get me away from his son.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Tyler.) Did you ever threaten to transport this lad? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Burdo. Tyler said nothing of the kind; he said, he could wish to send his son to sea, to keep him out of bad company; when he brought him to the watch-house, he said, he saw Stanton pick the gentleman's pocket of a handkerchief that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 8, Park-street, Dorset-square. On Saturday morning, the 11th of November, the prisoner came to my house for a lodging-room—I took him up stairs—he looked at the apartment, and I agreed to let him have it—he found fault with the ceiling, and said that it wanted whitewashing—he said as he was in the trade he would do it for half a crown and leave half of it as a deposit, I said, "Very well"—he said he should wish to come in on Monday, and he would do it that day, I said, "Very well"—he said he would come again in two or three hours, which he did, about half-past two o'clock—he brought his pail and things, and washed it—he came down to me and asked for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I gave him—I went down stairs to wash my hands and heard the street door go—that roused my suspicions—I went up stairs and asked my little girl if the man was gone, she said she did not know—I ran up stairs and looked into my drawer, and missed three sovereigns and two rings from the same drawer—it was not in the same room as he was in—I went out into the street and could not find him—I sent for the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 23, West-street, Somers-town. I am a barman, but am out of employ—I lived at the corner of Plum tree-street last—I employed the prisoner to bring my box from my mother's, No. 28, West street, and told him, when he brought it to Devonshire-street, to keep it there, as I was going to leave—when the box was brought to me I examined it, and missed five books, a picture, and sixteen pieces of coin—I had locked the box before I left it, and it was brought to me, locked—I had not lost the key, I had it with me—I afterwards saw the prisoner in Arlington-street, at a person's named Branch—I said he was a pretty fellow, to serve me in the manner he had, and told him I had missed these things—he said he could not help it—that he was going to send to his friends, and he would bring my things back—I said if he did I would forgive him, but he did not bring them back, and I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 103.) I apprehended the prisoner in Arlington-street. I charged him with stealing the books and other articles from the prosecutor's box—he said he was very sorry, but if he had time he would replace them—I took him to the station-house, and found three duplicates and a key on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and carry on business at 215, Whitecross-street, St. Luke's. On 29th Nov. the prisoner applied to me for a situation—I asked him where he had been living, and he stated with Mr. Preston, of the "Coffee-Pot," Queen-street, Ipswich, from whom I was to get his character, and as I was without a young man I engaged him for the following day, and he assisted me that day only—on the Monday following I wrote to Ipswich, and received this answer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the Wednesday; and in consequence of the character I received he came into my service on Thursday, 5th Dec—I afterwards received information from Ipswich, and kept a very sharp look out on the prisoner—on Saturday night, the 7th, about a quarter-past eight, a woman came into the shop and had goods—I did not observe what they were, but I heard the prisoner say, "11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. if you please"—I saw the woman put 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the counter—he took it up, put it into the silver compartment of the till, and counted out nine, and put them on the counter in a pile, and said to the woman, "Nine and one are ten, thank you"—there were half-crowns among the money—it was nine shilling's-worth of silver—I did not see any penny—the woman then left—I had examined the till five minutes previous, and there was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold in the gold compart<lb></lb>ment—I examined it afterwards and found the same—about ten o'clock on the Sunday morning 1 went and gave instructions to inspector Brannan, and on my return the prisoner told me the situation did not suit him, he wished to leave, the work was too hard—I asked him what sort of a shop Mr. Preston had at Ipswich, and said, "You told me you lived with him"—he said, "I did once, and I met him, and he told me he would give me a good character"—I said, "Will you tell me who the female was last night, of whom you took one shilling, and gave nine in change?"—he said he knew nothing about it—I gave him into custody—I afterwards went with</p>

               <p>Q. You are not sure the button was turned? - A. Yes, I am sure it was turned, and the backdoor, which comes into the little kitchen, was upon the latch.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure that was shut? - A. Yes, because I did it myself.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went out about five, where was your wife? - A. She went out with me, no person was left in the house, and nobody could get in without breaking the button.</p>
               <p>Q. They could turn it? - A. Not without getting over; I returned about nine o'clock, and missed the silver milk-pot, six silver tea-spoons, and a pair of sugar tongs; I went up stairs, and looked under my bed, where I put my money, that was gone, forty-one pounds in Bank-notes, that was up two pair of stairs, there was one 15l. one 10l. two 5l. and one 2l. and the rest in one pounds; I looked in my chest, and missed one blue coat, four waistcoats, thirteen shirts, and thirty handkerchiefs, then I went and gave information to Mr. Dalton, the officer of the parish.</p>
               <p>Q.Why do you accuse the prisoner? - A. He had been a servant to me six weeks; I found a key on the chopping-block, which I had lost about ten days; on the Monday morning, we went to look<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160070"></xptr>after him; we got information, that he was gone on board a Dutch vessel; we found him there; we found a ten pound note on the prisoner, and a guinea; we asked him where his chest was, he told us it was ast; we looked into the chest, and there I found a blue coat, four waistcoats, four shirts, a silver milk-pot, six silver tea-spoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and four watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those things your property? - A. Yes, he acknowledged he took two of the watches out of pawn, and two he bought with my money; there was a new suit of cloaths, which he said, he bought with my money, breeches, waistcoat, and coat.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the things are here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned at nine o'clock, how did you find the house? - A. The front door locked, and both the back doors open.</p>
               <p>Q. How could the person have got in? - A. I suppose, by having the key of the house, which I had lost ten days before, and found on the choppingblock.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the prisoner your servant at the time? - A. No, he had left me eight or nine days before.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No. 40, Basinghall-street. The pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service—in consequence of circumstances I thought it neces<lb></lb>sary to search his box on the morning of the 4th of August—I had missed about three pieces of fancy plaids, which had been torn off goods—after breaking open his box. I found the ends which precisely matched the pieces they were torn from—this is one of them, it is part of what I lost—the pri<lb></lb>soner had no right to have it in his box—his box had no business on my premises—it was there without my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had the prisoner been in your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years, at different periods—he did not come with a character—I am not aware whether mine was the first situation he had been in—I do not think it was—I have employed him off and on—I am a packer and dresser, these things are sent to me to pack—there are ends torn off pieces, but not of this description—the persons in my employ vary in number, from sixteen to thirty—I have a large number of goods of this de<lb></lb>scription—these are woolen and cotton—there are no ends torn off pieces of woolen, but of mouselin-de-laine which is a very different thing to this—the ends are not torn off these by me, or by any of my people, I am quite positive of that—when I went to the prisoner's box he was not in the way—there</p>

               <p>were men in the shop—before I broke the box open I asked the pri<lb></lb>soner to give me the key of his box, and he said he had left it at home with his sister, and he bring it at night—he was out in the City with my cart when I spoke to him—I left him, came back, and broke his box open—there was no policeman present—I have not seen the key of the box—he admitted that the box was his, and his observation about fetching the key was about this box—it was in a cupboard in the workshop in which I am in the habit of keeping papers—the cupboard was open.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

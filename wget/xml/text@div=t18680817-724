I am a dairyman, and live at 16, Leigh Street, Bruns<lb></lb>wick Square—on Sunday morning, 12th July, I went down, about 5.30, and found the place had been entered—I had fastened up safe the night before—when I came down, the door of the shop was unbolted and unlocked; it was on the latch—I first observed the till had been taken out—I had left 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it; that was gone—I went into the parlour, and found my desk had been opened, and some stamps, a seal, and a ring taken away—I also missed some pocket-handkerchiefs—this seal and ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my property—the name has been torn off this handkerchief, and I cannot swear to it—I had similar handkerchiefs.</p>

I got on the door step, Barrett got on my shoulder, and lifted the fanlight, and got in that way"—I then took Barrett and Fitzgerald into custody, and Chamberlain took Bateman—the other two said nothing—I have examined the fanlight—an entrance could have been made in that way—I know where Mrs. Rudland lives—she could command a view of the prosecutor's place from her window—Fitzgerald was searched at the station; nothing was found on him—I have known him eight years.</p>

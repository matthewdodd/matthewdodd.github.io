I was robbed in Skinner-street, within thirty yards of my own door, on Saturday, the 27th of April, at about twelve o'clock at night; I was on the Sun-street side of <placeName id="t18160529-44-crimeloc238">Skinner-street</placeName>

I saw the two prisoners at the bar, there was a sailor with them; they were dressed much the same as they are now; I have not seen the sailor since. The two prisoners stopped me at the corner of Skinner-street, at the oil-shop corner. The prisoner Dunnage put his elbow against the wall, and would not let me pass. Then the tall one, the <rs id="t18160529-44-deflabel239" type="occupation">sailor</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18160529-44-defend410 t18160529-44-deflabel239"></join>, stooped down, and looked in my face, and made use of some cramp words, which I did not understand. I turned off from them then, and went to the side of the street that my house was on. Then the prisoners crossed down upon me, and came before me within about thirty yards of my own door, and then they said, now b-gg-r your eyes, we have got you; give us up your money, all you have got, or we will have your life. I said, I had got no money, and they said, I was a b-y liar, and they said, they knew better, for I had money, and they would have it, or murder me directly. I turned round then, thinking to turn back, and did not think that the sailor was behind me; I turned round, and the sailor caught me by the throat, and nearly throttled me with his nails, and prevented my going away, and told me to stand still; I had hard to do to breathe. The two prisoners then held my arms, and the sailor felt my pockets, to see if I had a watch, but I had not. I was then endeavouring to get away, and was looking every way to make an alarm, and they said, if I made any alarm, they would murder me outright. The two prisoners took from me a pocketbook; it contained my fishing materials; I am positive there were not less than six fishing lines, and six hooks; they also took from me four penny-pieces; I gave them three, and told them if they would let me go, I would give them a pint of beer. They took a knife also, which was in the pocketbook, it was part of the furniture of the book, and five keys; my keys were in my coat pocket. I was endeavouring to get away several times, and before I could get away, these two prisoners said, if he will be so very obstropolous kill him out of the way, any how you like. Then they beat my hat down over my face, so that I could not see, and struck me at the back of my head into the middle of the road, and then when I pulled my hat off, I found there was nobody near me; they dragged me clean off my feet for two yards. The next time I saw any of them was at Bishopsgate watchhouse, on the Monday night, where I saw the two prisoners; they were taken in consequence of a description of them which I had given to Mr. Sapwell; I described them as soon as possible. When I saw them at the watchhouse, I had a strong idea that they were the men; they were sitting, and I desired them to stand up, and then I was sure of them, and that confirmed my recollection of them, and when they spoke, I had had such an opportunity of observing their voices from the ill language they had given to me, that I was sure and positive of them. I have never seen any of the articles that were taken from me on the Saturday night. I had first described their persons to Mr. Armstrong, and then he sent me to Mr. Sapwell, and I described them to him then, and to Shepherd. At the time I charged them at the watchhouse, they said nothing that is particular.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoners on Monday the 29th; I took them both at eight o'clock at night; that was on the Monday, after the Saturday that this man says he was robbed. I took them just at the skirts of the City, just at the end of Bishopsgate-street. I have heard the prosecutor describe the place where he was robbed, and that is in the City. I siezed hold of Dunnage first. I had had a description of three, but only took these two, and took them by the descriptions. Fellows wipped past my left hand. I took Dunnage, and gave him to Gildersleve, the patrole, and then persued Fellows, and took him. I had not told them when I took them at first, what I took them for; Fellows asked me what I wanted with him; he said he was not in company with the other, and did not know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290023"></xptr>him, meaning Dunnage. I had seen them together in the fore part of the day. I saw them together, so as to know they were companions. I had seen him twice the day before in company with the other. I took them both to the watch-house. I knew where to find the prosecutor, and informed him that I had got them. In consequence of that information, he came to the watch-house. I told him to look at them; they were the only persons in custody. I told him to be very circumspect before he said any thing; he looked at them; he sat close to them. There was nothing said then. He came out with me and Sapwell, and then went in again, and desired that they might stand up, and button their coats, and put their hats on. I asked him then if he knew them, and he said he was certain that they were the men. I asked him if he had any doubt, and he said none whatever. He said he recollected their person, and said, I know your voices particularly. Nothing was found on them relating to this charge. I afterwards went with Sapwell, to search Dunnage's lodging, but nothing was found.</p>

               <p>Fellow's Defence. I am entirely innocent of the crime of which I am accused, and never saw the prosecutor before in my life.</p>
               <p>Dunnage's Defence, written. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury; I most humbly address these few lines to you in this form, hoping that your kindness and great humanity, will extend to a poor friendless boy, and not be led away by the influence of false swearers. Though poor and distressed, I have not been guilty of the crime imputed to me, and should I be so fortunate as to meet your kind humanity, my lords, and gentlemen, be assured nothing shall tempt me to do wrong, or fall into the hands of bad company, which I have at all times avoided before. I have an aged mother in a most distressed state, whose only care is for my liberty, and wellfare, and should I meet your kindness and compassion, be sure I will fly to the arms of a tender mother, and never more disgrace her, or give her pain, but ever make it my study through life to make her comfortable, and happy. Humbly praying your kindness and consideration, and merciful goodness towards me, for which I shall be in duty bound to pray, and humble submission I remain,

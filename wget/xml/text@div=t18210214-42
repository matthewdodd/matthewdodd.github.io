               <p>"Whitehead's Buildings" the name T. Crawley; I asked if he worked for Mr. Mote? - seeing him in the dress of Mote's men - he said</p>
               <p>"Yes." Mr. Mote is a soap-boiler. I gave my wife the note to mark it; and saw her indorse it (looks at one) this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why is Exeter-buildings written on it? - A. Whitehead is a builder in our neighbourhood, and the buildings belong to him, it is known by the name of Exeter-buildings. The prisoner went out, I looked after him, but he was out of my sight in an instant. I do not know which way he went. Five minutes after, another man bought meat which came to 1 s. 3 d. and offered me 1 l. note - I marked the address as he gave it me (looks at one) this is it. We gave him 10 s. having no more change, I watched him, and saw he went a different way to Whitehead's Buildings (which address he had given me) I followed him and saw him join the prisoner, they went together 200 yards from my shop, I followed them up North-street into Sloane-street, suspecting them I went over to the constable, but as they turned, I followed them into the Cock public-house, I beckoned the landlord out, and saw them both together over a pint of porter; I fetch'd a constable who came at last, and I gave them in charge. I had before that sent to enquire at Whitehead's buildings. I saw them together for ten minutes before they went into the public-house.</p>

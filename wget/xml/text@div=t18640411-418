On Thursday night, 10th March, or Friday morning, I was on duty in Great Chesterfield-street, Marylebone about five minutes past 12: I saw the prisoner there, standing against the King's Head public-house, which stands at the corner of Great Chesterfield-street and Little Woodstock-street—it has doors entering into each of those streets—he was standing with his back against the wall, with his hands be<lb></lb>hind him, near the door in Little Woodstock-street—I did not speak to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186404110035"></xptr>
               <p>him—I went round my beat, and came round again to the same spot, in about twenty or twenty-five minutes—the prisoner was there again, standing in the same position in the same place—I did not say anything to him at that time—I left him, and went round my beat again—it would take me about twenty minutes to walk round my beat; sometimes it may take twenty-five minutes—I returned to the same place a third time—that was about ten minutes or a quarter to 1—he was standing in the same place and in the same position—at that time the door of the public-house in Little Wood-stock-street was open—I spoke to him—I said, "Devine, how are you living now? what are you doing?" (I knew him—when I first knew him he was a shoeblack boy, several years back) he answered, "I have no settled place of residence at present, and nothing to do; but I expect to have something to do shortly"—that was all that passed—the door in Little Woodstock-street, belonging to the public-house, was then shut too, whilst I was talking to him—I then went round my beat again, leaving him standing in the same place and position—when I came back to the place he was gone, and the public-house was all closed; all the doors were closed, and the house was in darkness—that was about ten minutes past 1—I then went down Great Chesterfield-street to the right, and then into little Marylebone-street, and then to the left into Little Chesterfield-field, which is parallel with Great Chesterfield-street—in passing through that street I saw a man lying down on the pavement in front of No. 5, Little Chesterfield-street—that is about from seventy to eighty yards from the King's Head—he was lying partly on his right side; his head was towards the door of No. 5, and his feet towards a hoarding, which there was in the street, opposite No. 6—I went up to him and spoke to him—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he made an attempt to speak, but I could not understand him—his hat was against the hoarding, near his feet—he was bleeding from the back of the head—I took hold of him by the arms, and endeavoured to raise him up—there was a good deal of blood on the pavement—his right arm was saturated with blood flowing from the wound at the back of his head—when I took hold of him he caught hold of my cape, and got up partly on his knees—he tried to speak to me several times, but I could not make out what he said; he mattered something—another constable came to my assistance, and we took him to the station-house—he did not make himself intelligible to me—when we got to the station a surgeon was sent for, and his wounds were attended to, and I took him in a cab to the infirmary—when I first took him up I noticed that the fall of his trousers was undone—I did not observe the fob pocket or the trouser's pocket—he had no handkerchief on—I saw no watch, chain, or seal, or any money in his pockets—I did not search him—at the infirmary, as I was in the act <hi rend="italic">of</hi> undoing his clothes, he resisted very forcibly, and said, "Let me have my property; I had two sovereigns"—I did not know him previously—at the time I saw the prisoner standing in the way I have stated, there was no one else in the street—when I found the deceased lying there was no one about.</p>

I would have given you the halfpence for the lodging"—he said, "To tell you the truth, I did not like to ask you"—I told him I had not got the halfpence at present, or I would have given them to him for his lodging that evening—several halfpence were made up for him in the tap-room during the evening—I saw Mr. Duck there while the prisoner was there—the question was put to Mr. Duck to know if he would give him a penny towards his lodging—he said no, he would not, he <hi rend="italic">knowed</hi> him—he afterwards said he had got him a place of work, and he would not do it; afterwards, Mr. Duck made friends with him, and offered him a lodging—he said he would make him up a bed on the floor—the prisoner said he could do that, he had been used to lying about—that was all that passed—I think the prisoner left the house about 10, or it might have been a little after 10; he left before Mr. Duck—I saw no more of him that night.</p>

I am a carpenter—on Friday morning, the 11th, about half-past 1, I was doing some work in the house, No. 5, Circus-street, for the landlord; it was not carpenter's work, but some work that the deputy ought to have executed, only he was unwell that night, and I did some portion of it for him—I heard a knock at the door at half-past 1—I called out to know who was there—the answer was, "John Devine"—I then opened the door and saw the prisoner; he stepped in a little way, and ap<lb></lb>plied for a lodging—I refused to let him come in, as the beds were all let—he went away, and I then shut the door—I next saw him in the middle of the day, on that same Friday, in the kitchen—I do not know of my own knowledge who let him in that morning; he remained in the house from that time till the following Tuesday, when he was taken into custody—on the Monday he told me that he had lost half a sovereign; he said that he had tied it up in the tail of his shirt, and by some means or other, the shirt came untied, and the consequence was the half-sovereign was lost—he told me that he had received 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that was due to him from a laundress in Wood-stock-street—he told me that on the Monday that the half-sovereign was lost—on the Saturday night before that I saw him pay for some beer, along with several others; I could not tell the exact quantity—I can safely say he paid for one pot; I won't exaggerate.</p>

I am a carter—on 11th March last, I was lodging at 5, Circus-street—I did not know the prisoner before he came to lodge there—he came to me at half-past 6 on Friday morning, 11th March—I was in bed—he woke me up, and said, "George, I want you"—I came down directly and put on my boots, and as I was sitting by the fire, he gave me a sovereign—I said, "What is this for?"—he said, "Fetch me some breakfast "—there was a handkerchief hanging on the line, and he said to the coach-man, "What do you think this will fetch; half a crown, or three shillings?"—the coachman said, "No, you will have to wash it a little different to that before it will fetch that money"—it was a black silk handkerchief—I went out and fetched the prisoner some breakfast—the houses were not open then, and I went into the Red Lion public-house, in the Edgeware-road, and called for half a quartern of brandy, and sat there to drink it—I changed the sovereign there—before I went out, the prisoner said, "I have something else here for you," and he shook his hand against his pocket—I said, "What is that?"—he said, "I sha'n't tell you before you come in"—I fetched in a a pound of steak, which came to 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a half-quartern loaf for 2 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., half an ounce of tea for three halfpence, a pennyworth of sugar, and a pennyworth of dripping; I think that was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, all but a farthing, that I laid out for the breakfast, <hi rend="italic">barring</hi> the brandy—I brought the things in and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, which I gave to the prisoner—he said, "You can keep half a <hi rend="italic">jane</hi>"—he told me that before I went out—half a <hi rend="italic">jane</hi> would be a half-sovereign—I suppose</p>

H." or something at the back—I know one letter was a "T"; I don't know what the other letter was—the letters were outside the case, and inside as well—it was a a biggish watch, about as big as the palm of my hand—the chain was a brass one, something similar to the one that gentleman has got on; it was half a foot long—the seal was an old-fashioned one, with a red stone and some funny letters on it, which I could not understand, deeply cut into the stone—he gave these to me, and the handkerchief—I went out and met a friend, and started off to Woolwich, with the things with me—this was on 11th March, on the Friday—we went into a public-house at Woolwich—I don't know the sign of it, but I believe the person is here who it belongs to, and I offered the watch to him for sale, for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I don't know what exactly, I had a little drop of beer in my head—I offered the watch, chain, and seal altogether—the man said I must take 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off—I would not take that, and I took the watch back again—before we got home, we had spent all our money, and I said to the young chap who was along with me, "Will, you go and sell this seal"—he said, "Yes," and he knocked the stone out and went and sold it, and gave me a shilling—I don't know the name of the person who keeps the shop he went to; I know the place—it was at a pawnbroker's, next to a churchyard, in Woolwich—the red stone was knocked out and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> away—I told him to chuck it away—I came back from Woolwich on Saturday, between 3 and 4 o'clock—I have never seen anything of the young man since—I stayed in Woolwich on Friday night and came back on Saturday—I came back to Circus-street, and gave the prisoner the watch and chain—I told him what money I was offered for it—I think I said four shillings, and he said, "Why didn't you take it?"—I said I was afraid I should get myself into trouble, and I thought it best to bring the watch back to him—he said, "You have no <hi rend="italic">call</hi> to fear getting into trouble, because I found this"—he went into the back-place and broke it up, and said, "Go and do as you like with this, and make away with it; it don't matter to me what you do"—I went out—this was between 5 and 6 o'clock on Saturday afternoon, 12th March—it was on the Friday that I offered it at Woolwich, and on Friday that the stone was knocked out of the seal—I stopped at a private lodging-house at Woolwich on the Friday night—it was between 3 and 4 in the afternoon of Saturday that I got back to Circus-street—I saw the prisoner at once—he was sitting down eating some fish and potatoes—when he went into the back-place and broke it up, he came back and gave me the case of the watch with no inside—I think there were two cases—they were completely broken up, just as if they had been smashed and run over—when he first gave me the watch it was in good order, from what I could see—it had a glass—he did not give me back anything more than the cases broken up—I never saw the chain again after I gave it to him—when he gave me these back, I said, "Where did you get these from?"—he said, "I found them"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "In</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Infirmary—the deceased, Joseph Duck, was brought there by the police, on the morning of 11th March—he was suffering apparently from the effects of intoxication and concussion of the brain—he was not sufficiently sensible to know what he was about—he spoke; at first we could hardly understand what he said, but afterwards he asked for two sovereigns, which he said were in his pockets—I was there when they were searched for—they were not found—I can't say whether it was exactly at that time, but I remember seeing that the fob of his trousers had been out across—the bottom of the fob had been cut away, and the lining of the trowsers also—his head was already dressed when he came to the Infirmary—I had a history of its having been dressed by the divisional surgeon of police—next morning I took off the plasters and examined the head—I found three cuts at the back of the head, running transversely across the back of the head—two of them were somewhat in a line with each other, and the third about an inch below those two.</p>

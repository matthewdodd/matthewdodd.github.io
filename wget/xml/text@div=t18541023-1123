                  </hi>. I live at the Sailors, Home, in Wells-street, White-chapel. On Monday night, 9th Oct., about 20 minutes past 10 o'clock, I was at a public house in Wellclose-square—I saw the deceased, Tobias Johanneson, there—I knew him—there were between twenty and thirty persons there—they were chiefly foreigners—some of them were women—they were not dancing when I went up—I saw the deceased seated at the table—shortly afterwards I heard a noise and confusion in the room—I heard a cry of "Murder!" and some women's voices—I did not see Johanneson there—I did not see him at any time after that in the room—I saw him at the doctor's; he was then lying on the floor, bleeding—when I was up in the room I was knocked down by a blow at the side of my head, as I was going towards the people who were standing at the end of the room—that was not when I first went in, I had been there about half an hour—it was after I heard the cry of "Murder!"—I could not see what I was knocked down with—I was cut at the side of the head—I do not know whether it was done by a man or a woman—my shipmates came and took me away.</p>

               <p>foreign sailors standing together in the middle of the room—the deceased was one of them, and the prisoner another—the prisoner had been dancing before that, the deceased had not—when I first saw the men, they were talking in a foreign language in the middle of the room—there were six of them; five with the prisoner—after they had been talking together a little while, I saw the deceased strike the prisoner with his fist on the side of the face—the prisoner struck him again—he then stepped two or three steps away from the deceased, went behind a table, and drew a knife from his breast; it was an open knife, similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw him draw it from his breast, and stab the deceased three or four times in the upper part of his body; his head, I believe—the deceased fell on his knees; the blows were violent ones—the prisoner held the handle of the knife in his hand, with the point downwards—I saw the knife in his hand—I did not hear him say anything—I believe he is a Dane; they were both sailors—I saw Monk go up to the table, and as soon as he went to the table, I saw the prisoner strike him with the knife in the upper part of the body; I cried, "Murder!" and the police came.</p>

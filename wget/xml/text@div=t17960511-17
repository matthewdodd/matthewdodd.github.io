               <p>I hired the prisoner, out of Spitalfields-market, to nurse my child, on the 26th of April, and on the 29th, she robbed me: she was in a back room washing some dishes, about eight o'clock in the morning, and these things were in a back room; she went to throw some dirty water away, I thought she staid a great while; I went to look for the things, and found they were gone; I went to look for her, and she had left a saucepan, that she took with her, upon the stairs; I saw her again the next night, in Spitalfields-market; I did not speak to her, but went home and told my husband of it; he went, and held her till the patroles came and took her; two duplicates were found upon her.</p>

            . I was in Foster-street on the 26th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening - I saw Blacket at one corner of the street, and Bailey putting a key into the door of No. 3 - Lyall stood before him; I went up the street and saw Sawyer standing at the corner - I and another boy went and played in the Broadway for two or three minutes; we then went down the street again; I saw Sawyer go down and whistle - they then all went from the door - Sawyer went down the street and came to the corner again; Blacket and the others then went away - we went down again and saw the door open, which had been shut when we passed it before; we went to Walton, the officer, and told him - he came with us to the house - as we were coming down the street we saw the prisoners coming up together - Sawyer was behind them - they were coming from No. 3; we went down to the house - the officer went into the passage and said"Who is here;" the door was then opened, and Bailey said "It is me, Sir;" Walton caught hold of his collar, he wrestled in the road and got away, but left his hat behind; we found the drawers open in Miss Perkins' front parlour, and the things on the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Sawyer? A. Yes; by working at Mr. Page's; I am an apprentice to Mr. Law, in the New Market, but since last October I have been living with my mother, as I did not like the business; I have been there eight or nine months - my master is willing to take me back - he has complained of me in a Court of Justice, and I was sent to the House of Correction; I once had part of the money for which a watch was sold, but I did not take it; I believe I have run away from my master about six times; I was once taken out of a lodging house, but I do not know that it was a house of ill-fame.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Upon your oath did you go to meet any girl or woman there? A. No, it was a lodging-house for men - I do not know who kept it - I was there only one night - I slept by myself - I went there about the watch concern because I was afraid to go home.</p>

            . I was in Foster-street with Edwards - I saw Blacket at the corner of Half-moon-alley; it was then between half-past six and seven o'clock - we went on and saw Bailey standing, at the door of No. 3, making a noise with something, and Lyall was behind him on the curb - we went on and saw Sawyer standing at the top of the street - we went to the Broadway, and played at a step, and then we went down again, and saw them at the same place - we then went down on the same side as the house was, and saw Lyall and Bailey, two or three yards off the door - Blacket was at the same place as at first - we went round Peter-street, and came down again and saw Bailey and Lyall at the same place, and the door was open, which had been shut before; Sawyer then went down Peter-street; we went round again, and they all went different ways; we went to the officer - he went with us into Peter-street, and saw Blacket and Lyall just by a gas light in the same street, some distance off - we saw Sawyer come by, and we went to the house, and the officer knocked at the shutters, and said "Who is here?" Bailey came out, and said "I am;" the officer collared him- he struggled and got away - I went into Miss Perkins' room - I found the candle wrapped round with a black stocking, and these things about the floor - the lock of the drawer seemed to be broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Bailey was the man who came out of the house? A. Yes; I did not know them before but I can identify their persons; I am a companion of Edwards' - we had been buying some sugar - candy, and were going home.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the two witnesses? Q. Yes; I had Edwards in custody from his master for running away - but he liberated him again; I did not know they were the parties till after I found them out - I knew them well, and could not be deceived in them; the boys had told me a house had been broken open, but did not say who were doing it.</p>

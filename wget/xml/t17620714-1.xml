A woman picked my pocket of a purse with the several pieces of money mentioned in the indictment. I took hold of her, and called for assistance; on which she gave my purse into the hand of the prisoner, who, as I called out, ran away with it. Mr. Bidicey, who was standing at his shop door, came out and pursued him: he took and brought him back to his shop. I believe he was searched, but nothing found upon him. I have never got my money again. The prisoner attempted to push me down at the time the woman was at my pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bidicey This lady called to me, and said she had had her pocket picked. I offered to lay hold of the woman which she had hold of. She said, this woman has delivered it to that man [pointing to the prisoner]. He directly ran away, and I after him. He made down Pope's-Head Alley, and Swithen's-Lane, down Lombard Street, round St. Mary Woolnoth's Church. I took him in a blind alley that leads into Sherborne-Lane. He was never out of my sight, but just as he turned the corners. I told him he must go back with me. He was a good deal frighted. There were several people pursued him as well as myself. I brought him back to the prosecutrix. He was searched, but nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140003"></xptr> thing found upon him that she could own. We found about seven guineas, and a bank note of ten pounds.</p>

On the 3d of January, at eight o'clock in the morning, I laid my coat in the colour room, or warehouse, and went to breakfast; I returned at half-past eight, and it was gone; I had not seen either of the prisoners that morning: in about half an hour I saw the coat in the cellar below, under some paper shavings; I did not see it again till I got to Guildhall - it cost me 3l. 10s.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Gillet and Co. who are owners of the premises. Thomas Flinn was employed there - John was a stranger: I heard this coat was lost. On the night of the 4th I was in the counting house - Thomas Flinn was cleaning away after the men - I secreted myself in the court, where I had a view of the premises: I waited from a quarter past eight to nine o'clock- it was known that a coat was lost: I saw John Flinn come from Old Fish-street, and look up at the factory window - the coat was thrown out - John picked it up - I got a watchman to assist, and secured him with it, and, in our way back, we met Thomas, going home; I told him to come into the counting-house; he did so; I said to Thomas, "I believe you know this is the carpenter's coat;" he said "Yes;" I gave them both in charge: there was no one in the factory but Thomas when the coat was thrown out. John said his brother told him he had bought the coat - Thomas said nothing; it had not been moved till the night of the 4th.</p>

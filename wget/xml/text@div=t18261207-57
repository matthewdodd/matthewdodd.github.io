               <p>JAMES ROSS. I am a servant to Dowager Lady Anson. I remember receiving this watch from Finnester; I think it was the latter end of July, 1824; I was to ascertain the value, and sell it if I could; I thought it not properly come by, and never offered it for sale; I kept it, in case I should see it advertised; I did not inquire among the families I knew, whether it had been lost; I have shown it to several people, and I sent it to have a new glass; Plank came to me, and I delivered it up to him immediately, as the same I had received from Finnester.</p>

I believe the prisoner to be the person who lived there in 1824, for about a month; I received a most excellent character with her, but discharged her at the end of July, on account of this watch being missed; Lord Clanricarde was at the hotel in July - the prisoner was housemaid, and attended the rooms where he slept; Mr. Jaquier resides in the house himself.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I produce a watch, which I received from James Ross on Sunday the 3d of December, and, in consequence of information, I apprehended the prisoner at No. 16, Newman-street, Oxford-street; I told her it was on suspicion of stealing a watch, and asked if she ever lived at the Clarendon Hotel; she said she never did, and had no recollection of ever having had a small watch in her possession; I did not hold out either threat or promise to her; I asked her if she knew Mrs. Finnester, the laundress; she said, Yes; I then produced the watch, and said, "You delivered this to Mrs. Finnester;" she then cried, and said she was very sorry that she did take it, but she thought it was of very little value, and that she found it on the hearth-rug in Lord Clauricarde's apartment; I took her into custody - she was in service when I took her, and her master and mistress spoke very highly of her - they had had a twelve-months' character with her.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Henrick, jeweller, Princes-street, Soho. I sold the Marquis Clauricarde this watch on the 12th of July, 1824; it is worth 40l. - I am certain of it.</p>

I gave the woman this watch with the foul linen, from the Clarendon; she had not seen me with it, but I saw her with it on the Sunday when I called, and told her not to give it to any body that knew me, for fear of any harm; she said she would show it to a young man, who would buy it for his sweetheart; she fell out with me in consequence of my bringing a strange washerwoman to the house.</p>

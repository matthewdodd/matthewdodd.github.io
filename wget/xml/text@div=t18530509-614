                  </hi>. I am clerk to Joseph and Albert Savory, watch makers, in Cornhill. In Dec, 1850, and Jan., 1851, the prisoner was in their employ—I know that on 15th Jan., 1851, there was work in his possession for him to finish—on 16th Jan. he was missing from his work—I went with a policeman to his residence, in Claremont-row, Barnsbury-road—the prisoner was not there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Savory. The officer has got a hook here—this is it—it is my duty to give out new work to the workpeople—when it is given out I take a note of it, and enter it in this book—I enter the date, the number of the watch, and the workman's name against it, and the description of the work—when the work is finished I receive it back from George Hide, the foreman—the men all work on the premises—when the work is finished and returned, I put my initials against it—it is then taken down to the shop, for which I have the signature of the shopman—the workmen are engaged by the watch, they have so much for doing each watch—they are paid weekly—I did not engage the prisoner, he was engaged by Messrs. Savory—on turning in this book to 24th Dec. 1850, I find No. 18,362, a lady's gold lever watch, was delivered to White—my initials are not against it—having looked at this entry, I have a recollection of having delivered that watch to White—on 30th Dec, here is a gold watch, No. 12,827, delivered to White—on 8th Jan., 1851, I find an entry of five gold watches, Nos. 10,160; 10,161; 15,409; 18. 364; and 18,365, all delivered to White—on 13th Jan., here is an entry of two gold three-quarter plate lever watches, Nos. 12,746, and 12,747, to White—all these entries are in the name of White—my initials are not against any of them—I gave all these to the prisoner, they have never been returned to me—it was the prisoner's duty to give them to the foreman, George Hide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was not his duty to deliver them to you? No; he should deliver them to Hide, and Hide would deliver them to me—the prisoner had no authority whatever to take work off the premises—the whole of this work is done on the premises—it is the examining the watches—I met the prisoner on 14th last month in Craven-buildings, Hoxton New-town; I followed him, and went up to him—I asked him if his name was White—he answered, "Yes; and your name is Harrison"—I told him it was a bad job that he had left Mr. Savory's in the way he had—he said, "Yes, it was; it is a long time ago"—I wished him to go with me to the foreman, Mr. Hide—I asked the prisoner if he had got the tickets, meaning the pawn tickets—he said, "No"—I said, "Could they be got at?"—he said, "No;" he had lost them in a pocket book—I asked him how he came to do such a thing—he said, "I don't know, I must have been mad; the money I raised upon them (or got upon them) did me no good; I came back from Paris a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worse man than I was when I went"—no other watch finisher left Mr. Savory's without returning the work from 1st Jan., 1851, till 1st March—the workmen are paid by the foreman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You had a good many other persons who made watches, or did something to watches, besides what are down in this book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there are only down here, White, and Maclean, and Burton—that is all that are here—there may be fifty persons employed altogether, but they are not watchmakers—when I saw the prisoner in Hoxton New-town, I followed him, and passed him, and then he came up to me—I said it was a bad job he had left Mr. Savory in the way he had done—he said it was, but it was some time ago—he asked me what I wished him to do—I wished him</p>

               <p>to go to Mr. Hide—I went with him to Mr. Hide, and afterwards to Mr. Savory, and then he was given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were first before the Magistrate, was not what I have now detailed all that you recollected of the conversation, and all the other part, asking him whether he had the tickets, and he saying he had lost them in a pocket book, and that he did not know how he came to do it, and be must have been mad, and that he was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worse for his Paris trip, and some other matters, were not recollected by you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were not mentioned by me at the time—I recollected them at the first examination, but I did net men tion them—I was at that time in the habit of giving out a very great num ber of watches day by day—on 3rd Dec. eleven were given out—on 16th Dec. six, and on 17th about eight—I was in the habit of giving out a great number of watches according to this book—I mean to swear that 1 can recollect giving out these watches to the men according to this book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But without this book, should you have known anything about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should have recollected I gave him out work—I gave him out a good deal of other work—on 24th Dec. I gave him out besides this watch, five others according to this book, and on 8th Jan. I gave him several others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear that by referring to this book you can recollect having given him out this particular work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only by referring to this book—except by referring to this book, I should have no recollection of the thing at all—I recollect giving him some watches, but I cannot recollect whether on the 24th I gave him seven or eight—I give out a great many watches—I cannot recollect the particular watch, or the numbers I gave out—it is only by referring to this particular entry that I can say I gave him out such a watch, having no distinct recollection of it—these are the initials I put to them when the work is delivered by Mr. Hide to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMPSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many watch finishers were there at that time employed on the business examining watches? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only two at that particular time—in this book, where the initials are not entered, here is written in pencil the word "stolen"—that was written on 16th Jan., immediately after the drawer was searched, and the watches were missing—my attention was at that time called to the fact—I did not search the drawer—my attention was at that time drawn to the circumstance connected with the delivery of these watches—the circumstance of the prisoner going away was mentioned to me, and then I made this entry in pencil—t recollect perfectly well having given the watches to him at that time—I have not forgotten since that he bad gone away—we at that time went over the stock to see what was missing, and what was not—I am quite certain that these watches were delivered to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having seen your own entry, and also the entry in pencil, that called your attention so shortly afterwards to these particular watches, have you not a distinct recollecion of having delivered these watches? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no hesitation in saying that I delivered them; I remember it—I must have remembered giving these particular watches out—I bad no reason for not giving the whole conversation on the first examination.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Savory; I was so in 1850 and 1851; it is my duty to receive the watches back from the workmen, and hand them to Mr. Harrison, when completed; I have a duplicate key of all the drawers. The prisoner was missing from his work on 16th Jan., 1851—in consequence of that, I opened his drawer with the duplicate key—I missed some watches and watch cases—I went to the prisoner's residence, in Barnsbury-road I think it was—I found he bad left—I gave him into custody in April last—the only conversation I had with him was, he said he hoped I</p>

               <p>should not be harsh with him, or words to that effect—I told him I must leave that to Mr. Savory—the value of the goods that were stolen was about 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were four watches missing, and five cases; that is the gold part, not the work—all the men work on the premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was this drawer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Under the workmen's board, in the workshop—Mr. Savory engages the workmen—I keep a book, in which I enter what is returned to me—each workman has a book, and when he returns his work to me I sign his book—I have the prisoner's book here—the entries in it are the prisoner's writing—the date on which the work is delivered to him does not appear in this book—the book is made up weekly, when the workman is paid—the work that is going on is paid for, but I sign my name at the time of the delivery of the work to me—the numbers of the watches appear in the book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross examined. Q.</hi> Here is in this book numbers "18362" and "12827," which have not your initials to them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the work that was going on at the end of the week was paid for, but, unless it was finished and delivered, it was not signed for—my signature indicates the return of the property to me—I judge these were not delivered to me, by seeing no initials of mine against them—these initials were put on Saturday when the work was delivered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But suppose the work was delivered on a Thursday, would you put your initials on the Saturday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should put my initials when I received the work—the work is generally delivered on a Saturday afternoon—the prisoner left on 16th Jan.; I think it was on a Thursday—here is number "15409," "10160," and "10161"—numbers "12746" and "12747" are not here; "18362" is under Jan. 13th, and "18364" and "18365" are under 11th Jan.—it might possibly take the prisoner a fortnight to finish a watch, and do what he had to do to it—he could have completed the majority of the watches he is charged with stealing by the Saturday previous to his leaving—there was no one else to whom these things were to be delivered; they must all pass through my hands—there was no other person to whom the workmen would deliver the work, and who would deliver it to me—I have no recollection that that has ever occurred—the work would not be delivered into my hands by any other person but the workman—I cannot swear that such a thing has never happened—I am always on the premises in business hours—I only go out to my meals—my duty is to receive the work from the workmen, and give it to Harrison.</p>

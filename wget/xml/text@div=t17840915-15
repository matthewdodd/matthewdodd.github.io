               <p>Court. What did Webb say in the prisoner's presence? - He said he bought the horse of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>He said that to the prisoner, did he? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What is the value of this horse? - Six guineas, it was a poney, about fourteen hands high.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How far is Hackney-wick to where you live? - I live at Putney.</p>
               <p>Putney Common adjoins to some other commons that are pretty extensive? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The poney was a pretty frolick some one, and very fond of rambling? - Yes, he is a young horse.</p>

            . - Yes, your honour.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Mr. Milne? - Yes, I saw him at my house.</p>
               <p>When was it? - To the best of my knowledge it was the 15th or 16th of July, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Did he own any horse that was then in your possession? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Of whom did you buy that horse? - I bought it of that man there.</p>
               <p>How long before you saw Milne? - I believe four or five days, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>What did you give for it? - Twenty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>It was a good bargain, was not it? - No, I do not think it, not as the horse was; I do not call myself a proper judge of horses, and I got several people to look at it, and they told me it was not worth any more; it was several hours before I bought him.</p>
               <p>I suppose it was low in flesh? - It was a glandered horse, and ran at the nose, I thought it such.</p>
               <p>I hope you have no other horses, have you? - I have one more, but they told me not to let that horse go with the other in the stable, which I did not.</p>
               <p>Now, friend, when Mr. Milne came to your house and challenged this horse, was the prisoner brought to your house? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Was the horse produced there before him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that the same horse you bought of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where did you buy him, Master Webb? - I bought him at home in our yard, he asked me to let him be put in the stable, I was so busy I could not look at him.</p>
               <p>You put him in along with your own Jockey, did you? - No, mine was out at grass.</p>
               <p>How long have you kept horses? - How long?</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, would you give twenty-five shillings for a glandered horse? - At this time I would, because they fetch more money, dog horses do, than they do in winter. I told the man that I should just fetch up a little rubbish from the marshes, then I would sell him for the dogs.</p>
               <p>But you would work him to the bone first, and leave nothing but the bone for the dogs; now, upon your oath, do not you know that the horse was worth five or six pounds? - No, he was not, nor I would not give a halfpenny more for it.</p>
               <p>You only wanted to melt him down; you keep a slaughter-house? - No, Sir, I never sold but ten or twenty in my life, and never bought but this one horse in my life.</p>
               <p>You are a middle man, between the thief and the boiler, are not you? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was you to sell this to, was you to take him to Smithfield? - Yes, Sir, and twenty-eight shillings is often given for a horse there.</p>
               <p>Court. I presume you had no doubt at all when Mr. Milne claimed it, it was his property? - Yes, because I heard the prisoner had sold some others, a horse, or a cow.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You put this horse on the common the night before you missed it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it glandered? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Had the horse a cold? - The horse very lately had a cold; I look upon it he was rode hard the night before, and being off the grass.</p>
               <p>What should you have thought would have been the value of the horse? - I gave seven guineas for him in April; and I should be loth to take less for him at this very time.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150052"></xptr>Has the horse the glanders now? - I am not a judge, but I do not think he has.</p>

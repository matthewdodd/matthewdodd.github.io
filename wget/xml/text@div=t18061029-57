               <p>Q. Did you lose a five pound bank note at any time. - Q. Yes, I did, and a ten rolled up along with it; I lost it on Monday the 13th of October at the house of the prisoner, he <rs id="t18061029-57-deflabel311" type="occupation">keeps a public house</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18061029-57-defend650 t18061029-57-deflabel311"></join>, I frequented it; he keeps the Half Moon and Seven Stars. I keep a house hard by in Chapel street.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us how you lost it, and what time of the day was it. - A.Between three and five in the afternoon; I was eating my dinner there, I had occasion to draw out my purse to get a seven shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. You dined there did you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober at that time. - A. Yes, I was both hungry and dry, I went in and dined there; this happened after dinner, I was preparing to go away, I had been there perhaps an hour and a half, I had drank two pints of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking any thing else in the day. - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know. - A. I cannot know.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not drank that day before to be intoxicated. - A. No, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the landlord close by when you took out the purse. - A. Yes, he saw that I had gold and notes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you miss your notes at last. - A. If you remember, I told you I was in the act of getting change; I laid the notes down while I was looking at the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you took the notes out of your purse. - A. I am certain of that, because I put them in my teeth, and I laid them on the table or dropped them on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether you put them on the table or dropped them, you are not certain. - A. I am not certain as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the house before you missed the notes. - A. Almost immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you change for the seven shilling piece. - A. He did, and I looked at the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you had left the house you had not missed the notes. - A. No, I had not missed them then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how can you be sure that you did not take them out of the house and dropped them, as you do not know whether you had them on the table or dropped them on the floor. - A. I recollect that I forgot putting them up in the purse.</p>

               <p>Q. You recollect that you forgot is an odd thing, how could you recollect afterwards, when you tell me you do not recollect whether you put them on the table or dropped them on the floor. - A. The next morning I drawed the purse out and not till then.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time in the morning. - A.As near as I can guess it might be about midday.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought at that time they were in your purse. - A. I looked to be certain that I had got the money ready for the payment of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took out the purse and perceived that the notes were not there. - Q. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be certain at that time that you had left them on the table. - A. I recollected that I put them down from my hand while I was looking at the silver; I put the silver in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you spend the evening after you had been to the public house. - A. I went home directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the five pound note since. A. I have, I think it was on the 21st or the 22nd of October, I saw it at Mr. Frith's.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that it was the same five pound note that you had lost on that day. - A. What do you ask me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290047"></xptr>Q. Are you sober now; the question I ask you is, how are you certain that it is the same five pound note that you lost at the prisoner's house. - A. If you will hear me I will tell you, Mr. Frith sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it was the same note. - A. Yes, I knew the note, I had made a mark upon it, there was an endorsement of J. Dewry. I saw Mr. Dewry endorse it himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that endorsement upon it when you lost it. - A. Yes, certainly, I never parted with it till I lost it, I wore it always. When I saw it in the possession of Mr. Frith I claimed it, I said it was my note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time between the 13th and the 21st and 22nd, speak to the landlord about it. - A. I did; as soon as I missed it the next day I went to Mr. Hughes, and told him that I had lost it at his house, and I told him the endorsement upon it; I told him over and over, because I went to him several days about it, he denied having seen them. After I had seen it at Mr. Frith's I went into the prisoner's house, he said he heard what happened, he said, Mitchell, I have heard that you have come to the knowledge of one of your notes; I told him yes, that I had seen it, and I said that I hoped to see the other ten pound note again, as I think I am sure they were rolled together; I said if you have found them I will not mind being something handsome for a dinner; he still denied knowing any thing about them.</p>

On the next morning he said she had lost the bank notes, I said I was very sorry; he said that he had been in the city to pay the bank notes away, the man was so very busy he could not receive the money, he must go again; he told me to look if I had got a note of the name of J.

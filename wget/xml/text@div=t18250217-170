On the 7th of February, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, he said he had just come into possession of property, and wished to purchase a gold watch; he selected a silver one, at 11 l., but said he intended to have given 30 l., but this had taken his fancy; he put his hand into his pocket, and took out a parcel, which he said contained forty-five sovereigns, which he had brought to pay for it. He then bought a gold chain, seal, and key; the whole amounted to 13 l. 19 s. - I attached them together, and handed them to him; he looked at them, and seemed perfectly satisfied. He then said he would take them to shew to a friend at the Blue Boar, and leave the sovereigns behind the while - I wished to open the parcel to see what was in it; he then said he would leave watch, parcel, and all: I said he should not leave the house till I had opened it; he caught hold of the parcel - I wrenched it out of his hand, and found it contained farthings, and immediately gave him in charge. I had sold him the watch, and given it into his hand - I considered the sale complete.</p>

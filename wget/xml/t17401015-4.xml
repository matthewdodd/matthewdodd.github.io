            . I am a Watchman. About 4 o'clock on Sunday Morning, the 31st of August, I met the Prisoner, with something on his Shoulder. I asked him what he had got, he said, only a Stone or 2; I felt, and found it was Lead; I asked him, How he came by it, he told me, a Friend had given it him to carry. I took him to the Constable's, and there he confessed, that he, and one Brown, took it from the Alms-houses near the Blue-Coat School.</p>

            . On Sunday Morning, the last Day of August, the Watchman (Falconer) brought the Prisoner to me, and charged me with him. I desired him to confess who was with him, when he took the Lead. He said that one Brown, and one Ford, took the Lead from the Alms-houses, rolled it up, and carried it behind the School; that one of them gave him this Lead, and bid him go forward with it. I carried the Prisoner to the Gate-house, and went to look for the other 2 Men; but we never could take them: There had been Lead stole from the Alms-houses, and some of this Lead match'd with the Place; but he never would tell us where the other came from.</p>
               <p>Mr Ilsley. I know the Alms-houses to be the Property of the Dean of Westminster, and the Dean of the Chapel-Royal, during the Time of their being Deans; it is an Estate of 52 l. a Year, Fee-Farm, which was left by Will in the Year 1682; and the Alms-houses were left under their Direction, but the Will is not here. <rs id="t17401015-4-verdict24" type="verdictDescription">

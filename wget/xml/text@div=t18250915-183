On the 20th of August I put ten yards of black silk on a roller, that was marked, into our window, about eight o'clock in the morning; about seven o'clock in the evening I went to take the goods from the window; I found the window broken close by where the silk had been - it was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. What have you got that other piece of silk for? A. To compare with the one which was stolen - they correspond exactly.</p>

            . I cut the remainder of the silk into small pieces, and delivered it about to different pawnbrokers. On the 24th of August, I got this yard and a quarter from Mr. Jones; I have compared it, and it appears to be the same; I went on the same evening to the prisoner's husband's house, and the officer found, in my presence two more pieces of silk, of a yard and a quarter each, in a drawer in their back parlour; he then asked if they had any more - the prisoner said there was another cut in the lower drawer; I then found a roller in the cupboard, which I believe the silk had been round, but the mark had been filed off.</p>

I was with Murray at the prisoner's husband's; it was an old iron shop; the prisoner came down stairs; I asked her about the silk - she denied having it, but I found these in the drawer, and then she said there were some she had pawned with Mr. Jones, which she had bought at separate times of two young men.</p>

            . I went with Murray to the prisoner's house on the 25th of August; I told her we had a search warrant; she seemed anxious to know what it was for - I said for silk, and asked her, if she had not pawned it at Jones's; she said she had, and she had bought it of a costermonger, who lived in Pye-street; his mother had got it at a tally-shop, and it was too good for him to wear.</p>

On the 4th of October, Pope came in for a halfpenny-worth of beer - I set it before him, and saw Crayford behind him - he said, "Draw me a halfpenny-worth;" Pope then said, "You may put them together." I thought, as I arose up, that I saw Crayford do something - I stooped, and again saw him take something in his hand - I looked up, and missed two pieces of pork from a dish on the counter; Crayford went out with it; Pope remained in the shop. I went to the door, and called Stop thief! an officer brought him back with the pork in a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate that Pope ran out? A. If so, it is a mistake.</p>

            . On the 4th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing at my door, which is half a mile from Turner's, and saw the two prisoners go by; some time afterwards I saw them again, and followed them to Radnor-street; I saw them go into this shop - one came out, and ran - I pursued, and he threw the pork away - I think that was Crayford; I secured him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said Pope ran out at the office? A. I did not know their names: they refused to tell their names at the watch-house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

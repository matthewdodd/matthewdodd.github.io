               <p>Q. Did you get your money again?</p>
               <p>Lay. No, not a farthing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you disguised in liquor at the club?</p>
               <p>Lay. No, I was not, I had no thoughts of being concerned with the woman; I have an honest wife, by whom I have had thirteen children; I think I have no occasion for a whore.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your halfpence and gold in one pocket?</p>
               <p>Lay. No, my halfpence were in my right-hand waistcoat pocket, and my gold in my left-hand breeches pocket; I heard her own to the watchman that carried her to New Prison, that the woman that went for the liquor had one guinea, and she the other; and if she did not help to maintain her in prison, she would inform against her and a good many more; she told the watchman he and part of many a crown got by picking of pockets, and what business had he to take her.</p>

               <p>This is all false, he took up another woman that he was with before.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were several women brought into the watch-house that night, and I said I could not swear to any of them; I was with no other woman but the prisoner.</p>

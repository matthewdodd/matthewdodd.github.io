             in Bedfordshire. I hired the prisoner, Knight, to assist me in driving the waggon from Hatfield; I had seen him before - I had two waggons. When we got to Holloway, he left us, and drove another waggon - I did not know but he was in the waggon till I got to Islington. I saw no more of him till I got to Newgate-market. I missed the flat when I got to the George Inn, Smithfield.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. John's, Clerkenwell. On the 30th of January, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, the prisoner, Knight, passed me at the end of Parson's-alley, St. John's-lane, close against St. John's-gate, with a flat of butter; he put it down by the side of the Jerusalem tavern, St. John's-gate - I said there was nobody up; he asked me what time I thought they would be up? I said about half-past six o'clock, and asked him if it was for Mrs. Walters, who keeps the house? he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I am going to leave it here for a man who used to be in your box." I asked him if the man's name was Woolley? he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have brought it for him, but I don't know what to do with it as he is not here, and I want to go back to Holloway with my waggon, but will you take care of it till he comes, or the woman of the public-house gets up?" He left it with me. As soon as the public-house was open I put it in there, and said it belonged to Woolley. When I went to the watch-house I saw Woolley there, and told him - I went over to the public-house with him. He put his foot on it, and said it was all right, and he knew where to take it to. I left him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Knight said he brought it from the country - A. Yes. Poor people often have butter from the country to sell in town.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THOMPSON. I am an officer. I was informed the butter was lost, and apprehended Knight. He denied it several times - at last he said,</p>
               <p>"I own I had lump of it, and sold it to an old woman." I said he must tell where the other was. He said</p>
               <p>"There was another man in company with me; he took it out of the waggon, and sat it down by the Bull public-house door, and I took it away from the door to a watchman." I asked him where the watchman's box was? he said,</p>
               <p>"He used to stand in the box at the corner of Parson's-alley, but now he stands in St. John-street." He said he had seen him in the morning, as he came down with the waggon, and he asked him if he had got anything for him? I desired him to go with me. I went to Woolley's house about seven o'clock that evening, and found him at home. I said,</p>
               <p>"I am come to know about that flat of butter which you had last Saturday morning." He said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, the flat of butter, do you?" I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you done with it? he said,</p>
               <p>"The waggoner and I sold it" - then said</p>
               <p>"No, I did not sell it, the waggoner did;" and after that he said he had sold it. I asked him where? he took me to Aylesbury-street, where I found the flat - he had sold six lumps there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. He said he had it from a waggoner, and was to have it every week. I used to employ him.</p>

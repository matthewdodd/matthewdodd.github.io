            . I live at Smithfield-bars, and assist my brother William, who is a pawnbroker. I produce a saw and plane, pawned on the 14th of May, about six o'clock, by the prisoner, for 3s., in the name of White - I am perfectly certain of his person; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am not the person; the things were lost a short time afterwards, and he said at Guildhall that he had turned me out of the shop, on the Saturday previous, with a lot of things. Witness. No; I never saw him till he pawned them; I never said he came there intoxicated on the Saturday previous, and I had told him if he did not go out I would kick him out.</p>

            . I am servant to Winter. I know the prisoner by sight - I saw him at master's premises on the 14th of May, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, and these articles were missed in about two hours - he came to the premises to ask for some shavings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you perceive anything in the sack when I came out? A. I was not in the shop when you came out - you had a sack on your shoulder; a little boy unlocked the gate to let him in.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, denying that he had pledged the articles; and stating that Rowland was in the shop all the time he was there; that at eleven years of age he had met with a dreadful fall, which had impaired his intellects, and at times he wore a straight-waistcoat.</p>

            . I am a pastrycook, and live at No. 15, Old-street. I have known the prisoner five or six years; I am no relation of his; he used to work for me - I merely come to his character; at the time he worked for me he was honest, as far as I know; he worked for me about nine months, two years and a half ago - I got him a situation in Spa-fields, in the pastry line; I recommended him to a place<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040055"></xptr>there - I parted with him through a disagreement about wages - he was with that master, I believe, about two months; I heard nothing amiss of him there; his master left - I have not known much of him since; he has been at work, I believe, jobbing about - he used to act in a very foolish manner when he got a little drop to drink, he was almost as if out of his senses, doing all manner of antics; I used to think it was all nonsense - he used to buy shavings and sell them again - I don't think he had his hair shaved off his head when he lived with me, but when he had a little to drink he used to be as if half mad - I don't think he knew what he was about on these occasions, he used to be at all manner of tricks; I could not manage with him at all; if he was in that way he would abuse me and when he came to himself he would not know anything about it; and he would abuse my wife, and he would declare when in his sober senses he did not recollect anything of the kind.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother; he is my first husband's child; this happened since the Queen died - his father sent him to the Crown for a pot of porter, and a lad ran against him with a wash-hand basin, and cut his head, and quite fractured it, and ever since we have always thought he was not perfect in his senses - he was never in any situation in his life, only three or four - he has been with the pastrycook eleven months, and he went to Mr. Reeves, the baker, to help take out the bakings; he has not been in any employ for fourteen months - I was left with five of them, and had not anything to lay on, and this lad was the chief support of my family - he worked very hard when he could.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he when sober? A. When he was intoxicated he was bad, and when any body put him into a passion he did not know what he was doing.</p>

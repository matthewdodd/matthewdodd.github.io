                  </hi>. I live in Barbican. On Thursday last, the 31st of March, I had been dining with a few friends, and had taken a glass of wine too much—I met the prisoner close by my own door, and was allured away to a house of ill-fame—I forget the name of the court I went to, but the officer knows—she robbed me of this money, and two purses—four sovereigns, seven shillings, and two half-crowns, that was in a red and brown purse, and there was another purse in my other pocket, empty—she had an opportunity of taking it, for the officer found a portion of the money on her the following morning—I was not with her more than three minutes—I did not pay her—I was to have done so, but I</p>

               <p>could not after she robbed me—there was not the least dispute about it—I am sure she is the person—I was not always so certain—I should be very sorry to be too positive against the prisoner; only from the officer find<lb></lb>ing on her a part of my property, but I am sure I should have recollected her from her dialect alone—she is Irish.</p>

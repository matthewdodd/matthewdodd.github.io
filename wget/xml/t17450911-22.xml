               <p>Q What Business are you?</p>
               <p>Bolley. I am a <rs id="t17450911-22-viclabel111" type="occupation">Jeweller</rs>

After that they stopped my mouth with a handkerchief, and picked my pocket, and swore if I offered to cry out they would murder me (they are all, my Lord, supposed to be of the Black Boy alley crow, for they have been dispersed since the alley has been take up.) Then they dragged me into a house in Moses an Aaron alley, and there they stripped me of the rest of my money, which was about 8 s. my jewels, and the things which I had about me. I have got one pair of ear rings by the means of a person who gave me instructions where to find them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got them here?</p>
               <p>Bolley. No, the pawnbroker has them in her custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say the Prisoner has any of your jewels ?</p>
               <p>Bolley . No, but she was in company with the other women , both in the street and in the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . Ask him whether he ever saw my face before ?</p>
               <p>Q. Pray recollect how you came to know her face again ?</p>
               <p>Bolley . I was exactly against a lamp, and this particular person [the Prisoner] and 2 more, I could swear to. I am positive by the sight I had of her by the lamp, that she is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since she was taken up?</p>
               <p>Bolley. It is a good while since, but she was taken in the same alley by one of the thieftakers, who I employed to do it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were three poor creatures before, besides myself, who were taken up upon this account, one of them can give you an account that she heard the Prosecutor say, he knew where they were in pawn.</p>

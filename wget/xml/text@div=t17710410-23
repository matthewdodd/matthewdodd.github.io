I did not leave any body in my house; it was Mr. Sibber's house; it became my house upon his death; he left it me in his will; he had been dead six days. I came to town that morning. I was informed the house was broke open; the back parlour windows were broke; it had outside shutters, which appeared to be wrenched off with a chissel, and then the sash must have been lifted up; there was a parlour door broke, and the locks of a beauset broke all to pieces, in which Mr. Sibber kept all his papers, and the papers were thrown all about the room.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Moorfields. I was beating my hour about 3 o'clock on a Tuesday morning in November, the latter end of the month; when I had walked about thirty yards from my stand I saw three men coming with three large bundles; I clapp'd hold of the first man's bundle, and insisted upon knowing what he had got there; he attempted to pull it away; at last he let it go; I turned round to see if the other two were coming upon me; they sheered off. I threw that bundle over the wall; and then I followed the other two; I left that man to secure the other two; I stuck between the posts; the second man dropped his bundle within a few yards of the next stand to mine; then I followed the third man as close as I could across Moorfields: there were several things dropped out as he went along; I did not attend to them but pursued him, and called out to Finsbury watchmen, but they did not come time enough, and the man got off. I kept the things three days, and then advertised them. Mrs. Hogshaw claimed them; she came to the Three Compasses in King-street, and sent for me; I carried the goods to her and she owned them; these are the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Norland Place, Notting Hill—in April last, the prisoner came to me and represented himself as coming from a friend of mine at St. Leonard's, Dr. Blundell—he produced several articles from newspapers, on scientific subjects, and asked if I would revise them for him, as he was a foreigner—he entered very largely into various points connected with science and medicine—as I was pressed for time, I asked him to let me know precisely what he wanted—he then produced a telegram purporting to come from the Marquis de Beaufort, of France, and said he had no money, and requested me to give him some; he also represented that he was a connexion of Sir Robert Anstruther, who I knew personally, and the Rev. Canon Melville, who I knew by reputation, and on the strength of that I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he promised to return on the Monday—I did not see him again until he was in custody—he also represented that he was a freemason, and from that I should probably have been induced to give him some portion of the money, though not the whole amount—I should not have given him the whole of the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. but for the statement that he was a connexion of Sir Robert Anstruther and Canon Melville.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How long did our conversation last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About an hour—it was at the latter part of it that I gave you the money—I don't recollect asking whether you had any relatives in England—I said it was a singular thing that you should come to a stranger for money, if you had any acquaintances in London, and you said you had none—you said you wanted it to pay your lodging at Hampton Court—I should probably not have given you more than a shilling, from your being a mason—you said you were a medical student, who was desirous of qualifying for a member<lb></lb>ship of the College of Surgeons, in London—you asked me to advance you a little money until you received the money which the telegram represented would be given to you on the Monday—I lent you the money, not because of the telegram, but because I thought you were a literary man in distress, and because you represented yourself to be a relative of Sir Robert Anstruther and Canon Melville—I had no other reason—I had never seen you before—you said you were connected with Sir Robert Anstruther, and you stated something about a Baron Anstrude, in the North of France, who was a connexion of his—you made no statement as to what was your con<lb></lb>nexion with Canon Melville—I gave you the money on the strength of your being a personal friend and connexion of a friend of mine, Sir Robert Anstruther.</p>

                  </hi>. I took the prisoner into custody on 13th May, in New Street, New Cut—I told him I held a warrant for his wrest for obtaining 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by false pretences, from the Rev. Cosmo Reed Gordon—I searched his lodgings, and found a quantity of papers, among others a pedigree of Sir Wyndham C. Anstruther, in which was mentioned the connexion of the Baron de Anstrute, of France, with Sir Robert Anstruther—I also found some cards engraved, "Le Conte de Beaufort," and others—on the way to the station he wanted to know how I had obtained his address—I said I should not tell him—he said "Well, I had a warning letter, I was a great fool; however, you came a little too late for a good many things"—Sir Robert Anstruther is not here, he is in Scotland.</p>

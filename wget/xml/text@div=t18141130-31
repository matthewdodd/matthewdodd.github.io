When I came to the top of that place, there are five posts, and when I came up to a small house, I heard these people, they were going the same road as I was. There are two roads, one a gravel road, and the other not. When I came into the middle of the field, a tall man came from the right hand; he passed me; I looked at him; I did not like the look of him; he knocked me down; I up with my umbrella I had then to keep him off; I was not afraid of one man; before I could get my arm to strike him, I was pinioned by two more men. Seagrim, the man at the bar, put the pistol up to my head; he is one of the two men now at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were pinioned by the man, what did that man to you - A. There were two men, that pinioned me; this was one of them, and that slapped the pistol at my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Of the two men that pinioned you, Seagrim you, say was one - A. He was one.</p>
               <p>Q. He held the pistol at your head - A. Yes; the other man who has has since got away, he came to me and demanded my money and my watch; I hesitated about it. When the man, who is now away said, damn you, none of your airs, if you do not deliver up your money immediately, you are a dead man. The man who has got away took my money, and this pistol this man kept at my hand the whole time. They tried to get the watch out; the chain broke.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did they take - A. A half guinea in gold, a three shilling bank token, and an eighteen penny piece and a shilling, to the best of my knowledge. I lost my watch too; when my watch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300021"></xptr>chain broke, one of them said, damn him, out with it, or you are a dead man.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them said that - A. I think Seagrim mentioned that. I immediately unbuttoned the waistband of my pantaloons that I had on, in order that they might take the watch. They got at my watch: they did not leave me. I entreated of them not to hurt me. I told them I was a man of a very large family. A bludgeon then came over my head; I was knocked down; after seeing the bludgeon at my head, I forgot the pistol, and made a plunge and got away. I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not Seagrim that knocked you down, was it - A. No, not Seagrim that knocked me down; than they left me on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. From first to last, how long might they be with you - A. I suppose ten minutes nearly, I cannot exactly ascertain the time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Seagrim stand behind you, or in the front of you - A. In the front of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark or not - A. It was not moon light, nor it was not very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been out long - A. I left my home in the morning; I came direct from Sun-street at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was it from Sun-street to were this happened - A. About three quarters of a mile; it was not so dark but what I crossed out of a little puddle that laid just in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make such observations of Seagrim as to be sure of him - A. I am certain of Seagrim, I am confident of him; I cannot identify the other man. I only know that there were three of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of your property since - A. Yes; here are the seals in the hands of the pawnbroker.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to this, because it is broken; it has been broken some time, I have had it this twelvemonth, that was to the watch that night; I have seen no other part of the property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then I am to understand from you, this seal there is no mark upon it that you know it by, it is a common seal with no impression at all - A. It is so common that I know that is the seal; I do not recollect that ever I saw such a seal.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, the key you say, that is broken - A. I can swear that is my watch-key.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, that you never saw these three persons before that night - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about ten o'clock - A. It was about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. You tell me, it was light enough to see the person of a man - A. It was light enough to see a pistol at my head, and therefore I could see a man.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no opportunity of knowing either of the men before - A. I never saw them before.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, can you take upon you to swear to a man you never saw before at ten o'clock - A. I saw a puddle of water so as to get out of the way; I could see a man to be sure; I could see water three or four yards before me.</p>
               <p>Q. From the circumstance of your being able to discover a puddle of water, therefore you could swear to a man you had never seen before - A. I believe upon my oath that is the man that put the pistol to my head; I am certain I could see the man's face.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you always been of that opinion that you could swear positively to the person of the man - A. I have, from the first time I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you say so before the magistrate - A. I think I identified Seagrim; I do not pretend to identify the other. I think I said to the best of my recollection Seagrim was the person that held the pistol at my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, before the magistrate, did not you say that you believed that he was the man - A. I said, I believed he was the man; I never deviated from that man, from the first time I saw him, I had no doubt at all of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that you never before the magistrate said you believed, and believed only he was the man - A. I do not recollect I said so; I am confident I never deviated from that man, from the first time I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that you believed, or swore positively; did you use the term you believed him to to be the man - A. I had no doubt of his being the man; I never doubted of his being the man at the first onset before the magistrate, I said he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the robbery was it that you were before the magistrate - A. On the Wednesday evening I think they were taken, and I think on the Thursday, the day after they were taken before the magistrate; the robbery was on Saturday; on Wednesday evening they were taken; I believed him to be the man when the officers took him in custody; I said before the magistrate that he was the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Partridge, looking at him now, have you any doubt of his being the man - A. I have no doubt at all of his being the man that put the pistol at my head.</p>

            . I saw the two prisoners at the Westmoreland Arms; I went in there about nine o'clock, and took some steaks; them two men and another stouter was in there. I asked them if they knew any thing of the fighting men; they said, they did, and they knew the black fighting man. I went to my partner, and said, there were three men in there that I did not like.</p>
               <p>Seagrim's Defence. I bought the pistol about six month ago; the landlady used to keep the pistol below stairs, we used to use it; by that means I kept the pistol up stairs. The week before I was robbed of fifteen shillings in mile End Road, on Wednesday evening, when these gentlemen took me, in consequence of my being robbed the week before, I put the pistol into my pocket, and when I came to Clerkenwell, the person that was to meet me there was not there. I went to Sadler's Wells; it was closed for the season; from thence I was coming home, and on my coming from Sadler's Wells I passed a person I never saw before to my knowledge. I asked the nearest way to Whitechapel. He said he was going to Hoxton; he would shew me the

            . We went across the fields; whether there was a path or not I cannot say; he took us to a gateway; in our going there these gentlemen immediately rushed upon us; and on the same day I was taken I met a person, he asked me if I would buy a bargain; he shewed me this seal and key; he told me I should have them for fifteen shillings; I said I had no such money in my pocket, I had only ten shillings. I gave him ten shillings for them, at the same time I was short of silver. I sent a person to pledge this seal for seven shillings; the person that I bought it off appeared to be in a sailor's dress.</p>

I am an officer—I was on duty at Kensington between twelve and one o'clock in the morning of the 11th of Aug.—there was a mob, and I attempted to take a party into custody—the prisoner walked across the road, put his hand into his right hand pocket, drew out something which I thought was a stone, and knocked me down—I was senseless and my head was bleeding—I am certain the prisoner is the man that did it—I had not spoken to him at all—I was carried to the toll-house, and I suppose I was there an hour and a half—the surgeon who dressed the wound has left his master, and is not here—I am not well yet.</p>

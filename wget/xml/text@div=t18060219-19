               <p>Q. Do you think he was sober. - A. I think he was, he turned round and walked up the court, it being no thoroughfare, he opened the gate and went into a stone mason's yard, where I stopped him; I produce the kettle, it is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it, I had been making rather free with liquor, I do not recollect being in the house; I had been fourteen weeks out of employment, I had a bad arm, and when I found I was not able to do any laborious work, I went to get into the army of defence; they would not have me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your arm well now. - A. No; I went to Tower Hill to get a ship, my arm being bad, and I being old, they would not take me.</p>

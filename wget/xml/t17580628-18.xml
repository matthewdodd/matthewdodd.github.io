I received information he had taken some of my stone, and used it at another place. When I came to settle accounts with him he denied he had used any of my stone any where else, only a little bit he had given to a relation in Long-acre. I took him before justice Welch, and there he denied the same.</p>

            . I was at the sawing of a copeing stone, and carrying it, and putting it up in the house of Mrs. Marshall in Gerrard-street.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose order did you saw and carry it there?</p>
               <p>Thomas. By the prisoner's order; as he was intrusted by Mr. Townshend, I did not know but that he had given the prisoner an order to have that done.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I can't exactly tell the time, but as near as I can remember, it is half a year ago or better.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Townshend. Did you every employ the prisoner to put up that copeing stone in Gerrard-street ?</p>
               <p>Townshend. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. I have been employed by my master as a journeyman for seven years, whether he ever found fault with me before?</p>
               <p>Townshend. No, I never had any reason to suspect him, if I had, I should not have made him my foreman in this building; he sent me down the men's time they worked every two or three weeks, but no account of this work for Mrs. Marshall.</p>

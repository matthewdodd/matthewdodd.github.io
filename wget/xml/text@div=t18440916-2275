I was going on board from the quay, and saw the prisoner coming over the ship's side with a jacket under his arm belonging to John Irwin, the carpenter—I asked him whose jacket it was—he said it was his own—I told him it was the carpenter's—I spoke to the officers, and gave the prisoner into custody—he was working on board the day before.</p>

At half-past three o'clock in the afternoon of the 24th of Aug. the prisoner was given into my custody for stealing this jacket—he said he went on board to get a draught of water, and went into the carpenter's berth, and took the jacket—he afterwards said it was distress that drove him to it.</p>

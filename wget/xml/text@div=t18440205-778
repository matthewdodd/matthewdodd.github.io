                  </hi>. I am a brushmaker, and live at Walthamstow—I keep pigeons in a loft over a stable, and a wash-house. On Monday morning, the 22nd of Jan., I fed them, and saw they were all safe—there were from sixty to seventy—on the Tuesday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I found the lattice door of the loft and the area door broken—the person had got over the pigstye—there were thirty pigeons missing—they were valuable—the prisoner had come to my house for employment five or six weeks before—he, wished to build a shed for me, but I did not allow him to do so—he came on my premises at that time, and saw the pigeons, and remarked to my man that they were very fine ones—on the Friday after the robbery I found four of my pigeons at Mr. Puryer's, in Hare-street, Bethnal-green—he de<lb></lb>scribed to me the person from whom he had them—in consequence of that I went with a police-sergeant to the prisoner's house, at No. 11, Hope-terrace, Bow-common, and in a back bed-room found fifteen of my pigeons—I then went into a shed in the yard, and out of a number of pigeons which were there, I selected three, which are all marked, and I can swear they are mine—this is one of them—it is a red-beard, and is marked on the wing—here is another which is marked on the wing—another, with a white feather in the tail, which was marked by myself—here is another, which if called an almond-drag, which is not to be matched in London—I value it at a guinea.</p>

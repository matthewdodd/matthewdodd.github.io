                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife. On Saturday night, 22nd June, about 8 o'clock, the prisoner came into the room—I then took the baby up-stairs to bed, came back, and he was still there—he took some money out of his pocket, gave me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and put 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back into his pocket—I said, "I thought you would give me another shilling"—he swore very much and said he had got no things, and that money was to buy him some—he got up and wrenched the 8$. out of my hand—I held it tight—he gave me a blow on the head and arm with his fist—my head was cut open—a blow came into my eye which was so violent that I raised my arm, and said, "Oh! pray don't;" and he said, "You b—r, I will break your arm"—I was on the ground, and he knelt on me—I became insensible—when I came to myself I was in a neighbour's house—my head was bleeding dreadfully—I was covered with blood, and was taken to the London Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same street as the prisoner—I heard a great noise, went there, and saw the prisoner kneeling on his wife, and moving his arm as if he was cutting her throat—I saw nothing in his band—I screamed out and a neighbour came—the prisoner rose up, jumped towards me, and said, "I will murder you, you b—r"—I jumped back out of his way—a policeman came, and the prisoner told him if he had his coat off he would serve him the same, and be would rip his b—y guts open the first time he passed his door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon to the London Hos<lb></lb>pital. The prosecutrix was brought there, I found a lacerated wound, half an inch long, and not very deep, on the left side of the forehead, and the whole of the left side of the face was severely bruised—in my judgment, some blunt instrument caused the wound—there was no bruise round it, which would have been likely if it had been done with the fist—the injuries were not dangerous—she was three weeks under ray care.</p>

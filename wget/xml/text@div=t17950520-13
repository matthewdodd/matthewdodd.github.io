             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a bricklayer. I was going along Grub-street, the 11th of this month, and I see the prisoner Barker before me, it was between two and three, he had got a parcel of nails on his shoulder, as though he had been coming from the ironmongers, I knew that he was a carpenter, and had worked in some premises of mine for Mr. Patch. I see him go into an old iron shop, and Grub-street; curiousity led me to watch what he was going to do there, and I walked backwards and forwards by the iron shop and I heard something rattle in the scale like nails, and going by the second time, I heard somebody say, there is four pounds; I watched him out, and see the paper much reduced. I could not see any body particularly in the shop, it was so barricadoed with iron things. I then watched him home to his master's shop, and see him deposit the remaining quantity of nails that he had on a work bench. I sent for an officer and had him taken up, knowing Mr. Patch to he gone into the country. I then went into Moor-lane and go an officer, and went to the house where I see the man go in and come out again. I went into the shop and asked this prisoner whether she had bought some nails? she said she had bought four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200017"></xptr>pounds; says I, there are the nails I believe, pointing to a quantity of nails that laid in an old frying pan or stew pan, or something like it; she said, yes, they are. The officer that was with me then took the nails to weigh them, and she said there was another quantity in the pan before them, and they were not all of one sort, but on examining them they appeared to be all of one sort, and they weighed seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they new or old? - New nails. I asked her how she could be so imprudent to buy new nails coming from an iromongers and out of a paper as they were of a man that she must know to be a carpenter by his apron? she said they were not shot out of a paper, they were shot out of a bag, I gave the constable charge of her and the nails.</p>
               <p>Jury. What nails are they? - They are what the ironmongers call threepenny trunks.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the parcel of nails that he laid on the board? - I gave them to the officer, they weighed ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You was merely passing by at this time that you see the prisoner? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. He had something that appeared to you to be nails? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were wrapped up, I take it for granted, in brown paper? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see them open in Barker's custody? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether they were nails or not, till you went into Simpson's house, you did not know? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when you came to Simpson's house, she immediately told you that she had bought something? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She told you what she had paid for them? - She did; she had bought four pounds, and paid two shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house were they? - On the opposite side of the counter on a shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. Not concealed? - Nothing more than any thing else in the shop.</p>
               <p>- BOGGY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an ironmonger. The man came to me as his master for some three penny trunck nails, about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.What quantity did he ask for? - No particular quantity, I gave him two thousand, which weigh seventeen pounds and a half.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Are you an ironmonger for yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You carry on the business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.These nails were your property of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold them to him? - Yes, for his master.</p>
               <p>Q. His master never had them delivered over to him? - I don't know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q.What were they worth? - Thirteen pence halfpenny per pound, the paper was not marked.</p>

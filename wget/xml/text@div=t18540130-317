                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, M</hi> 17). The prisoner was a police constable in the same division; he has been a good many years in the police force—I should say, nearly sixteen years. On the morning of 13th Jan., he was on duty in Bermondsey—it is part of my duty to go round the beats, and see whether the constables are on their beats—between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning of the 13th, I went round the beat in Bermondsey-street—I know the house of William Carpenter in that street; it is No. 101—it is in the parish of St. Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey—as I approached the house, I saw the door standing partly open, about half a foot open, I should say, and there was a light proceeding from between the door post and the door—I should say I was not more than a yard from the window shutter of the house at that time, I was walking very near the house—as I passed by I saw the light, and I looked in and saw a man standing in the shop—he had a light, standing against the partition with it in his hand; it was a lighted piece of paper—it went out—I was not aware at first that it was a policeman—I looked in again, and I saw him then light a piece of paper from his lamp and put it against the partition—the paper on the partition caught light; it was not very much that was alight—the paper that was on the partition did not appear to burn freely; the paper that he had in his hand burnt the most; however, I saw the fire on the paper go up between the crevices in the partition—the partition is here—when I saw that, I cried out, "Woods, what are you about?"—I knew then who it was; I saw his number reflected from the light that was in his hand—when I spoke to him, he put his hand and knocked the fire out, the light that was on the paper—(<hi rend="italic">producing the partition</hi>) this is where the fire was going on—this is where I saw the paper, and the fire went up here—I only saw the light going up here (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—when I called to him, he put the light out—he knocked the fire out with his hand; it was out in an instant—when I said to him, "Woods, what are you about?" he said, "If I had not come in, the house would have been on fire"—I asked him if he had called the inmates; he said he had, and shortly after that I heard a voice from up stairs, and Woods then cried out, "Carpenter!"—that was all I heard him say—Mr. Carpenter then came down into the shop—I was outside all this time; the prisoner was inside—I saw Woods showing Carpenter round the place with his light in his hand—it was his lantern that he had in his hand—he was not with Carpenter in the shop above two or three minutes, I suppose: not</p>

               <p>five minutes at the outside—after he had shown Carpenter round the shop, I took him to the station house—he came to the door—I asked him what he had been doing; he made no reply, and I then said I should take him to the station house and state the case to sergeant Reed, who was on duty, which I did—the prisoner did not say anything—I took him to the station, and told him, in sergeant Reed's presence, what I saw, and then sergeant Reed desired me to go and acquaint inspector Branford of the circumstance—I told sergeant Reed, in the prisoner's presence, that I saw him put the piece of paper in the lamp, and set alight to the partition—the prisoner did not make any observation on my stating that—I afterwards went back to the house of Mr. Carpenter—I examined the street door, and saw that the hasp had been forced out of the door—it was picked up and given to me by a witness; I did not see it picked up—inspector Branford knocked the partition down in my presence—it was a fixture, nailed up; we had to use a hammer to knock it down—I saw a parasol in the shop—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>ducing it</hi>)—it was standing on the opposite side of the partition, at the back—it was not close to the partition, it was standing about a foot from it, or it might be more—there is a window, and the partition divided it—one side is where Carpenter works, and the other side is a window, where he puts his umbrellas—the parasol was on the work bench—it appears to have been burnt; there are marks of fire on it—I saw it after I came back to the shop—I did not notice it in the first instance—this is the piece of the paper that was on the partition (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it was taken off in my presence; it is burnt—it was taken off after we returned—I saw it removed that same night, when I came back from the station—these are the ashes from the paper that we picked up afterwards, that had dropped underneath.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not exactly understand about this partition; you say a piece of paper was torn off when you went back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, this piece—the inspector tore it off; I did not do it—I am sure I do not know why it was done—it was a part of the burnt paper—he took hold of it with his fingers, and tore it off; it came off easily—at that time the light had been extinguished—this partition stood nearly in the centre of the shop, nearly in the centre of the window—it is the partition that divides the window—there are umbrellas in both windows—it does not divide the shop itself, it only goes part of the way across the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the whole of the partition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is not; we sawed off this piece of it—it is larger than this—this is the whole width of the partition—adjoining it on the other side is glass—it divides the window into two.</p>

               <p>second time I had been round on that night—it might have been just before 11 o'clock that I had seen the prisoner before—it was as near about 11 o'clock as could be—Bermondsey-street is a thoroughfare—it is a considerable thoroughfare in the day time—it is a thoroughfare at all times—there are a great many more persons pass through in the day time than at night—I have been in the force, I should say, fourteen years last July—the prisoner has been in the force longer than me—he is entitled to a pension after fifteen years service if he is passed unlit by the surgeon—the amount depends upon that—his would be 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for life, if he was passed as disabled—some men only get 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and some 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he might be entitled to 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for life—I do not know whether he has made any application about a pension—Mr. Carpenter sells combs, and different things, besides umbrellas—the outer door was open, so that I could see the prisoner—it was not wide open, it was pulled about half a foot open, or it might be a little more—you have to go down a step to reach the door—it is a small house, and it has got a ware-house <hi rend="italic">overneath</hi> it where they keep wool, a kind of loft—it is a very old house, one of the <hi rend="italic">ancientest</hi> buildings in the street—the prisoner has been in the same division as I have ever since I have been in it—we have done duty together for years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember that in 1848, in capturing a burglar, he received a violent blow on his neck with a brick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard so; that is the tradition of the force—I have heard that at another time, in 1849, his head was broken, and that he was laid up about six weeks in the hospital—I believe he has had a great many blows from first to last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Don't you know that he was six weeks in the hospital, and that he was delirious during a great portion of that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see him during that time, but I know very well that he has been knocked about a good deal—he had his eye knocked open, and was laid up for some days, I believe—I know that he received a stab in the thigh in the course of the performance of his duty—I do not know of my own knowledge that he was laid up for ten days that time, the inspector will be able to tell you—I know a man of the name of Mehennick—I believe he lives with Woods; I do not know that he does now, he did—he did so three or four months ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has Woods, or Mrs. Woods, ever spoken to you about your quarrelling with your wife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never; I do not know that my wife at any time ran away from me and went to Woods' house—I went there and inquired if she was there, and Mrs. Woods said that she was not; that is all I know—that was every word that passed—Mehennick lived there at that time—I did not say that I would learn or teach Mehennick not to harbour my wife—I swear that I never said that—I asked Mrs. Woods if my wife was there, and she said, "No;" I do not recollect anything else passing, I walked away again—I did not, that I am aware of, say, "I will teach" or" learn Mehennick to harbour my wife"—I have no recollection of saying so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you did not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recollection of saying so.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you say that you did not make an accusation against him when I asked you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at that time I did not—two days afterwards I did—I do not recollect saying anything of the kind to Mrs. Woods about teaching Mehennick to harbour my wife—I have been examined before as a witness.</p>
               <p>

               <p>your recollection; will you swear you did not say so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recol<lb></lb>lection of saying it; Mehennick has retired from the force—he has got a pension of 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was a sergeant; the prisoner was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since the prisoner's committal have you applied for a copy of the depositions, pending this accusation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked Mr. Tandy if he would oblige me with a copy of the depositions; he is one of the clerks of the police court—I asked him for a copy merely for my own guidance—it was not for the purpose of reading over what I had said before the Magistrate; it was merely for to see, for to look over, that was all—I got the depositions—Mr. Tandy is a clerk at the Southwark police court—I did not pay him for them—I did not get the whole of them, only my own evidence—I did not get it for the purpose of reading it ever, I had it for my own guidance—I did not get it for the purpose of reading it over before I gave my testi<lb></lb>mony here to-day; I had it merely for my own guidance, that is all.</p>

               <p>lights in the window was left burning—the fire was not alight; there had been a fire in the day time, but it had gone out—I cannot say to a minute or two when it had gone out; but I observed that it was out, and that was why I went up stairs to my room—there are two gas burners in the shop, but only one was alight at the time I went up stairs, that was the one in the window; it was within, I suppose, three or four feet of the partition—the gas is usually turned off when we shut up; but on this sight I went up stairs about that time, and sent the boy down a conside<lb></lb>rable time after to shut up, he was doing a little for his mother—we were shut up when I went to bed, not at half past 9 o'clock; I sent the boy down after that to put out the gas, and to shut up the shutters; that was after 10 o'clock—about 12 o'cloak I was awoke by my wife—I heard a noise in the shop, once, and only once; I thought it was the transparency that had fallen down; I thought the cat had knocked it down—my wife went to the head of the stairs, and I heard her call out three times, and after that I heard a voice call once "Carpenter"—on that I went down; I had not any light with me up stairs—I did not take any light down with me into the shop—I found one policeman in the shop, and one at the door—I now believe the prisoner is the man that I found in the shop; I was not aware of it at the time—he had a light with him; it was a lantern or lamp like policemen usually carry—I did not observe any other—I spoke first and said, I would kick my boy's backside for leaving the door open; seeing the door open, and the two men there, I thought it was so—the policeman said, "What for?" I said, "For leaving the door open, and troubling you and disturbing me"—he said "Is that all? or, "Is there anything else?"—I cannot say the exact words, it was one or the other—I said that was all that I knew of did he know of anything? And as I made that remark, I observed a sheet of <hi rend="italic">Lloyds Newspaper</hi> that had been tacked over a broken square, was out, and the transparency standing sideways down—I said, "This has been torn out since I went to bed, but it is of no consequence, I did not set any value upon it"—the policeman made a further remark, I believe, and then he made the obser<lb></lb>vation about fire; that there had been a fire, or there was fire, one of those two he mentioned—he threw the light upon the burnt partition as he stood, and I observed it on the moment, and then went up and saw it, and clapped my hand upon it, and found it warm—I saw that some of the paper had been burnt, it was black, charred—this is the partition—none of the paper on the partition had been burnt at the time I went up to bed, on the night of the 12th—upon seeing the paper burnt, I remarked, that I conceived I had not an enemy in the world to do me such an injury as this; and I said it had been done wilfully—I said, "Whoever has done this, it has not been done accidentally; God knows who could have had such a spite against me as to do me such a wilful injury as this"—at the same moment I saw this parasol on the bench on the other side of the partition, part of it seems to have been burnt—it was not in that state when I went up stairs on the previous night, it was sound, we were going to hang it outside the shop the following morning; it had been only painted the pre<lb></lb>vious day; it was not folded up—it was standing open on my work bench; my wife had only had the fringe tacked on that evening, and I told the boy not to lay it under the bench, because it would get dirty, and he put it on the bench—it was at one end of the bench, nearest the partition; it was put there about 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening—I called the policeman's attention to the parasol—he remarked that it might possibly have been done by the</p>

               <p>gas pipes, not by the gas lamps, but by the pipes; he said there was no gas on at the time he was in—the pipes are plain to be seen along the ceiling—the policeman turned his bull's eye on to the pipes when he made that remark; I replied, with all due respect to the Court, "D—d nonsense"—I said that, because I considered it was an impossibility to be fired that way—the policeman made no answer to it; the other policeman was still standing at the door at this time—he called to the one that was in the shop, "Woods, come here;" and he went out immediately—when I was going to close the door after he had gone, I found that the bottom catch, the hasp of the door, was off—I then dressed myself; the boy came down, after me—I was down first after I had dressed myself, and the boy and his mother came down together just afterwards—I did not see the boy pick up the hasp, I was at the other part of the shop—I had known the prisoner a good while before this as a police officer—I was never much acquainted with him, but I had spoken to him, and had seen him on the beat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gross-examined. Q.</hi> He had always behaved civilly to you, I hope, as a policeman on duty in the neighbourhood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have known him several years on duty there, I cannot say for a year or two; he knew me before he was in the force at all; he has always behaved to me in a civil and friendly way—I have no reason to speak otherwise than well of him—I do not know that the boy is a careless boy, he has received a very fair edu<lb></lb>cation—I do not consider that he is a careless boy—there are two gas lights in the window, one on each side of the partition—the gas pipes are carried along the ceiling, and then come down—they do not pass through the partition; they pass by the top of it, it does not touch it, it is within as inch or so of it, and then is carried down to a fight in the window—that is about three or four feet from the partition—I should say I had been speak<lb></lb>ing to the policeman a minute or two before I heard the other policeman say, "Woods, come here"—I think I had.</p>

On the night this matter occurred I shut the outer door about 20 minutes after 10 o'clock—I fastened it, by putting the latch into the hasp—there was a lodger out—he had a key to let himself in—I am sure the hasp was safe, and the latch catched—I put out the gas as soon as I had shut up—there were no lights burning then at all; there was only one light; that was in the window—the one in the centre of the shop was not alight—I put that out safely, and then went up stairs—I did not go to bed; I went into the room where my mother sleeps; I sleep in the same room—I went to bed about half past 11 o'clock; that was after Mr. Carpenter—I left my mother up—she had a candle in the room—I did not get up when this disturbance took place—I came down I after the policeman was gone—I picked up the latch of the door eleven feet from the door, inside; I measured it—it was where the stairs come, close</p>

I was the inspector of the station at Bermondsey-street when Squire brought Woods there in custody—I was in the charge room—the charge was made by Squires, in the hearing of the prisoner—he detailed to me what he had seen—the prisoner made no observation at that time—I sent Sergeant Squire to Inspector Bradford for instructions—the prisoner at that time was in the passage leading to the stairs—he was in the passage, by himself; about five or seven minutes; it might be ten minutes, but not more—nothing was taken from him when he first came to the station—I did not see his lantern when he first came in; after the expiration of the ten minutes he had his lantern—I went and took it from him—he said, "Here it is, just as I took it out at 9 o'clock, it has never been alight"—upon that I looked at the wick; it appeared to me to have been newly cut, fresh cut; it appeared to have been cut since it had been burnt—there was not the least appear<lb></lb>ance of burning about the wick—I kept that lamp in my possession—I showed it to Mortlock, the lamp trimmer, the following morning—it was then in the same condition as when I took it from the prisoner—I had kept it in the mean time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it the custom in the police for men to receive rewards if they give notice of a fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is generally a reward for the discovery of a fire; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

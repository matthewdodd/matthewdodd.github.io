On the 16th of July I was near Union-street, Little Moorfields, about half-past five o'clock—there was a great crowd of persons and a general piece of work in Moor-lane—I saw Marney strike a shoemaker a very violent blow in the mouth—I went up to Marney, and before I touched him he struck at me both right and left in the face—I had not done anything to him—he got me down and kicked me violently in the thigh and in the mouth—Carter came to my assistance—I got up again and secured Marney—Burt kicked me several times about the legs and thighs, and endeavoured to rescue Marney from me—I afterwards saw him kick several times at Regan, and at last he succeeded in kicking him so as to prevent him from giving any further assistance—I should say the kicks were given decidedly with the</p>

I was in Moor-lane—there was a disturbance—I saw Marney beckon a shoemaker over to him, and as soon as he got over he struck him very violently in the face—Bull went towards Marney immediately—Marney struck him right and left in the face, and knocked him down—Bull had not done anything to him—I went to Bull's assistance—Marney struck me twice in the face—I laid hold of his collar—Burt and another laid hold of me and pulled me away, and Burt kicked me in the groin—he appeared to kick with the design of kicking me there.</p>

I was in Moor-lane, and saw Marney assaulting Bull—I went up and laid hold of Marney—I requested Bull to assist me in pulling him down on the pavement—I held him down, and should have succeeded, perhaps, in securing him, but a female came and loosened his collar—he got up and renewed his assault on Bull—I took him off with my left arm, and endeavoured to hold him at arm's length till assistance came—he kicked at me, and at last kicked me violently in the private parts—I was bent double, and was forced to go into a coal-shed—Marney was then lying on his back and kicking violently—I was in great pain, and did not notice much of the proceedings after that—I have been in great pain at different times since.</p>

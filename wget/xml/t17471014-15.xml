It was with great Difficulty that the Court could get her to speak particularly of the Affair. When she did speak she declared, that when they were in the Field he threw her down upon the Grass, and stopp'd her Mouth with an Handkerchief, and it did appear that he had carnal Knowledge of her. She said, she cry'd out Murder several Times; and that there were People in the Field, but were at a great Distance, and none came to her Assistance. She was ask'd, how she could cry out if her Mouth was stopp'd? She answer'd, she got the Handkerchief on one side, and could cry out, and the young Child was playing about upon the Grass at the same Time. The Prisoner, she said, came home with her afterwards, and she never told her Mother of it for near a Month, for fear she should beat her, and then it was by Discovery the Mother had made of the Child's Disorder. It appear'd that this young Villain had given this Child the foul Disease; it seems he work'd all that Month, in the Yard where this Child and her Parents lived; afterwards she was ask'd, If he ever attempted any such thing afterwards? She answered, No. These being the Circumstances, it was not proved to the Satisfaction of the Court that it was a Rape; he coming Home with the Child: she making no Discovery of it, till she was forced to it; and his continuing to work in the Yard; on these Accounts the Prisoner, who richly deserved severe Punishment, was <rs id="t17471014-15-verdict82" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Philip Lorton, of Bishopsgate-street. On the 19th of August the prisoner came to our shop, and asked about a coat—I thought I saw him take a piece of linen off the shelf—I said I would send for a policeman—he said, "Oh, don't," and when he found I insisted on having one, he drew from his coat pocket two waistcoats, and threw them on the counter—they were not Lorton's.</p>

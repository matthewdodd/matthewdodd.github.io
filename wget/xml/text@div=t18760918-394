                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Walford Arms, Stoke Newington Road—on September 7th, about 6.30 I served the prisoner with a half-pint of four-half and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he put 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the Walford Arms—on 7th September I saw the prisoner leaving the bar—I spoke to my sister, and in consequence of what she said I looked in the till and found a bad shilling and a few coppers, no other silver—I went after the prisoner and found him standing in the street next door—I showed him the shilling and said "Do you know anything about this?" and he said "No, nothing"—I proceeded to take him to the station, and had my left hand on his right arm—he took a coin out of his waistcoat pocket at the corner of Gordon Road and put it into his mouth—I am not sure whether it was a shilling or a florin—I struggled with him and caught him by the throat and tried to get it from him—he fell, I left go of him and some person picked him up—on the way to the station he put another coin in his mouth—I asked him what he was doing, he said "Nothing, there is no occasion to swallow this". putting a good half a crown out between his teeth—I afterwards saw it, and it was good, there was blood on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Nearly 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was found on him at the station and every piece was good—he made no resistance—I took him by the throat when he put something to his mouth and tried to press his throat so that he could not swallow, but he did swallow it, because it was not in his mouth when he got up and it was not on the ground—I cannot swear that he did not put the first piece between his teeth to try it—I got him by the throat I did not hold him down on the ground with my other hand—he had one hand in a sling—I did not put my band to his throat when he had the second coin in his mouth—I saw him in the house, there was one person in the bar besides him—I had cleared the till ten minutes before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> No coin was taken from the time he gave it to the time he went out—I lost my hold of him when he fell but he did not get out of my grasp.</p>

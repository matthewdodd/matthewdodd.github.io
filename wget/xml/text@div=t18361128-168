                  </hi>. I am a broker and ship-owner, and live in George-street, Tower-hill. In August last I took Henry Eason into my employ—before that I had a lad named Green in my service—I had a large quan<lb></lb>tity of papers in three boxes in my counting-house, on a shelf over my head, and also some books—I have since seen two "The Devil's bridge, and Tris<lb></lb>tram Shandy," which I got from Mr. Snelling—Eason continued in my ser<lb></lb>vice till Saturday the 5th of November—I did not discharge him then—I told him to return early on the Monday morning, but he did not—on the</p>

               <p>14th of November, in consequence of information, I examined my boxes—I found the first box empty—and little or nothing in the other two—the papers were of considerable importance to me—I have lost altogether, I should suppose, not less than 6 cwt. of paper—I also missed fifty or sixty books, bound and unbound, and old bills of lading old letters, and old paid cheques—I examined my ledgers, and found cut out of one of them, the letters G. and H. from the index—I went the same evening with Lee the officer to look for Eason—I found him at his father's house in bed—he was brought down to the parlour, and I asked him some questions—he denied the charge, and after that confessed it—in consequence of his statement, I went to the premises of the Palmers, in Swan-street, about 200 yards from where I live—they keep a kind of stationer's-shop—there was a good deal of books and papers of different sorts about—when I first went in I saw old Palmer—I asked him if he was in the habit of buying waste paper?—he said he was—I asked if he had bought any lately?—he said he could not tell—I asked if he had seen any with the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> steam-packet on it, or the name of Linder—he said no, he had not noticed it—I said there had been some thing of that sort—he said if so, it must be his son—his son came in, and I asked him—he said he could not recollect any thing of the sort, and did not know that he had bought any—I said "The fact is, I have been to a house where you sold a quantity of paper, and have taken 14 1/4 lbs. out of that quantity which has not been used"—I said they had better recollect themselves, as I should take further steps, and bring an officer to see about it—I went to the police-office the same night, saw Lee, and told him what I had discovered—I saw from 60 to 90lbs. of paper at Lambeth-street, the day following—the greater part of it had the name of "<hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> steam-packet" on it, and my name—I saw some of the cargo books, and the two I have mentioned.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 30th of August I went into Mr. Linder's service, and staid with him till the 5th of November, when I left without giving notice—the second day I was there, Morant came into the office for a printed bill of the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> steam-packet, and I gave it him—he said nothing that day—next day he came into the office and asked if I knew of any stamps that William Green used to have, when he was there, to stamp seal<lb></lb>ing-wax with—he looked into all the desks, and could not find them—I said I knew nothing about them—he said I might find them if I liked—I said I knew nothing about them—the next day I was standing at the street door—he asked me what my name was—I told him, and he told me his name was Frederick; he then said he knew where there was some paper which he could sell for waste paper, and he knew a place where he could sell it—he came next day, and took some paper out of the cupboard, which was low enough for him to reach—it was letters and books—he said he always used to go in when Green was there, and Green used to show him all the places—on the 8th of September, Morant came into the counting-house and got on my stool, and on a chest, and took the brass gun out of the model of a ship which was there—he got on my master's chair, which was a mahogany one, and scratched it with his feet—he got on it to get to the boxes on the shelf—he could not reach them from that chair, and went and got a stool with a leather top to it out of his master's, Mr. Proctor's,</p>

               <p>counting-house, which is about two doors from us—he got on it and reached to the boxes with his hand—there was a spring which shoved in, and he asked if I knew how to open it—I told him no—it was a thing which you press with the thumb—he got something out of his pocket and pressed it with it; it opened then, and there were papers in it—he opened the second box as he did the first, took all the papers out of both, put them into a pocket handkerchief, and went away—on the 10th of September I went with him to Palmer's house, in Swan-street—I did not see either of them—I stopped outside—he took things from my master's on the 9th and 10th too—I do not know what papers he took out on the 8th—he took some papers and books on the 10th—I went with him to Palmer's, about five o'clock that evening, when I went home—he went in and I staid outside—he took some big books, and a few letters on the 10th—I have seen some of them since at Lambeth-street—I am not able to point out any paper which was taken on the 8th—he took away a great handkerchief full.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Drakeford, of No. 4, Wyndham-street, Marylebone. On the afternoon of the 1st of Feb<lb></lb>ruary, between four o'clock and half-past, the prisoner came to the house and brought a piece of paper, with "Send me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by boy or bearer, "William Drakeford," written on it—I wrapped two half-crowns up in the same paper and delivered it to him—he said he had been taken on to work that day, and the other boy had been discharged because he was saucy—I had received notes on former occasions from my husband for money for his own use—believing he was the bearer of that message, as he told me he had come from him, I gave it him.</p>

               <p>Drakeford was the foreman; that he had left the employ because he was saucy; he told me to write the note; it was not my wish. I wrote what he told me, and he forged Drake ford's name; he received half the money; he said, "If you get a sovereign to get change, keep the sove<lb></lb>reign and run away with it." I told him I thought that was very wrong.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Allcock, a builder, in Well beck-street. I know the prisoner, by seeing him with a boy named Dodson, who I had discharged, but I did not take the prisoner to work—I did not send him with any paper to get money—when he was taken up he begged forgiveness—he said Dodson told him he had been before for money, and it would be all right, he would be sure to get it—I had sent other people for money, but not Dodson.</p>

On the 19th of February I met two young men in a ham and beef shop; we went and had something to drink; I had a bundle containing these things with me - I did not know the men; we went to a wine vaults, and when we had sat about a quarter of an hour, one of them took the bundle from my side; I went to go out after him and the other got in the doorway and prevented my going out - I pulled him on one side and went out; I met the one who had prevented me from getting out, in St. Martin's-court, and I took him to the watch-house - the prisoner was taken the next day, and I saw my bundle at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What dress had the man on? A. A fustian frock - I should not know him again; I should know the one who stopped me; he was a short man - they were neither of them tall; I had taken very little that night - it was not half-past eleven o'clock when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prisoner one of the two? A. I cannot say that he was; I could not speak to him before the Magistrate - I saw him on the Friday, he was very differently dressed.</p>

            . I am a parish surveyor. On Wednesday, the 20th of February, I saw the prisoner between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, in Earl-street, Seven-dials; he had this coat in a bundle; he said he brought it from Warwick-square; I said I would go with him to see if he said true: as we were going along, he said he got it from Mr. Pearce, a tailor, No. 5, Green-street, Theobald-road - I went there, and Pearce said he had not had such a thing for a fortnight; in going to the office the next day, he said a man gave him the coat to carry to Queen-street, Seven Dials, and he was to have 1s. for his trouble.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he say he was going to show this coat to an aunt of his, to show her the quality? A. I think he might; we went to his aunt's house, but she was not at home; he said he lodged there, but it was no such thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did he first tell you about his aunt? A. When I first took him - I found he had lived there, but had left.</p>

            . I am a tailor. On Tuesday night, the 19th of February, the prisoner slept at my house; he is a stay-maker, but he had been working for me on the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th; on the 19th he came in, to the best of my knowledge, from ten to twelve o'clock at night; he was in at eleven o'clock; he went to bed and did not get up till twelve o'clock the next day; he had not been ill, but when he came in, it was supper-time, and I gave him a little porter; I consider that made him sleep longer than usual.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you live? A. In Green-street. The officer came to me with the coat; he told me a young man said he was employed by me about it.</p>

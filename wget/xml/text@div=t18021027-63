               <p>Court. Q. Did you not feel any person at your pocket? - A. No; I should have known I had lost it, and that would have been all, if I had not been told of it; the pocket-book is worth about one shilling.</p>
               <p>IVERS sworn. - I am a patrol for St. George's in the East, and was coming up Ludgatehill, with a sailor, on the 22d of September, about twelve o'clock; the sailor said, there were four men who had robbed this gentleman; I asked him, if he had been robbed, he said, no; he felt, and said, he had lost his book; the sailor said, he saw them go up a court; we followed them, and saw all the four in company, in Warwick-lane; I took hold of the prisoner, who the sailor said was one; they all rushed together, and in the scrunmage they all run round us, there might be seven or eight, while we were engaging, I saw a pocket-book drop, but from whom I cannot tell, there were so many about; I scrambled and got the papers; the prisoner was near, but I cannot say who dropped it; I took the prisoner and the book to the Compter; I have kept the book from that time to this.(Produces the book, which was identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you say you saw me follow you, or night you? - A. No, not till I took you.</p>

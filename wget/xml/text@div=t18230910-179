            . I am apprentice to Mr. Benningfield; I have known the prisoner about half a year. I first met him in the Tenter-ground. I was at Mr. Bond's house, on one Sunday, about five weeks ago, and saw the prisoner and a youth named Godfrey there. Mr. Bond was out; we broke a board of the cellar down, and got two bottles of wine out, drank it, and threw the bottles away; some wine was found at my master's; the prisoner's brother brought that to me - he afterward brought me a gun and gunlock. I took the lock back to him at Mr. Bond's house, as he said he wished to have the name taken out - he brought all the things which were found at my master's.</p>

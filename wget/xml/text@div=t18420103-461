                  </hi>. I am a coach-porter, in the employ of Benjamin Worthy Home, of the Golden Cross, Charing-cross—I live in Johnson's-court, Fleet-street—the prisoner Young jobs in the yard—I do not know Langley. On Thursday night, the 23rd of December, I was unloading the Norwich <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> coach, at the Golden Cross yard, at a quarter to twelve o'clock—among other articles, there was a basket, containing a hare and a goose—by cutting a cord, the basket fell on the opposite side of the coach—while I was unloading, I saw both the prisoners come out of the street and go on the opposite side of the coach—Young made a sort of scuffle against the basket, lifted it up, and gave it to Langley, who put it on the cob of the wheel—it fell down, and rolled under the coach—Young <hi rend="italic">nudged</hi> Langley, and said, "There is one," or something—Langley took it up, and deliberately walked out of the yard—I followed him, and gave him in</p>

               <p>charge—the officer asked him where he was going with the basket—he said he was going to take it home to his <hi rend="italic">old woman,</hi> as he had some friends in Norwich who sent a parcel every year; that he had brought it from the Golden Cross yard—we looked at it, and it was directed to "Mr. Bailey, Oat-lane, City"—when I returned to the yard, Langley had got upon the top of the coach, and was taking my place in unloading the coach—he had no business there—the basket was opened at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not Young say, "I will lend you a band, <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see him till they both came up the yard together from the street—he did not speak to me—when I returned down the yard I said, if it had been earlier the different porters who wait to assist gentlemen with their luggage would have been there—there were three hundred parcels that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Old Boswell-court, Strand, and am a constable of Hungerford-market—I was in the market, Langley walked down the street, and as soon as he passed me he ran down the Arcade—I was in my uniform—Polden spoke to me, and I caught him at the bottom of the Arcade—I asked where he was going with that basket—he said it was a present, that he had some friends at Norwich who sent him presents every Christmas, and he expected one from them—I asked where he got it—he said from the Golden Cross, and was going to take it to his <hi rend="italic">old woman</hi>—I asked who gave it to him—he said, "One of the porters of the yard"—I took him to the Golden Cross—he pointed out Young as having delivered it to him—Young, who was on the Norwich coach, was taken in charge—I understood Langley to say he had taken it as his own parcel.</p>

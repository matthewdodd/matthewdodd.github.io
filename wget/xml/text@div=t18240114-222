I pulled out my purse to pay for my beer - it contained twenty-one pieces of silver, partly Foreign, and some old English money - she asked if I was going to sell it; I said I was, but not there. She said she would sell it for me; I said I could sell it myself - she said she knew where to get more than I could. She took it up, and off she went with them, saying that she knew the pawnbrokers better than me, and went out. The landlady said I need not be afraid, for she would come back, so I sat waiting for her to return, but she did not. I have not seen them since.</p>

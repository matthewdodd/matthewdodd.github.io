On the 7th of July I was at Wimborn, in Dorsetshire; I made a remittance from there to Mr. Pike: I have a memorandum of the particulars made by me at the time - (reads) one note of Messrs. Raywood and Pool's Bank, firm Messrs. Welch, Lidyard, and Co., No. 211, dated 1st of December, 1821, 10 l. payable at Rogers, Toogood, and Co.: a Wincanton Bank note, Musgrave, Garratt, and Co., No. B. 3716, 1st of December, 1824. payable at Fry and Co., 5 l.; a Salisbury 5 l. note, Brodie and Co., No. 1298, October 5, 1824, payable at Remmington and Co's.; a 5 l.

            . I am post mistress at Wimborn, Dorset. I remember Mr. Gardner bringing me a letter on the 7th of July, directed to John Pike, of Oxford; it was a thick letter. The course of the post from Wimborn to the City of Oxford is by Southampton; letters directed any where in the County of Oxford, but not in the City, would go to London - it often happens by mistake that letters directed to the City of Oxford go to London. I should charge this letter treeble; the postage going from Wimborn to Oxford by London would be 2 s. 3 d.: we always send a letter bill in the London bag - this is the letter bill, sent up on that day; (reads) "From Wimborn, 7th of July, 1825, unpaid letters for London 12 s., ditto passing through London 2 s. 3 d., 14 s. 3 d., signed M. A. Hussey post mistress."</p>
               <p>Q. Here is 2 s. 3 d. charged for letters to London? A. Yes; a double charge, I believe, is put on in London, for a letter to Oxford; 2 s. 3 d. is the charge to Oxford - if it went by Southampton the charge would be 2 s. 6 d.; it strikes me by this charge of 2 s. 3 d. that this letter went in the London bag. I tied the bag, and sealed the twine with the Crown seal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe every post master has the Crown seal? A. Yes. I think I recollect sending this letter to London. I had a letter from Mr. Freeling about it about a month after. I do not enter on the bill how many letters are sent. I do not know what is in the letters, but charge according to the best of my ability - we generally weigh them. A letter directed to Oxford would mean the City, and unless I made a mistake I should send it to Southampton. I have been post mistress eighteen years; I do not generally make mistakes.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. Do you recollect on this day such a letter being delivered to you? A. I think I do; it being brought after time brings it to my recollection; I do recollect it certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Such a letter would be so charged? A. Yes. I cannot say whether any other letter was sent that day through London; very few go from Wimborn to Oxford. I recollect that this was directed to Oxford, but do not recollect the name.</p>

            . On the 8th of July I was employed at the Post-office - it was my duty to receive the Wimborn bag - it arrived safe that morning, tied, and sealed as usual; I opened it my self, and placed all the letters on the letter F table.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You received the bag from the guard? A. No, from a messenger, who brings them to the table; this was about six or seven o'clock in the morning. I am second opener at the F table, where this bag is opened - there are two sorters at that table; a letter directed to Oxford would remain in the office till night; the next table to us is letter E - it is about two yards from us; there are persons employed at that table. The letters would remain on the table about an hour; they go into the hands of the sorter - this letter would be carried to the Shrewsbury division, being sorted for Shrewsbury, not to any table, into the Oxford box; the messenger takes the letters, and lays them in the division - they then go through the clerk's hands, at the Shrewsbury division, and are put into the box in the morning, and would not come out of the box till evening. I do not know how many sorters there are in the Shrewsbury division.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. They are taken out in the evening to be sorted for where they are going? A. Yes; they are taken out, and put into the bag.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL JOHNSON. I am one of the presidents of the Post-office. The Wimborn bag comes in about seven o'clock in the morning, and goes to the F table to be opened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270039"></xptr>- there is a clerk and two openers at that table - they are sorted, and letters going the Shrewsbury road would go to that division. The country letters are sorted immediately behind the F table; only one sorter is employed at a time there, and that is the person who opens the bag. At the end of the morning duty these letters would be sorted, and carried to the different divisions, to which they belong; one for Oxford would be sorted to the Shrewsbury division; the Manchester division is two feet and a half or three feet from the Shrewsbury. I cannot say whether the prisoner was a sorter at that division that morning - there is a table behind the Shrewsbury division, and a ledge, where these letters going to various parts of the country would be put; we call them "inalls;" after being there deposited, the charge which the country post masters have made are erased, and the proper charge put on - they are then put into the respective boxes to which they belong, about nine or ten o'clock in the morning, and remain there till a sufficient number are taxed, and told up sufficient to form a bundle, when they are taken out, and tied up in bundles, ready to go out, and are put into the bags previous to dispatching the mails, by an officer, called an assistant of the division; the boxes are open during the process of duty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. A letter going through London to Oxford from Wimborn, would pass through seven or eight hands? A. Very possibly. The messengers convey them from the table to the divisions in their hands or arms, not in a tray - they would get on the ledge about a quarter past eight o'clock; the morning duty closes about nine or ten, according to the state of business - they would not be touched again till five o'clock in the afternoon, when they would be taken out of the boxes, tied up, and put into bags. A letter from Wimborn to Oxford would be in the Shrewsbury division, but it should not come to town regularly - there are four persons engaged at the Shrewsbury division in the evening; there are about twenty divisions in the room, and three or four persons at each. The Worcester division is on the right-hand side of the Shrewsbury - that is closer to it than the Manchester, which is on the left. The prisoner has been in the office sixteen or seventeen years. I never heard any thing to his prejudice.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BRIDGES re-examined. Q. Have you been assistant clerk at the Shrewsbury division any time? - A. Yes - the prisoner's duty I believe was at the Manchester division, but I do not recollect - Tetsworth and Oxford letters would come to my division; the prisoner has more than once left his own division. and come and examined my letters; he once gave me his reason for it, for he said he had friends living at Tetsworth. The Tetsworth box is within a few inches of the Oxford box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did he go to the Tetsworth box? A. I cannot recollect any particular time. I remember his being at that box two or three times - but I cannot remember at what period. I have heard since that a relative of his wife's did live there.</p>

            . I am one of the presidents of the Inland-office, and was on duty on the evening of the 8th of July. The prisoner was senior clerk at the Manchester division that day - it is next to the Shrewsbury division - letters for Oxford would be made up at the Shrewsbury division.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him? A. Since his childhood - he always bore a perfectly good character. I have known his father forty years.</p>

            . I am in the service of the Post-office, and for the last six months have been at the Shrewsbury division every alternate evening, as taxing clerk; our division is within three feet of the Manchester. I have often seen the prisoner on duty at the Manchester division. I have sometimes seen him come to the Shrewsbury division - he has looked over some of the letters, which had been sorted into the boxes; I believe he once told me some relations of his lived on some part of the road, and I have heard it from others - but until this charge, I did not hear of the place - I have heard it is Tetsworth. There is only one box between that and the Oxford, and only six inches space between them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not the practice of clerks to look for letters addressed to them or their friends? A. I believe they do look for letters going to their relatives, or coming to themselves. I should not think it extraordinary, I never did it myself, nor saw it done except by him. I think I have seen others do it - his looking excited no suspicion in my mind, because there were two or three clerks there at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTOREY GENERAL. Q. There could be no letters for him in the Shrewsbury division, he living in London? A. No.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner since 1811. About ten days before the 9th of July. I met him in Hoxton - I had not seen him for some time before that. I had been insolvent. When I met him he asked me how I was off. I said, "but middling;" he then said, he had an opportunity to put a trifle in my way; he took down my direction, No. 3, Bermondsey-new-road, with a pencil, and I bid him good day - we were not many minutes together, it was in the street. On the morning of the 9th of July, he called at my lodgings, in Bermondsey-new-road; he came into my house, and asked how I was engaged - what I had to do that day. I said, "Nothing particular - that I was at his service if he required," he then said, he wanted me to do a little business for him in the city, he had a few notes for me to change - this was about ten o'clock in the morning; he gave me three 5 l. country notes to change for sovereigns at the banker's in the city, where they were payable, and to meet him with the amount on Southwark-bridge, as soon as I had done it, which he thought would be a little after eleven o'clock; he went away, and I went out in about half an hour. I went to Stephenson, Remmington, and Co., Lombard-street, and changed a 5 l. note, which was payable there. I then went to Fry and Chapman's, Mildred's-court, and changed two 5 l. notes. I met him on Southwark-bridge and gave him the money - we walked to Cornhill together; he then said, he wished me to purchase 10 l. worth of French coin at the bullion-office, kept by Mr. Thomas, and then to go to Clerkenwell to fetch his watch from the watchmaker's, and to return with the French money and watch to Guildhall at two o'clock - he was to meet me there under Mr. Pitt's monument - he left me. I went to Mr. Thomas's, and stated what I wanted, and produced two 5 l. bank-notes which I had received from him; the person in the shop returned me one note, saying he did not like it, he would rather I would change it. I went to the Bank and received five sovereigns for it - previous to delivering it to the bank clerk, I wrote my own name and address - "C. Wallis, No. 3, Bermondsey-new-road," on it. I returned with the five sovereigns to Mr. Thomas, who delivered me the French money; it was mostly gold Napoleons, and some silver. I went to Mr. Fuller's, at Clerkenwell, and asked for the watch. Mr. Fuller's servant said they could not deliver it without an order. I returned without it, and met the prisoner at Guildhall - told him what had passed about the watch; he had given me a sovereign to pay for it. I delivered him the French money, and told him I had been to the Bank to change one of the 5 l. notes, which had been objected to by Mr. Thomas. He asked me if I had put my name on it - I said, "Yes;" he appeared rather flurried. I said, one could not be too open and candid, with a public body like the Bank of England, and therefore I had written my name on it as the regular way, in which they did business, required it, and it was very probable he would hear no more of the note. I mentioned about the watch - he said he was going out of town in a few days, for a few days - he desired me to keep the sovereign for myself. I told him it was too much for my time for that day; he said I might work it out another time - we parted. I met him accidentally five or six days after, he then asked if I had heard any more of the notes. I said No. He said, if I heard any thing further respecting it, I might meet him any time when he came to the office, and let him know. He said he came to the Post-office past the Beaver's Arms, public-house, near Kingsland-road turnpike, about four o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you some time afterwards receive a letter respecting this Bank note? A. I did - this is it; it contains a description of the note; it came to me at No. 3, Bermondsey-new-road. Before I answered it, I met the prisoner coming to the office, about the spot he described. I shewed him the note, he read it, and told me he did not know who he received it from. I said, "I am afraid there is something wrong - if so, stop it." - He said, he did not wish his name to appear, as there had been several embezzlements taken place in the office - money being taken out of letters, or words to that effect, and he wished me to state that I received it in the regular way of business, and could not recollect of whom. He asked if my rent was paid - I signified that it was not, and it was about 30 s. - he gave me two sovereigns, and we parted. I went home, and wrote a letter to Mr. Freeling to that effect. I heard nothing further for some days. In consequence of being told somebody had called when I was out, I met the prisoner on the Waterloo-bridge, and told him I had written the letter, and somebody had called. He said he did not wish his name to appear in the business. I said, I would not mention it, if I could avoid it." He told me, if I saw the party who called, to see him afterwards, and tell him what passed - we parted. I saw him afterwards, and told him the party had been again, but I was not at home. I appointed to meet the prisoner on Monday, expecting the party would call on Monday morning, as he had appointed. I saw the prisoner before he did call, and agreed to see him next day on Waterloo-bridge, about the middle of the day. I was taken into custody on the Tuesday morning - before I met him I was taken to the Post-office, and did not mention that I was to meet him that day on the bridge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What age are you? A. Thirty-two years. I never sold pens and paper to the clerks in the Post-office, nor seen them on any business; I never said I had sold them pens or paper, or had done any business with them. I did know two or three of the clerks by occasionally meeting them at the prisoner's house some few years ago - I should recognise them now if I met them, but am not acquainted with them personally - I understood them to be clerks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the messengers? A. I may have recognised persons about the office who I understood to be messengers, but never spoke to them. I have been there for letters, when I was in business. I do not know that I should recognise them now. I am now a dealer in writing paper: I never dealt in bills of exchange - I will not swear that I have not accepted accommodation bills in the course of my life. I do not know Mr. Williams, a currier, nor any of his clerks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not accepted accommodation bills to a considerable amount? A. No; I was never in the habit of accepting.</p>
               <p>Q. A few hundred pounds? A. No, nothing like it. I was originally in the hop trade. When I first came to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270041"></xptr>town I was clerk to Smith and Munn, in the Borough. I took the benefit of the Insolvent Act in 1820; I was in prison about three months; I was insolvent about 800 l.; there was not above 300 l. of it for bill transactions. I was in the hop trade then - my expenses were greater than my means - trade did not turn out so well as I expected. After my discharge I was traveller in the hop and seed trade for Mr. Buck. I only went out one season for him - I was afterwards in the service of Bush and Weir, for nine months, and then dealt in paper a short time. I afterwards got a situation in the hop trade with Mr. Beaver.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you turned away for drunkenness? A. For irregularity; I was with him, on and off, for nine months, and then returned to the paper trade, and sold paper when Austin met me; I had not seen him for a year and a half; I owed him about 16 l. when I took the benefit of the act; I knew he was in the Post-office but had no suspicion whatever; knowing him to be a respectable man, such a thought never entered my mind. He had stated to me that he was agent to a party connected with the East India shipping.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his giving you a sovereign excite your suspicion? A. No, because he knew I was not well off. I did not suspect he was acting wrong. I had suspicions when I received a letter from Mr. Freeling. I did not go to Mr. Freeling - the impression on my mind was, that if any thing was wrong he stood in a very delicate situation, and it was out of regard to him that I kept his name out of view, as he explained it to me. I did not advise him to leave the country; I thought there might be some danger connected with the note; he met me till I was apprehended, and I informed him what passed. I was only in custody a few hours before I made this communication - it was on the day I was taken. I thought something was wrong when I wrote to Mr. Freeling, but wished to keep his name out of the question if I could; I looked at his respectability for a long time, and it did not strike me he was guilty of any thing. I hawk pens and paper about for sale, but never go to the Post-office with them - I have had nothing to call me there since I left business; I have never been inside nor have I been up to the office lately.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. You considered him respectable, and wrote your own name on the note without hesitation? A. Yes; when I had a letter from Mr. Freeling I entertained suspicion.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You owed the prisoner 16 l, how came you indebted to him? A. I had a cash transaction with him - discounting a bill now and then for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when he brought you these notes it was in the nature of your former transactions? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were you examined at Guildhall when you were taken? A. No; I was examined twice at Bow-street: the first time was on Tuesday evening, the 24d of August. I was apprehended about nine o'clock in the morning, and was at the Post-office a considerable time - I considered myself in custody - I have remained in custody till now. I was first taken to the Post-office, and told this story there to the solicitor, before I went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>The Letter, from Mr. Freeling to the witness, was here read, requesting him to state from whom, and when he received the note, the particulars of which were stated.</p>

            . On the 9th of July I recollect Wallis calling and presenting two 5 l. notes for 10 l. worth of French coin. I objected to one of the notes, and desired him to go to the Bank and get sovereigns for it; he left and returned in five minutes with the sovereigns; I gave him twenty gold Napoleons, worth 9 l. 15 s., and a 5 and a 1-francs piece, in French silver, for the 5 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not said you had but a faint recollection of his person? A.

I was examined at Bow-street seven or eight weeks ago, and have seen Wallis once since, and am now certain of him.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. By direction of the solicitor of the Post-office, I went to No. 3, Bermondsey-new-road, to procure the attendance of Wallis; it was on a Thursday - I did not see him. I called on Friday and again on Tuesday morning; I then took him to the Post-office in custody; he was examined there and taken to Bow-street. He told me I should find the prisoner by the Beaver's-arms, Kingsland-road, a little before four o'clock. I went with the solicitor and took him; he wanted to know how we met him on that road, as it was out of the regular road, and either asked where Wallis was, or if it was Wallis who told me, but having an impediment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270042"></xptr>in his speech I could not understand which he said. I searched his person, and found one gold and two silver coins, which I produce. I found a pocket-book on him, with this memorandum in it (reads) - "14th July, left town for Deal - 22d, arrived in town."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He made no objection to your searching him? A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS. This is a 20-franc gold Napoleon - this a 5, and the other a 1-franc piece - they correspond with the silver money I gave Wallis. I do not know whether I gave him Napoleons or Louis, but it was 20-franc pieces. I call them all Napoleons - I, most probably, gave him both.</p>
               <p>Six witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Shakspeare's Head, in Wych-street; the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service. On the evening of 30th Sept. she was desired to go to Church—about a quarter of an hour after that, I met her coming down</p>

               <p>stairs without a light—she said she had blown the candle ont, and left it up-stairs, which I thought was rather strange; I, in consequence, went into her room, and in a box in that room, which was unlocked, I found a bottle of whisky without a cork, and in the same box I found a cork—it was a pint and a half bottle, and had my label fixed to it, and from the seal on the cork I could tell it was mine—there is a cupboard at the bottom of the stairs, where whisky was kept—my bar-maid lost a brooch, and that was discovered with the whisky—I also lost a sovereign on the 27th.</p>

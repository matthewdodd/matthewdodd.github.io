When he entered our service, I informed him, that his two predeciatars had robbed me of considerable property, and I must always have the priviledge of searching his pockets. This he agreed to. On Wednesday the 17th of this month I went into the warehouse between two and three. When I opened the door I saw him recovering himself from stumbling, and he made rapid haste up to me. I asked him what was the master. He said he was only coming up to see who was at the door; I asked him what made him stumble, he said something on the floor; I asked him what he had in his hand, he said nothing. I then laid hold of his arms, and insisted on knowing what his hand contained; I opened it, and there were two nutmegs in it. I had some nutmegs in the warehouse, I said, it was very strange, after what I had told him He said, he did not rob me for a profit; he acknowledged that the nutmegs were my property, and that he had taken them for a pain it his stomach. Conceiving that me might have more about his person, I went for a constable, and insisted on searching him; I searched him, and found in his trowsers, a hask of twine; I asked him if that was for a pair in his stomach, and he said no, it was to make a fishing net. I felt on the outside of his trowsers, and two more pieces of twine were taken out. He said they were all to make a fishing net.</p>
               <p>MR. BAUCK CHINA. I was in the house of the prosecutors, learning their business. I had examined the warehouse in the way of business a few days previous,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210017"></xptr>and there were then three quarters of a pound of nutmegs in a drawer. After we searched the prisoner, we examined the drawer, and found all the nutmegs gone.</p>

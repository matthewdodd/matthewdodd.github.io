On Sunday morning, 12th August, I saw the prisoners in Blackman-street, a little before 4 o'clock—that is about five miles from Lower Norwood—they were coming from that direction and going towards London Bridge—Smith had a bundle of boots wrapped up in this handkerchief under his left arm—I followed some distance and asked him what he had got there—he said, "Some boots; you can feel what they are, can not you?" I said, "Yes," and asked him where he brought them from—he said, "They are my property, I made them"—I took hold of Fisher's coat and felt boots all round him and all over him—I asked him where he brought them from—he said that he would not tell me, and that they were his own, and he was going to take them to Rosemary-lane—I took him to the station, searched him, and found these boots on him—these are only a portion: also a screwdriver, a box of lucifer-matches, and a knife—I found a knife on each of them.</p>

I live in Church-street, Greenwich—on Monday night, July 4th, about half-past 12 o'clock, I was going home—I saw the four pri<lb></lb>soners standing over Timothy Collins, who was lying on the ground, and they were ill-using him—I asked them to stop doing so, and they immediately did so—I think the whole four of the prisoners both kicked and struck him—they then turned round on me, and threw me down on the ground—they said, "That is the way we do it in Ireland"—they tripped me up, and I received two or three kicks from them—I think it was Dunn and Fitzpatrick who kicked me when on the ground—at that time I had a stick; that was taken from Collins while on the ground—while I was on the ground the prisoners all ran away when I called "Police;" they ran down William-street—I fol<lb></lb>lowed them, and came up with them about the centre of King-street—they then turned on us with a stick, and Dunn took out his knife and made three or four strokes at me—I got a wound on my right hand; it was a deep cut—the cry of "Police" brought up two men, Jeffery and Evans—one of the prisoners struck Evans with a stick, and he fell to the ground by the blow; and one of them wounded Jeffery on the head with the same stick—on the way to the station Duffey pulled out another knife—my back was towards</p>

                  </hi>, I am a maker of Rhenish colours, and work for Mr. Bransburgh, of Tower Royal. On Sunday evening, the 10th of April I was in Thames-street, about ten o'clock—I was sober—I might have had two glasses of liquor—i had with a friend—i fell in with the prisoner—we went into two houses and had two glasses of gin and noyean—the prisoner drank near gin—I went home with her to a house in a street leading out of Rosemary-lane—we went to bed in a room at the top of the houses—we both undressed—I put my clothes on the table—I had not been in bed above a minute before I asked her if she had fastened the door—she said, "No," and I got up and fastened it myself—she told me to lay down and go to sleep—I pretended to go to sleep, but did not, as I suspected her—in about quarter of an hour she got up and took my trowsers of the table—it was dark—I got up as she was going to unbolt the door—I seized, her, threw her on the bed, and took my watch one of her hand—she said something to me, and I did not know whether there were ruffians in the house—I prentended to be on good terms with her till I got into Rosemary-lane, I then gave her in charge—she was going out with my watch, she was at the door—I had given her 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at her first entering the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Perry Hill, Catford Bridge, Kent—on 9th February I was driving a horse and cart in Holborn—I saw Joyce, and pulled up and asked if he could direct me to Carter's seed warehouse; he said it was about 500 yards lower down; I thanked him and drove on at rather a sharp speed, but when I got to Carter's I found Joyce Standing outside—he asked me if he might mind the horse or trap—I assented and went into Carter's and bought a quantity of seed, which I put into the trap—I told Joyce not to leave the horse's head while I went across the road and made another purchase—I was absent three minutes at the outside, and when I came back the horse and trap were gone—I value them at 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went into Carter's and asked them something and then went to Bow Street—next night at 10 o'clock, I gained Information, and at 3 o'clock on Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing I recovered the trap—after going to Bow Street and giving information, I went back to Carter's and saw Joyce there; I asked him what he had done with my horse and trap; he said he thought something was wrong—I said "Yes, I think something is wrong"; he said "A little boy came tome and told me the gentleman who entrusted me with the horse and trap had directed him to tell me to drive it round the corner of Little Queen Street; I said 'Yes,' and when I got there I met another man dressed in a mackintosh, and cloth clothes and a <hi rend="italic">billycock</hi> hat; he jumped into the trap and handed me three-pence; I said 'You are not the man who gave me the horse and trap to mind;' he said 'No; it is all right; I am a friend of the man'—he was requested by the detective to come to Bow Street, where I was advised to charge him with stealing, which I did—besides the seed there were a quantity of potatoes in the cart—I received Information, and next night about 10 o'clock, I went into Parliament Street—I remained there till 2.30, or 2.45 on Sunday morning, and saw Odell and another man driving the horse and cart up Parliament Street—they pulled up outside Scotland Yard Police Station, got down, and gave the horse some Savoy plants—</p>

               <p>they had a cup of coffee at a coffee-stall; I went up to them and said "Halloa, old boy, a nice night"—Odell said "Yes it is, I am going to drive to Kingston"—I left them drinking the coffee, went to Scotland Yard, got a constable, and when I returned one had gone, but I charged Odell—he said "All right, old boy; all right"—with the exception of the whip and the ring, all the property I had left in the cart had disappeared.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Joyce.

On 11th February, about 2 a.m., the prosecutor called me out of Scotland Yard Office, and gave Odell in charge for stealing a horse and trap—I told him the Charge; he took no notice—I asked Mr. Day to go to the office to get somebody to take charge of the trap, and during that time Odell endeavoured to back the horse twice—on the way to the Station he attempted to get something out of his trowsers' pocket, which I found was a purse containing money.</p>

On the night of 9th February, I went with Mr. Day to Carter's shop in Holborn, and saw Joyce there—I asked him where the horse and cart were—he said he did not know—I asked him how he came to give it up to a strange man—he said "A little boy came to me, and told me a gentleman wanted it at the corner of Queen Street"—I said "a man like you ought to know better"—when I got him out I said "Do you think you would know the boy again if you saw him?"—he said "I think so"—I took him into Little Turnstile, and he said "Well, I do not know whether it was a little boy or a little girl"—I said "That seems a strange thing"—I took him through New Turnstile, where thirty or forty children were playing, but he could not pick one out—as we came along Great Queen Street, he said "Well, this is rather a serious Job for me, how do you think I shall get on?"—I said "I can't say; what did the man say?"—he said "He told me to meet him in Parliament Street, near the hospital"—I said "Did you go there?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Was he there when you got there?"—he said "No, he was gone"—I took him to the Station—on 12th February, I went to 3, Theobald's Road, where Odell's mother lodged—she took me into her room, and gave me the rug, a sponge, and a bag of potatoes.</p>

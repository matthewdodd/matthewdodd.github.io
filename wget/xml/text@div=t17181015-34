             , Capt. Fletcher, the Deceas'd, Mr. Heath and himself, had been Drinking together in a very Friendly manner at the Red-lion-Tavern in Richmond ; and being engag'd in Conversation , it was mov'd by some of the Company several times, that it was proper to break up, for that it grew late, and the Deceased, Mr. Heath and himself being to go to Istle worth,'twas thought it would be difficult to get passage over the Water, but the Deceased reply'd he could do well-enough as to that, for being known to the Ferry-man , he could easily procure a passage. They staid till past 11 a Clock, then going down to the Ferry, the Ferry-man was gone to Bed, upon which the Deceas'd told his Name, but the Ferry-man made them wait about half an Hour; that upon saying a Shilling they went over, and landed in a very Friendly manner, and were walking to Istleworth, on the Path near the River side ; and as they were passing along, and discoursing concerning their Passage over, the Deceas'd said that a Shilling was little enough, to which Mr. Heath reply'd it was so, provided it had been done readily, and they had not been obliged to wait so long, that the Deceas'd upon this took occasion to grow Warm, and Angry, and clapt his Hand to his Sword, but he (this Witness) holding him by the left Arm prevented him, tho' he attempted it several times; but all the while he did not perceive Mr. Heath attempts to draw, or meddle with his Sword. But the Deceas'd at last growing so unruly and resolure, that he could not well hold him he let him go, and being by that time come near the Houses, walked before, but had not gone but a small Distance, before he heard the Clashing of Swords, upon which he immediately turned back, and when he came up to the Prisoner and Deceased, found them about 20 Yards distant from the Foot Path, and the Deceased fallen, and Mr. Heath helping him up. That then hearing some Men in a Boat, they called to them, and having gotten him into the Boat, he was carried to the Coffee House at Istleworth, whither he and Mr. Heath, and one of the Watermen walked, and not being able to get a Bed, they laid him upon the Watermen's Tilts , and Cushions before the Kitchen Fire, and a Surgeon being immediately sent for, took care of him, and that the Deceased said to Mr. Heath, Tom, I am afraid thou hast Kill'd me, but I freely forgive thee; Mr. Health reply'd he hoped not. He likewise added, that there had always been an intire Friendship between Mr. Heath and the Deceased and an, intimate familiarity , and never the least misunderstanding that he knew of, nor no just Provocation given by Mr. Heath at the time of this unhappy Accident.

             deposed, that he and his Partner rose about 12 a Clock that Night to go a Fishing,(they being Fishermen) and that being in their Boat, they heard some Gentlemen discoursing about the Ferry and a Shiiling, they thinking they might want to go over the Water, made towards them, and being come near the Bank, they heard the Clashing of Swords; upon which they called out what are you doing there, Killing one another, and was answer'd we hope not; but they heard a Person Groan, and presently the Gentlemen called to them to come, and desired them to take the wounded Gentlemen into their Boat, and carry him to the Coffee-House at Istleworth; that they made answer, they would come provided they would lay by their Swords, but said perhaps if we take the wounded Gentleman into the Boat, you will go away, and we shall have a dead Man to take care of; But they replying, they would not, they took him in, and would have had Mr. Heath have gone with them, but he refused, saying, he was Wounded, and was afraid he should take Cold, but he would walk and meet them at the Coffee-House; that thereupon his Mate walk'd with him, and himself Rowed the Deceased to Istleworth; and by the way, ask'd him if he thought he was mortally wounded, to which he reply'd, he knew not; but if he was, he freely forgave him that did it. That when he came to Istleworth, Mr. Heath and Mr. Rutton came down, and they carried the Deceased to the Coffee-House, where Heath expressed a great deal of Concern for him, and Care and Tenderness of him, tending on him, frequently asking him how he did, what he would have,&amp;c. and that the Deceased desired him to be easy, said he wanted nothing, perswaded him and Mr. Rutton to go to Bed.

            , the Surgeon deposed that he being called by the last Evidence, went to the Coffee-House, just as the Clock struck one, but the Deceased not being then brought from the Boat, he walk'd toward the Water-side as they were bringing him up, and they not being able to procure a Bed, laid him on some Chairs, and afterwards on some Tilts and Cushions before the Fire, and dress'd his Wound, but did not then dare to Probe and Dilate it; that Mr. Heath shew'd a very great concern for the Deceas'd, and much Affection and Tenderness towards him; and tho' he was Wounded in both Arms, refus'd to be dress'd till after he had dress'd the Deceas'd; which he having done, did afterwards dress Mr. Heath of two Wounds, one quite through his left Arm; and the other under his right Arm near the Arm-Pir, that Mr. Heath sent to Richmond to the Deceased's Brother, who when he came, said to his Brother the Deceas'd, in the name of God Sam , how came this Misfortune? To which he reply'd he did not know; but several times desired his Brother if he dy'd not to Prosecute. He added, that they having gotten him into Bed, he search'd his Wound, and found it had penecrated the Abdoman ; and thereupon told them, that he apprehended it might be Mortal. His Brother sent for another Surgeon; and all proper means was used, but he dy'd the next Morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heath in his Defence exprest to the Court a great concern for the Deceased, said that his Death was a great Affiction to him, that there had been a long acquaintance and intimacy between them, that he had ferv'd him upon all Occasions, and there never had been any Difference between them, till this Fatal time; of which he gave this Relation, that she Deceased , Mr. Rutton, and himself, returning from Richmond to Istleworth, they met the Deceased's Brother, Col.

             , and Capt. Flescher,(who were just come from London) and went back with them to Richmond, to the Red-Lion-Tavern, and stay'd there longer than they intended; that Mr. Rutton several times express'd some concern about getting over the Ferry. The Deceased often reply'd, he need not trouble himself about that, for the Ferryman knew him, and would carry him over at any time. That the Tavern Boy lighted them to the Water-side. It was long before the Ferry-man would answer and consent to carry them over. The Deceased named his Name to him, but he would not know him; at length with much entreaty , he suffer'd his Boy to carry them over for a Shilling. That the Deceased seemed displeased at the Ferry-man's want of respect towards him. That after they were Landed, and walking toward Istleworth, Mr. Rutton said he was glad they had gotten over the Ferry, altho' they had so much trouble about it; to which himself reply'd, Ay, so was he, but those Ferry-men were surly Fellows, and knew no body at that time of Night without Money. The Deceased grew Angry, and said the Fellow deserv'd a Shilling, to which he reply'd so he did and more, if he had not made them wait so long on the Shore to make his Bargain. The Deceased said it was a Foolish thing to Dispute about it; was Angry, offer'd to draw his Sword several times; which Mr. Ruttan prevented; that they walk'd on, he following the Deceased, and Mr. Rutton at about the distance of 3 or 4 Yards, and would have explain'd what had been said, as not intending any Offence; that the Deceased's Anger encreasing after Mr. Ruttan left him, he told the Deceased, he hoped he would be of another Mind after he had Slept. He reply'd no, I shall not, and if you say I am Drunk you lye; and immediately drew his Sword, and pressing hard upon Mr. Heath, and endeavouring to close with him, received his Wound, and fell; and that he himself received a Wounds from the Deceased,1 of them quite through his left Arm; and had no way to save his Life, but by drawing his Sword to defend it.

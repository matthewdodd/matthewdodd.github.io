                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames Police-inspector</hi>). About half-past 11 o'clock on the night of 10th October I was on duty off Greenwich—3 constables were with me—we were alongside of Mr. Dyer's wharf, and saw a barge loaded with wool belonging to Mr. Edmunds, alongside of Mr. Allen's row, not 50 yards from my boat—near that barge loaded with wool, I saw another small barge, empty; it had some old chains and hammers in the cabin of it—it was close alongside the other barge—I saw the prisoner Giles come from the barge loaded with wool, with a bag of something on his shoulder, and he hove it down into the small barge, the barge <hi rend="italic">John</hi>—I saw him throw it off his shoulder—I then saw Mallett pass along with a bag on his shoulder, and he threw it down about the same spot where Giles threw his—Giles then returned from the barge of wool with another bag of something on his shoulder, and he threw that down in the same place where he had thrown the other, and where Mallett had thrown his—it was moonlight, and very clear just before, but it became rather dark—they repeatedly passed backwards and forwards, but I could not see whether they had got anything, in consequence of its becoming rather dark—Giles was standing in the sheets of the barge, and he said to Mallett, "Have you got enough?"—what the reply was I could not hear, but I heard Giles say, "You had better have another sack full"—Mallett then passed to the <hi rend="italic">Cosmopolite</hi> (the barge loaded with wool), and they let go the chains and went up the river—I went off to the John, and placed one constable on board of it—I then went after the Cosmopolite, and Haw the prisoners—I told Giles I should take him into custody for stealing a quantity of wool from that barge—Giles said, I have only just come on board; I have been on shore to get another hand; if any wool has been stolen, it must have been stolen before I came"—Mallett was then in the after part of the barge, and I directed a constable to go to him, and he was brought to me—I then directed Giles to take the barge into the Commercial Dock—he refused to do so; and I, with assistance, navigated the barge into the Commercial Dock-my self—I then went after the <hi rend="italic">John,</hi> and on the 2 flaps were 2 staples broken in—each of the prisoners had handed me a key, but they would not fit the lock, and I thought about breaking the lock, but in moving the look about, each flap came undone—I there found 2 sacks of wool, and about as much as 2 sacks full loose—there was 364 lbs. in all.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 89, St. James's Street, Islington, and am a tutor—I was walking along a street near the Borough Market, on the evening of 6th May, going home—I had treated a young man to two or three glasses of ale, and I suppose he was taking me home as I had asked him to do so—he showed me a urinal—I went in and left him outside—as I was going I</p>

                  </hi>.—I am beadle of the Borough Market—about ten o'clock on the night in question I was in York Street, and heard a cry of "Police!"—I ran under the railway arch and saw the prisoner running, and the prosecutor after him, about two or three yards behind; I took up the pursuit—the prisoner ran round the railing of St. Saviour's Church, and up some steps, and I lost sight of him—I turned round again and saw him running towards me—there was a van near the place where 1 lost sight of him—the prisoner said to me, "Did you stop him?"—I caught hold of him and said, "You are the man"—I brought him back to the bottom of the steps where the prosecutor stood, and he said, "That is the man that robbed me"—the prisoner then said, "You did not see me behind the van"—I had not said anything about the van before he mentioned it—I sent one of the market porters for a constable, and I gave the prisoner to him—I then went behind the van, and lit some paper—I there found this tobacco pouch, purse, and ring—I handed them to the constable, in the prosecutor's presence, and he said they were his property—there was some dust behind the van, and a hole had been scraped, and the purse and other things put into it.</p>

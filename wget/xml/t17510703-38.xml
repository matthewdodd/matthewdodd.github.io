            . The first time I ever saw this paper was the very day I wrote it; Mrs. Cohuan was then living; I wrote it, and left it upon the table to be perus'd by the parties the 24th of Nov. 1749. I wrote it from a copy.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your name subscribed to it as a witness ?</p>
               <p>Delaclose. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you subscribe your name to it?</p>
               <p>Delaclose. It was the 6th or 7th of December Mr. Jurdan g ave it me, and said Mrs. Cohuan was dead, and that she had sign'd the same will. So I set my hand to it at his desire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her sign it?</p>
               <p>Delaclose. No, I did not, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you then put your name to it?</p>
               <p>Delaclose. Because I was drunk, I was wrong in that, but they plied me with wine, and every thing of that nature, in order to sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you sign'd it?</p>
               <p>Delaclose. At the prisoner's house, but I told him if there was any dispute in the commons I would never appear to swear to it. He said there would be no dispute there at all, as there are but a few houshold goods in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the other subscribing witness?</p>
               <p>Delaclose. His name is

               <p>Q. Did you see him sign it?</p>
               <p>Delaclose. No, sir, I did not. Jurdan told me he was a drover. Some time in November, 1749, Jurdan came to me and desired me to go to the Commons with him: we went to Mr. Holeman a proctor there, and left this will upon his table to be made use of in the Commons: Mr. Jurdan and Mr. Holeman went to the office, but what he swore I cannot tell; they left me in the room till they came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he delivered it to Mr. Holeman?</p>
               <p>Delaclose. He said it was the will of

               <p>Q. How came your name to stand above Morgan's name, when you say his name was sign'd first?</p>
               <p>Delaclose. There was room enough, and I was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. If you was drunk, how came you to remember your name was above?</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Holeman, the proctor; this will was in Mr. Holeman's hands. Mr. Jurdan came there one day for an administration of this woman as a creditor without a will; I ask'd him if he knew any next a-kin? He said there were some relations. Then Mr. Holeman advised him to enter a caveat which was entered the 7th of December, 1749. I was by. He came again about a week after along with Delaclose, the witness to the will. Delaclose pull'd this will out of his pocket, and said it was the last will of Mrs. Cohuan. The prisoner did not say any thing about it, Delaclose speaking every thing for Jurdan. The prisoner could not speak English, so it was to be proved in Jurdan's name; he is the sole executer named in it; Delaclose said he wrote the will with his own hand, and had had it in his possession ever since the death of the woman.</p>

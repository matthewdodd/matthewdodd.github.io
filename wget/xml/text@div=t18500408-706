                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Smith, a surgeon, in Downham-road, Islington. On 19th March the prisoner came to the shop about five minutes before four o'clock; he wanted a bottle—it came to a penny; he gave me a bad sixpence, I gave him five-pence in copper, and he went away before I found that the sixpence was bad—I saw the prisoner in custody five minutes afterwards—I said he had passed a bad sixpence to me—he said he had not been near our premises—I am sure he is the person.</p>

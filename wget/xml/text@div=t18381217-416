                  </hi>. I reside in Crayford-place, Southwark Bridge-road. I lived nt No. 1, Bedford-place, for three years—that house belonged to Mrs. Ann Gibbons—it was not occupied on the 10th of December—it was undergoing repair, the key was left by her for the workmen—about half-past nine o'clock that night, I received information, and went to the house—a quantity of pipe was cut off and gone—the water was flowing all over the place, the sink was pulled down, and the lining stripped from it—the pipe was taken down which ran across the kitchen to supply that link—I have seen the lead which is here, and know it—here is some of my own work upon it—I am a plumber—here is the waste pipe which ran through a cupboard into the sewer—the value of the whole is about 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Fishmongers'-alley, with my father, James Maginnis. A little before eight o'clock, on the night of the 10th of December, I was going down Redcross-street, and saw Willson and Cum<lb></lb>mings come past with a leaden sink—Smith went round the back-way, with some leaden pipe over his shoulders, that leads to the back of the prisoner Winter's house in George-yard—I saw Winter going down Redcross-street—she touched Cummings on the side, and said, "My dear, make haste, and take it up stairs"—they went straight down towards Winter's house, and she went behind them—I ran and told the policeman, because my uncle had lost some lead, and I thought this was his—the policemen went with me to Winter's house—I am quite confident these are the persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go into the house with the policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and saw Cummings and Willson by the fire—Smith was by the lead—Winter was walking backwards and forwards in the house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 80.) On the night of the 10th of December, Maginnis came to me—I went with him to Winter's house in George-yard, with two other constables—I found Cummings and Wilson in the front room—I went into the wash-house, and saw Smith and Winter in the act of removing the lead, as if they wished to conceal it—they were putting it towards a back corner, where there were some ashes—I had been in the house half an hour before that, to search for some lead that we had information of—these men were not there then, only the prisoner Winter and her daughter—I got this lead and pipe from the back wash-house—I found a key and a box of lucifer-matches on Smith.</p>

I went with Hart to Winter's house—I went to the back door, and in the wash-house I found Cummings, Smith, and Winter—Cummings and Smith were removing the lead—Cum<lb></lb>mings went into the front room—I found a plumber's knife and a chisel on the board where the lead had laid—and this pipe was by the side of the sink in the corner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Willson. Q.</hi> Did you hear a cry, "Secure the man that is in the fustian coat?"<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I heard, "Keep all in that is in," that was all.</p>

               <p>to ask about a book—we found nobody at home but Winter's daugh<lb></lb>ter—she asked us to stop with her, as the policeman had been to take her mother to the watch-house—we waited half an hour—Smith then brought in some lead on his shoulder, and then some other lead on his arms—the old lady then came and said, "Who brought this lead here?"—we said, "Smith"—she said, "It must go out," and her son was taking it out when the officers came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Winters Defence</hi>.

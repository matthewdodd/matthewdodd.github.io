               <p>house on 14th Dec.—the prisoner was in my service, and he had been in the service of my predecessor—I missed money from my till from time to time, and I missed some on 20th Dec.—on 21st. Dec. a policeman marked some silver in my presence—I think he marked 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it was in half crowns, shillings, one sixpence, and one or more 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces—I put this marked money in the till on Thursday morning, 22nd Dec., between 8 and 9 o'clock—there was no one present but myself—the prisoner was at his breakfast—when he came down about 9 o'clock, I told him I would go up stairs to wash, and I left him in the bar to mind—I went up, and came down in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I told him to go up stairs, and when he had gone I examined the till—I missed from it one half crown, three shillings, and one sixpence of the marked money, and there were two shillings unmarked, which were not in the till when I went up stairs—I went across the road and got a policeman—I went up stairs with the policeman, and he found in the prisoner's clothes one sovereign, a half sovereign, two sixpences, and one halfpenny, and soon after he said, "Here is a shilling here"—the prisoner was undressed, and the policeman had his clothes in his hand.</p>

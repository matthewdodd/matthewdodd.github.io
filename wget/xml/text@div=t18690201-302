On Sunday evening, January 10, about 8.15, I was at the back of the Fireman public-house, Lavender Road, Battersea, on duty, and in uniform—I saw the prisoner with his back against a brick wall—I watched him, and he moved two or three yards towards some scaffold poles, I saw him take a parcel from his right hand pocket, and put it under the scaffold poles—I went to him, and said, "What are you doing there?"—he said, "Nothing, only drawing off" (that is making water)—I said, "What did you put in the wood I"—he said, "Nothing'—I went to the scaffold poles, but could see nothing, it was too dark—he asked me to have a glass of ale—I declined—he said that he had had one, and should have another, and went into the Fireman—while he was gone I and another witness lit a match, and found a parcel under the wood—I had not left the spot—I felt that it was money, and went to the public-house door, and met the prisoner coming out—I said "You must consider yourself my prisoner"—he said, "What for?"—I said, For what you put in the wood"—he said, "Come inside and they will tell you I am a respectable man"—I took him towards the station, and he pulled a pewter pot from his pocket, and dropped it on the ground—I picked it up, and asked him what he meant by that—he said, "I have forty of the b—s at home"—he refused to go with me, and said, I am a better man than you"—he laid hold of my throat with one hand, and put his other round my nook; we struggled and fell—I kept hold of him till I got assistance, and then got him safely to the</p>

I am gardener to Mr. Jennings, of Nightingale Lane, Wandsworth—on Sunday evening, 10th January, I was at the Fireman public-house, and saw the prisoner outside, near some scaffold poles—he walked about three yards, and I saw Johnson go and speak to him—he said that he was them to draw water—two women then came up—Johnson said that he should move him on from there, and he said that he was doing no harm—the women said that he was a respectable, upright man, and always used the house—the prisoner asked the constable to drink, which he declined—the prisoner went into the Fireman, and Johnson went to the scaffold poles, struck a lucifer, looked underneath, and picked up a parcel wrapped up in brown paper and rag—the prisoner walked out, and asked where the constable was—Johnson came from round the corner, and the prisoner asked him to have a glass of ale—Johnson said, "No; but I must take you"—I saw the struggle—the parcel was found three yards from where the prisoner stood.</p>

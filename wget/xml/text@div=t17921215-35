               <p>I am a pawn-broker, on Saturday morning about eleven o'clock the prisoner at the bar brought to my house a basket, out of which she took a pair of womens shoes, and a pair of mens boots and offered to pledge them; I asked her how she came by them, she said, they had been sent from Berkshire, to her husband, by an uncle; I told her from her appearance they were most likely taken from some waggon, going into the country; there was no paper on them; then I judged so from her appearance. One of my young men said to her, I suppose you have more in your basket; no, she said, she had not; my wife was going to market; she said, here is a man's shoe in the basket. I went round the counter and saw there was a pair, and said to her, now tell one where you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150069"></xptr>have got these; she said first of all, she got them from Snow-hill, and then from a court, No. 4, Hosier-lane; I was going to send my young man there to find out the persons, she said, no don't send there, they come from No. 15, Silk-street, Grub-street; I told her the best way would be to take her to the office, in Hatton-garden; accordingly I went for a constable; she desired me to call at Mr. Crane's, in St. John's-street, to desire him to inform her father of her situation, and to desire him to get the muffins, as she could not go there, I called at Mr. Crane's. On the second examination she then confessed they were taken from the waggon, which puts up at the Golden-lion, St. John's-street. I gave the goods over to

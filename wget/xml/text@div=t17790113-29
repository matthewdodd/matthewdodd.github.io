               <p>Did you know Irons before? - I did not, but Kimber did. Minsham asked us to go up stairs in the room where the common prisoners were? there was a man making shoes there. Kimber said he would go up and be measured for a pair; we went up, and staid about half an hour; then Minsham asked me to come down. Minsham and some other prisoners went down first, and Kimber and I followed them. They shut the door at the bottom of the stairs, and I lost my watch.</p>
               <p>Who went down with you? - I cannot say right. My watch was in my fob; they fastened my mouth, knocked me against the place, and took it from me.</p>
               <p>Who did that? - It was so dark I could not see them. It was those that went down stairs.</p>

             asked me how I did, and how all the people at Tothilfields did. We went up stairs, and sat about half an hour with a shoe-maker. Marshall asked Wilkins what o'clock it was; it was then five minutes after seven o'clock. Marshall asked me to go down stairs; Marshall went down, I followed him, and the prosecutor came after me. Marshall called Minsham out of the other ward; they shut to the door. I was shoved behind the door; I heard the prosecutor cry out, Gentlemen, do not burt me, take what I have and welcome. I do not know who took the watch.</p>

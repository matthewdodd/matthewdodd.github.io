                  </hi>. About seven o'clock in the evening, on 30th May, the prisoner came into my master's shop, Mr. William Ingram, at Barking-side—she asked for 7lbs, of salt—I went into the warehouse for it, and left her in the shop—I came back in about two minutes, and heard the silver in the till rattle, and saw the key of the till swinging—I accused the prisoner of robbing the till—she had her right hand closed, and her left hand down by her side—I took from her right hand a half-crown and a sixpence, and said I would give her in charge—she then said, "I took it"—this is the half-crown; I made a mark on it before my governor gave it to the policeman—there had been two half-crowns in the till before, this and another, a new one—after I took this from her hand there was one in the till.</p>

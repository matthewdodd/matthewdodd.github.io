I am single, and carry on the business of mang<lb></lb>ling—I live in the hamlet of Mile-End New Town—I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner a little time—she lived opposite me—I occupy two rooms in the house, and the third room was occupied by Mrs. Mallet—the landlord does not live in the house—on Christmas-day, I saw the prisoner in the course of the day she went up stairs to Mrs. Mallet, and she asked me to mangle her a pair of sheets about six o'clock in the evening—I said, "Do you want them particularly to-night? I will do them in the morning the first thing"—she said she must have them to put on the bed, but they were hardly dry enough, and she would go home and finish them—I left my room between six and seven o'clock—I locked my door, and took the key with me—I left nobody in the house at all—I was absent ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I have one room on the ground-floor, and one up<lb></lb>stairs—I had left the lower room when I went out—when I returned, on coming up the garden, I thought I saw more light in the first floor room than I had left there—I had left a rushlight—I unlocked the street-door—I went in, and said, "Who's there?"—the prisoner called out, and said, "It is me: I thought you were asleep"—she was up-stairs with a candle in her hand—I went up stairs to her, and said, "What do you do here?"—I found her in my room, and saw my drawers wide open—the door was wide open—I said to her, "What have you been to my drawer for?"—she daid it was not her—she turned round, and I saw the vallance of the bed had been lifted up, and saw a pair of sheets, a flannel waistcoat, and a napkin, which had been taken from my drawer—I took them up, and brought them drawn stairs—I said to her, "What do these do here? you have taken them out of my drawer"—she did no, she had not touched them—I brought them down stairs, laid them on the mangle, opened the door, and called my son, who was next door but one—he came in—I said in her presence, "George, I have been robbed"—he went for an officer—I am sure I had left these things safe in my drawer before.</p>

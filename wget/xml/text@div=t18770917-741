                  </hi>. I live at 13, Perrin Street, Bromley—on the evening of August 7th, I had been drinking with the prisoner and his wife, and after<lb></lb>wards went to Western Street, where a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> took place between my wife and the prisoner's wife—I and my wife went to fetch a baby, which had been left at Western Street—there was a young woman named Mrs. Clack, with a baby in her arms, and the prisoner shook hands with her—the prisoner's wife said "You had better take him home and sleep with him" and struck Mrs. Clack—my wife told her not to do that while she had her baby in her arms—the prisoner's wife was about to hit my wife, and I went to help her—my wife ran into the passage followed by the prisoner's wife—he stood in the doorway and said "If you come further into the passage I will bury this knife in your neck"—I went to my wife to get her away, and had not gone more than 2 feet when it was buried in my neck, and I fell out into the street insensible—there was a wound about 4 inches in length, I was in the hospital from Tuesday night till next Tuesday week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My wife is the prisoner's sister—I had been to three public-houses, but was not the worse for liquor, I do not know if he was—he struck me first—I said before the Magistrate I only struck him once, and saw a knife in his hand while he stood in the doorway, and it was dark in the passage and I did not see a knife, there were some people outside, I was struck just inside the passage; it was not dark—I saw the prisoner raise his arm to strike me; Julia Callow was not cut as well—I will nut swear to that—I have only been in prison once; I got two years' hard labour for doing nothing—I said before the Magistrate "I believe the prisoner struck me."</p>

On 7th August I was called to Western Street, and saw the prosecutor lying on the pavement, with a wound nearly 4 inches in length—there was nearly 2 quarts of bloods, I never saw a man bleed much more—I took the prisoner—he said "It was not me</p>

               <p>it was my sister, I do not see why I should suffer for her, and I will give her in charge for stabbing my wife also"—I did not see any knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner did not ask me to go to the house and see his wife—I never saw her until 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning at the station, when she had been to hospital and had her wounds dressed, the prisoner's wife was cut—I saw only the bandages—I think the prisoner has been in a reformatory, but am not certain—I do not know that he has certificates of character from where he has been working—the passage is about 12 feet long, and 3 1/2 feet wide—I think the prisoner had been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Tredegar Road, Bow—on 7th August, I saw the prisoner and prosecutor at the door having very high words, and the prisoner dared the prosecutor to enter the house—he said "If you come in here I will cut you"—I saw the prisoner's hand up and when he went in the prosecutor followed, but he had not been in two minutes before he came out and rolled and fell against a lamp-post—the women were inside fighting and hallooing "Murder"—I saw the prosecutor's wound and much blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The passage was not altogether dark, a lamp throws a light about a yard across it—one of the women was cut—I am sure the word "cut" was used by the prisoner.</p>

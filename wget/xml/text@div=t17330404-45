Three Weeks afterwards he found a Cap in a Chair by Baker's Bed-side, which he swore was the Cap that his Money was in when he lost it, and 8 Guineas and 6 s. were found in Baker's Chest. The Cap was produced in Court. Trumper's Sister swore that she made that very Cap for her Brother out of the Tail of his Shirt, and knew it to be the same by a particular Seam which was run together and fell'd like a Petticoat Seam, it not being usual to make such Seams in Night-caps. In answer to this, says Baker's Mother (upon her Oath) if I have a Soul to be saved (as I hope I have) I made this Cap for my Child out of the Tail of my Husband's Shirt; I double-crown'd it on both sides, and run it along a-this-fashions - you, did you say, Goody Baker? Yes indeed did I, Goody Trumper; and besides, I can swear to the Cap by these two Holes - Well, and I can swear by the same Holes that it's my Brother's Cap. And pray now what sort of Cloth was your Son's Cap made of? - Cloth; why, it was an ordinary coarse Cloth. Coarse; but what sort I say? - why, it was Flax. - Flax; very well! now my Brother's Cap was made of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040017"></xptr> Dowlas, and this Cap here is Dowlas, I'll take my Oath on't ; and pray Goody Baker do you call Dowlas, Flax? - Yes, I do - Do you so? But I say Dowlas and Flax are two Things - No Matter for that, you shall never persuade me that I don't know the Cloth that this Cap is made of, when I cut it out of the Tail of my Husband's Shirt; sure I have seen it often enough!

                  </hi>. I am a cooper, in York-street, Stepney, On Monday morning, 27th Dec., about three o'clock, I was going home—I saw Ann West in the Commercial-road—I went with her to 44, Baker-street, and went up stairs—she laid on the bed, but I did not go into bed—I took my coat off, but not my waistcoat—I had a silver watch in my waistcoat pocket, and a gold guard round my neck, and she forcibly took them from me—I was standing up at the time, but being a little in liquor I did not expect it—she ran at me, pulled the watch out of my pocket, and the guard-chain over my head—in endeavouring to escape, she upset the table and put the light out—she got out of the room, and out of the house—I followed her—I called for the police, but she was gone—this is my watch and guard.</p>

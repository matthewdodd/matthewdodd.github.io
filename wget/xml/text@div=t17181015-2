He could not Swear to the Prisoners Face; but when he was apprehended, he had the Prosecutors Coat on his Back, and a Spur, and other of his things in his Pocket. By other Evidences it did appear, that the Prosecutor crying our Highway-men, some Persons that happened as to be near, pursued the Prisoner, and he not being able to get off, quitted his Horse, and hid himself under some Brambles in a Ditch, and the Prosecutors Coat on his Back, the Spurs, Handkerchief,&amp;c. found in his Coat Pocket; and the Horse was carried to the King's Head at Hampstead. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, and said that his Brother was to go so a Fair to sell a Horse, he met him on the Road, and ask'd him to give him some Linnen; and that on the Road his Brother gave him the Coat and other things.

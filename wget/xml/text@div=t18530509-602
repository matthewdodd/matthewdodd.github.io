                  </hi>. I am a wholesale stationer, in Cloak-lane. On 13th April I received a consignment of six boxes of copying paper, among many others—three of them were opened immediately, and the other three were suffered to remain in the passage leading to my warehouse—it is in the parish of St. John the Baptist, in the ward of Walbrook—each of the boxes that were opened contained twenty reams of paper—I cannot tell how long the boxes remained in the passage; it was between three and four hours—I received them between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning—one of them was missing at 5 o'clock—I gave information to the police, and offered a reward—on the Friday morning, the next day but one, I sent Mr. Clements to the prisoner Jackson's, in consequence of information—the police were with us at the time we went—I have since seen twenty reams of paper produced by the officer—it is in my belief a part of that paper that came to my place that day—it is foreign paper, made in Germany—it has of course no Excise mark on it—the Customs levy a duty on it—it is a very peculiar quality—I have not sold twenty reams of paper of this sort—this agrees in colour and quality, and in number of sheets in each ream, with what I lost—the five boxes that were opened were nailed, as all boxes coming from Germany are, with very peculiar nails—I have one of the cases here, and here is one of the nails of it—the twenty reams were worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ream.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Marsh, and live at No. 9, Wellington street, Blackfriars-road. The prisoner Izard lodged in my house in the first-floor back room—I was at home on Wednesday, 13th April—I was looking out at the window, and saw a box come in a truck—Izard and another man were with it—they brought a box out of the truck, and put it on my mat against the parlour door—it appeared very heavy—Izard worked it round on the side, and the two carried it up stairs—I afterwards saw a box produced at the Mansion House very similar to that one—on the following Friday Izard paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for rent, which he would have owed me on the Saturday—I said to him on the Friday, "If you please, I want my room to put my boys there"—(I did not go into the room, I went to the door)—he said, "When do you want the room?—I said, "As quickly as you can possibly let me have it"—he said, "Make up the rent-book, and send it me up"—I made it up, and, instead of sending it up, I carried it up, and I saw in the room a box like the one brought in from the truck on the 13th—in the latter part of that same day I heard a noise in Izard's room—that was after the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid—it was a noise something like breaking-up wood—I did not see the box after that—I do not think I saw Izard and anybody else go out after I heard the noise; but on the Friday morning, before he gave me the money, I saw some parcels go out—Izard and one that he called his brother took them out—that was before the breaking of the wood—my daughter went in the yard in the morning, and she brought me two nails—I thought they were very funny nails—I put them in my pocket, and gave them to the officer—these are the very nails (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—on the morning after the removal of the box from the truck, I was looking at my window, and saw a gentleman go along; he looked hard at my window—I opened the door, and he said, "Is Mr. Izard at home?"—I said "Yes," and he went up stairs—he had whiskers round his chin, and dark hair and dark eyes—the prisoner Jackson has the appearance of him, but the whiskers are off now—he had a kind of black and white coat on—I called it snail-back—it was not a very rough coat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What stuff was it made of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell, but I have seen coats like it—it was a cloth coat—I suppose it was an overcoat by the appearance of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you believe Jackson to be the man, or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the appearance of him; I do not speak with any certainty—my eyesight is not good when I have my spectacles off; I had my spectacles off then—I took notice of the whiskers, because I have got a son who wears them the same, and I rather admire them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Izard. Q.</hi> Are there any more yards adjoining to your yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are yards certainly, but they are parted off—I never measured how high the walls are; I think the wall between my neighbour's yard and mine is about as high as this witness box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find any nails yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think seven or eight—a gentleman came and asked me to let him look in the room, and he stirred the dirt about to look for nails; and after he was gone, I put on my spectacles, and looked into the cupboard, and found one nail and half a nail; in the fireplace I found one nail burnt, and under the grate I found a lot more that were not burnt—these are the nails.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mrs. Marsh by her former husband. I found two nails in the yard; I do not know on what day—I gave them to my mother—Izard's window looks into that yard—I was at work at the next door on Wednesday, 13th April—I saw a truck stop at the door; Izard was with it, and a boy that I do not know—there was a box in the truck—I saw a box or case that was produced at the Mansion-house; the box that was brought in the truck was like it, but I do not think it was quite so large.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 42, Wellington-street; I am a tailor. On Wednesday, 13th April, I was working in the front room on the ground floor of my house, which is exactly opposite Mr. Marsh's—I saw a truck arrive, with a chest or box on it—Izard and another person were with it, and they lifted the chest or box into the passage—next morning, Thursday, I saw the prisoner Jackson go to that house—he had a grey Witney overcoat on, and his hat had crape on it about three inches up—he was in the house about three minutes, and when he came out Izard came out with him—I should think it was between 12 and 2 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were not before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the officer Evans found me—he did not describe Jackson to me—he asked me what sort of man it was, and I described him to him.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The statement of Izard before the Lord Mayor was here read as follows</hi>:—"All I have got to say is this, I was employed to sell the paper, and of course I offered it to Mr. Jackson; I did not know the price, and I took it to him, and asked him if he could find me a customer for it, and of course it was taken; I never saw nothing more of it till half-past 6 o'clock, when I was at home; but as for its being brought in a box like this, I never see such a box before; when I saw the paper it was in a six-dozen candle box.

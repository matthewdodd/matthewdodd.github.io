The prisoner was in my employ for nine weeks; about six weeks ago I missed a ring, which was kept in a jewellery-box on a shelf in the ware-house - I cannot exactly say when I missed it; I saw it again on the 24th of May at a pawnbroker's - I knew it to be the ring I had missed; I am certain of it.</p>

I have seen many of exactly the same pattern; it is of very little value, as the pearls are vspoiled - they have never been of much value; I should think it might be bought at a pawnbroker's for about 7s. 6d. - the prisoner did not tell the Magistrate in my hearing where he got it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 20th of May, at his father's, in St. John-street, charged with obtaining a watch in his master's name - Mr. Novra did not charge him with this ring then; I found a number of duplicates on him, and among them one for this ring - I said nothing to him about it; I went to Whittaker's with the prosecutor - the ring was produced, and he claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On the 20th of May did the prosecutor tell you he had lost a ring? A. No; he said he had lost several articles, he could not tell what; the prisoner said the whole of the goods pawned were his own property - some were musical snuff-boxes; the prosecutor said, "It is impossible - some of them have been obtained in my name; I deal in musical-boxes - they may have been taken from my warehouse - I will go with you and see;" when I told him a ring was pawned, he said that might be his, as he dealt in jewellery.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live on Clerkenwell-green. I had a ring of this pattern in August last - it is a very common pattern, or I could speak to it more positively; I believe it is the same, but as there are many of the same pattern, I do not swear positively to it - I sold it in August; here is the book in which I entered the transaction - I cannot say to whom I sold it; the prisoner's friends applied to me about it about a month ago - I have entered here, that on the 30th of Au<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300056"></xptr>gust I sold a ring for 7s. 6d.; the buyer's name is not entered, as it was sold in the shop - I believe it to be the ring I sold that day.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.Was the ring defective in any respect? A. Not when I sold it; there is one stone out now - I must have had it above twelve months in my possession; it was out of time, and was some months in my window -I have no private mark on it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. From the materials it is made of, is it likely one of the pearls might drop out? A. It was very likely - I made no communication to the prisoner or his friends till they applied to me.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. NOVRA. Q.Have you any private-mark on the ring? A. In the gold there is a little hole at the bottom - I did that myself; my wife wore it, and lost the pearl out of it - she gave it me to put one, and I put it into the jewel-case and forgot it; she had worn it for twelve months - I did not intend to sell it; I made the hole to try if it was gold or silver.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.How was it you never mentioned that to the officer? A. I had not looked over my stock, and did not know I had missed it; I did not mention the mark to the officer - I only told him about the pearl; I did not try it with aqua-fortis.</p>
               <p>JURY to STEPHEN STEPHENS. Q. Did you perceive this hole in the ring when you took it in? A. No; one of the stones were deficient.</p>

On the 8th of April the three prisoners came together to my shop - Davis asked to look at a pair of stays, pointing to a pair marked 8s. 6d.; I showed them to her - Norris said, "You had better have coloured ones," and I took some coloured ones out of the window - Davis then said, "I had rather have cotton fronts" - I showed her some of them; they looked first at one pair, and then at another, and said they were too high a price; they took up the pair marked 8s. 6d., and Norris said, they were much the best, but I must take less for them - I offered them for 8s.; they said they could not afford<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100113"></xptr>that - I said, they saw them ticketed, and knew the price before they came in - they began to turn round, and at that moment a balloon went up from Greenwich, which took our notice, and they bade me good afternoon - I directly missed a dark pair of stays - I followed, and found them walking arm-in-arm together, Norris in the middle - I called a neighbour and took hold of Norris. I said "You have got a pair of stays of mine" - she said "You wretch, you hussy, I have no such thing" - I said, "You have a dark pair of stays of mine, and I will not loose hold of you"- the officer came up; they were taken; and the stays found on Norris, she and Davis had been the acting parties - Smith took no share in the conversation.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

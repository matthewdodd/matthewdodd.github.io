The Prosecutor deposed, she was going down to Salisbury along with the Waggon, her Mother being sick in it. That there not being room in the Waggon, she and another Woman that was with Child went on Foot, that as they were going along Piccadilly, the Prisoner enquired of her if she was going along with the Waggon? she replied, Yes. And after some Discourse, he claiming Acquaintance with her as a Townswoman, he parted from them, and she saw him no more till she came to Hounslow. That Mr. Bush, the Salisbury Waggoner had taken the big-bellyed Woman into the Waggon, so she was left by her Self. That he would have her go in to drink, which with Importunity she did, that there came also Bush the Waggoner, and the Waggon going before, they all three walked four Miles together, to a place called Bellsound. That there Bush the Waggoner left them two together, and went after his Waggon to Stains. That it growing Night, she began to be in Fear, and the Prisoner bid her not be afraid, he would take Care of her, and knew the Way; that coming to a Lane this side Stains, three Miles long, there was a Foot-path in the Field on the inside of the Hedge; that going along, she was overjoyed that she happened to be in the Company of a Man in Years, and a sober Man, and her Townsman too. But having walked a pretty Way together, he on a sudden put his Foot before her and threw her down upon a Hillock, so that her Body lay over it, and her Heels higher than her Head, and fell upon her, getting between her Legs, lying with his Face upon hers so close she could scarce breathe; that she cry'd out for Christ Jesus's sake to him not to injure her, but that he holding her down in that Posture that she could make no use of her Hands or Feet to get up, put his Finger into her Body and tore her very much, and afterwards lay with her. That afterwards they went together to Stains, and the next Day took another Road; that she was very much injured, bled very much for a long time after; and that coming to Salisbury she apply'd her self to a Surgeon, had Medicines, from him, had been in a very ill Condition eversince, was So now and under a Surgeon's Hand, was intirely ruined, and never like to recover her Health again. That she told the Doctor how she had been served, and that he knowing the Prisoner, told her, if she swore it against him, she would take away his Life, and persuaded her to make it up; that accordingly he had endeavoured to make up the Matter between them. That she remaining still very ill, and hearing he was come to London, came up and prosecuted him.

            , the Surgeon deposed, That she did make Complaint of such Usage to him two Days after her coming down, that she was very ill in her private Parts, and that the Prisoner had offered her Violence as she was coming from London, and that upon Examination, he found she had an Excoration in the Parts mentioned, that he gave Medicine, accordingly; that afterwards she complained of fainting Fits, for which he applied proper Remedies, and that after that she complained of a Pain in her Head; and that he was of Opinion her Illness might proceed from Heat of Urine. He deposed likewise, that he did, by her Consent, speak of it to the Prisoner, and that he said, if he had done her any Injury, he would pay for her Cure; that he brought the Prisoner and the Prosecutor Face to Face, and that there were Offers made to make up the Matter, and that she insisted upon 5 l. She being asked of the Court, when she made this Matter known first, she owned she did not to any Body till she came to Salisbury; she said, she was afraid to tell her Mother of it, she being sick, and distemper'd in her Head some time before, supposing it would have put her into Fits, and been the Death of her. It appeared that the Prisoner and Prosecutor after the Commission of this Fact walk'd together to the same Inn at Stanes, and lodg'd there that Night, and no Mention was made to the Carrier, nor any Body else, and that she afterwards went on Foot great part of the Way, as the Carrier deposed, that the Weather was very bad, and that might probably be a great Occasion of her Illness.

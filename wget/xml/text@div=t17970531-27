On the 10th, in the morning, I went to see whether the bags were gone; I placed myself behind the chests, and about half after two o'clock in the day time, I saw a man come and take a bag of tea away from the place; I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or another man; I gave information to the assistant elder; the man was taken down to the accompting-house, it was not the prisoner, he was searched, and nothing found upon him. The prisoner came into the accompting house, while we were searching the other man, to hang up the keys of that department where the bags were that I am speaking of; the assistant elder searched the prisoner, and I saw him take two small bags of tea out of his breeches; I did not observe him to say anything then. Mr. Brookers has got the tea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. I am a commodore, to take care of the Company's business.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you have a guinea for every prosecution? - A. I expect nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't you expect a guinea from the East-India Company, for every man you convict? - A. I never heard of it, I can say nothing to it, I never received any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prisoner take the tea? - A. I saw one of the two men, but I don't know which it was.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner came to hang up the keys? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear he would have been brought into the Costom-House, if he had not come? - A. The information was given against both of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Might not the man have gone out of the gate, instead of coming into the accompting house? - A. He might have attempted, but he would have been stopped.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were searching another man? - A. I was searching another man at the time the prisoner came into the accompting-house, I desired him to stop, I laid hold of him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Brooks. That part of the warehouse is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310032"></xptr>within the City of London; I mean that part of the warehouse where the bags of tea were found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Gardner, of Regent-street, Lambeth—the prisoner and his sister lodged at our house. On the afternoon of the 6th of Sept. I went to my drawers in the back room, missed a black silk and a black crape handkerchief—I had suspicions, looked for my money, which I had placed there on the 4th, and missed a sovereign, two half-sove<lb></lb>reigns, and five shillings from another drawer, and some boys' collars, a pair of child's shoes, and a pocket-handkerchief; and from another drawer, a shirt—I have found some of them—I gave the prisoner in charge on suspicion—she was very tipsy—I had seen her several times go to a certain spot in the gar<lb></lb>den, and rake about there—on the Thursday morning she went to the same spot—my son and I went and found seven half-crowns buried there—the articles produced are mine.</p>

I immediately called the prisoner at the bar, and the maid servant, to know how this had happened: I found they had both a long story to give me concerning a long lace ruffle, which each of them had in possession.</p>
               <p>Did each say they had a lace ruffle, or you found it? - They said they had it. I went out to dinner, and in the mean time determined to investigate this matter as far as I could. When I came back in the evening, the story I heard from the maid,

At last they all agreed to go to the public office in Bow-street; I put them into a hackney coach, and went immediately: Justice Gilbert, upon hearing the story, thought the prisoner's story so equivocal, the suspicion lay sufficiently against him to commit him. - I was present; a duplicate, I believe, was found in his pocket of a pair of ruffles. I went in person that night, that no time might be lost, to Mr. Hill's, pawnbroker, in Carnaby-street, Carnaby market, and asked if Mr. Knox had ever pawned any thing in his shop: he said a pair of knee-buckles: I asked if any other things, besides knee-buckles; he said, he has not pawned the lace ruffles or cambrick handkerchiefs, but a gold-headed cane at one time. I judged it to be mine; it was taken back from my house to the pawn broker's; he said he knew it perfectly well, which shewed the man dishonest; he continued in commitment. The next thing I did was to circulate hand-bills to all the pawn brokers in London; I wrote out a description of eight pair of ruffles, the number I lost was about fifteen; I had about 20 pair in all: I wrote out a description of eight, and said they must be in the name of Knox, or

               <p>When I went to look for some cambrick handkerchiefs in the drawers where I left them, I found none; and when I heard the story of the ruffles being lost, I looked to the places, the boxes were mostly full, when I came back I found they were gone. I brought the box to my master and told him he was robbed of his ruffles; when I sent the prisoner at the bar the coat to take away his livery, I was going to send him a coat, and in his press I found a bottle of wine, where this coat lay; it was his press to keep his cloaths; the bottle of wine had my master's seal on; he had no lock or key to it. The wine was in my care; I looked over the cellar to see what wine was missing, I missed fifteen bottles of various kinds of wine, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you ever leave the key of the cellar with him? - Never; I have left it in my pantry upon the nail; I don't know whether he knew whether it was there or not, I left no wine out, he could only get at it by the key.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>The press that you found the wine in was open? - It was open.</p>
               <p>So that any body might inspect it? - Yes; it was in the open hall.</p>
               <p>Are you certain you never left any wine about out of the cellar? - Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Where were these handkerchiefs? - In my master's wardrobe, where his cloaths was.</p>
               <p>Were the drawers left locked or open? - They were locked; I left the key in my pantry.</p>
               <p>And were they locked when you came back again? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you see them found there? - I took them from where he kept his cloaths; it belonged to Mr. Rous.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner use to keep it locked? - Yes; there is a lock to it, but it was open; he did not return from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rous. The reason I apprehend them to be mine is this, I fancy they are made in the form of a cravat; in the corner of one was done in a figure 3 with blue silk, and over that very apparently there are the marks where the letters have been picked out.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to the rest of your linen? It is impossible for a man to swear to linen.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Rous swore to one handkerchief in particular, comparing it with his own, which he pulled out of his pocket, with the mark of 3, and said it is made like a cravat; it seems rather the same size and shape.) I can't swear to the trunk; there is a corded muslin ruffle among the things found. I have none but corded muslin ruffles; there is another.</p>
               <p>Are those the things found upon the man? - They are the same things; they have never been out of my possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>The trunk was the property of your master, and the key in it when you took those things out? - The key was in it.</p>
               <p>And you are certain those are the things? Yes.</p>
               <p>(The pawn broker deposed, that he lived in Crown-street, Princes-street; produced the watch, said he had bought it of a man of the name of Malone, whom he knew extremely well, for seven guineas and a crown.)</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Rous. It is eight weeks ago last sunday, I went out to Knightsbridge about six in the evening, I returned between nine and ten, and found William at home, the prisoner at the bar, he let me in, there was no person there but him, there was a book before him, he leaned his arm upon the table, whether he was reading or no, I can't tell. I took off my cloak, he turned round to speak to me, what it was I don't know, he stooped to pick something up close by his chair, he said what is this, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050013"></xptr> said I don't know, may be it may be one of my robins fell out of the drawer; he said no it is not, it is a ruffle of Malone's fell out of his pocket, for he has been here this evening. He said no more to me about it, nor I to him. I went up to the drawing room to shut the windows, from there I went to the door, I talked to a person that had the care of next door house, till a young woman came to sleep with me, it might be ten minutes, he came and let me in, William went to bed. I opened the door and picked up a ruffle in my master's bed room going up to the bed room, about an hour after he picked up the ruffle.</p>
               <p>Did you sleep in that room? - Yes, I did, I slept there. There was a young woman with me, I said ma'm is this your's, no not as I know of, said she. I laid it down upon the table in my master's bed room, and went to shut the window shutters. Upon shutting it she took the ruffle, and said, it is a gentleman's ruffle, she said very like one of Mr. Rous's. I said it can't be one of Mr. Rous's, he had been in mourning, she said she knowed the tacking of it in Russel-street, she was my master's valet's wife.</p>
               <p>Have you that ruffle? - I have; then I said to her, I will go and ask William whether or no he knows any thing about it. I went up stairs, she with me, and called William, he did not answer, he was in bed. I said, William, have you been in my master's bed room; he said, what should I do there; I said, I do not know what you should do there, but somebody has been there, for there is a gentleman's ruffle in it, he took the ruffle very carelessly and threw the ruffle down in a chair by him, I said he need not throw the ruffle away, for I would have the ruffle again, I picked it up and carried it down stairs, and left it till my master came home, which was five weeks.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the ruffle you picked up under the table below stairs? - I did not pick it up, he picked it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rous. I have had it ever since he was at Bow-street, that is mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Malone there? - Yes; I saw him with him at the street door.</p>
               <p>Who is Malone? - I don't know; he appears like a very genteel sort of person. It was night, he laid there, when he came home with him it was a storm, William said, it was a very bad night to turn any body out, he came there, and staid from Saturday night till Sunday morning. I did not know it was Mr. Rous's ruffle, I had not been accustomed to go into his bed-chamber.</p>
               <p>But Malone has frequently been at your master's house? - Yes; and he has dined there several times.</p>
               <p>By your invitation? - No, he could not, he is not of my acquaintance; when he was there he slept with William in the garrat.</p>
               <p>Did you see him any part of the night, from the time he went to bed till he went home? - No.</p>
               <p>Many persons came to visit you; one Mrs. Wilmot or Miss Wilmot? - Yes; I never had any person staid with me after eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>You was very intimate with the prisoner at one time; I am sure you was; and you entertained some resentment against him; did not you say you would certainly hang him? - No.</p>
               <p>Nothing to that purpose? - Yes, I have, but it was not in my power.</p>
               <p>What did you say to that purpose? - The last time but one when I came to Bow-street, my master's man and his wife in a coach, the person that slept with me, William pleaded very innocent, and I said if he does not get his deserts now, he will by and bye. I should not be sorry to see him go by to be hanged.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to say, upon your oath, you did not entertain some suspicion of his neglect of you? - No; I never knowed he had any pretensions.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether she has not had men lay in the house frequently? - Mrs. Bolton's servant, who is here; I can be clear she has had my master's mother's servant in the house with her, and another man besides.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you wish to say any thing else? - I have nothing else to say.</p>

            . There was a person slept<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050014"></xptr> in the house, three nights in the garrat, and that man's wife slept with me, in my master's room. I cannot say whether it was a week after the ruffle was found, or a fortnight; it was Mr. Bolton's servant came, as I asked him to sleep in the house, for the care of the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rous. I could swear to the ruffle that was picked up by him.</p>
               <p>Jury. The ruffle was not taken upon him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rous. This ruffle he picked up himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Divisional Surgeon of Police at Eotherhithe—on 27 July I saw Stevens at the station; he was bleeding from an incised wound in the fleshy part of the back of his arm, two or three inches long, which had exposed the muscles; also from a punctured wound on his back, which had penetrated to the backbone, and then glanced off to the left for quite two inches—he lost more than a pint of blood—I dressed the wounds, and they are now healed—he has sustained no serious injury except from loss of blood.</p>

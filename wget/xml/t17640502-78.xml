About a quarter of an hour after I saw the prisoner coming up Cheapside; he turned round Bow-lane; I pitched my basket, and went round by the church, and took him. I thought by his making off, and the description I had had, he was the man. I charged him with taking the loaves: he at first denied it: after that he took me aside, and owned he had taken three loaves: he confessed the same before the magistrate, in my hearing.</p>

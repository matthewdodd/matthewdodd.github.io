               <p>Elizabeth Stephens. I lost half a guinea last Thursday night, at <placeName id="t17581206-9-crimeloc48">St Giles's,</placeName>

               <p>Q. Where did you put your pocket at going to bed?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Stephens. I put it below my head; my money was in a box in my pocket; I found my box taken out, a little below her head. I ask'd her for my money; she bid me to hold my tongue and not expose her 'till morning, and she would give it me or satisfaction for it; in the morning she went and changed half a guinea; I asked her for it, she scolded me, and said she would give me no money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her before a Justice of the peace?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Stephens. I did, there she said she had that half guinea of her friends.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My prosecutrix is a vile woman, I know nothing of what she has been saying, it is all false.</p>

            . I was here on another occasion, and I never saw the prisoner in my life before, but having some knowledge of the prosecutrix, thought it necessary to speak what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prosecutrix?</p>
               <p>W. Marsden. About two months; she has come to Justice Fielding a great many times, and charg'd people, some with felony, and has perjur'd herself.</p>
               <p>Q. In general, what is her character?</p>
               <p>W. Marsden. I believe a very bad one; her behaviour has been infamous.</p>

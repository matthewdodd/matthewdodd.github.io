                  </hi>. In March, 1856, I wag a packer in the service of Mr. Isenberg, of No. 121, Leadenhall Street. I and Morris, together, packed six cases with boots; I have in my hand a list of the contents of those cases, it was copied from the packing book by the clerk; the packing book is not here (<hi rend="italic">it was directed to be sent for</hi>)—the journal is here; the entries are not in my writing—I packed the cases—I looked at the packing book at the time so as to know what was put in the cases—I did not look at the book before me, that has nothing at all to do with me, that is the clerk's book—I recollect what I put into the boxes—there were 527 pairs of boots—the marks of the packages were "G." over "C. C. and Co."—the numbers were from 1088, I think, to 1093—the vessel by which they were to be shipped was the <hi rend="italic">Narrahyarra</hi>—on 27th March, those packages were delivered to the prisoner, to be delivered at the St. Katherine's Docks—he was carman, and of course it was his duty to deliver those trunks at the Docks—I had nothing at all to do with his duty—I produce a receipt for those packages in the parcel book—it is the signature of the prisoner—those packages were consigned to Adelaide—(<hi rend="italic">The entry of</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th March was here read</hi>: "27th of March; G. over C.

                  </hi>. In March, 1856, I was in the employment of the prosecutor, Mr. Isenberg. I recollect six cases or trunks, containing boots, being sent to St. Katherine's Docks, on the 27th—they were delivered to the prisoner for the purpose of being taken—his father was the carman employed occasionally by Mr. Isenberg, and his son assisted in the busi<lb></lb>ness—he drove a cart—he ought to have carried them away in the course of the afternoon; they ought to have gone straight from the warehouse to the Docks—in the course of our business it was the duty of the carman to carry goods of this sort direct to the Docks—we always send them to one parti<lb></lb>cular Dock, and he had no other place to call at for us—he would not be employed for other goods—there were no other goods in the cart; he was hired for that particular purpose.</p>

Q.</hi> Who hired the cart, and when? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say who hired it—I cannot say on what terms it was hired—Mr. Maybury, the prisoner's father, is the person that carries on the business, I believe—the prisoner was merely acting as his carter—I can remember that there</p>

               <p>were no goods in his cart on that occasion but ours, because I entered these cases in the book myself—I saw him put them into the cart, and I ticked my small label that I had, against those six cases—it depends upon circum<lb></lb>stances how often the cart comes to our warehouse, when they might want him; I do not know how often, a great many times in the course of the month—it was six months since when my attention was first called to this circumstance; it was this year, but I am not in the employ of Mr. Isen<lb></lb>berg now; he called on me to ask me if I knew the handwriting in the book—my memory is assisted by what I see—this is my handwriting—looking at that, I can remember that I entered in that book certain numbers of packages as delivered to Maybury—I say that these goods were delivered to the prisoner, because I had his signature; he signed for them—I saw him—I mean to swear that I saw him sign it—I never received a signature from anybody but him and his brother, because it was not my department to have those boots, but it happened that day that the clerk was not there, being just dinner time, and I of course entered those six—I recollect by the book—I do not know his handwriting so as to be familiar with it—I do not recognize it—if I had found any other name there besides Maybury, I should not have said that that person signed it—I never received any except from the two sons, the prisoner and his brother—if I had found the brother's signature there, I should then have said that he had signed it, and that I had delivered the goods to him—I have no recollection of it independent of my memory being refreshed by this book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer of boots, in Leadenhall Street. I remember sending six cases of goods to the St. Katherine's Docks on 27th March, 1856, intended for Adelaide, South Australia—I initiated the matter, and therefore I am positive as to the day—I recollect it from my books; from entries in my clerk's handwriting, and vouchers, and checks; they were seen by me at the time they were made—on many occasions I did not see the entry, but in this instance I did—that enables me to say that they were sent on 27th March—the prisoner took them in his father's cart; he carted all goods for me—I saw the goods delivered to the prisoner, and saw him start with them—there were no other goods in the cart—no directions were given him as to when he was to take them to the docks, but in the usual way; it was usual to take them at the time—the docks are about a walk of a quarter of an hour, or a drive with a small load of five or six minutes, within a mile—the marks and numbers of the cases were "C. C. and Co." and "G." over, "1088 to 1093"—they were packed in cases made of wood, covered with oil cloth, covered with tarpaulin, and covered with canvas, sewn up—the numbers were marked on each end of the packages twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it the ordinary kind of trunk or case that you made use of in your business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The ordinary kind—I was present when the book was compared with the marks on the cases—when I am in the way, I generally check these entries—I did so in this instance—I swear that—this is the entry of the warehouseman Nicholson—I saw these</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110019"></xptr>
               <p>individual cases packed—I saw the oil cloth put on, the tarpaulin, and the canvas, all three—I saw two only put on, because the third was naturally put on; it was put on when the case was finished; the one I saw on, and the other two I saw put on—the marks are on each end, on the outside—Maybury's cart was in the habit of taking goods for me, sometimes two or three times a day, and sometimes about half a dozen times a week, I think for about two years and a half; during that time I have sent a very great many cases in his cart—I first heard of the loss of goods in July, last year; that was not of these, but some other goods—it was about two or two and a half months ago that I heard of these goods—I remember the prisoner going away with these goods—he generally carted smaller lots; when the quantity was small, his father has said, "I will send my son for them;" otherwise there were generally two men with them—I have a distinct recollection of this particular transaction—I swear that I recollect this individual cart going away with these six packages, and that there was nothing else in the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. In March, 1856, I was in the employment of Mr. Isen<lb></lb>berg, as foreman of the shoe department. On 27th March I saw sons cases packed—there is an entry in the book, made by me at the time; it is an entry of six cases, containing children's and women's boots, about 500 pairs—I made a memorandum of the marks and numbers of the cases—they were "G. C. C. and Co.," and 1, 084 to 1, 093—I find those marks on this case, and the No. 1, 090—it is on the same part of the cases as those I saw packed.</p>

                  </hi>. In the early part of 1856 I was in the service of Messrs. Moses, of Tower Hill. I knew the prisoner at that time—in March, 1856, I saw him at the White Hart public house, in Rupert Square, Goodman's Fields, at the comer of Rupert Street and Lambert Street—from there I went to the other end of Rupert Street, to a court called Christopher Court—the young woman who was then living with me went with me; also Maybury, Collins, George Boyce, and a man named M'Carthy—they were altogether at the public house—when we got to a house in the court, the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man went on first, and the young woman and I followed, and we just got there in time to see two bags of boots put into the <hi rend="italic">cabby</hi> M'Carthy and Collins; Maybury was then up the court—the bags were brought out of a house about the centre of the court, but I do not know the number—I did not go into the house—when I first went to the house M'Carthy introduced me to Maybury and Collins, and said that it was all right, and I knew all about it, and I was to take them away; Collins held out his hand, and said, "If you give me the money you can have them"—that was the money for the boots and shoes—what I have told you was said in the presence of Maybury, the boots were mentioned—M'Carthy spoke first; that was in Maybury's presence, he took me, and introduced me—Collins complained about Boyce keeping him so long wait<lb></lb>ing, as he was afraid they should be taken; I offered my services—I had a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> outside the door, and he held out his hand for the money—I told him I did not have the money to give for the boots—Collins said that he had done business with a man to the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. once, and only got 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it, therefore he would not trust any more—Maybury heard this conversa<lb></lb>tion, but said nothing—we then came out, and Maybury, Collins, M'Carthy, and Boyce went to the house in the court—Collins came just as I was going</p>

               <p>away with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; he did not go to the house in the first instance, I was waiting for him—I followed them with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> up the street, to the bottom of the court, two bags were brought out, and I saw them put into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Maybury did not come out of the house in the court while I was there—I saw him go up the court, but did not see him go into the house—I went away with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, it contained water-tight boots—M'Carthy told me that there were three dozen in one bag, but there were not that quantity in each, as one bag was much smaller—I did not see any payment; I saw a cheque some time after for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but not that day; George Boyce had it—after that day, last Good Friday twelve months, I saw Maybury at the same public house; he, Collins, M'Carthy, and Boyce were all together—it might have been a fortnight or so after the occasion I have just mentioned—I just went into the public house, and Boyce and I had had a word or two, therefore we did not speak; but directly he saw me, he walked out—I did not hear any particular conversation—I have several times since con<lb></lb>versed with Maybury about these boots; he told me on one occasion that Mr. Isenberg <hi rend="italic">should</hi> ask his father to put 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward, but he said he would not do so, because his father knew he was guilty of doing it, and he told me that his father was allowing him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to keep away from his place.</p>

Moses, at No. 87, Tower Hill, not very far from St. Catherine's Docks—I was discharged when my theft was discovered—it must have been a large amount of boots and shoes that I stole—it was about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I received—Mr. Moses found that out, and discharged me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow and live at 73, South Audley Street—the prisoner has been about two years and a half in my service, first as lady's maid and then as maid and housekeeper—I appointed her as<lb></lb>keeper housekeeper at her own request—her wages were 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—as house the prisoner had charge of my house—in March I returned from Torquay and in May I went into my house, we had just changed houses—on Saturday, 15th May, from certain circumstances that came to my knowledge I discharged the prisoner, and she left on that day with certain</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187506050015"></xptr>
               <p>boxes—she returned the same night, I did not see her, I heard her; she left the next day, Sunday, with several boxes—she had asked me on the Saturday to lend her an empty box, which I did—from a communication the butler made to me I examined the house and missed several things (<hi rend="italic">several boxes full of articles were produced by the officers</hi>)—there were two mantles, a quantity of pocket handkerchiefs, some lace collars, a number of yards of lace, a great many pair of gloves, a riding habit, pairs of stockings, some silk and some collars, several sheets, a blanket, table cloths, my son's Ulster coat and other coats, some dresses, boots, 50 yards of braid, a leather case, two pair of earrings, two gold brooches, five teaspoons and a salt spoon with a crest on them—I had spoken to the prisoner about the gold brooch several months age, and she said that ray daughter had lost it out riding, and that was found in her box—all the property in these boxes belong to me—I never gave them to the prisoner—she had no right to re<lb></lb>move them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at Torquay last summer, I have been there many years—I have not a house there—at the end of the summer I left for continent—I left my housekeeper and the prisoner to pack up a great number of boxes with directions that they should be sent on afterwards to the brewery in East Smithfield—I can hardly tell how many boxes there were—I think between twenty and thirty, there might have been thirty-nine—I did not see them; I dare say the prisoner's boxes were also seat to East Smithfield, but I did not know—I was abroad then—very-likely some of my things might have been packed in her boxes; I don't know how she packed them—some boxes are more fitted for certain articles—I returned from, the Continent in January, and went to the St. George's Hotel—the prisoner had I suppose been at her own home in Norfolk in the meantime—I brought with me from the Continent the boxes I had taken with me, they were taken to my house—I stayed at the St. George's Hotel about a fortnight, after having been first to Torquay—the prisoner always did the packing—my daughter did not give her two serge dresses—my daughter is not here, she is too young to come to a place of this sort—she is twenty-three—I recollect my house in South Audley Street, being done up—my son did not come there and ask the prisoner to unpack his portmanteau—he did not throw out a number of things and say she might give them to the foreman of the works, only a few old travelling gloves—my boxes came from the brewery to South Audley Street, in February or March—I sent the prisoner into the house before it was ready for occupation—all the thirty-nine boxes were unpacked by her sooner or later—I sometimes superintended the packing, not always, when I was at the hotel I trusted to her unfortunately—I was present once when the prisoner's lodgings were searched—I saw the articles of jewellery in her boxes, in a case—we left a good many things behind at Torquay, which we could not take with us—it was the prisoner's duty to pack those somewhere—the teaspoons had been in use by a prior housekeeper, they were sent by her to me to South Audley Street, and handed by me to the prisoner when she became housekeeper, they were in her personal charge in April—at the time she received them workpeople were in the house, they are hardly out yet—the spoons were found in her box with my table linen—I discharged her on the Saturday, almost at a moment's notice—she left and came back on the Saturday night, and went through the linen—she slept in the house that night—I went through the linen as far as I could; she did not—it was not correct, it has not been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187506050016"></xptr>
               <p>right since she has been there—she did not tell me on the Sunday, that on account of the way in which the things had been packed from time to time she had things of mine amongst hers, which she would return to me—she said she would return the box—she did not ask me to lend her the box in order that she might return my things in it—she wrote me a letter afterwards; it did not state that she would return the things—I saw her leave on the Saturday, with four or five boxes—I was very much sur<lb></lb>prised at that—I did not attempt to stop her—I wanted to get rid of her; I was alone there—I did not see her pack on the Sunday; she asked me to let her stop till Sunday, and to lend her a box because she had not packed anything, and she had packed everything; she was all day packing—I said "You took away four or five boxes yesterday, bo you must have packed all that belong to you"—she said "Oh, no; I was in such a flurry I could not pack properly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At that time I was alone in the house with my daughter; my son was away—the boxes that were at the brewery were all brought back to my house in South Audley Street, none of them were taken to the prisoner's lodgings with my knowledge or consent—this is the first time I have been asked about ray daughter giving the prisoner things; I could not replace what I have lost for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., some of them were most expensive things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to Mrs. Hoare—on Saturday 15th May, I saw the prisoner leaving the house after she was discharged—she took away four large boxes and a large linen bag—she came back about 8.30 in the evening in rather a drunken state, she slept there that night—on Sunday I saw her packing a large deal box—she left about 8.30 that evening—she took away a number of boxes, I could not tell how many—there was a large deal case, a large linen bag, and some smaller cases, and a small portmanteau—I afterwards informed my mistress what had taken place—I have seen the boxes in Court—the large deal case and the large box are a portion of what I saw her take away.</p>

On Tuesday, 18th May, I went with Towner to Moore Street, Chelsea, and saw the prisoner there—I told her that I was a police-officer, and that I should take her into custody for stealing a quantity of clothes and other property belonging to her late mistress, Mrs. Hoare—she said "Some of the things were given to me, and the remainder I took away in mistake"—I found five boxes full of property Mrs. Hoare afterwards went and identified it—I afterwards went to 12, Cowley Street, Westminster, and with a key which the prisoner gave me and which she said was the key of her room there, I opened the door and found three black leather boxes full of property—Mrs. Hoare saw them—all the property is here.</p>

               <p>Q. What is she?</p>
               <p>Crofts. They say she is a girl of the town, but I did not know that when I took her in; she used to come down to my room in a morning, to have a little water for tea. On the 20th of March, I was at home at dinner, and went to my work again with the key of the box, in which were thirteen guineas, all the money I had; the box was put under the head of my bed, and locked, and when I looked for my money, which was on the Thursday following, it was gone: the 20th was on a Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last?</p>
               <p>Crofts. I had seen it about ten days before: my wife went to make the bed, and missed the box; it was found under the prisoner's bed, broke open; but the prisoner had quitted her lodgings on that 20th of March, and I never could light of her till the 21st of October. I could hear of her several times, that she was at the Goat and Black Horse, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did she leave her lodgings?</p>
               <p>Crofts. She left them on the Tuesday, in the afternoon, before I came home from work, which was at six, or half an hour after. When she found I was after her, she removed to another place. I found her at last, in Duck-lane, within an hundred yards of my house: I heard where she was, and went to her: she had lodged with us at times, about three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>Crofts. She said, How do you do, Mr. Crofts? I said, but very indifferent: how do you do? as hearty as a buck, said she. I said to the constable, there is your prisoner. Said she, must I go along with you? I said, yes. D - n you, she said, you have taken me at a disadvantage. When she came to the justice's, she denied it, and said, another woman took it; but we never saw the other woman before or since. She says, she left the other woman at Manchester or Birmingham: there was a woman at dinner with us that day, in my room, the room where the box was: she was a stranger to us.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. I never missed the box, till the Thursday after that Tuesday, when she left her lodgings in the afternoon; then I found it under the foot of her bed, in her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she owe you any thing when she went away?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. She owed me 10 s. I did not know of her going: the lock of the box was broke all to pieces; my husband was at work when I found it: there was nothing of any consequence in it, except the 13 guineas, which were taken away; they were in a little purse, and my husband kept the key.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the box before?</p>

               <p>S. Crofts. I believe I had seen it about four or five days before. On that Tuesday, she had a breast of mutton and turnips, and dined in my room, and a young woman with her that I never saw before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that young woman stay?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. She staid there a few hours.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did your husband stay?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. He staid no longer than his dinner hour; the prisoner and that woman both went away together, about two hours after my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue in the room all the time they were there?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Did not she agree that woman should lie along with me, unknown to her husband, for a week?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. No. I never saw that woman before or since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I lodged with them, on and off, two years. I never thought they were worth a guinea, or a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176412120012"></xptr> quarter of a guinea, in the world. Their house was open to all comers and goers: that day that I went away, I came down stairs, and said I was very ill; the woman that lodged with me, got a dram; he, his wife, and she, got all drunk together; I laid down on the bed. I went with a friend into the country, and when I came back, I went to live where he found me; I did not go to his house, because I owed him some money: I am as innocent of it, as the child unborn. She sent me that day to pawn her gown.</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Crofts. Did you ever send her to pawn your gown?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. No, I never sent her to pawn any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect when you had seen your money last?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. I hit the chamber-pot against the box under the bed on the Sunday morning before it was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you out on that Tuesday?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. I never go out, from year's end to years end. I was not out that Sunday, nor the Monday neither: I did go out on the Tuesday to Tothill-street, on an errand, but I was not gone half an hour.</p>

            . It was about two feet long, and a foot wide.</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Crofts. What time of the day did you go to Tothill-street?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. I went in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner then?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. She was then in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock your room door?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. I did; but we have a little back-door, that has only a button to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know of your going out?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. I don't know that she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen her any time that morning?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. I had seen her a very little time before I went out; she used frequently to come down to our room, pretending she could not be by herself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back, how did you find that back door?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. Then I found it unbuttoned.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she used to come into your room by that door?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. She used to come sometimes by one door, and sometimes the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it easy to open that door?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. The button is withinside, but it may be opened with a knife very easily.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it buttoned when you went out?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. I turned the button with my own hand, when I went out.</p>

               <p>Were all his clothes off? - On, he was dressed in the room.</p>
               <p>They took him? - They took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>This is your story? - That is my story.</p>
               <p>Was the man sober at the time? - He was sober enough, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Was he sober? - Quite sober, I am sure.</p>
               <p>He was a lodger above stairs, and you were a lodger in the first floor? - Yes, Sir, I was a lodger in the first floor.</p>
               <p>Where did Mrs. Smith lie? - On the ground floor.</p>
               <p>The Irish gentleman and his wife lay on the second floor and he lay in the garret? - Yes, he lay in the garret.</p>
               <p>(Cross examined by Mr. Garrow.)</p>
               <p>If you are angry with my Lord, you will scold me bitterly before I have done with you; I want to see if I understand the thing correctly; you say he got you down on the floor; then he hurried your petticoats over your head, put the bed-cloaths over them; put your arm under the frame of the table; then he jumped upon your middle, and by jumping with his hands and knees, contrived to do this business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were crying and screaming at that time very much? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All the time he kept one of his hands the whole time upon your hand? - I took this left hand very often.</p>
               <p>You cried as much as possible? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And called him villain as often as you could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Made as much noise as possible you were able? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is agreed. He got one of his hands on one of your arms? - Yes, I can not speak English.</p>
               <p>I will speak Welsh, rather than you should not understand me; with one of his hands he had got hold of your arm? - Sometimes; and he took it hold himself, very often to get his will of me.</p>
               <p>He sometimes used that hand for the purpose of helping himself; we all understand what you mean well enough; now the other hand he kept on the frame of the table to keep your hand down? - No, he did not keep it, the frame of the table kept my hand sometimes; I could not take it away.</p>
               <p>So then the frame of the table kept down your hand, and occasionally he helped himself with the other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120087"></xptr>He lay with you about five minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And then the business was complete? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might he lay after that before he began again? - I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>You can try; you married women know these things very well; you can tell whether it was a quarter of an hour, or five or six minutes? - You! don't you ask me that.</p>
               <p>Yes, yes, I shall? - The truth I was tell.</p>
               <p>Now how long might he lay before he tried to begin the second time? - I cannot tell, belike a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Then he was no more than a quarter of an hour in the whole? - A little more.</p>
               <p>Then as soon as it was over he was beginning again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I desire to know whether he had quitted that position which you have described before he endeavoured to begin again? - Yes, he had; I am not a young girl.</p>
               <p>Then he had withdrawn himself, before he attempted to begin again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he got up from the ground? - No.</p>
               <p>Only just a little laying by to rest himself a little? - He lay upon me.</p>
               <p>But he had withdrawn himself from your body? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he endeavoured to begin again, but that however he could not accomplish? - No.</p>
               <p>He put you down upon the floor before he put your petticoats over your head? - Chucked me down upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Then he put your petticoats over your head? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your cloaths were not put up until you were laid down upon the floor? - No.</p>
               <p>Now Mrs. Davis, you have told this story two or three times before now? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>When the watchman came you told him this story? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>You made your charge before him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This villain you know had carnally known you, he had had knowledge of you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was this the charge you made before the constable:</p>

               <p>Do you swear that positively that he is living? - I believe he is living.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to believe it, have you seen him lately? - Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Was that before or after this thing happened to you? - After this happened to me.</p>

               <p>Did you know it at the time that this thing happened to you? - No.</p>
               <p>That he was at Woolwich? - No; I heard he was dead.</p>
               <p>How lately before this thing, did you happen to hear he was dead? - Do you want me to tell such a thing as that.</p>
               <p>Now, Mrs. Davis, how lately before this thing happened to you, had you heard he was dead? - I cannot tell if you put me upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Don't you know upon your oath how lately before this man ravished you, it was that you heard your husband was dead; I must have an answer to my question? - I heard, I cannot tell when.</p>
               <p>You know Mr. Ewen who stands near you there; how long before this man ravished you had you heard your husband was dead? - I heard about three months; almost three months.</p>
               <p>Three months then before this man ravished you, you heard that your husband was dead; is that correct? - I cannot tell rightly.</p>
               <p>Was it two months before? - I am sure I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>How long before this accident happened to you? - I am sure I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Whether two or three months? - I don't know which; if I had the letter from him I could tell.</p>
               <p>You must recollect? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Had he been dead a week? - I cannot tell you Sir.</p>
               <p>Had he been dead a fortnight? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>A month or six weeks? - I can give you no answer to it.</p>
               <p>Had he been dead two days? - I can give you no answer.</p>
               <p>How long had your husband been dead before you heard of his death? - I cannot tell indeed.</p>
               <p>Had you heard he had been dead, three days or three weeks? - I heard he was dead, some person told me so.</p>
               <p>Who told you so and when? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Can you tell if he had been dead a month, or a week, or a day? - If I see the man again, I don't know him again.</p>
               <p>Then some stranger told you of it? - I had a line he was living at Woolwich.</p>
               <p>When had you that line that he was living at Woolwich? - I had it about a fortnight or nine days agone.</p>
               <p>How long since is it that you had a line that he was living? - After this happened to me.</p>
               <p>How soon after this happened to you? - It was about two or three days before I go to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120089"></xptr>How long is that ago? - About a day or two after I commit this man.</p>
               <p>So then you went to see your husband two or three days after you had committed this man, and you had a line that he was alive two or three days before that? - I go a day or two after the line, about two or three days after I commit this man, I went to see my husband; I had the line that night I believe.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell who brought you that letter; perhaps it was

               <p>You resisted him on the bed, and then he had you on the floor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the alderman all this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the alderman you was thrown twice on the bed? - I cannot recollect whether I told him that I was twice on the bed.</p>
               <p>You was twice examined before the alderman; I desire to know whether at either of those times you swore that he put you twice on the bed? - I believe I did not say he put me twice on the bed.</p>

               <p>Then you only told the alderman that he put you once on the bed? - I did not tell no more than that; I cannot recollect indeed.</p>

               <p>In consequence of an information against the prisoners, you went in search of them? - I did. On Wednesday, the 17th of March, I apprehended both the prisoners; I went to a corner house in Wardour-street; after being there some time, and telling my business, the prisoners came down stairs, with their hands in their pockets: I was apprehensive that they were armed, at that time, and therefore I let them pass by me. As soon as they were got out into the street, I made a hue-and-cry; upon which they drew their hands out of their pockets, and then I saw they had a pistol in each hand. They were pursued, and taken. When we came to Bow-street, I searched them; I found, upon Joseph, four Bank post-bills, a 100 l. a 70 l. a 40 l. another, 33 l. 14 s. and a lottery-ticket, No. 28,257.</p>

The clerk called me out, and said a Gentleman wanted cash for a Bank post-bill, but had refused to give the premium which we always have, which is a quarter per cent. He said, that if the master of the house was there, he thought he would not take it. He called me. I said it was what we always had. He said, If it is what you take; I must allow it you; as I am upon travel, and must have cash.</p>

               <p>Please to look at that note, and inform the court and jury whether that was one of the notes forwarded by you to London by the mail? - This was a note forwarded by me to London, by the mail, on Saturday the 27th of January, 1781. This is No. T 1062, 40 l. There were three others, T 1060, T 1061, and T 1063, of the same date and tenour .</p>
               <p>Please to look at this note, and see whether that is one you forwarded also? - I believe it is; but the number has been altered since.</p>
               <p>What alteration has been made in the number? - Here is an addition of a 0 to it; the original number was T 1063; it appears now T 10630.</p>
               <p>That alteration is made by putting a 0 after the figures? - It is.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say whether it was one of the bills you forwarded to London? - I believe it is; but, the number being altered, it does not appear as before.</p>
               <p>What reason have you for believing it? - I have a copy in my pocket, that I took of the bills, which corresponds with these. I believe I have left it in my great-coat pocket, in the other room. I have examined it, and every thing corresponds but the 0, which clearly is an addition.</p>
               <p>What is there that induces you to think this was not 10630, when the bill was originally issued at the Bank? - Because the date and sum agree with the other, and the 0 appears to me to be added since the bill was sent from my house. My memorandum is, Bank post-bill, No. T 1063, dated January 16th, 1781, payable to

               <p>Can you tell who the person was that came? - In the midst of business, we are very thronged; to the best of my recollection, it was

               <p>How did he pay for the ticket? - He gave me 100 l. Bank post-bill; I had not cash enough in the till, to give the change myself. I took it to Mr. Branscomb, and said, I wanted change for this 100 l. note. He gave me three 25 l. bank notes, and bid me make the rest up in cash, which I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever seen the prisoner Joseph before? - Not before that night.</p>
               <p>You must have a vast number of people come to your office, I imagine? - A vast many. In the course of a week or eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030018"></xptr> days, the same gentleman came again, and wanted another ticket; I took one out of the till, the only one I had at the time. I said, I had only one ticket; if you are not partial to any number, this is undrawn: he said something, he was not particular about the number. He took out of his pocket a little red Morocco pocket-book, and opened it, but he did not take any bill out of the book. I happened to cast my eye upon him, and when he saw that I looked at him, he turned away from the counter, clapped his hand upon his thigh, and said, I have left my purse in some place he mentioned. He immediately retired from the office, and did not buy the ticket, nor did not offer me a bill at that time.</p>

               <p>Are you sure he was the same person that you took the bill of? - I really believe him to be the same person; it struck me, the second time, that he was the same person.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you now certain, or not, whether he was the person that came the second time? - I am sure he is the person that came the second time.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether he was the person that came the first time, or not, you are not positive? - Not so positive; but I believe so .</p>
               <p>You have looked at the ticket? - Yes, I know the ticket.</p>
               <p>You are sure that ticket was sold at your office? - I am sure that is the ticket, because I indorsed it myself.</p>

               <p>Court. How do you know that the number was altered after it went from the Bank? - We never issue any Bank post-bills above the number 10,000.

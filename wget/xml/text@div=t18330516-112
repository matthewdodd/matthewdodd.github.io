             (Police-constable T 107). On the night of the third of May, about twelve o'clock, I was on duty on the bank of the river, near Chiswick, with two of my brother-officers - we heard some persons conversing across the river; I and my brother-officer went and took a boat at Chiswick-ferry, and proceeded across the river towards the spot where we had heard the conversation - we got half-way across and saw a barge moored off the Surry side, and saw a boat shoot a-head of the barge, coming towards the Middlesex side - we rowed round the barge, and it was loaded with lime; we followed the boat but lost sight of it, but a boat passed us in-shore laden with sacks and two men in it; it was coming towards us, not in the same direction the other had gone; we turned, suspecting their's was the boat we had been following; it passed us so near that I was obliged to unship my scull to let them pass, one of the men in it was Thomas; I could not swear to the other man; we followed them, and they drove it up a drain which carries the water through the meadows; we did not observe it go up the drain but saw the stern sticking out - we jumped on board and found it was drawn on shore, but not fastened; we got on shore, but the mud was so thick we could not proceed after the men, and the fog coming on we got on board again, and found the sacks of oats and beans on board, we took the boat to Chiswick - Mr. Downs owned the boat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose boat did you take to go in pursuit of them? A. A waterman's at Chiswick; it was not foggy at first, it was a fine night; I had not seen Thomas before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did it pass your boat very near? A. Yes, so near that the man next the boat had to unship his scull; they must have been within half a yard of us; we did not stop them, as we did not know it was the boat we were in pursuit of - but I thought it might be, as I had seen two men in the other boat, just as it was gaining the point where we lost it.</p>

            . I am Watson's mother, and live at Mrs. Vaughan's, at Brentford. On the day before my son was taken, I had been on the river with him, and Thomas, and Mrs. Vaughan - between seven and eight o'clock we were hailed by Chuter, who asked my son if he would give him any thing to drink, which he agreed to do; Chuter said if we would take him back he would come on shore and have some - my son said Thomas should take him back, as his arm was bad and he could not row; my son did not row the boat at all, from the time Chuter got into it; when we got on shore and had had something to drink, my son, Mrs. Vaughan, and I went home, and Thomas came with the boat; he and my son then went out to Chuter; it was then a quarter before nine, and at a quarter-past eleven o'clock they all three came to the door together; I did not see them, but my son came in, and was in bed by half-past eleven o'clock; Thomas came in and was in bed about ten minutes after my son; I slept in the same room - my son was called at half-past four o'clock in the morning and got up; he could not have got up before without my knowing it.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.How long have you known Thomas? A.Nearly twelve months; he has lodged at my house full six months - there are only four rooms in the house; I have slept in the same room with my son and Thomas ever since before Christmas - I went bofore the magistrate at Hammersmith, but was not called - I know it was a quarter before eleven o'clock when the three came to my door; I looked at the clock - I know Thomas went to bed ten minutes after my son; I do not sleep very soundly; I fastened my door on the inside; I knew my son had to go to London to the lug, but he came home to have his are dressed, as he had scalded it; I don't know whether that would disable a man from rowing, but he did not row when we were out that day.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.When they first came to the door, after they had been to drink, they came altogether? A. Yes, my son did go out to help them launch the boat off, but he came in again directly; Thomas rowed Chuter to the barge and then he came in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you bolt your door? A. I locked it sir; Thomas went to bed last and I then got up and locked the door; it is but a small room.</p>
               <p>MRS. VAUGHAN. I keep the house in which Mrs. Watson, her son, and Thomas reside. I was in Mr. Downs' boat with them that evening - Thomas rowed the boat as Watson had scalded his arm; Chuter was in his barge, he called to Watson and asked him if he would give him some beer if he came on shore; Watson said he would, and they fetched him - we afterwards went home, and the two prisoners went out to meet Chuter; they all three came to my door afterwards; and after launching the boat, Watson came in and went to bed, and Thomas came in in about ten minutes; he went to hed in the same room where Mrs. Watson and her son slept - I don't sleep in that room, I sleep with my husband - neither of the prisoners went out again that night, for I was up ironing till half-past three in the morning - they could not go out without going through the room I was in.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. What is your husband? A. A labouring man - Mrs. Watson goes out nursing, and when she is at home she sleeps in the same room with her son and Thomas - when the three men came to the door it was a quarter past eleven; I know the time; I have a clock in the room - I did not exactly look at it - I can't tell how many times I have talked this matter over.</p>

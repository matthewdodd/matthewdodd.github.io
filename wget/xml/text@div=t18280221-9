On the 2nd of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner knocked at the door, and asked my servant if I had a bed-room and sitting room to let for a single gentleman. I came down, and saw him in the passage - he asked if I had an apartment to let; I asked him into the parlour, and asked if it was wanted for any length of time; he said it was for a gentleman who had come from the country, and was at the Saracen's Head, Aldgate - that it might be for a month, more or less. This coat laid on the parlour sofa - I said I could not give him an answer till Monday - this was on Saturday; he left the room before me; I showed him out at the front door, and shut the door after him - he returned in five minutes, and knocked at the door - the servant came up to me to give me notice, and when I came down he was gone; I missed the coat, which was on the sofa when I let him out the first time - he was taken within five minutes, and brought back to the house, with it; I know it to be my son Richard's, coat.</p>

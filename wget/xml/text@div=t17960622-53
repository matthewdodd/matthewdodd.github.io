               <p>Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am a patrole in Chick-lane; I sat in my box, I heard a bullock come down, and somebody coming after it, between one and two o'clock, it was a month ago last Monday; I looked out and saw the bullock, and a man coming, and I thought the man did not drive it as if he was driving it right, he did not go after the bullock as if he belonged to it, he did not wish to turn it, that made me stop him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he driving it fast or slow? - A. Pretty fast down Chick lane, from Smithfield; I knew he had no business to drive it that way; I drew my cutlass and ran after him, I called out to a man below, stop that man, and he called out, stop that bullock; I said, never mind the bullock, stop the man, the other watchman let the bullock pass him, and stopped the prisoner; we jumped on the man at once; I said, there is a number of false badges, let me look at your badge; they are numbers they wear on their arm, granted by the Lord-Mayor, the watchman looked, and said, that is a false badge; I said, who do you work for, and he said,

            , so accordingly I said, if you work for Stevy Player, go along with me, it is very well, if you don't, I will take care of it; I called another watchman to go with me for fear he should be rescued; I took him as far as the Three-tuns, and there I stopped, and said, I would go to Stevy Player; there was a man with a drove of beasts, he said, that is the man I work for, I asked the man if he did, he said, yes; I asked the man his name, he said, Porkey.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you asked the prisoner his name? - A. Yes; he said his name was Porkey; I said, then you are brothers, are you, and the other man said, no; with that I said, I thought you were brothers, being both of a name; the prisoner then made off, my partner and I ran after him, he ran among the beasts two or three times, and dodged me; I met him, and then he had a hedge-stake in his hand, and made a stroke at me with it; I made after him again, and met him again, and he struck at me him, my partner has the badge, we let the beast go, we did not take any further notice of it.</p>

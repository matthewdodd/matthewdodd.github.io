On the evening of the 11th of October, about half-past seven o'clock, I went to Dalston; I had shut up my shop and left the property safe; I returned about half-past nine o'clock, and found the property stated in the indictment gone, and my wife had eloped; I did not see her again till she appeared before the Magistrate to exhibit articles of peace against me; it struck me she was in the habit of visiting at Calvert's and I went there; I did not see the prisoner then, but I saw him the next morning; I stated what I had lost, and asked if my wife had brought any thing to his premises; he said no - they had not seen her for two months - which I knew to be false, as I had watched her in there on the Sunday morning; it occurred to me that the prisoner had a loft at Mr. Wilkins' premises in Old-street; I went there, and Mr. Wilkins told me to come the next morning at seven o'clock; I did so, and after looking about I found a large canvass bag did under some trusses of hemp; I pulled it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060048"></xptr>out and found some of my property in it; Wilkins' man then came up and knocked me down and took it from me- I fetched the officer, and met Calvert; I said to him,"You have acted the part of a villian towards me in keeping my property;" he said "There was nothing there belonging to me, and nothing should I have;" when I returned with the officer Calvert shut the door against us, and said we should not come in - we got in by force; he and a man were sitting on the bag - they resisted us and pushed us about; we got the property, and took it to the office; the prisoner said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Upon your oath do not you know that in consequence of you and your wife quarrelling, she was forced to take the mattress to sleep on? A. No; I never had but one indictment for assault preferred against my wife - the prisoner then became her bail, and arrested me for her board and lodging; I went to Worship-street, and made a charge of felony against him there - the charge was made before another Magistrate afterwards, but neither of them committed him; I then went before the Grand Jury; I never offered to settle the business if they would give me any money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any proof that this man stole them? A. No; I have no doubt but my wife took them and put them in his care.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant clerk at the Westminster County Court. I produce a certified copy of an entry in the plaint book, with reference to the suit of Quinton <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> ✗Johnson—the plaint was entered on 27th April, 1858; William Quinton, plaintiff, against Joseph Johnson, defendant, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., money detained—that came on to be heard on 19th May, when the plaintiff and defendant appeared—Mr. Whitmore was the presiding judge—the plaintiff made his statement, and the defendant then tendered himself as a witness, and was duly sworn, and gave evidence—the plaintiff's evidence was, that the defendant, being at his house, they proposed having some gin and tobacco; it was either one house or other, for both plaintiff and defendant were together; that he asked the defendant to fetch the gin and tobacco, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185807050059"></xptr>
               <p>gave him a sovereign, and after a considerable period the defendant returned with the gin and tobacco, and change for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that the plaintiff said, "I gave you a sovereign'"—the defendant said, "No, you only gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—on being examined by the Judge, the defendant swore that it was only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the plaintiff said, "There is a witness present, who saw me lay the sovereign on the table," but he was not present, and the Judge adjourned the case for an hour, requesting a person, who was a witness in the case, to go to the witness's place of employment, and bring him to the Court, and Clewley was brought in, and examined; the result was a verdict for the plaintiff for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was ordered to be paid on 31st May, with the expenses of the three witnesses, and his Honour committed him there and then—after the positive statement of the plaintiff, and the assertion that a witness would come forward, the jndge looked very hard at the defendant, and said, "Now do you still persist in your statement?" or words to that effect, and then, took up the book, and examined him, and wrote down his words, and he still persisted that it was only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chair maker, of No. 26, Brunswick Street, Blackfriars Road. I have known the defendant some years—On Sunday afternoon, 28th March, I left my house about ten minutes to 10 o'clock—I put two sovereigns in one pocket, and one shilling in the other; on my way I met the defendant (I had previously purchased some tobacco); his brother Charles was with him; we had a quart of beer, which I paid for with fourpence in copper; I had paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the tobacco, which left me 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the beer, left me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the two sovereigns—I went to his house at his invitation, and two persons named Clewley, father and son, came in—we all had some beer there—the defendant asked me to lend him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the work which I wag going to give him to do (some turning)—I did so; that was before I went to his house; that was all the silver I had—when we got to the house, Clewley sent out for some beer; they had clubbed together a few halfpence—I wanted to get home to my dinner, and Clewley said, "Shall we have a drop before we go?" I said, "I do not mind;" and said to Johnson, "Just get a half pint of gin," and put down a sovereign on the table—he took it up, went out with his brother, and stopped away nearly two hours—when he came back he brought the gin—I asked him for the change, as he did not offer to give it; he said, "What change?" I said, "The change out of the sovereign;" he said, "You only gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "I saw it was a sovereign when I put it down on the table;" he said, "No; you only gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" he then pretended not to know what he was doing, and appeared to get more drunk—Clewley asked him whether he was going to give the change; he said, "No"—Clewley said, "It is a very bad thing of you, the poor man cannot afford to lose a sovereign;" Johnson said, "No, I am not going"—Clewley said, "I saw Mr. Quinton put down the sovereign, and saw you pick it up"—I fetched a policeman; Clewley went away first—his brother Charles came back with him when he brought the gin—the inspector at the station refused to receive the charge—I afterwards went before a Magistrate; the defendant appeared, and the Magistrate said that it was a very dishonest action, and very near a felony,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185807050060"></xptr>
               <p>and told me, if he did not pay me, to summon him to the County Court, and I would get my money—I took out a summons; I was too late the first time, on account of my work, and took out another—I gave my evidence, and Johnson swore that I only gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that he brought a half pint of gin, which was 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco, and left 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the bottle—I heard the Judge caution him; he repeated the same statement afterwards; I have not seen him since; he has not spoken to me at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What day was it when the sovereign was expended? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 28th March, Palm Sunday, about ten minutes to 1 o'clock in the day—I had not been drinking with other persons; about three pots of beer were drunk on this occasion, when Mr. Clewley came in, I was there about half an hour before Clewley came in not more—when he came in we had a pot of beer, and we had had one pot before; another man was with Clewley, who was a stranger to me—I persist in my answer that we only had three pots of beer altogether—after they were drunk, he invited us to his house about 100 yards off—we did not stop at any public house on the way; they then clubbed round when I think they paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. apiece, there were seven of us, but I did not give anything—half a gallon of beer was brought in which would be 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I think—no one sent for more after that, only the half pint of gin; it was about an hour from the time I went to the defendant's to the time I sent for the gin—it was a little after 5 o'clock when he came back; they were all present when I gave the sovereign—Johnson's daughter was not there, she was there at first, but she went out, and I did not see her come in again, she was outside—I did not take my share of the liquor, I would not touch it, because I was so vexed, but I took my share of the beer—Clewley, the son, is here, the one who was sent for at the County Court; the father was there likewise—it is not a very large room—I did not see that any of the party were a little the worse for liquor at the time the gin was sent for—I gave the defendant in custody about an hour after he returned, he pretended to be the worse for liquor, I do not know whether he was shamming or not—I was too late the first time at the County Court, and I was too late here last Session, the Grand Jury were discharged—no one has given the defendant notice to appear here to my knowledge—the Magistrate dismissed the charge.</p>

I have known Johnson as long as I can recollect—I knew Quinton, but not so intimately as I knew Johnson—I was in Johnson's house on Palm Sunday—we drank one half-gallon of beer before the gin was sent for—they said, "Cannot we have a drop of gin before we go?" Mr. Quinton put a sove<lb></lb>reign on the table, and said, "Go and get some out of this"—I saw that it was a sovereign—Johnson took it away with his brother Charles—they were away about an hour and a half—he put the gin on the table, and Quinton asked for the change; Johnson said, "What?" he said, "The change for the sovereign;" Johnson said, "It was not a sovereign, it was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" and he had had to take 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of his own pocket to pay—he walked all right into the room, but after Mr. Quinton asked him for the change, he laid himself</p>

On the 4th of January, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I had two sovereigns and 11 s. 6 d. in silver. I met the two prisoners in Oxford-market. I had been to receive my pension - the prisoners were quarrelling with another young woman; I stepped up to see what was the matter. I had two or three of my comrades with me; we left the women in the street, and went into a public-house. We did not get very intoxicated, but were a little the worse for liquor. We left the public-house about half-past two or three o'clock. I then met the prisoners again - Mott wished me to go with her, which I declined; she still followed me, and asked for something to drink - Wardle was then gone. I went into a liquor shop at the top of the Haymarket, and gave her a glass of gin; I then came down to the Broadway, and gave to Mr. Fox, a poulterer, one sovereign, to take 7 s. 6 d. which I owed him. I had then two sovereigns and 14 s. in my pocket. I told Mott I did not wish her to go with me; we then went to <placeName id="t18250113-23-crimeloc114">Strutton-ground</placeName>

I gave her 1 s. to fetch a pot of beer - she left me in the room. She said it was her own room. Three or four other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130011"></xptr>young women came in soon after she had fetched the beer; they pushed me down on the bed and cut my pocket off. I cannot state which of them it was, but I think it was Mott - they ran off and I after them, but could not overtake them; they ran into a house in the same yard. I went for a constable but we could not find them. I am quite sure that Wardle was one of the women who came into the room - she said</p>

            . I am an officer. I was applied to by Powell, about five o'clock - he said he had been robbed in Duck-lane by some of the women, and he would take me to the house; we went, but there were no women there. He then took me to another house, where he said he had been, but we found no person there. He described the women, and I took them up in consequence of his description. He appeared as if he had been in liquor but had recovered. I took Wardle on the following morning, about half-past four o'clock, in the same house, in the next room. As soon as the prosecutor saw her he said she was one of them; there was another woman in bed with her but he did not accuse her. I asked him if Wardle was the woman who took the money; he said No, she held him down - his hand had a scratch.</p>

               <p>WARDLE'S Defence. I had been out and met a gentleman, who took me to a house in the Almonry, and next morning the officer took me. I had not seen the prosecutor.</p>

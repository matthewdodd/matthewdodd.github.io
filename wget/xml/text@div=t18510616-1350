                  </hi>. I am a French-polisher—the prisoner was in my service. On 7th June I tent him to Mr. Cook's, in Oxford-street, to get some money owing to me, not any stated sum, but what he could get—when he came back, he told me that Mr. Cook had given him none, and did not know when he could—I paid him his wages that night, and he went away, and did not return—on the next Saturday, the 14th, I saw him, and asked him if he had any money belonging to me—he said, "No"—I said, "You have got some money you received from Mr. Cook"—he denied having any, and I gave him into custody.</p>

            . My husband is a weaver; he lives at Darking, but in January, 1768, we lived at Stepney. On the 4th of January we were in bed when the cutters came. I did not get out of my bed. My husband had four looms in the house; the cutters went into the room, and cut the four looms to pieces. I saw two of the men upon the stairs; they spoke to me: he that is called captain came into my bed-chamber, and demanded my money. Perrin came up with them. I saw Cavalier and Read upon the stairs. I knew them before. Read taught my husband and daughter the weaving business. There was no work in any of the looms; after it had been cut out the first time, we used, as soon as a piece was made, to take it out. There was no trimming work in the looms. I do not know but there was trimming work lying in the room. They totally destroyed the four looms.</p>

             the younger. My father is a weaver. I know the prisoners at the bar. In the beginning of January, 1768, about one in the morning,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180031"></xptr> on the 4th, they came to my father's house at Stepney, and knocked at the door; I went out of my bed in my shift and opened the casement, and asked who was there; they asked for Mr. Clare, and told me to come down and open the door, or they would blow my brains out. I said to my mother, There are some cutters come to destroy us again, (my father was in the country.) I told them I would come down, as soon as I had put my clothes on. They said they would fire at the window directly, if I did not come down immediately. I went and opened the door: one of them took hold of my hand, and desired me to lead him to the shop door. I did, and told him there was the shop, and every thing belonging to the weaving trade. I begged of them to spare my life, and my mother and children. They asked where my father was; I said in the country. Perrin knocked at the chamber door; he said, Open the door directly. They wanted a knife. I went down on my knees, and begged my life. They said they did not want my life, they wanted a knife. I said I must go down two pair of stairs for one. They said, if I went directly, I should not be hurt. I went down. The moon shone very bright, and it was a very deep snow. They had no other light with them. I turned round at the door, thinking I should know some of them. I went to the table-drawer, and took out a knife. They snatched it from me. I then asked if I might go up stairs; they said, Not till they pleased. I could not tell what to do. I stood at one corner of the room till they ordered me to go up. It was very cold. I asked them if I might go up to bed; they said, Yes. I saw Perrin and another in the shop, cutting the looms to pieces. Cavalier was below stairs, and who else I do not know. I cannot tell who the other persons were. I went up stairs, and walked about the room. They came up stairs, and knocked at the door again. I asked what they wanted? They said they wanted money. Who that was, I cannot say. They said they must have something to drink. One came into the bed-room, and said, Mrs. Clare, I must have some money to drink your health. My mother said, How can you expect any money, when you distress me in this manner? I said, Mother you have a shilling in your pocket, let me give them that. I gave it into a man's hand. I do not know who he was. I said, Here is all we have in the world, except three farthings. The man said, I am sorry for it, a good morning to you, and down stairs they went. They called when they were out at the window for me to come down, to come and take my father's books and writings that they had thrown into the snow. I said I could come and fetch them when they were gone. They kept making a noise, and staid about an hour; They made me come down. As I came down I saw a man. I called to them to take that man to them. The man that asked for the shilling said, if it was not true, he would blow my brains out. Every thing was broke in the house like an earthen-ware shop. I believe they had a guard at the door at the time. They cut all the four looms, and every thing, all to pieces, and took some things away. There was no silk in the looms, neither were any silk trimmings cut.</p>

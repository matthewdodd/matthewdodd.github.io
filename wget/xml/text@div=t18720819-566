Leverson, 101, Cirencester Street, London, W."—I posted it myself, between 3 and 4 o'clock on 5th July, having pre<lb></lb>viously called the attention of Wood, the inspector of letter carriers, to it—next morning, shortly after 10 o'clock, the letter was brought to me; the envelope had been opened, and the underneath part of it was damp, the three upper flaps had been forced, and from it had been taken the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—the prisoner was then sent for to the Postmaster's private room—I showed him the letter, and said "This letter has been opened, and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes have been taken from it; do you know anything of the notes?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Where are they?"—he put his right hand into his right hand trousers' pocket, and took out two notes crumpled up, which he handed to Rumbold, the police-officer, who was present; Rumbold handed them to me, and I identified them as those I had enclosed in the envelope.</p>

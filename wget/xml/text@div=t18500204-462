                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 381). On the evening of 1st Feb. I was in the Canal-road, Mile-end, watching a marine store shop, kept by the pri<lb></lb>soner Beckett—my brother officer, Tickett, was with me—we were in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner, Monk, going towards Beckett's shop, and noticed he had something bulky under his jacket—he went into the shop, and I watched him through the window—Beckett was behind the counter—Monk took this piece of leaden pipe from under his jacket, bent as it' is now—Beckett took it of Monk, put it into the scale, weighed it, and gave Monk a shilling—he was speaking—Beckett threw the lead behind the counter—Monk then came out of the shop as I ran in—I asked Beckett for that piece of leaden pipe he had just bought—he said, "I have not bought any leaden pipe; it was an old brass tap"—I said I was a police-officer, and I insisted on having the piece of lead—I ran round the counter, and he put out his leg to throw me—I saved myself with one hand and took hold of the lead with the other—the lead was behind the counter on the floor—I pat the pipe on the counter, left it in charge of my brother officer, and I ran and overtook Monk—I told him I came to take him on suspicion of stealing a piece of leaden pipe—he said, "I have not been to the shop"—I had not then men-tioned anything about a shop—I took him to the shop, and he said, "I hope you will look over it; it is the first time; I have got a wife and a large family"—he acknowledged that he did sell it—he did not say where he got it, but I knew where he worked—Beckett asked me to go into his back room, and said he hoped I would look over it—he said he would give me anything if I would look over it this time; it was the first time—I asked him where his book was—he said he had none, and then he commenced writing on a slate—I knew both the prisoners before for some years—Monk gave his address, "Facing the Three Colts, Old Ford"—he did live there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman K</hi> 170). I was with Benton that evening—I saw Monk in the canal-road, coming from the Mile-end-road—he went into Beckett's shop—he had a jacket on, with something under it—I could Dot see what it was—it appeared bulky—it made his jacket stick out—he went into the shop—I went over, and looked in at the window—I saw Monk take a piece of leaden pipe from under his jacket—he gave it to Beckett, who was behind the counter—Beckett put it into the scale, and gave him Is.—Beckett then took it out of the scale, and threw it behind the counter—I then went into the shop with my brother officer, and Monk left the shop—Benton told Beckett that he wanted the piece of leaden pipe he had just bought—he said he had bought none; it was an old piece of brass tap—Benton said we were constables, and insisted on having the leaden pipe—he went behind the counter, and Beckett laid hold of him, and attempted to throw him—Benton took the pipe up, and gave it into my possession, and he went out after Monk—after he was gone, Beckett said he hoped we would look over it, that he had an afflicted wife, and he bought it—Benton brought Monk back, and he said he hoped we would look over it, it was the first time, and he had a large family and a wife at home—Beckett asked us to go into the back parlour, and settle it—he went into the parlour, and said to his son, "Make an entry of the pipe I have just bought," and his son did, on a piece of paper—Beckett took it, and put it into his pocket—I took it from him at the station—this is it—I have known Monk about two years.</p>

I am in the service of my father, John Cocks, who keeps a plumber's shop in Frederick-place, Mile-end-road, about 150 yards from the Canal-road—Monk was in my father's service, and he was at work on the 1st Feb., not at the shop, but at a building, about 100 yards off—this is my father's pipe; it is a piece I had had in my hand about half an hour before it was brought to me by the officers—I know it by this crack, and by taking off a union screw from it—it is old lead, and was lying in the shop—it was then straight, not bent as it is now—it weighs about 12lbs., and is worth about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we are allowed 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt. when we exchange old lead for new at our lead merchants—we do not sell it again as old lead.</p>

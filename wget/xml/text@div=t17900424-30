               <p>On Easter Monday, I was in Mrs. Harlow's kitchen: I saw the prisoner take a grid-iron out of the shop; I got on the window, and looked through a hole; he carried it away: I followed him into Fleet-lane, and saw him sell it at Mrs. Reed's; I waited till he came; and I spoke to him, and said, how came you to steal things? and he ran away.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you not to seize him?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240151"></xptr>- I was all in a tremble, and fear; I did not know but he lodged at Mrs. Reed's, till I heard them bargaining: the constable has the gridiron.</p>

               <p>I had the gridiron from Smith, when I was at the end of Cock-lane; the prisoner and Smith were struggling; and I went and secured him, and left him in care of one of the patrol: I went to Mrs. Reed, and asked her for the gridiron; and she denied it; I told her it was no use to deny it, for we had the thief in custody: Smith went the next day, and she gave it him.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. Is that the gridiron? - Yes, I am sure of it; I never saw such a one before.</p>

               <p>and I went after the woman—I overtook her about 300 yards off—I saw the male prisoner on ahead, ten or twelve yards—I said to the woman, "You gave me a bad shilling"—she said, "Did I? are you sure of that?" I said, "I am"—she said, "Let me look at it"—I gave it her back—she said, "Can you swear to this?"—I said "I can, on my oath"—she said she was very sorry, she did not know it was bad; and she gave me a good shilling, and said, "See if that is a good one; I am sorry to give you the trouble"—she then went away—I saw her the same night, when the policeman brought her—I am sure she is the same woman, and the male prisoner was the man I saw.</p>

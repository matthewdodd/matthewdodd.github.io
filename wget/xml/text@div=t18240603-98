I believe I mentioned in the room that I had been robbed - I went out, and saw him near the door - I called before I got to the door to a person coming in, and said Stop thief! he was not stopped till he had run across King-street; I went out after him - he was out of my sight for a moment in the passage, but not in the street; I am sure he is the same person - he had got about half way up the street towards the market; he was searched, and my purse found on him - I did not see it taken from him, as a crowd collected, and I cannot swear to the quantity of money that was in it when I lost it, but it must have been within a shilling or two of what there was when I went into the sale-room - there was one sovereign - I can't swear to the silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You were in this room, which was very much crowded - A.

            . I live in St. Martin's-street. I was at the sale room, and saw the prisoner there - I was looking at some linen, and he pushed against me, and pressed me against the counter - he came and stood against the right shoulder of Mrs. Head. In about five minutes my attention was drawn that way, and I saw him take his hand from under Mrs. Head's shawl, with a purse in it; I did not speak, because I did not know but it might be his own property - I did not suppose he had taken it from her. In about a minute she turned her head, and said,</p>
               <p>"My purse is gone;" in consequence of which I turned, and looked for the gentleman with the purse, but he was gone. I left the sale room soon after, and did not see him again till I saw him at Bow-street. I am certain he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were there in the room - A. There might be a hundred; the prisoner was in the lower part of the room; there might be a dozen persons near Mrs. Head.</p>

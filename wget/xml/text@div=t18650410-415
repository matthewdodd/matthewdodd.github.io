"he said, "I picked that up in the Hackney-road also"—I then said, "Where do you live?"—he said, "In Duncan-street, Mile End"—I found a letter on him addressed to Mr. Roberts, and I went to the address on that letter—I have left it at the office—I did not go to Duncan-street, Mile End; I went to 45, West-street, Devonshire-street, Mile End, in consequence of the letter I found in his pocket—it was a weaver's shop—I made a search upstairs, and found a quantity of watchmaker's tools, and about fifty watch-bows, gold and silver—I also found on Roberts 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—these bows are second-hand—there may be two or three new ones—I took him to the station—he said he was a weaver.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, G</hi>) On Friday, 24th February, about 3 in the afternoon, I went to 142, Whitechapel-road with Sergeant Moss, Inspector Brannan, and several other officers, who were posted back and front of the house—the lower part of the house was being fitted up as a pie-shop—I knocked at the door, received no answer, and knocked a second time—the door was then opened by Mrs. Jeffery, who I know as Barrett—</p>

               <p>I then shoved the door and went in, and saw the man Barrett (Jeffery) titling on a bench—Brewerton was standing in the centre of the shop, and Mrs. Brewerton near him—I said, "Barrett and Brewerton, you must con<lb></lb>sider you selves in custody for being concerned with others in several jewel robberies in the City and the Strand"—at the time I took Jeffery by the collar, Moss took Brewerton, and a violent struggle took place between them—another officer arrived, and at that time I saw Jeffery pass something to Mrs. Brewerton—she turned round and ran upstairs, followed by Mrs. Jeffery—I gave Jeffery into Ranger's custody, and followed quickly behind the women upstairs—before I could reach the top, Mrs. Brewerton turned aside into the room on the left and locked the door; Mrs. Jeffery went to the right—I knocked at the door where Brewerton went in, and said, "Open the door quickly; "not receiving any answer, I burst it open, and saw her with her right hand putting something in her pocket, taking at the same time something off the mantel-shelf with her left hand and putting it towards her pocket—I said, "What have you got there?"—she said, "Nothing"—I went to take hold of her hand, and she caught me by my hair and my whiskers, and held me in that position until the arrival of Sergeant Moss, who released me—she struggled violently—a sergeant in uniform came up, and he and Moss held her hands while I took from her pocket these four or five parcels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) containing gold chains—they were in a piece of old newspaper then—they are all gold chains; most of them new—there were some pieces of broken chain also; they appear pieces of new chain broken up—all I produce now I took from Mrs. Brewerton—I also found a purse containing spade guineas and half guineas, six 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, some pieces of chain, and four rings—this is the purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found this small box on the drawers in the room—it contained some lockets, a piece of chain, and another guinea, and two receipts for money paid into the London and Westminster Bank; one for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "18th January, 1865, received from Mr. William Henry Jeffery 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling, to the credit of his deposit-account at the London and Westminster Bank;" 23d January, received from Mr. William Henry Jeffery 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. &amp;c."—I have six 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes here—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was found at the other house—we then conveyed the prisoners to the station, and pro<lb></lb>ceeded to 13, Ely-terrace, Bow-road—I knocked at the door, Mrs. Caseley put her head out at the window, and said, "Who are you?"—I knew her at that time by the name of "Casey "only—I said, "We are police-officers; open the door" hearing a bustle in the house, and no one coming to open the door, I burst it open—Moss was close to me at the time—I rushed up<lb></lb>stairs followed by him, and saw the woman Caseley run out of a small room at the back into the front-room, where I found the man Caseley—at that moment Brannan came up, and I left him in charge of the two Caseleys in the front-room, and went into the back-room, where I saw Mrs. Caseley come from—in searching that room we found this box locked (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Moss took a poker and broke it open—I lifted the lid and saw a quantity of watches and chains, fifty-two gold watches, and one silver watch, gold coin to the amount of 196<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I mentioned at the police-court that it was 246<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but that includes the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the money was all in this bag, as it is now; it was taken to the station, untied, and counted in the presence of the superintendent—it has been in Mr. Durkin's pos<lb></lb>session ever since—we tied a piece of rope round the box and took it to the station—there was a large quantity of gold chains in it—the jewellery and money in the box is all in reference to this robbery—we found another box</p>

Johnson's burglary—I found a quantity of jewellery in your possession, which has been identified as Mr. Johnson's property—I did not find it then—you said to your wife, "Give me those things that Billy gave you"—I did not know they belonged to Mr. Johnson then—I have heard your other name; it is "Tom, the madman"—we heard that wherever we found Bar<lb></lb>rett, we should find "Tom, the madman, "which was you—that is a nick<lb></lb>name you are known by amongst the thieves—I can't say you have not been at work since you were discharged from the convict-gate, up to the time you were charged with Mr. Walker's burglary—you did not say that you</p>

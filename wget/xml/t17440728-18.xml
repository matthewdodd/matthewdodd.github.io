He carried us to a house in the parish, which is called the blind woman's house, where I went in, but found nobody; I found nothing but two dead fowls , which they had stolen that night. I went up towards Rag Fair, and by the watch-house we took these three girls, and they carried us to Mr. Johnson's house, where I found the things.</p>

            . I went with the Con stable to Johnson's house, the Constable looked through the key hole, and bid us run round, the things were in the yard the outside of the house close to the vault door, and some of them had like to have been down in the vault. I run to the fore door and let them all in, I went into the fore room of the house, and Mr. Johnson was in bed with a young child. I was told that Mrs. Johnson was run out of the cellar window, and into the hay field house. I and the last witness went to the house, and told Mr. Bell the master of the house, that there was a woman run up who had received stolen goods. Then Mr. Bell said he would go up with us, we went up 3 pair of stairs and found her; she was going to shove us out of the room, but when Mr. Bell came up she came quietly out of the room.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the elder</hi>). I live at Fox Court, Gray's Inn Lane, in the first floor front; the prisoner lives in the same house, in the first floor back. On Thursday, 6th May, about half past 5 o'clock in the morning, I went down for some water; I was dressed—as I returned up stairs, the prisoner was standing on the landing, by my door—when I came on to the landing, he rushed at me, and I received a wound on my neck—I saw nothing in his hand—he said, "There, you b—, take that"—I was cut, and it bled—it was inflicted with some sharp instrument—I had not said anything to him—I went down stairs as fast as I could, to make an alarm—I ran into the court and saw a policeman—I heard the prisoner follow me a few stairs down, but</p>

On 6th May, about half past 6 o'clock in the morning, I was in Gray's Inn Lane, and heard cries from Fox Court—I went there, and saw Perry, the elder, bleeding from the neck—in consequence of what he said to me, I went up stairs, to the back room, first floor, and found it fast, the prisoner was in the room—I asked him to open the door, he said that he would, but did not—I broke it open and got into the room, and then he said, "I did do it; it is a man who has been living with a woman who honestly bore a child by me"—I asked him where the knife was; he said, "I threw it behind the bed"—I told another constable who was with me to look behind the bed, and he found it there, but I came away with the prisoner and took him to the station, he was sober; I did not see the knife in his presence.</p>

I was in Fox Court, and saw Perry coming to the door of No. 1, calling out "Murder" and "Police"—his neck was cut, and was bleeding very much—I went up stairs with Jones to the back room, first floor, and found it fastened—I tried it, and could not open it—I assisted Jones in breaking it open, and when I got in I saw the prisoner there—I took Perry to the hospital, and then returned, searched the room, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) behind the bed—I observed nothing on it—Jones went into the room first, and I was not so near as he was, and did not dis<lb></lb>tinctly catch the words the prisoner said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior house surgeon to the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road. On 6th May, about 6 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, the elder Perry was brought there—he had a large incised wound, about seven inches in length, extending along the base of the lower jaw, and going as far as the back of the neck—it divided some important vessels—it was apparently a cut—he had lost a considerable amount of blood, and was in a state approaching collapse—I attended to the wound, and he remained in the hospital till yesterday morning—the wound is not yet quite healed—it was a very dangerous wound, and might have been inflicted with a knife of this kind—it would take considerable force to inflict it, as the knife is blunt, but if the knife was sharp it would not require much force—it was a jagged wound, and a portion of it was lacerated.</p>

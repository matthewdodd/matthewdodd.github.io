             thus depos'd. On Sunday Night betwixt Eleven and Twelve, as I was driving the Bister Waggon for London, in Company with other Waggons, the Prisoner Pass'd me several times on this side of Southwell. He was in a red Rug-Coat and a laced Hat, and rode upon a Grey Horse. I could see his Face plainly, for it was a very light Night, He stop'd his Horse, look'd hard at me, and asked where Mr. King was. I told him in the Waggon, for Mr. King was the <rs id="t17261012-38-viclabel162" type="occupation">Waggoner</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17261012-38-victim245 t17261012-38-viclabel162"></join>, and had desired me to ride his Horse while he went in to Sleep. - Then the Prisoner went off, and in a little while he came riding up again full speed, and swore he'd Shoot me, if I did not stop the Waggon, and order'd Mr. King to come out and stand by the Horses. Then he went to the tail of the Waggon, and call'd for a Knife to cut the Ropes. I told him I had got no Knife, but if he'd have a little Patience, I'd untye 'em. He swore he was in haste and could not stay so long, and so he gave me his own Knife, and ordered me to cut 'em. He told us the road was beset with Highwaymen. Some Women and Children that were in the Waggon got out. He ordered several Hampers to be taken down. I told him I Wondered what he wanted, for I knew of nothing in the Waggon of any great Value. He swore he wanted Money, and would have it before he went, or else all the Hampers in the Waggon should be shot into the Road. At last he took a brown paper Parcel out of a Hamper, but what was in that Parcel I cannot tell; but it seem'd to be pretty heavy for the bigness. He attended us near two Hours in all. I did not take him for a Highway-man at first, but only for some Maggotty London Gentleman, that was got upon a drunken Frolick. On the Tuesday following I apprehended him at the Black-Boy and Unicorn at West-Wickham. I had described him so exactly to my Landlady, that he coming there, she suspected him to be the Man, and sent for me. I first went to look on his Horse, which I knew by several Spots on his Head. Then I went into the Kitchen where the Prisoner was drinking with - Barret, a Banbury Waggoner. The Prisoner said he wanted to speak with Mr. Watts about a Marble-Table. I took no Notice that I knew the Prisoner but said I'd go see for Mr. Watts. I told Mr. Watts that the Prisoner was the Man that rob'd the Waggon. He at first was in a great Passion at what I said, and told me that Mr. Drury was a Gentleman that lived in very good Credit at Wendover; but when I insisted upon it, he went to the Inn, and kept him in Discourse while I fetched a Constable. We found a Pistol upon him, about 7 l. in Money, and some Bank Bills, and a Receipt, which made up near the Money that was lost.</p>

             thus depos'd. Having occasion to send some Money to London, I put up 15 Moidores and 250 Guineas, in a Linnen Bag, which with an old Fan, I Wrapt in a dirty Gown and Petticoat, belonging to Mr. Bats; I cover'd these with two or three Sheets of Brown Paper, which I ty'd with Pack-thread, and put into in to a small Hamper, directed for my self, and delivered it to the Bister Waggoner. This Gown and Petticoat, Fan and brown Paper, I found at Mr. Lowes at Wattleton, where it was left by the Prisoners Order.</p>

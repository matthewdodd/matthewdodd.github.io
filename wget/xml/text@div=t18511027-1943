                  </hi>. I am clerk to the vestry-clerk of St. Luke's parish. On 2nd Sept. the prisoner was an inmate of St. Luke's workhouse, and I was instructed to take his examination with a view to apply for an order for his removal—I first made this copy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I took down from his mouth and then read over to him, and he signed it in my presence—I then had another copy made of it which I read over to him, and he signed that—I did not go with him myself to swear it before the Magistrate—this copy has remained in my possession ever since (<hi rend="italic">the examination being read, was headed,</hi> "The examination of Joseph Palmer, taken upon oath;" <hi rend="italic">and con<lb></lb>tained the following statement</hi>:—"I am twenty-five years old—I was lawfully married to my present wife, Ann, at St. Thomas Charterhouse, Goswell-street, about two years since—I have lawful issue of such marriage, one child")—some time after Marylebone parish had been served with the notice,</p>

               <p>I received information which led me to ask him whether it was true that he had been married—he said it did not matter whether he was or not—I told him it mattered a great deal, and that it had got us into litigation with another parish—he then said, "Well, I am not married."</p>

I received this paper from Mr. All berry, and in consequence of his directions I took it and the defendant to the Worship-street police-court—Mr. D'Eyncourt, the Magistrate, was sitting, and the prisoner was sworn to this paper—he had previously signed it—I showed him his signature, and asked him whether that was his handwriting—he said yes—I asked him whether the examination had been read over to him—he said it had—I asked him whether the contents of the examination were true, and he said yes—I saw the Magistrate sign the examination, and I left it with the clerk of the Court.</p>

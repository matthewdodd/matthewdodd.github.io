On Thursday night the 20th of February, I was at home, nobody else was in the house; I was sitting in the warehouse, and heard the house bell ring; it rang a second time; I did not go to the door; I then heard the lock of the door being tried; I went to the room above with a brace of pistols, I looked into the court, and saw two or three men come up at a time; this continued for about two hours, till about half<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090059"></xptr>past ten o'clock; there was a light in the court, and I could always observe them making to the door, but could not distinguish any particular person. Next night I went with my brother and two other friends into a house, the ack windows of which look on to my door; we placed ourselves at the back window of this house. and observed two persons go up at a time; five separate times, they rang the bell and knocked as before, and looked up at the house to see if any lights were moving. I kept my station till half past ten o'clock; there was nobody in the house to answer the bell; I saw a number of persons watching about. On the Saturday night I took the same station, to watch with two friends, and saw them come up in the same way; ring and knock, and about half past ten o'clock, two men came up with a ladder, placed it at the window, and one mounted half way up; then a boy came down the court which disturbed them; he came down the ladder, and they carried it away; two more returned in about ten minutes with the ladder, and placed it against the house, one of them went up, and lifted the window up and got in, and the other carried the ladder away; I kept my post, and in about five minutes a party of five arrived with the ladder, pitched it at the window; two of them, mounted it, when one of the gentlemen who were on the watch gave an alarm, and I went to the passage leading to the court to prevent their escape, and met two men coming out, I presented a pistol to one and my friend did the same to the other which stopped them, and in a few minutes some persons rushed in, and pushed us out of the court into the street, and on turning my arm, my pistol fired and the man got away; I was thrown down; we chased the party and came up with the prisoner; my brother took him; I came up within fifteen seconds, and found him in custody. I went into the house and missed three amethists set in gold, and some more work which was in progress; I went to the watch-house with the prisoner, he asked if I would swear he was in the house. I said No, for I have every reason to believe he was not, for I consider him one of the party who did not enter.</p>

            . I am the last witness's brother, and joint owner of the house. On Saturday the 22d of February, I went to watch the house, and saw a man knock at the door twice; I think he also rang; a man came and stood and looked up the court at him and went away; after that I saw two men come up the passage, take a ladder from under it and place it against our window; a man went half way up it, a boy came running up the court; the man directly dropped from the ladder, placed it where they took it from and went off. In half an hour a man came up the court, looked up at the house and went away; two men came up, (apparently the same) and one got into the house with the ladder, the other put it back in its place, and after that five men came with the ladder again, three of them got on it; a signal was given for us to run out, they observed this and immediately began to descend, and at that moment, I went down to the street door, and through the court, and found a stoppage in the passage of some persons; my brother's pistol went off; one of them crossed the street, and ran towards Jewin-street, on the other side of the hackney coaches; I followed on the other side, and at the end of Jewin-street, a person caught hold of the prisoner by his coat; he was running and was with the others in the court; I saw him cross the street; the tail of his coat came off. I had not lost sight of him till then; I first saw him at the end of the court, with the party I am certain; it was not possible for any other persons to come into the court, so that he must be one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation did you first see him - A. Among the others with the ladder; whether he was on it, or at the foot, I cannot say, but I am sure he is one of them; when he was caught his coat skirt gave way; I followed immediately, and caught him by the back of his coat and neckcloth, and took him without losing sight of him and have not the least doubt of his being one of the persons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said at Guildhall you could not swear whether I was inside the court or not - A. My memory will not serve me to say what I said there. I will not swear that I did not say so; but I should think I did not say so. I said I saw him on the steps of the court, which are at the end of the court, quite away from our door. I had not seen him in the court, but on the steps at the end of the passage; but before that I saw him at the foot of the ladder. I saw him near my brother, on the step at the end of the passage - he appeared in contact with my brother, forcing himself from him. The man who got into the house made his escape through a trapdoor on the roof.</p>

            . I live at Aylesbury. On the night of the 22d of February, I was passing the end of this passage, and heard a cry for assistance. I immediately ran across the street, and saw the prisoner, and several others, endeavouring to rush out of the passage. A gentleman, dressed in a white coat, was keeping them in the passage. I immediately rushed into the passage, and endeavoured to secure the prisoner - at the same time a pistol went off, and they all made a rush together. I slipped down the step, and left my hold of the prisoner - he ran towards Jewin-street. I followed, and saw him taken, and taken to the watch-house. I did not see him lose his coat tail. I had an opportunity of seeing him in the court, and kept my eye on him till he was taken. I did not lose sight of him when I fell - he is the man.</p>

On the 22d of February, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, I was going by; as I passed the entrance of this passage, I saw a man rush from the entrance, and run across the street - I am sure the prisoner is the man; I never lost sight of him, but pursued him across the street some distance; and when about two yards from him, I saw him throw away a small parcel. I immediately seized him by the skirt of his coat, which gave way, and I have it here. I do not know what became of the parcel.</p>

            . I had the prisoner in custody, on the 22d of February. His coat was without a skirt. I have it, it matches with the skirt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to see my aunt, who was very bad; and as I came along, I saw a few people in the court, ran up, and a pistol was fired directly; a person tried to catch hold of me; I happened to run, they tore my coat, knocked my hat off, and accused me of this robbery.</p>

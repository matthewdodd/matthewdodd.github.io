            (To Hall.) Do you remember what it was that was upon the seal of your watch? - A. No; I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was it? - A. I believe it is red; there is a head, or something of that sort, upon it.</p>
               <p>Backrow. My Lord, this seal is red, and has a head upon it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 1st of March, I was going to work, and a young man asked me to go with him to sell the watch, I did not know it was a stolen watch; I went to seek to sell it, and he went with me; I offered it to a cloaths-man in the open street; if I had known it was stole, I should not have offered it in the open street for sale.</p>

I found some tiles missing from off a shed, where I keep my hay, joining to my dwelling-house. I ordered my ostler up, he came down and said there was a considerable quantity of lead gone, I went up and found it so; on the Wednesday following, the 30th, I went up into the gutter about half an hour after 7 o'clock in the morning and missed more. Then I went to my butcher in St. John's-street, he and I went into Charterhouse-lane, and peeping through a hole in a door, in an old house that comes to the back of my yard, but 2 or 3 houses distance, I saw the 2 prisoners putting some lead into a cloth or sack; they went out with each some. I watched them down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040027"></xptr> the lane ; her's was in her apron, and his on his head; they went through the sheep-pens in Smithfield, down Cow-lane. I went and got a constable; we took them coming down a lane by the New market. Lowe confessed he stole it from me, Butcher said he was to give her a breakfast for carrying it with him; they were taken before Alderman Whitaker, before whom Lowe owned he stole the lead from my shed, and the woman received it through a hole : I have taken dimensions of the width of the gutter, and it fits exactly. Lowe said he sold as much before, as came to 7 s. [The lead produced in court and deposed to.]</p>

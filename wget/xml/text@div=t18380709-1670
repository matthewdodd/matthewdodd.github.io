                  </hi>. I am a discharged soldier of the 45th regiment. I was in a tap-room of a public-house at Finchley, on the 29th of June—the prisoner came in after I was there—I fell asleep—I had a purse—I do not know what was in it, but I think from 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I awoke it was gone—this is my purse—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—and the one I missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at this public-house—I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner there—the prosecutor fell asleep—after that I saw the prisoner unbuckle his knapsack, and put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and then put it into his own pocket—I could not tell what was in his hand—the prisoner then said, "Good day, I must go, and thank you for me"—they had been treating him, I believe—he then went away—the prosecutor was then awoke up, and said he had lost his purse and money.</p>

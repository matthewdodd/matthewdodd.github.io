               <p>that I saw this prisoner; he had a female with him, and he was charging her with robbing him—I was standing at the bottom of this court, and I said to him, "Never mind about what you have lost, I have lost more"—we got into conversation—he was lighting his pipe, and I asked him for a light for my pipe, and he gave me one—there were two or three more in company with him; two of them got behind me, and they garrotted me—the prisoner came in front of me—there was only him in front that I can identify—I don't think there was any other in front of me, there were two behind me—they got their thumbs in my neck, and throttled me, and they took from me the chain and the money that I had left—I can't say which man it was who took it out of my pocket—there was light enough to enable me to see that the prisoner was one of the men; I am certain of it—I had been drinking a little, but very little—I knew what I was about.</p>

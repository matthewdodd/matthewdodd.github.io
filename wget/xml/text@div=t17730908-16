            . I live with Mrs. Smith, a silver-smith, the side of the Fleet Market, three doors on this side of Holborn Bridge; I have a piece of chain (producing it) Mrs. Smith bought it of the prisoner; I was present when it was bought.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was that man?</p>
               <p>Grove. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she buy it?</p>
               <p>Grove. On a Saturday afternoon, about six or seven weeks ago?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was robbed on Friday; I have compared the pieces of chain; and they matched one another.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see this young man before?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Whether there are not many chains of the same pattern?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes: but there is an urn in the division of the chain.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but called twelve witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

            ' house. On the 24th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I went out with Mrs. Gillings, who is now lying-in. We left nobody in the house; the window shutters and the back door were bolted; I stood at the front door when she locked it; she left every thing secure, and took the key with her; we returned about twelve o'clock at night, and found the door shut to; it is a spring lock; we opened it with the key, and found a bundle tied up in a blanket in the front parlour, ready to be removed. I sat up all night in the room where the bundle was, and am certain the same bundle was taken to the office; it appeared to contain a bed. I had left some green baize up stairs when I went out; I left one piece on a hamper, and the other on the bed. I went up stairs at night, and found the bed and baize, and quilt and blanket gone. I live with Mrs. Gillings; she has left her husband. A piece of cheese was also gone, weighing 4 lbs. The bed was on the mattrass in the morning when I saw it. They were all tied up in the blanket in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Mrs. Gillings lives with you - A. Yes; Mr. Gillings does not live in the house; he gave his wife the house; it is his property; we pay no rent for it. The bed is his wife's. He does not visit her, nor ever comes to the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long is it since he lived with his wife - A. Not since September; he never lived in this house himself at any time; he pays the taxes; I have lived there six months with his wife.</p>

            . I am a master carman. On the 24th of April, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was going home - it was moon-light. I went into Elizabeth-place, and met the two prisoners and another man. knew Wilford before. I was forty or fifty yards from the house. Wilford had the bed in a bundle on his back, and Nibbs had a small bundle; I could not see that the third person had any thing. They said</p>
               <p>"Hollo, old chap, how are you?" I said,</p>
               <p>"How are you?" I looked at them, and thought it was not right. I knocked at the door of the next house to Gillings's, and asked if they had been robbed; they said No. I looked at Gillings's door, and saw it three parts open; I knocked at next door again, and alarmed them, and went after the prisoners. I met Mullins, who directed us which way they had ran; I ran, and caught the prisoners in a place called the Five Chimnies, and pulled the bundles off each of their backs; I said,</p>
               <p>"You bl - thieves, you have stolen these." Wilford immediately knocked me down with a stick; I jumped up at him; he knocked me down again; I got up again, and he knocked me down a third time. I hallowed out, and they ran off; I pursued; they were both stopped in Regent-street, without my losing sight of them, and taken to the Ship, public-house, Vauxhall-road. The third man escaped. The bundles remained where I had pulled them off their backs. I went back, and carried one bundle back to the house, and Smith carried the other; we put them down in the front parlour. I left the next door neighbour in possession of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had they both a bundle - Yes; I kept them in sight all the way; I was not above twenty yards behind them; it was not above half-past nine o'clock.</p>

The other prisoner was brought in about the same time; I proposed to search them; somebody said I had no authority; I said I was an officer. Nibbs immediately dropped three skeleton keys: one of them fell on the floor, and I caught two as they fell; they are different sizes; Wilford also dropped the key of a clock.</p>

            . I live in Regent-street, Vauxhall-road. On the 24th of April, at twenty minutes past nine o'clock at night, I was at supper, and heard a shuffling noise coming along the street; there was a cry of Thief! I ran out, and saw Wilford running on the opposite side of the way, and Nibbs running on my side, in the gutter. He halloed out,</p>
               <p>"There he goes! Stop thief!" It struck me that he was one of them. I ran down the steps, overtook, and collared him. He said,</p>
               <p>"I am not the man; why do you detain me?" Bowen, who was behind, came up, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is one that I stopped with a bundle on their heads in Five Chimnies-passage; and there goes the other who knocked me down three times." I said,</p>
               <p>"Go after him." He did so, and I detained Nibbs till Wilford was brought back. Both were taken to the Ship Nibbs wanted to get his hand into his left trowsers pocket but I held his arm; he said he wanted to pull out his handkerchief. Nibbs said he was not the man.

            . I am an officer. I went to the Ship about ten o'clock, and found the prisoners in custody. After we had taken them to the watch-house, I pulled a handkerchief off Nibbs' neck, which has the marks taken out of it. I went to Wilford's lodging with the key which he said belonged to his door or box; it opened the padlock on the door. I searched the room, and found two regular skeleton keys and some other keys, which have been filed; I found five fine files there. I have known him many years, and know he has lived there for the last two years. Some of the keys were on his work bench. I stripped and went up the chimney, and found a surgeon's instrument case, containing two lancets and a probe. I was at the office next morning when the bundles were produced, and have had them ever since; Bowen brought them to the office; I found a piece of cheese in one of them.</p>

               <p>GEORGE GILLINGS. The house No. 8, Elizabeth-place, is my leasehold property. I pay the ground rent and taxes - I built it last spring, but never lived in it. I let it for a quarter to another person. My wife wished to leave me - I told her she should have that house to live in, and the goods also - the furniture in it is mine; it was moved from Garden-street, where I live; she left me in September - I allowed her to take what furniture she liked - I knew she was going to live there with this man, because she had encouraged him in the house where I lived. I never had any conversation with him about the house. I told my wife if she chose to leave me, she might have the house to live in, and the things for her use; that is all. I have paid no taxes, but I have got a bill for them, which I must pay. I have two more houses adjoining this. I did not take a list of what furniture she took, but I know what I gave her - I had no concern with Websdale. I gave the house to my wife to live in. I know the bed, bolster, and two pillows to be mine, by the pattern; I had had them about three years, and gave them to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You gave them for her use - A. Yes; I did not know at that time that Websdale was to live with her, but suspected it; we had no intention of coming together again.</p>
               <p>Q. You never intended to claim her or the furniture again - A. I can't tell what may happen sometime or other. I never put any servants in the house. I have not attempted to separate her from this man; I ask him how he is when I meet him. I never intended to occupy the house myself; I never drank tea with Websdale there.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not intend to claim the furniture again - A. I do not know what I might do if it pleased God to take her. Taxes have been demanded, but I was not at home, so I did not pay them.</p>

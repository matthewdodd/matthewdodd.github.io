            . I am a conductor of the dismounted patrol of Bow-street; my beat is from the Angel Inn at Islington to Hornsey-gate. On Thursday, the 27th of May, about ten minutes before two o'clock in the night, just as I entered Cambden-passage, Islington-green, I saw one of the prisoners about two hundred or two hundred and fifty yards off; I cannot say which of them it was - he was standing under a gas-lamp. Newman was with me. As soon as he saw us he ran down a middle court; we made haste up to this court, as it is not a thoroughfare - we went down the court, but saw nobody. I saw all the three prisoners coming out of Mrs. Marratt's garden door, which opens into the court; it was quite dark; the front of the house is in Pierpont-row, and the court runs down by the side of it - the garden is behind the house; there are two bolts and a latch on the garden door, inside. They came through the door, and shut it (it was dark.) I said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, who is here" - Thompson answered,</p>
               <p>"I have only been down here to ease myself;" he had his waistcoat unbuttoned, and was buttoning it up. I knew his voice, and said to my brother officer,</p>
               <p>"Lay hold of him;" we instantly apprehended all three of them, and took them to Islington watch-house - I searched Johnson and Davis, but found nothing particular. I left Newman with them while I went out, and just on the curb stone of the pavement, about twelve yards from the watch-house door I picked up a chisel and a watch, in the exact direction we had brought them. I went on till I came to the court, got a watchman's lantern, and looked down by the garden gate, and found a small crow-bar. I returned to the watch-house, locked the prisoners up, and noticed that Johnson's shoes were loosely tied, as if they had been recently put on. I went to Mrs. Marratt's house, and found the back parlour window open as high as the sash would go; it looks into the garden; and at day-light, about three o'clock, I alarmed the people of the house. I went into the garden, and found a dark lantern, part of a phosphorus box, and a bundle of matches under the window, all scattered about. We were let into the house by the boy, and found a pane of glass broken in the parlour window, and the catch undone; a time-piece stand stood on a chair in the window. I found the door at the bottom of the stairs leading into the garden nearly open, except the bottom bolt, which was not quite undone, and just by the garden gate were several footmarks on the fresh mould. I went to the watch-house, and took a shoe off each of the prisoner's feet; I tried them to the various footmarks, and each shoe fitted one mark or other. I have no doubt but the marks were made by those shoes. The parlour window had been opened by breaking the glass over the catch, and then an arm could he put through to undo it. I found a bell under the window in the garden, and a handkerchief, which has not been claimed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What distance were you at first from the premises - A. About one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards. The prisoners were taken almost instantly; the shoemarks were of different sizes. Johnson's was rather larger than the other two. I tried the shoes to the marks about an hour and a half after - it was dark when I went back after they were taken. I have seen them all before, and knew Thompson.</p>

            . I am a dismounted patrol, and was with Norris, and accompanied him into the court about ten minutes to two o'clock on Friday morning, and saw one of the prisoners; he said he went there to ease himself; the other two prisoners came out of the back gate of the garden, and were secured; they all three came out of the gate - we took all three. I remained with them in the watch-house while Norris returned. I afterwards went with him (when the family were alarmed,) and saw the footsteps compared with the prisoners' shoes; different footmarks corresponded with each shoe. I took their shoes off myself. I firmly believe that they were produced by those shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You found nothing on them - A. Except money; one of them had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030008"></xptr>12 s. 6 d. Their shoes were nearly new, so that they left a better impression.</p>

            . I live in Pierpont-row, with my mother, who keeps a chandler-shop. The house is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington; my father's name is William; he does not live at home, but is alive. On the morning of the 28th of May, about half-past three o'clock we were alarmed by the boy. I was the last person up the night before, and fastened the back parlour window myself about half-past eleven o'clock; I fastened the catch, and put the bell on it. The garden gate was bolted top and bottom - I saw it safe at ten o'clock, and the back door was locked and bolted at the bottom. In the morning I found the hack parlour window open, and glass broken by the catch, which was whole the night before. I missed my watch which I had left on the parlour mantlepiece the night before, when I went to bed, fixed in the time-piece stand, which was found on a chair under the window in the morning. The bell produced is what I fastened to the window the night before; the watch is mine (examining it;) I have had it six or seven years; it is a metal one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you go to bed at night - A. At twelve o'clock; my mother occupies she whole house, and is married to my father. I saw the footmarks in the garden, they were not confused. No strangers were in the garden except the officers.</p>
               <p>DAVIS'S Defence. I had been to see a friend, and stopped with him till between twelve and one o'clock, and as I returned I went down this court for a necessary purpose, was coming back and saw two officers with these two men in custody - the officer said,</p>
               <p>"Catch hold of that young man," and he caught hold of me.</p>
               <p>THOMPSON'S Defence. I went to the playhouse, and then accompanied a friend home - I left him in the Lower-road about half-past one o'clock, and on returning, at the end of this court met the officers, and told them I had been down to case myself.</p>
               <p>JOHNSON'S Defence. I had been to my cousin's on Stamford-hill, was making my way to Westminster rather intoxicated, and went down this court, and finding it was not a thoroughfare I came back.</p>

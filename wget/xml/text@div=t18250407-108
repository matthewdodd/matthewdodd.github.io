On the 26th of February, between four and five o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, on the haberdashery side; she asked for some white ribbon; I took the drawer out and put it before her; a young man came up and asked me a question, which took my attention off the prisoner; I then saw her take her hand from the drawer; she asked me the price of some other ribbon, and bought a yard and a half of it; I then got over the counter and accused her of having taken the ribbon - she said she had not; I took her to the back part of the shop to Mr. Hopkins; he asked her for it, and she took this ribbon from her pocket.</p>

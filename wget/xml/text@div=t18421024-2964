                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Smith—the prisoner was in our service about nine months—she left about five weeks ago—before the went I missed one yard of brown and one yard of black merino from my parlour—they belonged to Emily Tice, who was living at my house—about three weeks after, I saw the policeman take the brown merino from the prisoner—she was wearing it as an apron—she was wearing the black when she was in my service—they were both torn off from the pieces—I compared them together, and they are similar—this brown I know very well—the black has not been found.</p>

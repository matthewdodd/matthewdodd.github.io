             nursed my child for three days and a half; on this day fortnight she went out in the afternoon, and in about half an hour afterwards Elizabeth Robinson brought my child home; she went away and returned in about half an hour, and brought me a pair of ear-rings; she asked me if I would keep them for about half an hour; I told her I would not; she said they were her's, she could not keep them in her ears; she put them on my child's frock and went away; she came the next morning for the ear-rings; I asked her what she wanted with them; she said she wanted to pawn them; I told her I dare say they were not her's, and she should not have them. My husband fetched Harper, the officer, and gave charge of her. She is about fifteen, I believe.</p>

On the 16th of April I saw the prisoner on the top of Mr. Hatton's chambers - I went up, and saw him cutting some lead from the roof; I asked him what he was doing, and he said, "Going to repair some chambers for Mr. Whiten;" I said he was thieving, and asked him who employed him - he said some person at No. 14, Chancery-lane; I then went and found two pieces of lead cut off, besides the one he had in his hand; he had a knife in his hand, which I took from him; the two pieces of lead were laying on the adjoining roof: I saw them applied to the roof, and they appeared to fit exactly. He said he came up No. 9 stair-case; I went to see if it was so, and found that stair-case open. We went to No. 14, Chancery-lane, and found he did not live there - he then said he had made a mistake, it was No. 14, Shoe-lane.</p>

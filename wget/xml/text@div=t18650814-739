I am appointed by the Mint to look after coiners—on Friday afternoon, 14th July, about 4 o'clock, I went to the King's Arms public-house, in the Coal-yard, Drury-lane—Inspectors West, Potter, and Brannan, and Sergeant Ackrill and other officers, were with me—I sent Ackrill in twenty minutes before I went myself—I went in at the street-door, into the bar—I asked a female there where Rowe was—she called him—I heard his voice and I went up stairs into a room on the first floor, and saw the prisoners there standing at a rat pit—there was also a man in the</p>

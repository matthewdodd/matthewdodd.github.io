                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 342). I was on duty at Ponder's End, on 15th Dec, a little after 9 o'clock at night—I saw the prisoner in company with another man and a woman—I watched them; they crossed the road—the prisoner went down by the side of the Two Brewers, the other two went into the Two Brewers—the prisoner returned in about a minute, and he also entered the Two Brewers—I then spoke to the landlord, and asked him to get a light—I went with him to the place where I had seen the prisoner go by the side of the house—there is a shed there, a lean-to, and on the tiles of that I found a bag—I felt it—there was something like coin in it—I let it remain where it was, and I watched about an boor, and at a little before 11 the prisoner came to the place, and reached on the tiles, and walked away—I went to the place and the bag was gone—no one else bad been there—I then followed the prisoner nearly a quarter of a mile, I took him by the arm, and asked him what he had got in his pocket—he said, "What is that to you?"—is he broke from me—I took him again—he broke from me again, and strict me several times—I saw him put his hand in his right-hand pocket—he then struck me several times, and in doing so he threw something over my left shoulder, as if he was going to strike me again—I heard it fall, it sounded as if something fell heavily, but there was no Jink—I called on Davis to assist me—I took the prisoner, he was quite calm then, and I took him to the White Hart—after getting a light, I west back to the spot where this struggle took place—I there found this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can swear this is the bag I saw on the top of the tiles—I opened it in the presence of Mr. Bennett, and found in it thirty-seven counterfeit shillings, all wrapped up in separate papers—I found on the prisoner two good shillings, two duplicates, and four silk handkerchiefs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Two Brewers. I remember some persons coming to my house on the night of 15th Dec.—Hayes spoke to me—I got a light, and went by the north side of my house—there is a little lean to building there—I saw just such a bag as this on the tiles, I did not take it up—I left the policeman there to watch—after that I heard one of the persons in my house say, "Let us go," or "Be off"—I saw the prisoner go to the place where the bag was—he returned immediately, and went down the road with the other man and woman—the other man had been out of my house once or twice; but eventually they all went away together—after the three persons had gone I saw the policeman go to the tiles to look for the bag, and it was gone—that was almost directly after I had seen the prisoner go up there—I and the policeman then went towards Enfield High<lb></lb>way after the prisoner—the White Hart is on the way—we did not stop there—I saw the policeman go on, and soon after he returned with the prisoner and the woman—we had passed Adey on the way, and stopped him, and partly searched him—I said, "That is not the one that took the bag"—we left him and ran on—that was before we got to the White Hart—when we got to the White Hart I was outside waiting, and Adey came up and went in there—the policeman then brought back the prisoner and the woman—he gave them into our custody, took a light, went out, and in four or five minutes he came back with this bag—I saw it opened, and the bad money in it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you always been quite so certain that those persons all went down the road together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we afterwards overtook Adey about 300 yards from our house—they all went out together, bat Adey was behind the others—the policeman began to search Adey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Wilson, a market-gardener.

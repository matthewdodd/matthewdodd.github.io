                  </hi>. On the 9th of November, I was master of the June a collier—she was lying in Bugsby's-hole, which is below Blackwall—about a quarter to six o'clock in the evening I was returning to the vessel—the vessel was at anchor—George Guthrie and William Willans were in the boat with me—they were rowing, and I was steering with the rudder—the boat was between fifteen and sixteen feel long—It was a very fine night—neither light nor dark—when we were near Blackwall-reach, I saw a large steamer nearly abreast of the reach—she was coming down behind us, about three times our length from us—our boat was nearly in the mid-stream—It was a Scotch boat I am speaking of—after getting clear of the Scotch boat, I pulled my boat directly into the north shore—we were ten or twelve yards from the north shore, not more—I saw the Monarch at the upper part of Blackwall-rach—she was coming up, and about three times her own length from us when I first saw her—she was near the north shore—she approached towards our ves sek—she then went nearer into the north shore—when she was about twice her length from us, or a little more,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183511230151"></xptr>
               <p>she was coming direct on us—I stood up and shouted as well as I could, "Ahoy, starboard your helm"—she would have gone to the south if she had done so, and have been clear of us—I could see on to the deck of the vessel, when I stood up, but could not make any body out—I did not see any persons—Guthrie laid his oar in and stood up, and we both shouted—he kept shouting out in the same way as me—she struck our boat, and nearly cut her in two, and the boy Williams went down underneath the steamer, on the starboard side, and I went down under her bottom on the larboard side—I came up just under the steam-boat's larboard quarter—a waterman's boat was towing astern of the steamer, and the waterman reached a hook, and hooked me by the nose—I got hold of the hook with my hands, and was got out of the water—I was immediately taken on board the steamer—I saw the prisoner there, who I believe to be the captain—he was aft assisting me on board, when I got up out of the waterman's boat—when I went on board—he said he was sorry for the accident, and that he heard and saw nothing till he heard the crash of the boat—he gave me his card, and put a piece of sticking plaister on my face, which was bleeding—our boat came up bottom upwards, close by the steamer—I believe every endeavour was made to save Williams, but I was in such a state myself I could hardly see—his body was found next morning—I saw it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long time passed between your seeing the Scotch ship and the <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think about ten minutes—the <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi> is a towing steamer; what is called tub, of twenty-five tons—they take very large ships up the rive, at times—It was after six o'clock, when I saw the <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi>—there was a light at her mast-head—I do not know a place called Saunders-ness, in the Isle of Dogs—I know Bugshy's-hole—I have been accustomed to the river nearly thirty years—I know the point you mean, but do not know Saunders-ness by name—the tide was on the ebb, from Greenwich Hospital towards Saunders-ness—I should think it was to hours after ebb—the current was running very strong at the time—I was on the northern shore, and I thought to keep out of the way of damage from the craft—we were going down with the tide, and the <hi rend="italic">steamer</hi> coming up—vessels endeavour to keep out of the current going against them—the <hi rend="italic">steamer</hi> was above the point; perhaps, twice its length, when the accident happened—It had rounded the point, and that made her come into us—I should think the tide would be very little <hi rend="italic">slack</hi> at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> His coming on towards you was in consequence of his having rounded the point, and there was a string current at the point? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he would come to the smoothest water—(looking at a sketch) these arrows, denoting the course of the tide, are correct—I calculate that was nearly the set of the tide—It was very shallow water off the Ness-point—It became necessary for her to keep a certain way off the point, to avoid the shallow—I do not think she was ashore after the accident, but she was near it—that made me keep so close in—I considered I was safer near shore than in the current—the Scotch steamer was in the stream, and the set me in towards shore—there was plenty of time to go into the current again, but I had charge of my own boat, and calculated, that I could go where I liked with her, and went close in shore—It was a particular night, for the time of year; not what they call light, nor was it very dark—our vessel is fifteen or sis teen feet long—It was not above two feet and a half out of the water—the <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi> was about one or two feet above the top of my head, when I stood up in my boat—we had no sailing tackle on board—we had a boat-hook—It</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183511230152"></xptr>
               <p>is not usual to hook a lantern on a split head in small boats—I never saw any thing of the kind—I could see the light at the steamer's mast-head before she rounded the point—I could see it over the point—she was on the western shore then—she had not rounded the point—she was on the same side of the shore—In knew that she would be coming up on that side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What difficulty could there have been for your putting your boat's head to the stream, and drifting down the stream? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were vessels, at anchor on the other side—If I had gone athwart of them they might have hurt me—I considered I was safer in my small boat, by going along shore—I could have gone any where I chose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having seen the vessel coming round the point, and knowing it must come on the same side as you were, on turning the point, could you not easily have got into the stream, to get out of the way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I first saw her three lengths from us—she was rounding the point—there was no land between us when I first saw her—I did not see her over the point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say you saw her light at the mast-head, before she came round the point? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but it was the sand on he shore—I cannot say how many persons were examined before the Coroner on this subject—Guthrie did not go into the water at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you been in the middle of the stream when the Scotch vessel came near you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the made me go nearer shore—I do not think I was above ten yards off the shore when the <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi> struck me—It was not shallow water—we were above the point then—I was between the point and London—the accident happened after she had rounded the point—I should think there was eight or ten feet of water where she struck us—this was a steamer of twenty-five tons—a small vessel—I cannot say what water show draws—I should think it was my safest way to keep close to the shore—It was a very bright star-light night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The set of the tide is just round the point? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It sets off the point to the eastward—the river run east and west to the point, and then turns round, and goes north and south—the moment the steamer came round the shore she would meet the tide coming towards her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not that throw her head tot he eastward? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The man at the helm should avoid that.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Watt in the boat on the evening of the 9th of November, and saw the <hi rend="italic">Monarch steamer</hi> coming—she was three times her own lengthe from us when I first saw her—I could not tell how far she was from the shore when I first saw her—but our own boat was about twelve yards from the shore, and in the north shore side—the tide was running down—the steamer bad a light—she was not coming direct on our boat—she was rounding the point when we first saw her, and after she rounded the point we pulled our boat towards the north shore, to keep clear that, called out—the captain called out first—she was twice the steam boat's length off when we called out—we called loud enough for any body to have heard, who was in the bow—after we called out, she struck our boat that was only the time she might be running her own length—I took holds of a rope belonging to the steam-packet, and jumped on board of her—I found nobody in the fore-part of the vessel—the first man I saw was on the paddle-case on the larboard-side of the boat—on the Greenwich side—I suppose the boat is about fifty feet long—the paddle-case is before the midships</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183511230153"></xptr>
               <p>rather—I took the person on the paddle-case to be the engineer—he was on the check by the paddle-case—he was near about his proper place—when I went aft in the boat, I took it to be the captain of the boat I spoke to—I cannot say it was the prisoner—I found a gentleman aft, I took to be the captain, and a waterman—the waterman was standing by the tiller—he had not got hold of the tiller—the other person was standing close by the tiller—I saw Mr. Watt brought on board soon after—he spoke to the gentleman, I took to be the captain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were not in the water at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I stepped on board the steam-vessel, and got up her bow, by the help of a rope which was fixed before the bow-sprit—the waterman's name in Elliott—Hubbard was the man who picked our Captain up—I believe he is here—the windlass-bits are in the fore part of the vessel—that is the general place which they keep a look out from—It is proper for the engineer to be on deck—he has the management of the engine when he is on deck—I heard Crocksford examined before the Coroner—I do not know Avery—Williamson, an engineer, was examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman at Greenwich. On the night in question I had a tow from the Captain of the <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi>—he took me up in Bughy's-hole—she was lying still alongside a schooner at the time—that was about two miles and a half from Saunders-ness—she came up against the side, which was about two hours ebb—the current was running strong—until you come off the point of Saunders-nes the tide runs eastward, and it runs sharp off the point—I had made my boat fast to the stern of the steamer—Samuel Hubbard was with me—when I got on board the prisoner was there, and a mate, an engineer, and a boy, besides Crocksford and myself—the prisoner is the master—when the vessel started, the prisoner stationed himself on the windlass-bit to keep a look-out—I stood on the starboard side of him—Crocksford was on the larboard side of him—he was keeping a look out—there was a light at the mast-head—the captain did not leave the place once—the mate was at the helm, and the remained there till the accident happened—I cannot say where the engineer was—he ought to have been by the engine—the engine makes a great noise, more than if it was worked below, because it is all open—I heard some hailing the moment before the accident happened—It was impossible to have avoided the accident—the engine was stopped immediately—when it was stopped the people came as running aft, looking for the boat-hooks—the effect of the tide would be to drift the boat aft.</p>

                  </hi>. My father, Henry Hunsdon, is a farmer; the prisoner was in his employ. On the 8th of May, about half-past two o'clock, I was proceeding to London with a load of greens—the prisoner was with me—when we were between Ilford and the Pigeons public-house I got on the cart, and saw these beans in a sack inside another sack in which he had the victuals for his horses—these beans ought not to have been there—when we got to the Pigeons I saw the prisoner get on the load, and take this bag with the split beans in it out of the other sack—he slid them down, and took them to the trough opposite the Pigeons door— our bones were not feeding there at that time—they had their bags on—this is the beans—they are my father's property.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I took them in the sack to give my horses—I meant to put them in the nose-bags before I started off again, but they took them away. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I gave him out the feed he was to have for his horses on the overnight—he was not authorised to take these beans or any thing else for his horses—I saw him go away from his horses, who were eating from the nose-bags in the middle of the road.</p>

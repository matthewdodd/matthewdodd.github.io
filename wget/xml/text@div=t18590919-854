I am a carman of 7, Huggin-lane, Upper Thames-street—I was in the employ of Alfred Campion, of Upper Thames-street, till last Saturday—on Monday evening, 12th September, about half-past 7 o'clock, I was in Upper Thames-street, and saw the prisoner with two casks of jelly in a truck—I knew to whom they belonged, and went up and asked him what business he had with them—he said that the cooper told him to take there; he then dropped the handle of the truck on the ground, and ran away—I took it to Mr. Campion's warehouse; then got a policeman, and went into the cellar; the doors were open, and we found two casks, one laid on the other, to get out of the trap-door—the jelly-casks were kept on the next floor—the prisoner had worked at Mr. Campion's several times.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Campion, of 9, Curzon-lane—on 12th September, about a quarter past 6 in the evening, Humphreys and I left the warehouse—I fastened every door—the back basement door, leading into Dow-gate Dock, was fastened by a single wooden bar running across—there was no bolt—I have never known goods to be taken out at that door since I have been there, which is three or four months—the prisoner has been employed there, and knew the door—when I came on Tuesday morning, I found the bar lying in the cellar, and one empty hogshead piled on another, immedi<lb></lb>ately under the flat, to get into the second floor, where the jolly-casks are deposited—these two casks are worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

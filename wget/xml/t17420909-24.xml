Whether I left the Key in the Door or not I cannot say, but the Goods were missing in the Morning. I found the Things upon her Back at the House where we were drinking Gin the Night before; she owned having the Brass Candlestick, but would not say where she had pawned it.</p>

            . I live in the House with my Neighbour, these were his Wife's Cloaths, they lay upon the Back of the Chair; when he missed them, says he, Where's my Shirt? she owned the taking of the Candlestick before the Justice, but said she threw it away. Said I, she has taken your Wife's Cloaths, and you will find her at such a Place. I found the two Petticoats and the Stays, but the Gown she said she had given away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going along Bishopsgate-street, and he asked me how I did, and whether I would go and drink, which we did; and he asked me whether I would go with him to his House, which I did, for he said he was a single Man then. <rs id="t17420909-24-verdict119" type="verdictDescription">

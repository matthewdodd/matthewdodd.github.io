                  </hi>. My mother keeps a shop near Piccadilly. On 16th Nov. a person came there and asked for a biscuit—to the best of my recol<lb></lb>lection it was the prisoner—I served him—he put down a sixpence on the counter—I put it amongst the halfpence in the till—there was no other six<lb></lb>pence where I put it—my mother afterwards came and discovered it was a bad one.</p>

                  </hi>. I remember the prisoner coming for a biscuit, on 16th Nov.—I am positive he is the person—my daughter served him, and he paid her a sixpence—soon afterwards I had occasion to go to the till—I ob<lb></lb>served the sixpence with the halfpence; it was the only sixpence there—it was apart from all other silver—I found it was bad—I wrapped it in paper and put it at the back of the till—in less than an hour the prisoner came again for a biscuit and some cheese—he gave me a half-crown—I examined it and took it in my hand—I opened the till, and said, "I don't think I can give you change"—I recollected him to be the person who came in with the sixpence—I knew him when he was looking in at the window—I walked round the counter with the half-crown in. my hand, and when I got very near him 1 said, "I don't think this is good"—he said, "Yes it is; if you don't like it I will give you halfpence"—I said, "This is the second time you have been here to-night passing bad money"—he tried to leave the shop—I pre<lb></lb>vented him by holding his coat—he got out and gave a sudden jerk—the piece of his coat that I had hold of, came off, and he ran away—he was brought back in about five minutes by Wright the officer—I gave Wright the two pieces of bad money.</p>

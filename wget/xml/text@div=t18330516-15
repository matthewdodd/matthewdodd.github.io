               <p>ALFRED COPELAND. I live at the King's-head, Fenchurch-street. This happened on the 16th of April, about half-past twelve o'clock at night - I was rather tipsy - I recollect having my watch safe in Leadenhall-street going home - I was in company with two women at a public-house in Leadenhall-street, but I cannot swear to them; they walked with me from by Whitechapel-church, and from there to a public-house in Leadenhall-street, but I cannot say that I can swear to them - I never have sworn to them.</p>
               <p>Q.(Handing him his deposition). Is this your handwriting? A. I signed a paper at the Mansion-house - I think it was read over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not asked if the contents of the paper were true? A. I might have dropped the watch myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't be guilty of prevarication, or if you do the Court have a way of dealing with such persons - were you not asked if the contents of your deposition were true? A. There was so much noise at the time I could hardly hear what was read over - I was sworn to speak the truth; I don't know what the deposition contains, and cannot say I ever did; it was read over in a hurried way, but I cannot say I knew what was in it - my watch was produced at the Mansion-house the morning after I missed it - it was my watch I am sure, I picked it up and looked at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how you lost it you cannot tell? A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that positively? A. I cannot very well; the name

               <p>WILLIAM SMITH. I am watchman of Aldgate-ward. I was on my beat in Fenchurch-street on the night in question, and saw the prosecutor pass in Fenchurch-buildings, which is opposite Church-row, and saw the two prisoners - I followed them, and heard a bit of a scuffle - I heard the prosecutor say to the two prisoners, "Give me my watch" - I cannot say what they said further than that they had not got it - I saw the elder prisoner pass her hand behind her, and as it appeared to me give the youngest something, but what I could not tell; I instantly saw the youngest stoop, as if in the act of dropping something; one of my mates came up, and took hold of one of them - I stooped and picked up a paper, and in it was this watch; it was within a yard of each of the prisoners - I am sure the prosecutor addressed the two women and said, "Give me my watch" - I had not seen him come out of the public-house with them - they were taken immediately - the prosecutor appeared before the Lord Mayor the next day and the day after - I was present when he gave his evidence; I believe what he said was taken down and read over to him, but I should not like to take my oath of it - he did not express any doubt about their being the persons he had been with, and who had taken his watch.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PLAISTOWE, JUN. I produce the watch, I found it in the watch-house when I came from the Compter - Smith delivered it to me at the watch-house - I attended at the Mansion-house, and saw the prosecutor there, and heard his evidence; it was taken down, and read over to him, and he swore to it; he claimed the watch - he said at the watch-house that he had been in company with the women, but he did not wish it to go any further.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at the watch-house impute to them the stealing his watch? A. Yes.</p>

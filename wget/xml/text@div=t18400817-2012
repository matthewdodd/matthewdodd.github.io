                  </hi>. I live in Ebury-street, Pimlico; the prisoner was my servant. On the 30th of July, about a quarter after six o'clock, as I came down stairs, she met me, and asked if I knew whether the parlour-window was left open all night—I said it was not, for I shut it myself, and drew the curtains—she said it was open, and a step-ladder placed against it outside—I ran down and found my goods all in confu<lb></lb>sion, and several bundles tied up ready to be taken away—I missed about twenty pairs of boots and shoes, as 1 thought then, but I could not tell from the confusion—the police came and inspected the premises, and thought somebody had got in—I at last found I had lost four pairs of boots and four pairs of shoes—these are mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I found them at a greengrocer's in the neighbourhood.</p>

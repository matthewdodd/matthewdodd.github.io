                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIMS</hi>. I have worked regularly at a printing office from September 8th, 1873, every day, it is Mr. Brettell's—I know a carver and gilder named Ward—I know <hi rend="italic">Trickey</hi>—I have known George Crabbe for the last twelve months, he has been at my place twice during that time—we had tea at 5.30, and after that we were talking together, the other young men who were there cannot come because they had to go to their work—there were five or six of us altogether—my nick name is <hi rend="italic">Coaley</hi>, because I work at a coal shop—my name is printed <hi rend="italic">Coaley</hi> as a vice-chair<lb></lb>man</p>

               <p>—I presided as vice-president at a benefit for George Ward on March 20th, the man was out of work and it was a friendly meeting—I did not know that he had been in custody—I was not a friend of his—it was a sub<lb></lb>scription—I do not know John Nicholl better known as <hi rend="italic">Bluey</hi>—I was not at a friendly "<hi rend="italic">lead</hi>" for him on Saturday March 27th—I do not know any<lb></lb>thing about this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I have been out of work my friends got me up a friendly "<hi rend="italic">lead</hi>"—I know nothing of a friendly "<hi rend="italic">lead</hi> "on March 20th, 1875, for the benefit of <hi rend="italic">Pat Willis</hi>, I do not know him—I know nothing of a "<hi rend="italic">lead</hi> "for William Harper's benefit—I do not remember a friendly meeting at the Three Tuns, Moor Street, Soho—I have never to my knowledge attended friendly "<hi rend="italic">leads</hi>" for the benefit of men who have been convicted, I did not know that <hi rend="italic">Trickey</hi> was in trouble—I knew him by working for a carver and gilder, and he asked me if I would do him a friendly aid and come up—I swear that I did not know he had been con<lb></lb>victed of felony—Reuben Green is outside, he is down on this card as the chairman, and he was summoned as a witness—he was not at my house that night and I don't think he saw George Crabbe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> All" these benefits have been for people with whom I worked or whom I knew, not for people who have been convicted—I don't associate with such persons; I have to work for my living—George Crabbe works for Mr. Welsh; he has been there eight or ten months—I have never heard any charge made against him before; I believe he has been in trouble for drunkenness, but not for felony.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Oran—I know George Crabbe—on 14th March he came to our place to tea; my husband had invited some friends; I remember the day by a little business I had—Finn came first, George Crabbe next, and the others afterwards—Crabbe remained from 5.30 to 8.30—I was sitting there the whole time—we then went to Sutton's public-house, and George Crabbe being a teetotaller had some lemonade or ginger beer, and we remained there till 10 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known him about twelve months—I remember the date because I owed a little rent, and I paid three weeks' rent the next day—I got a receipt in the rent book, but that is not here—a young man named Gorham, a polisher, was also there and two or three more—Mr. Green is outside, but he did not come into my room to tea—I saw him in the public-house—I did not go with the others to the public-house, but followed soon afterwards, when I had put on my little girl's things—Green was not in my room, he only called just as I was going out, about 8.30; my</p>

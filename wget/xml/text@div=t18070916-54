            's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he live in the house. - A. No, he lives over the way. When I got home I took out his money and mine together, from my bosom; I took a one pound note out of my six, and then I put my own purse and his pocket book upon a shelf in a cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner and your husband in that room. A. Yes. I went out for some tea and sugar; I left my husband and the prisoner in the room when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cupboard locked. - A. No, there is no door to it. I staid about three quarters of an hour; when I came back I found them both on the bed, and directly I went into the room I missed his money and mine. I said I am ruined, and run down stairs directly to my landlady; I awoke my husband and told him somebody had taken the money out of the room. The prisoner was on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him. - A. No, not then. I fetched my landlady, we searched the room, we could not find it; she made the prisoner get up out of the bed for us to search the bed; we told him the money was gone; he said I had ruined him, I had lost all his money and all his property. The prisoner walked out of the room, and never spoke another word; he seemed very unconcerned.</p>
               <p>Q. He expressed some concern, he said you had ruined him, and you had lost all his property, but however then he went out of the room. - A. Yes; in about half an hour he came back and asked for his pocket book and his money; I told him I could not give it him, somebody had robbed me of his money and mine and all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the pocket book notes, or purse afterwards. - A. No.</p>
               <p>JAMES HARVEY. I am a Chelsea pensioner. I received six one pound notes; I gave them to my wife, and the change I kept. When we got home my wife put it on a shelf, she told me; I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner's pocket book. - A. No. After I was upon the bed my wife went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lay on the bed when you did. - A Yes, he came to me and laid by me on the bed; I went to sleep while she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of her absence, did you take the purse or the pocket book from the shelf. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your wife awaking you, and telling you she had lost the pocket book. - A. I do not recollect her coming into the room, but as soon as I saw her in the room, she cast her eyes towards the shelf, and said the money was gone; the prisoner said it was a pretty job if all the money was gone, he was ruined.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 22nd of July, in the prosecutor's house. I asked him if he had any money or notes, he denied it; there was a soldier in the room that insisted that he had notes about him; he still persisted that he had not, I searched him, and found upon him three one pound notes, two seven shilling pieces, and three shillings and sixpence in silver. I produce the notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 21st of July I went to Chelsea; I received a pension of four pound six shillings and eleven pence; I put it in my pocket. I parted with Harvey, and went into a cook's shop, from that into a public house; I drank pretty freely. Going home I met Harvey and his wife very much in liquor. We went into a coach, and ordered it to drive to the Fox, Wardour-street, where I live; we stopped there, drank half a pint of gin, then they went round to Green's court; they alighted, and went up that court; several of my friends took me away; she could not walk she was conducted up the court; I went to the Fox. After that I went and asked her for my pocketbook. I gave her my pocket-book to take care off; there were twenty duplicates in it, there was no other property in it. When I asked for the pocketbook, she said she put it and her husband's money on a shelf; it was all gone; I asked her who had been in the place, she said a woman up stairs; I went home to my own place and treated a friend; I never mentioned the word money to her; I had my notes in my pocket when I was at my home. I asked a tailor to buy my boy some things that night; I pulled out my notes to change at the Fox; the landlord would not change them that night.</p>

Yes, I remember his coming to the sign of the Fox the corner of Wardour-street, Peter-street, Soho, it was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon; they came in a coach, Mr. Harvey, his wife, Bantin, and his boy and another man; they had half a pint of gin in the coach, the coachman led the horses round to Green's-court to Harvey's habitation; the prisoner at the bar did not go into the house with them, he returned with me to the Fox; I was with him there upwards of three hours.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, and live in East<lb></lb>row, Kensal, New-town. I know the prisoners—he lived a little below us, and kept a house—I do not know what business he is—I am sure he lived by himself, and not with his father—he is married—his father kept a chan<lb></lb>dler's shop—he did not assist his father—on Monday evening four weeks, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was going to get some beer for my father, and saw the prisoner and his father in his father's shop—I do not know what he was there for—there was nobody else there—the shop shutters were to, but I could see into the shop—the door was open, and I saw through the door—I was crossing the road, and saw them in high words—I heard high words from them both—I do not know what they were saying—they were speaking in a loud voice—I mean they were scuffling together—I saw the prisoner trying to get a knife from his father, and with that Mr. Richards stabbed the prisoner—the prisoner then took the knife from his father, and, said, "You have done it to me, and I will do it to you" and he then stabbed his father—I did not see where be stabbed him—the prisoner then went away—as he was going out of the shop door, the father took a candlestick from his side, and was going to hit him with it—the deceased's wife then came down, and led him into a room—I did not see how the prisoner used the knife when he stabbed his father—I saw him stab him, but I did not see where the knife went—I did not see whether it had any effect on the father—I was outside the gate—he walked, and his wife and Mrs. Hickman led him into the next room, one holding him by each arm—I knew the deceased by sight before—I saw him again on the Saturday after this—I went into the shop for something, and he served me—he seemed very well then—I did not see him again.</p>

I am the prisoner's brother—my father's name was Henry Richards—I saw him on Monday night, the 2nd of Jan., it was about half-past nine o'clock when I left him—he was then rather tipsy—I did not see the prisoner there, and saw nothing of the transaction—my father died on the 20th—I did not see him after this occurrence till the Sunday following—he ate a hearty dinner then, and drank some ale with me—he said he felt a little pain—I did not perceive much change in him—I did not see him again till the following Sunday, he was then in bed—I was not there when he died—he did not go about his business between that Sunday and his death—I did not see him out of bed between that Sunday and his death—the prisoner had previously served behind the counter for him, assisting in the business, but was not doing so at the time in question—I heard my father send in to ask him to go with some coals on the Monday—I did not see them together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called to the deceased on the 2nd of Jan.—I found a punctured wound in the upper part of the left side of the chest, made by some sharp instrument—it was about an inch and a half in length, and about four inches in depth, extending obliquely downwards and inwards, not a direct wound—I did what was necessary for him, and attended him until he died—I did not apprehend any danger at first—I heard that he went about his business, but I did not see him do so—I gave him strict direc<lb></lb>tions to keep quiet, because a punctured wound is always a dangerous wound—I saw him every day, and some times twice a day—he was always up stairs in his bed-room when I saw him—after I first saw him the wound assumed a very dangerous appearance, inasmuch as it never showed any disposition to heal—it was very insidious—there was low fever—I apprehended danger after I dressed the wound the first time, and came to examine it the second time, and saw no disposition to heal—he died on the 20th—I examined him after death—the cause of death was inflammation of the pleura, the covering of the lung, and of the pericardium, the covering of the heart, caused by the wound—I am quite sure the wound was the cause of death—by the Coroner's direction, I fitted this knife to the wound, and they exactly coincided in shape.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

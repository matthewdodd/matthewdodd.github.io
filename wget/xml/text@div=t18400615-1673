                  </hi>I am the wife of Frederick William Coe, of Riverswell Cottage, Park Village. The prisoner was our servant—I missed six pairs of stockings, and mentioned to the prisoner having missed them—the said she knew nothing of them—I went to Gravesend, leaving the pri<lb></lb>soner in town—when I got there I found my box was not in the same state as when I packed it up—I came to town on the 30th of May, sent for a police<lb></lb>man, and asked the prisoner if she would object to have her box searched<lb></lb>she said she had no objection—I was present when the policeman searched it, and found a towel and a black satin reticule—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they belong to me—the box was locked—I bad never given her these things—she said nothing when they were found.</p>

                  </hi>I am a policeman. I searched a box at Mrs. Coe's house in the prisoner's presence, and found these things—the pri<lb></lb>soner said nothing when they were found—on the same day I went to the prisoner's mother's, in Brunswick-grove, Holloway, and found in one box a pair of stockings, and another pair in another box, with a pair of kid gloves and a child's night-gown—under the bed-clothes I found four pairs of stockings, wrapped up, I believe, in an apron.</p>

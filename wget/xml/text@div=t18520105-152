About half-past 7 o'clock in the morning of the day before Christmas-day I gave a horse to my boy, to turn out to graze—he came home about half-past 5, and in consequence of what he told me I went to look for my horse, and could not find it—on the Friday following the police-inspector showed me the horse—I told him the different marks on it before he showed it to me—I had no doubt it was mine—it is worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I turned his horse out to graze in the field next to Victoria-park about half-past 7 o'clock in the morning of the day before Christmas-day—the field opens into Victoria Park-road—I went to look for the horse at 4, and could not find it—I saw it again on the Monday—the inspector had it—I am quite sure of it by the marks—it is white on the fetlock behind—my father had had it about seven weeks, I believe—I had been in the habit of cleaning it and taking care of it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-inspector</hi>). On the morning of 24th Dec. I was on duty at the lower end of Romford-market, and saw Grant with a horse—I told him to move on, and, in consequence of something said to me, I followed him and the horse—I came up to it a second time, when both prisoners were together—Christie had hold of it—when he saw me coming, he let go of the halter at once—I was in uniform—I asked Christie where he had the horse from, and whose it was; he made me no answer—I then asked Grant where they had the horse from; he said, "We have only rode him down eleven or twelve miles"—I asked where he had him from; he said, "From Globe-lane, Mile-end"—I asked who it belonged to; they did not know—I took them both into custody, and the horse—Chambers afterwards gave me a description of the horse, which corresponded with it—he afterwards saw it—I showed it to the younger Chambers on the Monday following; they both identified it—there are a great many horses for sale every Wednesday in that market; but when I first saw Grant, he was not at that part of the market where the horses were selling, and I told him to go to the other part of the market, where they were selling.</p>

"No, it belongs to this young man, Christie"—I was going to buy it, but thought Christie did not look as if he had a horse of his own, and said to Grant, "I think you have stolen it"—he said, "You know, you know"—my looking at it caused a little obstruction, and the officer told them to move on—I asked Grant the price of it; he said, "30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I did not like to buy it, at I did not like the appearance of the <hi rend="italic">chaps.</hi>

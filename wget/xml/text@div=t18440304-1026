At half-past twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 17th of Feb., I was on duty near Mr. Hunter's Dock, at Nine Elms—I turned on my light, and saw two lads on the roof of Mr. Watson's granary, doubling up the lead—they were both dressed in fustian jackets and trowsers, as the prisoner appears now—I sprung my rattle—they crawled over the roof, and went into Mr. Watson's inclosed premises—I went round the road, sprung my rattle again, and got assistance—I went to Mr. Thornton's Wharf—the prisoner was brought to me in custody in about ten minutes by Hopkines—I searched the dock, and went to the spot where I had seen the two lads—I found a piece of lead on the top, partly cut off—I cut that off, and it exactly matches with a pieces my brother officer had taken before—I not form any notion of the prisoner's face at that distance, but his dress and size corresponded.</p>

"Do you know what it was?"—I looked at him and saw he had no shoes or stockings on—I said, "It strikes me you are one of the party, I shall detsin you"—I went to lay hole of him—we scuffled. and he got away—he ran down right into the water, and got out of my sight—I called "Stop thief," and he was taken—he is the same man.</p>

I told her I was going home to my lodgings, and we walked together to George-yard; in George yard I felt her hand about me, she put her hand immediately away from me, and said, the watchman is coming? I felt her hand about my right hand breeches pocket; she put her hand against me, and pushed me away three or four yards, and I saw the other girl come from the corner of George-yard, and they stopped to speak to one another, and they passed one another, and I walked on till I came to Cheapside, and it struck me then that she had picked my pocket. I felt in my pocket and I found my money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lose? - Five guineas and a half, it was in gold, lapped up in a bit of paper, I lost nothing else, it was in my right hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that breeches pocket buttoned? No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. When first you missed your money in what situation did you find your pocket? - I found my pocket unbuttoned, and and likewise one of the flaps of these breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you first seen your money there? - I had it in my hand in my pocket, when I was speaking to her. Immediately after I missing my money, I ran back and I saw the girl going down Bow-lane, I immediately got to the girl and laid hold of her, and the watchman was coming by, and I said to the watchman, I charge you with this woman, for robbing me of five guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the watchman take her into custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he search her particularly? - I did not see her searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the watchman here? - No, he is not; the constable is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with her to the watch-house? - Yes, I did, and she was examined there by the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any money taken from her? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your money has not been found at all? - No, it has not, nor any part of it. She said she would give me a guinea if I chose to make it up with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it she said that? - In the compter afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you told her that you would taken it up, if she would give you some money? - I did, to hear what she would say.</p>

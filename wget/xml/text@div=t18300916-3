I said I did not know that there were seven - I did not know that more than one had said he had the shoes; his wife was present, and said, "What did you come here for?" and called him a prig - I understand that to mean a dishonest person; he then sat down in the room by his wife - no violence followed in consequence of her calling him a prig - he sat down and talked to her; I do not know what about: there did not seem any anger between them then; she went out and got some binding to bind her shoes, and then bound one pair while he remained in the room - he continued to sit on the same seat; she was out about half an hour - they did not appear in anger while she was binding the shoes; when she had done them he said he had got a few halfpence with him, and would have a little gin - he sent out for gin; three half-quarterns were brought, and four of us partook of it, the prisoner, his wife, myself, and Mary Ann Short - none of us were intoxicated: we then had some tea, which was provided at our joint expence - the prisoner partook of it; there did not appear any ill will between him and his wife then: we finished tea about half-past five o'clock; the prisoner then said he should be glad if his wife would give him the price of half a pint of rum - she said she would give him no rum; there was a noise out of doors - we all locked out of window; I ran into the other room to look out - I returned; the prisoner and his wife were still in the room with Short- we then sat down a bit; he and his wife appeared joking together - the prisoner then asked me how many times Mr. Kelly had been there: I had seen Kelly three times at my room - he is a shoemaker: she used to say he was a first cousin of Mr. Hectrup's - she bound shoes for Kelly's master: I said Kelly had been there three times to my knowledge - he said he should like to know who had the shoes- there had been an inquiry about a pair of shoes before this; he said he would tell who had the shoes if his wife would give him the rum - she had lost a pair of shoes that morning.</p>

               <p>Q. When the prisoner came at four o'clock was he at all intoxicated? A. Not at all, he was very sober; he had no liquor after the gin - he got up and said to his wife,"Ayn't you sorry for the shoes you have lost to-day?" she said, "No, not at all;" I saw him take up a knife which laid on the window - it was a knife she used to cut the shoes with; he sat close to it - he took it up, and stabbed it three times into his wife's chest - he jabbed it to her breast, but the busk of her stays kept it from her body - he did not wound her then; I said, "Lord have mercy upon me! the man is going to kill the woman;" I was afraid of it at the time, and called Mrs. Morris from the next room - I ran down stairs, and saw no more of it; I heard her halloo Murder! I did not see her again till she came out of the hospital, for I ran into a neighbour's house - I left him and her struggling together in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed her do any thing to him before he attempted to stab her or after? A. Not at all; she never touched him while I was in the room - she had called him a prig, but after that they were sociable and drank together; there did not appear any animosity between them then.</p>

            . I am single, and lived in the same room with Mrs. Hectrup, and used to sleep with her; I saw her and her husband together about four o'clock on this day - the prisoner is her husband: they always appeared as husband and wife, and spoke to each other as such - her name was Catherine Hectrup; we were just going to tea as the prisoner came in - he said, "I wish to know the seven people who accuse me of stealing the shoes;" she had missed a pair in the morning which she had to bind - I told him no one had accused him of taking the shoes, but Mrs. Heal had said she saw him come down stairs the night they were stolen - I said, "She is only joking with you, sit down" (meaning that his wife was only joking) and his wife said, "Sit down and take a cup of tea;" I had heard her say nothing to him but "You had better let me have the shoes," and calling him a prig, which means a dishonest person - they were joking and laughing together, and seemed very friendly; he said,"You wanted me to treat you on Monday - I have got a few halfpence now, and will treat you;" I went and brought in a quartern and a half of gin - it was drank between the tea, while we were at tea - we all partook of it, and were all quite friendly; after tea they were conversing about the shoes, and he said he would say what he knew about the shoes, if she would send for 1s. worth of rum - they were not talking in anger; she took a pair of shoes home to the Old Jewry after tea, and brought another pair to be bound - the prisoner remained in the room; she bound the shoes in his presence - there was no anger between them then; they were laughing and joking - they sat very close to each other; she had to go out to fetch binding for the shoes, and he talked a good bit about his wife while she was gone - she is younger than him, and he seemed uneasy about her; he mentioned Kelly's name, and seemed to say he had risen her from nothing, and she had behaved herself ill for some time - I had seen Kelly at the house three times, but he came each time on business; I was present - there was nothing to induce me to think ill of them; I always understood he was the prisoner's cousin- I told him I had seen Kelly there, and that he put his hand in my face once when he was there, and told me to mind what I was saying, as we had a dispute - he is an Irishman; I told the prisoner his wife sometimes spoke improper, and he should excuse that, as she was younger than him, and he should not ill-use her, for it was unbecoming in a man - he made no answer to what I said, but seemed silent, as if he was musing; her conduct was not proper towards her husband - she has often, in my presence, spoken aggravatingly to him; I did not think her conduct exactly improper - I do not know that she behaved unfaithful to him; I never saw any thing indecent between Kelly and her - his wife returned, and said, "I have been a good while gone;" he said, "Yes, you have;" she said, "I have been as far as Meek's, in Fore-street;" he said, "Are you not sorry about the shoes you have lost?" she said, "No, by my soul, I am not sorry about them;" they were then sitting quite close together - he rose suddenly from his seat, turned round, and stretched his arm<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160007"></xptr>out towards the window-seat, took something from there, and immediately aimed a blow at her chest three times; I was so dreadfully frightened I could not say positively what was in his hand - his wife called to me, and said, "I am stabbed, run for a doctor, Short;" my child was laying in the bed - I took it up, and ran for assistance immediately; I rushed into a blacksmith's opposite where we lived, and begged a man named Smith to run, for there was murder; I was coming out of the blacksmith's, and his wife rushed in there - she held up her clothes, and was streaming with blood; it appeared to be running from her thigh - there appeared a very great flow of blood; I saw nothing of the prisoner afterwards - he was not running after her - I begged of the man in the shop to take care of her while I went to Mr. Dobson, the apothecary; Mr. Dobson's son rushed directly to her assistance, and she was taken to the hospital - I went to see her the third day after - she was in bed there then; I did not see the prisoner afterwards - his wife had been using the knife just before he stabbed her, and put it on the window-seat; I did not see her do the least thing to provoke him; she did not speak quite proper to him, rather aggravatingly, but there was no quarrel - she did not appear at all aware that he was going to strike her with the knife; he took her quite by surprise.</p>

               <p>MRS. SHORT. I delivered these clothes to the constable - they are the same she wore at the time, and are in the same state as I received them at the hospital.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been brought here quite ignorant of the case; my wife sent me word that she had been in fault, and was willing to forgive me the little accident she met with - she sent word she would not come forward for five hundred guineas; as such I have no Counsel or friends to attend to my interest - I throw myself on the mercy of the Jury; when I was put into the Compter before, it was through Kelly, who led me to give her a box, and after being in the Compter two or three days, I was told by a witness I could produce that she had been walking with Kelly in Finsbury-square; she came to the prison the day after, laughed at me through the window, and asked if any body had told me any thing about her - I said I had been told she had been walking with Kelly - she denied it, and said it was another shoemaker belonging to her master in Coleman-street; I told her her own uncle had made a remark to me about her, that they had been seen together, and if she would come home and be peaceable in future, I never would rebuke her with what had passed; I told her all that had happened from time to time, and before she should come to public scandal, I was willing to forgive her- I declare to God Almighty I was as fond of her as ever a man was of his wife: when I went to the room that day she went out for half an hour - Short was talking about her: I remarked to Short that her dress was not fit for a journeyman shoemaker's wife, and I did not know how she got the clothes; Short told me several times that Kelly had been there: she did not know it, but that worked up my feelings - I had been very affectionate to my wife; I found myself changed - there was a knife by the shoes; whether I caught it first or she I declare to the great Heavens I do not know, but in the scuffle between us, in which I was quite exhausted, for I was quite out of my mind - in the scuffle she and I fell together on the ground, and what little wound she received was at that time; the knife appears to some very awful, but it was the cut I got in my hand caused the blood to be on it - I do not deny there was a knife between us both, but I never intended to hurt a hair of her head; I could not bear myself when Short told me what she did: I do not blame her for it, as she did not know the effect it would have on me - I have no Counsel, for I did not know I could be convicted in this manner.</p>

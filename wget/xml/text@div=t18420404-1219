On the 24th of February, about half-past three o'clock, or near four in the afternoon, Robinson brought this great-coat to pledge—I asked whose coat it was—he said it was his own—I said I was sure it was not, and asked where he got it from—he said he had brought it from his father, and if I did not like to take it, he would go and fetch his father—I said he had no occasion to do that—I called a policeman and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live, at 1, Halsville-Cottages, West Ham, and am an iron boat-builder—about half-past 9 o'clock on the night of 4th May, I was in Halsville-road, Plaistow-marsh, looking at a man selling jewellery—there were some people there, and I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket, taking my watch out—I had seen my watch not many minutes before—I tried to catch hold of the prisoner, but he ran against me and I could not—I saw him with the watch, and another witness saw him pass it—I valued it at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have never seen it since—I never lost the prisoner till the officer came up—my watch-guard was not broken; the rivet through the ring of the watch was broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 10, Victoria-dock-terrace, West Ham—on the night of 4th May, about half-past 9, I was by the prosecutor in a crowd—I saw the prisoner on his right side—I noticed him moving in different parts of the crowd, and heard the prosecutor say, "I have lost my watch"—<hi rend="italic">directly</hi> he said that the prisoner got in front of him, put his hand over my shoulder with something white and round in it, and passed it to somebody else, who made his way out of the crowd—the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner then, and I caught hold of his other arm and pulled it down, but the watch was gone—the prisoner said, "I have not got your watch, but I know who has."</p>

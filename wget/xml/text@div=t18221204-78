I wanted to issue two writs, and bought the stamps for that purpose; and last Monday I called at the City Arms for Thompson, a law writer, who fills up writs; he was not there, and the prisoner offered to do it. I said if he would do it properly I would give him half-a-crown, and put the stamps down before him; he set to writing.</p>
               <p>Q. You never expected to receive the paper in the state you delivered it to him - A. He was to fill them up; he sat down and began writing. I went to another part of the room for the newspaper, and he went out at the other door with the stamps and papers; there was two papers not written on; I laid them down with the two affidavit stamps for him to fill up, and also make the affidavits. The papers were stamped with a 5 s. stamp. I was not alarmed at missing them, but sat a few minutes, and then began to wonder where he was, and from what I heard, I went to Mr. Hildyard where I bought them, and found he had been there and sold them; he was to fill all the papers up. He heard me inquiring for Thompson, and said he could do it, and shewed me an affidavit to convince me of it. I found him the same evening at the City Arms, and took him. I told him he had treated me very ill. I had written</p>
               <p>"17 s. 6 d." in figures on the stamps before I delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. Q. Did you not ask me to fetch the stamps - A. Yes, I called there before I bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not say to you,</p>
               <p>"have the goodness to wait, and I will return" - A. No.</p>
               <p>J. B. HILDYARD. My father is a law-stationer, and lives in Poppin's-court, Fleet-street. The prisoner came with these two stamps, and asked me to return the money. I asked if he himself had bought them, he said No, he had sent a tall gentleman in black for them, but it was for a job of his own. I returned him 10 s., which was paid for them, and in about half an hour the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040033"></xptr>called about them. I produced them. I know them to be the same, as they are folded, and all the rest I had were not. I am almost certain of it, but cannot swear these are the two, as some others might be folded.</p>

               <p>The Court ruled, the charge could not be sustained. The stamps were delivered for the purpose of being filled up, and would then be of no value except to the particular person, and not the subject of felony.</p>

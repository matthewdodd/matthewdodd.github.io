               <p>Who catched the bundle of cloaths out of your hand? - That man did so, they both then immediately ran away; it was not dark; I could see half way over the park, it was a very light night it was star-light, I do not remember there was any moon, I suppose in the whole they were with me five minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. Five minutes in presenting a pistol and taking away your bundle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that in that time you can recollect to distinguish the prisoner, because the other man was the man that put his pistol your to breast? - The other was a great deal bigger and lustier; he seemed to be a very fat lusty man, and the other man was nothing like so big as the other.</p>
               <p>I suppose the other man attracted your notice most? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to know this prisoner again? - I knew him directly, I saw him on the Tuesday at Bow-street, on the Saturday night; I was robbed and I saw him at the Justice's on the Sunday morning; I was robbed about ten o'clock, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100076"></xptr> two men ran away, and Mr. Watkins who was with me, knocked the prisoner down, and some people came up and took him to the watch-house, I was left in the Park for three or four minutes by myself, I heard the cry of murder, and Mr. Watkins had him down, I said, for God's sake keep him down, he said, call for help, I did so, and there came up two men, and I thought they were going to murder me, and I ran away.</p>
               <p>How long was it after the prisoner had taken your bundle, that Mr. Watkins had knocked him down? - About five minutes, he ran after him and the man threw the bundle down; Mr. Watkins beat him very much.</p>
               <p>After the man was knocked down, what happened? - Then Mr. Watkins kept upon him, and the other man went away, I went down to the park gate, and there came some help, and took Mr. Watkins and the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the help? - Several people, I was at the watch-house, but it was an hour and an half after they were there; it was a little after eleven o'clock: After I had been there some time, they let the prisoner out of a place, and they said, was this the man that took your bundle, and I said, yes: I never had my bundle, Mr. Watkins run after the man, and the bundle contained the things mentioned in the indictment; the next morning we took the prisoner before a Justice, I told the Justice how the affair happened and I recollected the prisoner again very well.</p>

               <p>I live in Cambridge-street, I am a cabinet-maker and joiner; this young woman lived at Brompton, she was coming from her place, she sent to me, to meet her in the evening; to come home with her, I walked along to Brompton, and I came all the way from Brompton through Hyde Park, and just as we came nigh the bason, two men came up, one fastened on me, and the other on her, and said, your money or your life immediately.</p>
               <p>Were they armed? - One had a pistol.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner either of these men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he the pistol, or the other? - I am. not sure, I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Why you perceived these two men, and knocked one of them down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That you did in your fright? - Yes, we were close together, she had hold of my arm, and she shrunk close to me, and we were all four together, and I believe this was the man that fastened on me, but I am not sure of that; one of them was putting his hand into my pocket, and I struck at him and said, you scoundrel, I have no money, and immediately I cried murder! and and this man took the bundle, and I ran after him and knocked him down and kept him; I cried murder very loud, and the girl came up to me in a very great fright, I sent her to get assistance, and she fell into fits, I heard the pistol fire before I knocked him down; fifty people came about us in a few minutes; we all went to the watch-house, and they went out and found the woman in the Park, we went to the Justice's the next morning, and were ordered to appear again on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Court. You are sure this was the man? - I am as sure of it, as that I stand in this place; he never was five yards from me all the time; the bundle was not got again.</p>
               <p>What o'clock was it? - It was about ten o'clock, a very fine evening, the days were longer then, I could see at a good distance in the Park.</p>
               <p>Jury. How near was it to Hyde Park gate? - It was very nigh the bason, near Grosvenor-gate.</p>

               <p>It was between ten and eleven o'clock, I stopped at Hyde Park Corner to drink a pint of beer, it was half past ten o'clock by the dial in the house, it was not light, there were stars, but they did not give the light of the moon; I never was before an honourable bench of Justice's in my life, or a magistrate; I had been to Kensington, I staid pretty late, I went to seek after business, I have been a <rs id="t17830910-49-deflabel288" type="occupation">gentleman's servant</rs>

I saw a man run before me, he had a bundle in his hand, he dropped the bundle at about ten yards distance from me, I run too, I did not know what way that man run, this man followed me and knocked me down, and after that he got upon my stomack, the blood run out of my mouth and nostrils, and he made my eyes so black, I did not see out of one of them for six weeks: I begged him for God's sake to save my life, I had neither pistols nor weapons, nor money: I was quite suffocated, and all over in a gore of blood; my head was almost as as big as three heads; with that, I was put into the inner place in the watch-house; the next morning I was taken to the Justice's in Bow-street, and committed; both my prosecutors swore full against me, that I was the man that took the bundle, but I never was; I know no more of it than the child unborn; I have one sister in London, and a mother in the country, a very old woman.</p>
               <p>Court. Is none of the people belonging to the watch-house here?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>How came none of them to attend? - There were several of them at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was any body nigh you when you knocked him down? - Not any one.</p>
               <p>How long after did any body come? - A few minutes after, there was not another person nigh me, he run a little across from under the trees, it was not far, it was a very little way, I saw him throw the bundle out of his hand.</p>

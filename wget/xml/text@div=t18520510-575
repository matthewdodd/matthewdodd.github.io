                  </hi>. I reside at Roehampton, in the parish of Putney. On Wednesday evening, 21st April, I left Roehampton about 9 o'clock, or a quarter past, to go to town with my family—I returned about twenty minutes after 2; the carriage drove up to the door about that time—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100141"></xptr>
               <p>I went into the drawing room a few steps for the purpose of getting bedroom handle sticks—everything was perfectly safe then—there were no signs of fire, nor, that I could see, of robbery—about an hour afterwards, I was alarmed by a maid knocking at my door—I got up, went into the drawing room, and found it filled with suffocating smoke, and the opposite side of the room was in flames, which extended to the window—an ottoman occupied a recess between the fireplace and the window, and there were curtains opposite which go the whole length of the room—the curtains up to the coving of the ceiling were on fire—the coving is a sort of wooden canopy fastened to the window; it is part of the wall, I think—most likely the architect built it—it is not part of the curtains, it is boards nailed against the wall, and fastened in the ordinary way—those boards were on fire—the principal body of fire was in the corner in that part of the room, but there was also fire in that part some—what nearer to the fireplace at the back of the ottoman—it extended from the window round the corner partly to the fireplace, limiting itself to those parts which were wood—where there was skirting board it was on fire; the skirt<lb></lb>ing board was only partial at the back of the ottoman—the heat was intense—I did not go in, but shut the door, and gave orders to my wife to save the lives of the children first—it was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before we managed to get the fire under—a large picture, which was above thirty feet from the fire, was entirely charred and destroyed—there is a fire-place at each end of the room—there was a clock at one end, which stopped at 18 minutes to 4—I also missed a pendulum clock from the mantelpiece on the other side, which stops directly it is moved—I saw it after it was found—it had stopped at 29 minutes past 3, which was about ten minutes before I was alarmed—the clocks kept very exact time indeed—the legs of the otto-man were entirely destroyed, and the floor was destroyed at the further corner—I missed a large quantity of valuable property, some of which I have not recovered yet—I had seen most of it the evening before, on two tables at the further corner of the room—they were some seals, a silver gilt snuffbox, and some instruments, some of which were as far as could be from the fire, quite at the opposite corner—I missed nothing from that part of the room where the fire was; that part was entirely hedged in by furniture, two arm chairs, a sofa, and a small table—the sofa and chairs were within an inch of touching; a man must have gone round them, or stepped over them to get to where the fire was—the nearest point to the clock, which was carried off, at which I ob<lb></lb>served the fire to have gone, was six feet from where it had stood—the candles used in the drawing room are all wax, and cut to fit the candlesticks—stearine candles are used in the school room, and only in that room—several things were missed from the school room, which I have since seen—from the school room you can get round from the drawing room by a door; you can get round in two ways—a stearine candle was found on the same console table as the silver bedroom candlesticks bad been on—a policeman showed me a wax candle found in the shrubbery, which was precisely like the others—it was cut, and fitted the silver candlesticks—my family were very much alarmed—I have been informed that the prisoner lived there with Mr. Thomson, before I took the house of Mr. Thomson, seven or eight years ago, but I have seen him on two occasions only; the first time was when I arrested him at the India House for a burglary—I do not know his writing—I received a letter on 28th April, six days after this transaction.</p>

To the Commissioners of Police, Great Scotland Yard, Charing Cross—Sirs, I beg to state I heard this morning the awful news of Mr. A. J. Hankey's residence being robbed and afterwards set fire to, and that suspicion at present lights on me. God is my judge I never did entertain any malice or revenge for that gentleman, or any one allied to him. I must certainly confess that my peace of mind has been much unsettled since he was so very anxious to prosecute me for Mr. Day's burglary. I was innocent of that, but guilty of receiving it. Through my former conviction, that prevents roe from facing my accusers, and I have no other means of finishing a life which has been a burden to me ever since I first stepped on my native shore after an absence of twelve years. Since the first week of my leaving the Hospital, I refrained from coming to Roehampton; family quarrels was my sole reason for so doing, and I hope God will forgive me and others. I have been wrongly judged by those in power, and sooner than be remanded, even on suspicion, I will end that life so eagerly sought for by the bloodhounds and perjuries that beset me; but let me, ere I conclude, remark the sole cause of my untimely end I lay to Mr. A. J. Hankey, and my only wish and last prayer is for him not to let revenge follow me beyond the grave, or to any of my parents or relations. May God forgive him, as I hope forgiveness at the last day of judgment, where rich and poor, guilty and innocent, will meet their true acquittal. Farewell, Gentlemen, and all the world; I leave this innocent. May God have mercy on my soul.

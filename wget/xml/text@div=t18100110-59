It is with extreme concern I now appear before you, it is the first time in my life; I have only to offer in extenuation of my conduct, I have been confined three months with sickness, during which time I was obliged to make away with all my tools. I beg my offence may be considered to arise from necessity, and not from depravity, and should I be considered an object to experience the lenity of the court, the most grateful sensations of heart will be ever acknowledged, by your most penitent servant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident manager of the Deposit Assurance Company, New Bridge-street, Blackfriars. I was appointed to that office in 1852—in the early part of Feb. the defendant called at the office; he represented that he was a compositor in Messrs. Spottiswoodes' employment, and requested me to supply him with some prospectuses of our Company—the number he asked for was rather large, and I declined at first to do so unless I knew what his object was; he said that it was the practice in Messrs. Spottiswoodes' office, for the partners to give lectures on various subjects, and that they had requested him to give a lecture on life assurance; that 300 of the men had singled our company out, in conse<lb></lb>quence of some peculiar feature, and he had no doubt but that all would insure, in consequence of hearing his lecture; upon that I gave him about 100 prospectuses, we were rather short of them at that time and were receiving tenders for some—I told the prisoner if these men were going to insure it would be advisable for Messrs. Spottiswoode to tender for the printing of a new batch of prospectuses—he said, "Can you give me any idea of the price?" I said it will be from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per thousand; he said he would let me have the tender the next day—I spoke to one of the Directors, who said he thought it was a very capital idea—the prisoner brought me the tender in writing, and it was accordingly given to Messrs. Spottiswoode, who undertook to deliver 20,000 prospectuses at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per thou<lb></lb>sand—I afterwards received the following note—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Her Majesty's Printing-office, reading department, Feb. 15, 1854, New-street square; to C. W. Bevan, Esq. Sir, permit me to acknowledge the receipt, this day, of eleven prospectuses, and sixteen forms of proposal, of the Deposit Office; as I have been some time awaiting them preparatory to my lecture, at the request of my governor (Mr. Spottiswoode), I should be most happy if you would favour me with an interview personally, at any time you could con<lb></lb>veniently appoint, either to-morrow, or before Saturday. I am, Sir, yours respectfully, M G. Keating. P. S. I have the Spottiswoodes' <hi rend="italic">carte blanc</hi> to invite any friends to to-night's lecture.

Favour me with 200 of your office envelopes to enclose cards and bills to my friends in the various newspaper offices; or would you deem it better to use plain? M. G. Keating. P. S. May I take the liberty to ask the advance of a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of printing, &amp;c., as I am just now a little short</p>

               <p>of cash. You will certainly oblige by so doing, which we can settle when the 20,000 prospectuses are completed. An early answer to this will oblige.")—I then sent for the defendant, and on the following Sat. he called; I asked him what he meant by writing to me for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of his master's bill for printing; "Oh! I can settle that with the governor, I always settle things with the governor"—I said, "If you settle things with your governor like that, I do not settle things with my governors like that;" that I had nothing to do with his lecture, and could not give him any money whatever; he then asked me if I would lend him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Certainly not," and asked him what he wanted it for; he said he should have to give a <hi rend="italic">spread</hi>—I said it was time enough to pay for the <hi rend="italic">spread</hi> when he had given it—he then asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as he must have a decent coat to lecture in—I said, "I see what sort of man you are," and I advised him to leave my office, which he did—I then received the following letters from him—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Her Majesty's Printing-office, Sat., Mar. 11, 4 P. M. C. W. Bevan, Esq. Dear Sir, I regret to say from the dis<lb></lb>courteous (I ought to say, 'ruffianly') reception I have just now experi<lb></lb>enced at the hands of your under-strapper, Norris (who is neither useful nor ornamental to any office), that I shall feel myself perfectly exonerated from my engagement of advocating the merits of the Company of which you are resident secretary, in my forthcoming lecture, unless I hear from you before 7 o'clock this evening; I have disobliged myself and my friends to oblige you and your Directors, at your written request I am sorry you are so short-sighted. Yours most respectfully, M. G. K. P. S. Your announcement at the Angel Inn, Oldham, as reported in the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Times</hi>, of March 1, that 300 of the printers in the employ of the Messrs.

Yours respect<lb></lb>fully, M. G. Keating")—after the reception of those letters I saw the de<lb></lb>fendant on the next Monday morning—I called on Mr. Norris, at the office of Messrs. Spottiswoode, and requested to see Mr. Keating—I saw him, and said to him, in Mr. Norris's presence, "Mr. Keating, I have called for your apology to these two letters; unless you apologise I shall see Mr. Spottiswoode, your master"—he said that if I libelled him to his master he should bring an action against me—I then went with Mr. Norris to Mr. George Spottiswoode, and showed him these letters—the defendant was not present—I afterwards met the defendant in the street; he came up, but I did not speak to him—I received this letter from him, on or about the day it bears date—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "24th March, 13, Took's-court, Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane.

Well, my lecture came off Did I show any ill feeling towards you or your Company? Have I deserved such vindictiveness at your hands, merely from writing you a note for a few pounds on account, to pay for printing the fresh bills, &amp;c. I wrote under excited feelings at the insulting language I received from Norris, of which I believe you are <hi rend="italic">still unaware.</hi> I regret you should have extended your ill feeling so far as to deprive of bread my wife and little ones (at least so far as you are concerned). However, I suppose you can have no objection to amicably terminate our brief acquaintance, by remitting me a cheque for the printing account; bills, cards, &amp;c. (postponing the lecture), for your purposes; advertising, fees to waiters, and incidental costs out of pocket, which you have induced me to become liable for, say 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. If so, <hi rend="italic">the matter rests here</hi>, and receive the final adieu of, Sir, your obedient servant, M. G. Keating. P. S.

                  <hi rend="italic">blessings attending the adoption of Life Assurance.'</hi> It is evident from the numerous attendance, and its freedom from partisanship, 'young' or 'old,' that the critiques in the journals are not altogether undeservedly rendered. It is painful to me to go into particulars, but in self-defence I feel bound to state the following facts. In Her Majesty's Printing-office there is a most admirable plan of education for the machine boys, reading boys, apprentices, and even adults (under the fostering charge of those amiable gentlemen, the Messrs. Eyre and Spottiswoode, H. M. printers). The 'readers' or 'correctors' on the establishment (of whom there is a staff of 25) each take a class, to contribute to the local 'treasury of useful knowledge.' I (as one of them) was solicited by Mr. William Spottiswoode to take the arithmetic class. I assented, but said I should prefer 'getting out of it' (<hi rend="italic">as others had done</hi>) by giving a lecture; on learning my subject, <hi rend="italic">'Life Assurances,'</hi> Mr. Spottiswoode was quite pleased, and so the matter was settled to come off in the lecture room attached to the office on the following Wednesday. To be better up in my Subject, I sent my son over to the <hi rend="smallCaps">DEPOSIT OFFICE</hi>, in Bridge-street, Blackfriars, with my compliments, for one of their Prospectuses, as I heard they offered <hi rend="italic">startling advantages.</hi> The Resident Manager asked who it was for, for what purpose, &amp;c. He was answered. He forthwith re<lb></lb>quested an interview with me; I duly attended. He suggested—would it not be better to give it in some <hi rend="italic">public room</hi>, as our lecture room was so small; to hire Anderton's large room, not to mind the expense; to order a supper for my friends as far as a dozen pounds would go, as he was most anxious for a <hi rend="italic">public</hi> opportunity, under <hi rend="italic">such auspices</hi>, of refuting some <hi rend="italic">dark rumours</hi> relative to his own antecedents, and some charges against the Chairman of <hi rend="smallCaps">THE DEPOSIT</hi>. Further to induce me to yield to his request, he asked me (as he learned I was a printer) for an estimate for printing 100,000 Prospectuses of <hi rend="smallCaps">THE DEPOSIT</hi> (showing me at the same time, <hi rend="italic">in private</hi>, the respective estimates for the same from Manchester, Liverpool, Oldham, Birmingham, and other places). The above estimates varied from 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per 100,000. He said, Do it for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per 1,000 and you shall have an order for 100,000. I replied, I could do nothing in the matter without submitting it to my principals. I consulted them; they accepted the order, which is now being executed, <hi rend="italic">on my recommendation at the time</hi>, but which I <hi rend="italic">now</hi> regret for <hi rend="italic">their</hi> sakes as well as my <hi rend="italic">own.</hi> At Mr. Bevan's request, 500 copies of <hi rend="italic">The Deposit</hi> (last year's) circulars were distributed to all employed in H. M. P. O., to induce some of them to insure. It was complied with. Two days after he saddled me with the responsibility of an assertion made by him at a meeting of his Company's shareholders at Oldham (see Keating's Lecture on Life Assurance), viz., 'That 300 of the compositors in the Messrs. Spottiswoodes' were about to join <hi rend="italic">The Deposit</hi> after a careful examination,' &amp;c., &amp;c. This gave <hi rend="italic">serious</hi> offence to my principals, who challenged me with it I wrote Mr. Bevan a strong note, condemnatory of his assertion, and as I wished to cease our brief acquaintance, to settle my account. I was met with evasion, and ultimately downright insult from himself and his understrapper Norris (Assistant Secretary), his former companion in the Queen's Bench. The result is, I was compelled to place the matter in the hands of my solicitor (Mr. Archer, Clement's-lane, City), who has instructions to proceed forthwith. It is lamentable, Mr. Editor, that the many responsible names figuring in the list of Directors of <hi rend="italic">The Deposit</hi> should be so tarnished by being associated with that of Charles W. Bevan, Resident Manager. Surely chaos must be come again, or Lord Viscount Drumlanrig, M. P., P. C., Comptroller of Her Ma<lb></lb>jesty's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030008"></xptr>
               <p>Household, must have been misled, to allow his name to be associated with that of such a scamp as Bevan. The sooner his Lordship publicly dis<lb></lb>avows all connection with the <hi rend="smallCaps">'DIDDLE-OZIT'</hi> or <hi rend="smallCaps">'DEPOSIT'</hi> the better for himself, for he will stand higher in an <hi rend="italic">Imperial</hi> point of view, than have his name dragged into County Courts and Lord Mayor's Courts all through the backslidings and antecedents of Charles W.

I thank you, <hi rend="italic">Grub;</hi> your perse<lb></lb>cution has procured for me an appointment of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per diem travelling expenses, with a <hi rend="italic">carte blanche</hi> to choose my own route. Still I say, pay my wife my account, and I shall cease to think of you or your Company."—I received that letter through the post—I cannot say when, as one letter followed the other so fast that I put them in a drawer every morning, and sometimes two or three times a day I had them—I afterwards received this other letter, which purports to be a copy of one sent to <hi rend="italic">Reynolds's Newspaper</hi>—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "A dashing-looking fellow, on his emerging from the Bench (after a remand from the Insolvent Court), thought, in the year 1852, that the best mode of supplying his necessities would be to open an Insurance-office for the receipt of moneys as <hi rend="italic">Deposit</hi> in exchange for the sale of annuities, &amp;c., &amp;c. The plan was notable, but required assistance; and a coadjutor worthy his friendship was found in a fellow prisoner named N—r—is, expelled from the Secretary ship of a highly respectable Insurance-office for manipulation of its funds. These prison birds at once confederated together, and found no great difficulty in their way. The chief capital demanded by such an undertaking, on the part of the concoctors, was unbounded impudence; and on that of the public, unbounded credulity. Having joined their purses to produce a flaming</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030009"></xptr>
               <p>prospectus, and taken an office in Bridge-street, Blackfriars, their next plan was to concoct a Directory of gentlemen, who, while they attracted public attention, and seemed a pledge for the respectability of the Company, should yet mislead those who were not familiar with the financial world. This was an easy task, and in due time the most honourable names in London were openly published as being Directors, &amp;c. Trusting to the faith of the public in great mercantile firms, there was scarce a banker, a brewer, or merchant, whose patronymic (but with different initials, or misspelling the name) was not used by these Jeremy <hi rend="italic">Diddlers</hi> to forward their views. Everything thus prepared, they turned their attention to statistics; and here, again, there was no great obstacle. In order to procure business, it was necessary to offer tempting terms, so they liberally proposed to serve the public 30 per cent. lower than any other office, although, with all the existing competition, the greatest difference hitherto had been from 1 to 1 1/2 per cent.; and in addition to this, these bad men committed the glaring impudence of granting Life Assurances for much smaller premiums, and selling Annuities on much lower terms than any other office; terms so palpably wrong that a man aged thirty, by paying 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., could obtain a Life Annuity of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and by paying 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of this to insure his life, could receive 6 1/4 per cent for his <hi rend="italic">Deposit</hi>, and secure his capital to his represen<lb></lb>tatives. Having thus arranged preliminaries, and secured the Comptroller of Her Majesty's Household, M. P., as chairman, they opened their office and commenced business. They had the precaution to select respect<lb></lb>able agents, and by giving a commission of 25 per cent. where other Com<lb></lb>panies only gave 5 per cent. thus stimulated the agents to say all they could in their favour. The terms were very attractive. There is always a large uninitiated class, ready and willing to be duped, and the business went on swimmingly. If a man wanted to insure his life, there was no difficulty about his health. If a man wished to purchase an annuity, they were quite willing to dispense with baptismal certificates in London, Dublin, Edin<lb></lb>burgh, Glasgow, <hi rend="italic">Oldham</hi>, &amp;c., &amp;c. Large and handsome offices were opened in Bridge-street, Blackfriars, for the reception of <hi rend="smallCaps">THE DEPOSITS</hi> of the unwary, and the public thus induced to play its part in this most serious drama of real life. The poor and less intelligent portion of the community, lured by terms which had never before tempted them, took their spare cash and <hi rend="italic">deposited</hi> it in the safe (?) keeping of these worthies. Rich men were not less dazzled by the golden promises, and one person, who had toiled, and worked, and grown prematurely old in the service of mammon, invested <hi rend="italic">his all</hi> in the purchase of an Annuity; and in order to secure the capital, insured with them his life. He is now a beggar!!! A family, which with great industry, and by doing without a servant for forty years, had saved enough to retire from business, <hi rend="italic">deposited</hi> the principal portion in this <hi rend="italic">Bank of Elegance</hi> just in time to be next day made acquainted, by public advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and other papers, that the Company (to keep the game alive) were about issuing 100,000 <hi rend="italic">new</hi> shares, at a discount of 25 per cent. from the original shares, but that when the new shares had been paid for, their <hi rend="italic">'Deposit'</hi> would be refunded, &amp;c., &amp;c.

                  <hi rend="italic">un</hi>-prepaid testimony to the zeal of the Resident Manager, in the shape of shameless advertisements (for the payment of which the Directors have to be sued in the various County Courts in Great Britain and Ireland); but the walls of the provincial towns will shortly blaze with coloured posters, cautioning the unwary against being <hi rend="italic">'diddled.'</hi> Even now, not a single advertisement will get insertion in any paper, unless pre-paid. The <hi rend="italic">'Deposits'</hi> thus received are liberally spent. The noble Chairman, being a sporting character, backs 'The Spider' for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 'Johnny Walker' for another 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but in this latter battle (see <hi rend="italic">Belts Life</hi>, May 7, under head 'The Ring,') fearing 'a cross,' directs the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposited on account, to be handed over to his 'Pet's' opponent. The Resident Manager keeps his saddle horses and carriage horses; servants in gorgeous liveries; fares sumptuously every day; lives in the house in Bridge-street, and, being of a convivial character, astonishes that quiet Assurance-street with gay parties, lighted rooms, musical soirees, and expensive dinners—the last, at Radley's, cost 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—of course, paid for out of his own salary!!! But there are dark rumours afloat since the publication of Keating's Lecture on life Assurance, which should make men hesitate before they give this fellow their countenance or support. It is known they have thrown some difficulties in the way of paying some annuities in the country; and that, without any justice, they have refused to discharge a Life Assurance claim which had become due; still, what is everybody's business is nobody's business, and they thought they had hedged themselves with such a conventional respectability, and gave such good dinners (at the policy holders' expense) that it was not till Mr. Keating had the nerve, single handed, to grapple with the bubble, that they were compelled to yield. So great was their <hi rend="italic">prestige</hi> that, though he came fierce and furious, and bearded them in their own house, and before the very faces of their friends; though he told the ladies and gentlemen present he was swindled, and that their <hi rend="italic">host</hi> was the swindler, ultimately he was compelled to resort to the Lord Mayor's Court for the recovery of a petty account for printing and hotel expenses paid out of pocket for this Resident Manager. The following extract from <hi rend="italic">The Reformer</hi> will close this week's notice of the <hi rend="italic">Diddle-osit:</hi> 'Some time ago there was sent to this office a series of advertisements in favour of The Deposit and General Assurance Company, which were entered and paid for in the regular course of business. We are cautious about admitting indelicate quack medical advertisements, but it never entered into our heads for one moment that an Insurance Company professing to be incorporated by special Acts of Parli<lb></lb>ment was, in truth, a quack Company, got up for the premeditated purpose of imposing upon the public in matters of life assurance and annuities. Hence the advertisements of the Deposit and General glided through our columns from time to time. But we were astonished this week to learn that it is a spurious mushroom Company, hatched in the Queen's Bench prison, about two years ago, by a pair of scamps bankrupt in character as well as in purse. Under these circumstances, our duty, we humbly con<lb></lb>ceive, is at once plain and decisive, and therefore we proceed to discharge it, for the sake of the public, whose faithful and unflinching servants we at all times profess to be. In a word, we raise our voice and warn the public against "The Deposit and General Insurance Company." It is a false and fictitious Company. In their policies of Insurance they take care to provide, viz., "That the capital, stock, and funds of the said Company shall alone be answerable to the demands thereupon under this policy." Why, what is the</p>

               <p>value of their capital, stock, and funds, if, as we repeat, the parties them-selves, forming the said Company, are utterly worthless, being, in fact, no better than a parcel of tricksters in London, disowned, or repudiated, or condemned, by every respectable person to whom reference is made? There can scarcely, we think, be anything so base or so nefarious as taking "De<lb></lb>posits" or premiums from unsuspecting people, and making them believe they are secured against the contingencies of life, or the risk of fire, and then mocking them in their calamities when the <hi rend="italic">Bubble bursts.'"</hi>)—I cannot recollect how I received that, but it is most likely that it was left in the letter box—it was in a letter addressed to myself, but I always throw the envelopes away.</p>

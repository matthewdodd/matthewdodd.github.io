I had just passed through a gap, when I saw a man who turned out afterwards to have a crape over his face; when I first saw him, from his face appearing black, I took him for a negro. I had no suspicion of him, but passed him; when I had gone about three or four yards through the gap, I heard a voice behind me crying, stop, stop!

            , Esq; A great coat, I believe wraped together about his body; he had blackish hair which seemed to hang about his ears; he said, stop! stop! your money, your money. He did not make use of any violent imprecation; he had a pistol in his hand which he presented to me. I gave him my purse which contained three guineas, or three guineas and a quarter; he kept his eyes fixed upon me, and was remarkably circumspect, looking about him and rather moving about as I imagined to observe whether any persons were within sight; he saw my watch chain hanging from under my waistcoat; he asked me for my watch; after some little conversation, I advised him not to take the watch, I said they were dangerous things; but he insisted upon having it, and I gave it him. I then asked him for my purse again, I was particularly fond of it, and he returned it me empty; he then looked about him for a short space, just took a view of the fields, and turned back again the way that I had come through the gap, and I observed as he turned he took off his hat, in the act of turning, I thought he drew up the crape; he ran with great velocity through the gap and turned upon the further side of the hedge and I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. In the motion of taking off his hat and throwing up the crape as you apprehend did you see his face.</p>
               <p>Boyd. No, he had turned about, but I looked very closely at him while he was robbing me; the sun shone very bright, I thought he was careful to keep his face turned from me, he behaved without any violence or imprecation, I have seen the prisoner since the robbery at Sir

My watch is in the hands of a pawnbroker; it was produced before the justice and sworn to by Mr. Atkins. I don't know so much of the movement of the watch, but it appears like it; the plate, the name, the number, I could almost swear to, but both the gold cases are changed for silver ones; and there is a scratch for a figure of one, but it is awkwardly done. The number of my watch was 1918, it has been attempted to be made 1913.</p>

            . I am a watchmaker. I find by an extract from my books, that there was a gold watch, with two cases, capped and jeweled, sold to Mr. Boyd, on the 10th of January, 1768, the number 1913. I saw that watch at Sir John Fielding's yesterday sen-night; I believe the movement to be the same that was made for Mr. Boyd, but the cases were changed. The addition of a one, that Mr. Boyd mentions, has been very badly put to it, and the name has been taken out of the cap, where we usually put our names; that has been totally erased; but there is a roughness upon the cap that shews there had been an erasure</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name upon the watch?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Samuel and Robert Atkins, London, number 1913, both upon the cap and upper plate of the watch; that was made at the time my father and I were in partnership: that name still remains upon the inner plate of the watch.</p>

               <p>Shipman. I believe in the evening. I gave him a duplicate for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man?</p>
               <p>Shipman. Yes, I am very certain to him, I have known him three or four months, and have dealt with him frequently in wearing apparel; but I had never taken a watch in before of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you to keep the watch?</p>
               <p>Shipman I gave him a duplicate for three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you advance money for a certain time, do you?</p>
               <p>Shipman. Yes, I lent him an advanced price upon that account, otherwise I should not have lent him so much.</p>
               <p>Q. What is paid for the two pounds thirteen shillings and six-pence for three months?</p>
               <p>Shipman. Six-pence in the pound per month.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was about eighteen-pence a month you was to have for it?</p>
               <p>Shipman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you produce the watch?</p>
               <p>Shipman. On Wednesday sen-night at Sir John Fielding's. The duplicate being found in the prisoner's lodgings, by one of Sir

               <p>Shipman. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Do you remember what I said to you when I brought the watch to you?</p>
               <p>Shipman. Yes, I asked him whether it was his own; he said, he had bought the movement for eighteen or twenty shillings, and that the movement was originally in gold cases, but that he purchased the movement of a young gentleman who sold the cases: he said, the young gentleman was a lawyer.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not mention his name?</p>
               <p>Shipman. No, he said, he had carried the movement to a watchmaker's, and had silver cases put to it: he said, the watchmaker lived in Beach Lane, White Cross Street. He had this watch out once, and pledged it again: it was the first time he pledged it he told me that.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he bring the watch, the last time?</p>
               <p>Shipman. On the 19th of November. The first time he brought it, was the 22d of October: it was the last time I lent him two pounds thirteen shillings and six-pence on it, the first time I lent him two guineas. I never had it before the 22d of October.</p>

               <p>Shipman. The usual time, two years: it was the advanced price the last time, that induced that agreement.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never lent him any thing before this watch, but upon wearing apparel?</p>
               <p>Shipman. No, but upon Christmas-eve I lent him a guinea and half upon a watch.</p>

               <p>Heley. I referred to our list of the pawnbrokers, and by that means I found out that the watch was pawned at the person Mr. Shipley lives with. It was a proposal among the pawnbrokers to number their shops.</p>

               <p>Heley. Too many.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence:</p>
               <p>On the 10th of last September, I had been down to Deptford about some business: on my return back, I came through the Minories. Just by the sign of the Crown, a well dressed gentleman asked me to buy a watch; he had blue cloaths on, and appeared to be a sea fareing gentleman; I never saw him before: he took me into the Crown: he said, he was distressed for money and obliged to part with his watch. He asked me twenty-eight shillings for it; I asked him whether he was a watchmaker? he said no, it was his own watch, and had been his father's formerly, but he was obliged to sell part of it, and would sell the movement to me, if I would buy it. I gave him eighteen shillings for the movement. As I had never a watch, I thought it would save some expence to have a pair of cases made to it. He wound it up, and showed it, and said, it was a good watch. I carried it to Mr. Nourse in Beach Lane, he made me a pair of cases for it, for which I gave him a guinea. After he aad done it, I was rather necessitated for money and was obliged to pawn it a few days after. I took it out again, and a few days after I had got it out, I had a writ out against me from one Mr. Jarvis at Deptford, who I had contracted a debt with; I therefore pawned it again, to raise money to pay the debt. Since I have been in custody, I have sent an officer to the Crown in the Minories, there were several gentlemen in the tap-room when I was there, drinking, but I can get no inteligence about the man I drank a pint of beer with him, when I bought it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

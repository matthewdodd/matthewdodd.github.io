I said no; I went to another man that I knew in the same way, he did not want them; Wilson said to me, let that man have them, I spoke to Griffiths, and he came and bought them, and I offered to take them home for a pint of beer: presently the young man came in, and called this man out, and came in afterwards, and said, was not you a drinking with that young man, yes, says I, then this gentleman came and dragged me out of the house, says I, do not pull me, I am no thief; and I went to the Justices.</p>

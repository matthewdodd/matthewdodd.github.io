                  </hi>. I live in Upper Ground-street, Blackfriars. I was in King-street, and saw the prisoner fumbling at the prosecutor's breast—I saw him put one hand deliberately on one part of the pin; the other pan was covered with a handkerchief—I saw him draw it from the prosecutor's breast—he had a yellow silk handkerchief in his hand, which covered one part of the pin—he put his hand down by his side—I cannot say what be<lb></lb>came of the pin—I gave information to the prosecutor—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man I saw take the pin—I could see the large part of the pin and the chain.</p>

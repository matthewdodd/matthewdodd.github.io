I live with my aunt, Mary Ann Brown, in North-street, Pentonville—I go to school at Mr. Hart's, in Gee-street After I had been to school, on the 28th of Nov., I went out in my bonnet, and left my cloak hanging in Mr. Hart's house—about half-an-hour after I saw the cloak in the policeman's hands—this is it.</p>

               <p>one o'clock, on the 28th of Nov., I was in Gee-street—I saw the prisoner and two others standing opposite Mr. Hart's—I saw a short man, who escaped, go into the yard—the prisoner then entered the door of the house, and came out with something in his apron—I sent a boy to inquire what was taken—the prisoner saw that, and ran—I pursued him—he ran into a court, and threw off his apron, with the cloak in it—I called to a boy to pick it up, and follow me—he did so—they went to Clarendon-square—the short man turned to the left, and the prisoner to the right—a policeman met him—he then went to the fence—I went to catch him, he struck at me, and jumped over the wall—I followed, and saw him taken—this is the cloak and apron.</p>

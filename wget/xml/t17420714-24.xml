My Servant was complaining to the Washerwoman, that some of the Linnen was missing, (we discovered it by that) I found out where she lived, and got a Warrant to search, and went the 23d of June, with an Officer, to Mr Turner's in White Lyon-Yard, but in her Box we could only find two Pair of Gloves; Mr Turner's Son said, he suspected she had acted the dishonest Part, by the Handkerchief which she sold a Relation of his; I showed him a Handkerchief I had in my Pocket, and he knew his Relalation had bought such a Handkerchief, I knew it by the Mark of H in the Corner, tho' the H was pick'd out, the Mark of an H remained; her Box being since searched, several other Things were found that are mine.</p>

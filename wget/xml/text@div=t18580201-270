                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 185). On 20th Jan., about 8 o'clock in the morning, I received information, and went to a shed on the premises of Thomas Burton, at Rushey Green, Lewisham—the doors were closed; I pulled them open and saw the prisoner skinning a sheep—I took this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from him, and asked him where he got the sheep—he said, "Out of Mr. Wal<lb></lb>lis's field," and that his dog had worried it, and that he did not know what to do, and took it into the shed—I told him I must take him in custody—he said he was very sorry—I took him to the station, and then returned to the shed, and found the sheep's head concealed under the boarded floor, and the carcase in the shed—I sent for a farmer and a butcher to examine it—I found no marks of it having been torn by a dog—I showed it to Mr. Wallis's shepherd.</p>

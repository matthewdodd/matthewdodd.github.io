               <p>Q Do you know of his having lost any property in September last? - Yes, on the 26th of September he lost four pieces of printed callicos, he lost them out of the warehouse, from the counter in the front.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the warehouse part of the dwelling house? - It is underneath the dwelling house, under the same roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you get into the warehouse any other way than to the dwelling house? - No, only at the front door; the warehouse is on the ground floor; there is nothing there on the ground floor but a passage. I saw the printed callico there about an hour before, I happened to shew them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you miss them? - I did not miss them till I took them on the prisoner's shoulder. This was on Thursday the 26th of September; I took him then that instant about thirty yards down Ironmonger-lane; I went up to him and tapped him on the shoulder, it was about thirty yards from our house; he had the linens on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to follow him? - I had some writing to do in the counting house and I saw something white, and I went to the door, and about twenty yards down the lane, or more than twenty, I saw the prisoner at the bar with the linen on his shoulder, and I knew one of the patterns, because it was the right side outward, and I followed him; the constable has them.</p>
               <p>A CONSTABLE sworn.</p>
               <p>This gentleman sent for me to take the prisoner into custody, and these things were hanging on the banisters when I went into the warehouse; they were delivered to me at the house.</p>
               <p>Sculthorp. I am certain they are my master's property; this one piece has been in the house more than a twelve month, they are worth about ten guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope I may be excused; I was in liquor.</p>

            . I rent a house in the parish of Hanworth. On the 1st of March I went out about three o'clock in the afternoon, and left nobody at home - I returned next day between six and seven o'clock in the evening; I had fastened the house up when I left, and when I returned I found the window broken all to pieces, and broken open; the back window was torn quite out, it was safe when I left home. I missed my shoes, a watch, and stockings, some bacon, and sugar - my breeches were not gone, but moved from where I had left them; the watch was worth 2 l., the shoes, 10 s., handkerchief, 5 s., waistcoat, 2 s., and breeches, 1 l. I have not recovered the property; the prisoner worked for me. Kendon gave me information.</p>

            . I am a piano-forte maker, and live at Hanworth. On the 2d of March I was at Twickenham, and went into Mrs. Scurr's, the pawnbroker's shop, and saw the prisoner there pawning a pair of breeches, a waistcoat, and a handkerchief, and heard him ask her to lend 10 s. on them; she could only lend 5 s.; he said he would take 5 s., that he was going down to the brewhouse, and would call as he returned - he left the articles there - he knew me. He called again, and Mrs. Scurr would not take them in, in consequence of what I told her; this was on Tuesday; he was apprehended next day. As I returned home I called on the constable, who lives next door to the prosecutor, and we found out in the evening that the house was broken open. Foothead was unloading his cart in the field - we called to him, and I told him what I had seen. I went into the house, and saw the clothes, which appeared to be the same I had seen him with at the pawnbroker's. When he was apprehended I saw a pair of shoes taken off his feet.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at Twickenham. On the 2d of March the prisoner brought a pair of breeches, a waistcoat, and a handkerchief to pawn - the waistcoat produced is what he brought, I am positive; I cannot swear to the breeches, but have every reason to belive them to be the same. I was going to lend him 5 s., but in consequence of what Kendon said when he called, I said I would not take them in; he had left them with me, and called in an hour - he took them away. I asked him his name; he said it was Collyer, and that he came from Hampton - I told him his name was not Collyer, but Beeks, and that he came from Hanwell; he said it was not, and took the things away. The prosecutor called, and shewed me the things next morning - I knew the waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to Twickenham. I went into a public-house, and a man there asked if there was a pawnbroker's near, and asked me to pawn the breeches - he pulled his waistcoat off his back, and gave it to me with them, and told me to pawn them in the name of Collyer, for 15 s.; she would only give 5 s. - I said I would call as I returned, and then she would not take them in, and asked what name I was to pawn them in; I said Collyer - she said that was not my name - that I came from Hanwell; I said I did not. I took them to the man, and went away.</p>

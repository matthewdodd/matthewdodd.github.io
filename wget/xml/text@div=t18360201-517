On the 7th of January, between four and five o'clock, the pri<lb></lb>soner came and called for a pint of porter—she warmed it, and called for a quartern of gin—she gave half the beer to a man—she then came and took this glass, and put it on the table, she moved the pots that were on the table, and then I saw the glass was missing—she was going—I said, "Where is the glass?"—she said she did not know—I said, "I expect you have got it, put it down"—she took it out of her bundle, and put it down on the counter.</p>

I looked about, I saw this youth, and another boy about ten or twelve yards distance; the prisoner looked back and threw the hankerchief from him; I immediately took the hankerchief up, followed the prisoner, seized him, and brought him back. This is the handkerchief; I have had it ever since; it has no mark on it; it corresponds, in appearance, with the handkerchief I lost.</p>

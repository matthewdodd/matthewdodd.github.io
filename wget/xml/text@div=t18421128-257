                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael George Drewitt, and live at No. 100, Waterloo-road, Lambeth. I first knew the prisoner by the name of Rosetta White—I was present at the parish church at Clapham when she was married to Robert Daughters, my husband's cousin—I had attended the church the Sunday before, and heard them asked—Daughters was a single man, and was a carman, working in Tower-street—he had lodged in the parish of Clapham some time before—I only saw the prisoner about four times before she was married—the first time was about a month before—I think Mr. Murray was the clergyman that married them—I went and got the certificate from the church after they were married—the clerk gave it me—I examined it with the register at the parish church—I saw it written from the book—I saw them once afterwards at their door, in Kent-street, but did not go in—I saw Robert Daughters alive yesterday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am parish clerk of the district church of St. Peter's, Walworth. I produce a copy of the register of marriage—I was present at the prisoner's marriage—she gave orders for the banns to be put up—I think I saw her twice or thrice on the subject—I made the extract from the register, and examined it—it is a true copy—(<hi rend="italic">The extract stated that William Highwood, batchelor, and Rachael Smith, spinster, were married on the 11th July,</hi> 1841, <hi rend="italic">by George Anslie, minister, in presence of H. Dove and W. S. Turner.</hi>)</p>

               <p>Yes, I believe he is not here—I do not recollect all the young women that come to be married—the prisoner made her mark—I thought there was some<lb></lb>thing rather particular in her appearance when she came to put up the banns—I have been thirty-eight years in the neighbourhood, and she has been a great many years about the neighbourhood, and I have seen her many times—I knew her by sight, but not by name—I am quite sure she is the person—I did not know the man she was married to—he signed his name "High<lb></lb>wood," and was married in that name—whether his name was Highwood or not I do not know—I have not got the original book here in which he signed his name—I have a distinct recollection of his telling me that his name was Highwood—I invariably ask the parties their names, and how they spell them.</p>

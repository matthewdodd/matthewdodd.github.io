Partridge's—about Feb. 1843, I took two or three pieces of mousseline-de-laine—forty-six yards altogether—I gave them to Henry Anscomb—I did not tell him where I got them from—he came to meet me at the General Post-office—he came to the corner of Foster-lane, which is exactly opposite my master's premises—he came by ap<lb></lb>pointment—I gave him the dresses, and he took them away—I met him at the corner of Foster-lane, walked to the Post-office with him, and gave them to him at the side of the Post-office—that is about twenty yards from the house—not within sight of it, but round the corner—in Dec.

On Saturday, the 21st of January, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I missed the savoys out of my garden - they were safe about dusk the evening before - and were worth about 30s.; I saw some marks of a wooden-leg, and I suspected the prisoner - I took an officer, and searched his house; we found five of the savoys - I then went to the turnpike, and asked the man there about them; the prisoner was brought to the office, and there I charged him with taking them; he said he had bought them from a cart, but did not say where.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the house and found the five savoys - I went into the garden, and saw the mark of a wooden-leg; I met the prisoner on the Monday - he said he was coming to give himself up, about these savoys, but he was not guilty; I told him about the print of the wooden leg - and he said, more men had wooden-leg besides him; when I found these savoys at his house, he said he had bought sixpenny-worth of a man in the road, and had sold five of them to the turnpike-gate man; the wooden-leg mark in the garden was of the left leg, and so is the prisoner's; he said he had been to see for in work on the night they were taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in bed on this night, as my mother swore before the Magistrate; there are three men in the parish who have left wooden-legs.</p>

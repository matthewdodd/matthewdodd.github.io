                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 98). On Wednesday night, 5th Dec., about half-past 7 or a quarter to 8 o'clock, I was on duty at Bromley-street, Poplar New Town, and saw the prisoner in a marine store shop—I looked through the doorway, and then went in, and asked the marine store dealer what the prisoner had brought in—he produced 25 lbs. of lead, melted in this manner—there were six of these pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked the prisoner his name—he said, "Robert Dickenson"—I asked him how he got it—he said that his master, Mr. Heather, gave him a portion of old lead pipe as a privilege for coming to the City for some new pipe—I told the Magistrate that he gave the name of Robert Dickenson, and so did the marine store dealer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder. The prisoner was in my employ as a bricklayer, at Canning Town, near Barking, putting up some brick work for some new cottages—8 or 9 lbs. of lead were left in a house nearly finished—I saw it safe seven or eight days before the police-man called—it was in the back room of one of the houses, and I think it was in a cupboard, but am not certain—I gave the prisoner no old pipe, this was a new piece, which the plumber had cut off and left—I gave the prisoner no lead whatever—he was not entitled to any as a privilege for going into the City—I paid his railway fare—he did a little job, and I allowed him so much more for doing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was not I taken bad with rheumatic fever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and you got a plasterer to work for you, and a bricklayer also for two or three days—you were not bad two or three months this time—you did part of the work yourself—you had the key of the buildings sometimes—I saw the lead there after the plasterer and bricklayer were gone—you took some pipe up to town, to exchange—that was new pipe—I thought it was not strong enough, and ten feet were sent down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. That is what I took in exchange; the ten feet are laid down in the ground now, and I can find them; you did not pay me 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; here is the book (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>); is not that your writing) <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Yes, but I paid your railway fare, 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there and back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you pay him anything for taking it to the City? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did a little job afterwards, and his time was included in that—this is the book that was kept between us, but some little jobs were not put into it—here is some odd work here, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was made up with other jobs, something equivalent to the time it took him—I do not claim all this lead; mine was in the shape of piping.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. This man who I had to work for me left me this lead, which was in his tool basket; my master told me on Wednesday that I was to go and get a plasterer, and I went and said to my landlord, "I am to sell this for old lead;" he went with me, and the first shop I came to I sold it; my master did not pay me a half penny, only my railway fare; the reason I have no witnesses is because my master owes me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I could not get the money.</p>

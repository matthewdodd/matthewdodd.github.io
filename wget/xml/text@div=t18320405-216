               <p>COURT. Q. When did the prisoner cease to reside in Charlotte-street? A. As near as I can say, about the beginning of November, 1829.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Did you remain with him till he left that place? A. I did; I never saw him there after Mr. Dodson came - I remained there; I do not know exactly how long Dodson might have been in the house when the name was removed - I cannot say whether it was there at all after Dodson came; the prisoner had no shop - there was a surgery where we made up medicines for patients, which were entered to them in the day-book, and then posted into the ledger; the bills were made out, and some of them, I think, were paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did persons come to the house to buy drugs? A. A person named Sherman, a surgeon, once ordered medicines at our house, which he had made up for him; they were entered in the day-book to him - he lived in the house with the prisoner the latter part of the time, but not at that time; he was in the habit of coming occasionally - he visited some of the prisoner's patients, and gave directions during his absence.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it before or after he came there, that he ordered medicines for his own patients? A. I think it was while Mr. Holtom lived in the house; sherman then lived in Park-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. While you were there, did anybody come to buy any thing? A. I never sold any thing, nor do I know of any thing being sold to person who came.</p>

            . I am a widow, and lived in Lower John-street, Commercial-road. A person, who went by the name of Captain Mitchell, took apartments at my house the latter end of 1829; the prisoner used to visit him, and when he first came to my house, he (the prisoner) left his name as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050095"></xptr>Captain Miller - Mitchell left my house at two o'clock one Sunday afternoon, to go to France, and left a paper, signed"Captain Hall;" I never spoke to the prisoner about it - the prisoner always answered to the name of Miller; I am certain of the prisoner's person - he had not mustachios when he visited at my house; he used to wear a blue frock coat - he (the prisoner)had a quantity of boxes at my house; I saw him open one case - it contained horse harness; there was a hamper of medicine - he took the medicine out of it, and put it into a wooden box; I heard him say he had a phaeton, which he wanted to place at the George, half-way-house, Commercial-road - the week before Mitchell left my house, a van of property was brought there, and a backney-coach came on the Saturday-night; the prisoner told me he was going to France, in the steam packet, with Mitchell and his wife, who he called Mrs. Miller - Mitchell left my house in a backney-coach, the very same morning as the prisoner left; Mitchell used to carry pistols in his pocket - I never saw the prisoner with any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you fix the date of his leaving on Sunday morning? A. I am sure it was the latter end of November, 1829.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. You cannot recollect whether it was on the 22nd? A. I cannot - the prisoner did not bring the van of goods.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the box he opened come in the van? A. Yes; he told me it was medicine - there were bottles and jars.</p>

            . I am a solicitor - Mr. Dodson was a client of mine. In October, 1829, in consequence of an advertisement, I saw the prisoner, and entered into a negociation with him for the purchase of his business as a surgeon and apothecary, in Charlotte-street, Portland-place; the purchase was completed - Mr. Dodson was a young man; the prisoner was to remain in the house for three weeks after the purchase - I believe that part of the arrangement was inserted in the written agreement, which I have not got; I saw him at the house on the Monday after the treaty was completed, which was on Saturday - (I have ceased to be Mr. Dodson's solicitor, and have given up all the papers;) this was on the 16th of November - the prisoner's name remained on the door for three or four weeks after that; it was taken down some time after the docket was struck - I only saw him in the house two days after the treaty was completed; I was present at a conversation between Dodson and the prisoner that day; Mr. Dodson asked him when he would pay him the 118l. which he owed him - he said he had got nothing but bankers' bills, but that he was going into the City the next morning, and would either pay Mr. Dodson, or call at my house and leave it with me - at this time the prisoner wore more the habit of a quaker than any thing else; he was not like a captain - I never saw him after that Monday; I struck a docket against him on the 24th of December - we endeavoured to arrest him first, but could not; immediately we found he had gone abroad we struck the docket - that was our reason for striking it; I am not aware that the debt of 118l. had any reference to the negociation about the business; he had told me on the 3rd of November that the debt he owed Dodson should be paid on the completion of the business - the amount was then mentioned as 118l.; it had then been agreed that Dodson should have the business, for which 700l. in all was to be paid - Dodson's mother was to pay for the business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. The debt the prisoner acknowledged he owed Dodson was 118l.? A. I believe it was - I understood so from Dodson and from the bankrupt; I am not aware that Dodson and the prisoner were acquainted previous to my answering the advertisement - I think I first saw them together in September - I think it was after I had written to the prisoner respecting this purchase; Dodson was not above twenty-two or twenty-three years old.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was to be given for the business? A. I do not know - several arrangements were made, and alterations; Holtom first asked 400l. for the business and lease, but an alteration was made and a valuation, and the sum actually paid was 700l., including fixtures, wine, and furniture - I cannot tell the particular items; they were all classed together - I believe I wrote Mrs. Dodson one or two letters; I know Mr. Dodson was living respectably, and believe he was able to lend 118l. - I am attesting witness to the agreement; it was not stamped - (Looking at four letters) these are my handwriting; I was present when Mr. Camphell, a friend of Mrs. Dodson's, paid the 700l., on behalf of Messrs. Postlethwaite, her bankers, on Saturday, the 14th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, do not you know that the difference between the first agreement and the second was just 118l? A. Not that I am aware of; I never knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the second agreement was a fraudulent one, made for the purpose of deceiving Mrs. Dodson, to get the 118l.; and that it was 118l. more than the real purchase-money? A. I do not; I never knew it from Dodson or any body; there was a different arrangement made, and I was informed by both parties, that the sum to be inserted in the deed was 700l.; and, to the best of my knowledge, that was the bona fide sum for the purchase; Mr. Dodson went up to take possession of the business on Saturday, the 14th: the prisoner was to introduce him to his patients for three weeks at least.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was a verbal arrangement entered into as to the time Holtom was to remain on the premises after the valution? A. Certainly; he agreed to reside on the premises for three weeks from the 14th of November Mr. Dodson was merely to lodge with him during that time.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When the 700l. was paid to the prisoner, was any demand made on him for the 118l.? A. No; we were at Mr. Campbell's house in Friday-street, Cheapside; Mr. Campbell handed the money to Holtom, in Dodson's presence and in mine - I went to my office; I believe Dodson and the prisoner went to Charlotte-street together - the money was paid in bankers' acceptances, and on Monday the prisoner said he was going into the City next morning, and would leave the amount with me or pay Dodson.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. About three weeks or a month before the prisoner's final settlement with Mr. Dodson, he told me he was in difficulties, and was about selling his business, and wished to gain time with his creditors till he had sold it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050096"></xptr>Q. Did he ever make any request to you? A. He asked me to allow him to bring some boxes to my house, ashe was going to Van Dieman's Land; I agreed - some boxes and trunks came to my house in Aldermanbury; there might be a dozen boxes and one or two portmanteaus - on a Sunday afterwards he told me the business between him and Dodson had been settled on the Saturday; he wished the boxes to remain at my house - he gave no other reason than that my house was nearer the docks, and he had given up his premises; I know one Jordan was a creditor of his - I suspected the prisoner was about to leave the country, and at my request Jordan came to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A. Did you go to his house in Charlotte-street, after he told you the business was settled? A. Not to my recollection; the plate, with his name on it, was brought to my house very shortly before the prisoner went away; the last time I saw him was the Monday evening following the Saturday on which he said the business was settled - I believe he brought the plate himself; I know Mr. Dodson, but did not then.</p>

               <p>MR. CATLIN re-examined. I was present before the commissioners at the time of the adjudication; (the witness proved that the several commissioners qualified, &amp;c.); I attended the third meeting - the bankrupt did not surrender at any of the meetings; I attended till three o'clock, and heard him proclaimed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CALARKSON. Q. Was you Dodson's attorney when he made an affidavit of debt against the bankrupt? A. Certainly; I prepared all the proceedings, and became his attorney when he acted as assignee - he was removed afterwards; I did not appear for him in the Court of Chancery - he has since taken the benefit of the Insolvent Act; I opposed his discharge for his creditors, not on my own behalf - he was in my debt; I was his attorney till about eight months before he took the benefit of the Act - I never knew of there being two valuations made in this negociation; there were several arrangements - the original valuation of Mr. Close's was not altered that I am aware of; there was a different arrangement altogether after the valuation - I never heard that 118l. of the purchase money was to be repaid to Dodson; I believe there was some wine in the house - I am not aware, at this length of time, whether I ever told the prisoner on no account to mention to Dodson about the wine - (looking at a letter) this is in my writing - there was no secret transaction about the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever write to the prisoner, "Do not say a word to Dodson about the wine; I shall insert it in the agreement, and then inform him upon execution that I agreed to take it for him with the furniture?" A. If I have written that in the letter, I have; I am not aware how it could have arisen; (looking at the letter) if this be my writing I did write so; it is my writing - I am not aware what it relates to, or what may have been my motive, at this lapse of time - Dodson went over the stock; the only reason I can suppose is that Dodson must have objected to take the wine, it being a larger stock than he required; he was my client - I cannot say what quantity of wine there was; there was a very large quantity I know - I can give no reason for writing this, except that he would very likely object to take so large a stock - (letter read).</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR, - I hasten to enclose you a letter I have received from my client, Mr. Dodson, by which you will perceive he will be here to settle the business on Monday or Tuesday; as soon as he arrives my clerk shall come and inform you what hour he will wait on you to look over the books, and satisfy himself about the business - we will then return here, and enter into the agreement. - Do not say a word to Dodson about the wine; I shall insert it in the agreement, and then inform him, on execution, that I agreed to take it for him with the furniture. - You know I am perfectly satisfied about the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have any honest reason for writing that? A. Holtom made it part of the arrangement that the wine should be taken; I had no opportunity of seeing Dodson, and presume I wrote the letter to state I would agree to take the wine, and insert it in the agreement and get Mr. Dodson's consent to take it - his consent was obtained before the agreement was signed.</p>
               <p>COURT Q. Then why did you wish the prisoner not to tell him about it? A. Because I would explain it to him- I did not mean to entrap him; if he objected I would take it all myself, and I did - he objected to take so much- I said I would take the rest at a valuation; no regular quantity was inserted in the agreement.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, "You know I am perfectly satisfied about the business, and you score the letter I?" A. I was satisfied myself about the purchase of the business, and it was subject to the approval of Mr. Dodson; this letter is my writing - (read.)</p>
               <p>To R. Holtom, Esq.</p>
               <p>October 28th., 1820.</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR, - I have seen Mr. Postlethwaite, who has been here, and will have the money ready; I have given him a letter of introduction to you - he will call; recollect the purchase-money 400l., valuation of fixtures 27ll. 10s., medicines 28l. 10s. - do not let him see your agreement: he has seen the one signed by you; I enclose you a note I have this instant received from Dodson, by which he fears Postlethwaite will write to Mrs. Dodson before the business is closed, but if you tell him you must have the business closed to-morrow, it will be done; do not let this letter be seen - tell Postlethwaite you must have the agreement completed to-morrow, in consequence of the illness of your wife.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, on your oath, was his wife ill at that time? A. I am sure I cannot tell; if I have written that, I believe she was ill, but I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by "Do not let Postlethwaite see your agreement?" A. Because I presumed Dodson had made a different arrangement with him than the first agreement alluded to - a paper was signed by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. We have no evidence of the petitioning creditor's debt but this witness; if the Court think his evidence is doubtful, I will withdraw from the prosecution.</p>

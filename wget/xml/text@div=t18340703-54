               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You never lost sight of him; what became of the property? A. That he knows best about; I cannot tell - he was before me - he was taken within half a minute of the robbery - I turned round on him instantly - it was a brilliant pin - it was more than half a minute before he was taken - it was half a minute before I turned round on him - he was taken in a minute or a minute and a half - I turned round and called "Stop thief" - I never lost sight of him - it was very near four o'clock in the afternoon - it is a considerable thoroughfare - I am a <rs id="t18340703-54-viclabel295" type="occupation">watch manufacturer</rs>

            , the pastry-cook, being ill - the prisoner was taken between there and Finch-lane - he did not keep on one side of the way - I crossed to follow him - I could not stop him - I cannot tell who did - I charged him with robbing me - he denied it, and permitted himself to be searched.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you undertake to say the prisoner was the person who actually snatched the pin from your breast? A. Yes; I turned round, and in about a minute and a half he was taken, and I was certain he was the person - I had never lost sight of him - I did not pursue him more than half a minute or a minute - he might have run a hundred yards, and had an opportunity of dropping the pin.</p>

            . I am a servant, and live in the Curtain-road. I was crossing from Angel's, the pastry-cook's, and saw the prisoner come directly from the gentleman, who called, "Stop thief" - I ran after him, and kept close to him till he was taken into custody - he was three or four yards from Mr. Hart, when I first saw him - he was coming directly from him - as soon as I ran, several others ran- the prisoner dodged us among the coaches, and was stopped - I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you on the same side of the way or the other? A. I was in the act of crossing the street on the same side of the way - I said, before the magistrate, that I was crossing in the opposite direction - I ran faster than the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Dolling. No; about a fortnight and two days after he was taken up; I was coming to London, I happened to see him going to work at Westburn-green, that is about two miles or more from Wilsden; he had a fork and a rake, going to haymaking; there were two or three more fellow-servants with me, we took the prisoner up, he offered to run away; I fetched him back, he offered to return my money again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before that charged him with robbing you?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070004"></xptr>Dolling. Yes, he pulled some money out of his pocket, and said he would give me what I lost, but did not mention any sum.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think he might offer you that rather than be carried to prison?</p>
               <p>Dolling. I cannot say as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Consider this man's life depends upon your evidence, can you swear this man was one that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Dolling. To the best of my knowledge he was one.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Dolling. He had the same clothes he has now, the other was a lustier man than he a considerable deal; he offered to send for a man, he called him his partner, to give evidence where he was at the time of the robbery; the woman would not go, we offered to let him go, and we would go with him; then he would not go, and said he had no partner belonged to him; he said he was either at the Spotted Dog at Westburn-green, or the Red Lion; we gave him liberty to go to either of the places, but he would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you enquired whether he was at either of these houses?</p>
               <p>Dolling. No, I have not; he said he lay in Mr. Godfrey's barn that night along with one Clarey his partner.</p>

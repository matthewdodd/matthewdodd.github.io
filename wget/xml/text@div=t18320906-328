            . I am clerk at the Leith and Berwick-wharf. I examined the cask when the prisoner brought it; I found the tin which covers the samplehole had been partly removed - I had the cask weighed, and it was 9 cwt. 2 qrs. 10 lbs.; I had no weight delivered to me but the import weight on the cask, and supposing that to be correct, the deficiency would be 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 15 lbs., including the weight of the cask, which might be 20 lbs. or more - I took a sample of sugar from the cask, and compared it at the Thames Police-office, with that found in the bag - they corresponded and I believe it was of the same bulk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was brown sugar, I suppose? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a delivery foreman at the West India-docks. I delivered the cask on the 11th of August into Mr. Kerrison's waggon; it was about three o'clock - not to the prisoner, but to another carman; the weight at which it came into the dock was 11 cwt. 25 lbs., and I delivered it at 11 cwt. 20 lbs., a deficiency of 5 lbs, for drainage - I was close to the man who weighed it - I saw it weighed again at the Leith and Berwick-wharf, and it weighed 9 cwt. 2qrs. 10 lbs., which was a deficiency of 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 10 lbs., or 178 lb.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whether any sugar was taken from the cask before the prisoner had it, you cannot tell? A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BOWLES. I live in Bedford-street. I brought the tierce from the dock to Leman-street, Goodman's-fields; it was then unbroken, and there was no sugar in a bag in the cart - the prisoner took it from me at Leman-street, to go to the Leith and Berwick-wharf,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you remain with it while the waggon was in the street? A. I took out my horses, went away; and the prisoner came; it was then about five o'clock in the evening.</p>

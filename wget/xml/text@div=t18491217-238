                  </hi>. I keep a baker's shop, at 102, Golden-lane. On Saturday, 8th Dec, about ten o'clock at night, I heard a noise in my bed-room on the first-floor, as I was in the parlour under it—I went up-stairs, and the kitchen door was slammed in my face—I went on the leads, which are in a line with the kitchen, and found a lot of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packets of coppers on the wall—I had had 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of such packets—I got them off the wall, and went to see for the thief—I found a pair of shoes by the side of the wall—I had lost my watch and the other articles stated—they have not been found.</p>

I went with my brother-officer and took the prisoner—he had no shoes on—I asked him how long he had had no shoes—he said for some time—we found that these shoes fitted him—he denied all knowledge of them; but in the way to the station he said they were his shoes; that he had seen a young man who had asked him if he wanted to earn a few halfpence, and he went down the passage; that the other man handed him out some coppers, and during that time he slipped and the other told him to pull his shoes off, and he did, and some of it fell, and the other said, "<hi rend="italic">Hook it"</hi>, and he ran off.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner had been sometime living with me. On the morning of the 7th of April, about one o'clock, I was sitting by the fire, warming some broth—there were two plates, a dish, and two knives and forks on the table for supper—the prisoner was in bed—I heard footsteps coming up stairs, and said, "Is that you, Ann?"—she said "Yes"—I said I had heard that <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Baker's ship was coming home—I cannot say whether the prisoner was awake, or heard it, but he sat up in bed, and said, "Are you coming to bed?"—I said, "Not yet, I have got to go down for something"—he then got out of bed, locked the door, came to the fire-place, and struck me a blow on the left eye, which swelled directly—I stood up to go out, and be took one of the knives off the table, and struck me over the eye<lb></lb>brow with it—I became senseless, and the next thing I recollect, was his putting me into bed—I said, "You have cut me"—he said, "No, lay still, or I will make you"—I laid still for some time, and then fell asleep—when I awoke it was day-light—I got up, and the knife laid on the table—I said, "This is the knife you cut me with"—he said, "No"—I opened the window, and called a policeman, but he said I must go to the station, and while I was speaking to him, the prisoner went out of the room—I went to the station, and returned with a policeman—he was then at home, and was secured—I do not know what became of the knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Palmer, of York-street, West<lb></lb>minster. On Friday evening, the 25th of Nov., I saw the prisoner with the deceased—I never saw either of them before—they were not quite opposite my door—the prisoner was supporting her on the right side, and a woman on the left—the woman appeared very much intoxicated—when she came opposite to my door she fell in nearly a sitting position, and when she fell I saw the prisoner kick her—I think it was a little above the right knee—he kicked her very violently, but only once—she laid there for a second or so—he lifted her up, and immediately afterwards threw her on the pavement—she fell on the left side—her head went on the pavement, and there was blood on the place where she fell—I did not particularly observe her head—after a few mi<lb></lb>nutes he raised her and threw her down again, but not so violently—when he kicked her she said, "Oh, you good for nothing wretch"—he picked her up after the last time she was down, and carried her across the road—she ap<lb></lb>peared quite senseless then—the prisoner appeared sober, but I did not take particular notice of him.</p>

I was called out by my wife on the 25th of Nov., and saw a woman laying on the pavement—the prisoner and a female were by her—when I had been out about a minute, I saw the prisoner lift her off the pavement, and put her nearly on her legs—she did not appear able to stand—when he found she could not stand he threw her from him—he tried first to set her on her legs—he took her up again, she could not stand, and he threw her down a second time in my presence not so violently—the back part of her, head struck on the curb-stone on the first fall, and I saw blood where her head laid—after throwing her from him the second time he took her up, and carried her away in his arms—I did not see the first fall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an undertaker. On the 21st of Nov., I was at work for Mr. Bangham, York-street, Westminster, and saw the prisoner with a woman leading a drunken woman along between them—they Came next door to Palmer's, and I taw him let the drunken woman down, apparently by accident—he then raised her, and wanted to persuade her to go home—he let her down again, I thought not by accident, and when she was down kicked her—I remonstrated with him for his cruelty, and told him to put her aside so that a policeman might take care of her—he told me to go to hell, it was no business of mine—I saw him take her up again, and push her from him—she fell rather on her right side—her head went on the flag stones—he pushed' her from him—it appeared more the back part of her head struck the ground than the side—I saw blood from the back of her head apparently, on the stones—it was raining very hard at the time—he afterwards took her up, and carried her away—he had said, "Why don't you get up?—I should say she was too drunk to get up—she appeared very obstinate indeed, in the first instance, in not keeping her legs—I will say I only saw him push her once—I do not say the second time that he pushed her intentionally, but at the time he kicked her he let her fall, not pushing her from him—he dropped her twice, and once pushed her from him—I did not see her fall after her head fell on the flags.</p>

                  </hi>. I knew the prisoner and the deceased—she went by the name of Ellen Derrick—they lived in Gardener's-lane, York-street—on the Saturday morning, at half-past seven o'clock, the prisoner came to my room, and asked me to come with him to see this woman—he called her his wife—he said she had got very drunk the day before; that he had carried her home, laid her down on the bed, and she had not awoke since—I went with him to Smith's-rents, York-street, and found her on the bed on her back, snoring very hard indeed—I live about three minutes' walk from them—I wiped her mouth—it appeared nothing but slobber which comes from persons' mouths when tipsy—I told him to go for a doctor—he said, "Where to?"—I said, "Go for Dr. Davis"—he went out immediately—while he was gone a little thick stuff came from her nose and mouth—there appeared blood in it—I threw the window up—I sent another woman for the prisoner, and imme<lb></lb>diately after, Derrick died—the prisoner returned, said he had been for Dr. Davis, but he was very ill, and could not come—he went back again, and fetched him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Prince's-court, Storey's-gate. I received an order from the Coroner to examine the body of Ellen Derrick—I made the examination on Monday afternoon, the 28th—there was a very slight bruise on her right knee—a fall, striking the knee against any bard substance, would produce it—the body was in a healthy state—there was a severe contusion on the left side of the head, at the back—I opened the head—there was no fracture—within the skull was a quantity of extravasated blood on the brain, corresponding with the external contusion—it was caused by a rupture of the vessels pro<lb></lb>duced by the injury received on the head—the brain itself was in a healthy state—there was effusion of blood on other parts, from the same cause—in my opinion her death was caused by the extravasated blood from the ruptured vessels of the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The bruise on the knee had nothing to do with her death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—she was rather a heavy woman, and of full habit—being intoxicated, the vessels would be gorged with blood, and be more likely to rup<lb></lb>ture, and the fall would be greater—I believe the prisoner requested a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, before the Coroner ordered it.</p>

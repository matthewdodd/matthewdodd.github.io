                  </hi>. I am in the service of Rowland Mitchell, of Baker-street. The prisoner was in the habit of calling from Mrs. Hofferman for the dirty linen, and occasionally brought it home—she called on Monday, the 4th of October, when a three weeks' bill was due, and said she called to request payment for the washing—I said, if she would tell her mistress to call I would pay her—she said Mrs. Hofferman was ill and unable to attend—I then paid her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she wrote "paid" in the book— she said her mistress had requested her to put "paid" in the book—I parted with the money, believing her mistress had sent her for it.</p>

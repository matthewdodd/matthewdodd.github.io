               <p>Lawrance. He was taken up on suspicionand be confessed the taking them before justice Withers: he owned he took all the things mentioned in the indictment, except one piece, which he said was not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the goods again ?</p>
               <p>Lawrance. Yes, he was stopped at Shoreditch, and put into the watch-house: he had the things all upon him then.</p>

            . I was constable of the night : the watchman went home with some people, and as he was returning, he light of this man at the bar, and brought him into the watch-house to me; he had a sack with the things in it on his shoulder: (the sack and irons were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor; and the constable deposed they were found upon the prisoner.)</p>

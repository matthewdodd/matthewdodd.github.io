                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-constable</hi>, R 300). On 23d June last, I was on duty in plain clothes, in London-street, Greenwich—I saw the prisoner Monroe first handle a coat at a pawnbroker's shop—I saw Lee and Brown about 600 yards ahead, near the baths and washhouses—I watched them—they turned round Circus-street—Monroe then walked with Brown—they stopped a lady—I saw Brown put her hand into the lady's pocket—I went and spoke to her—I then followed the prisoners until I met a constable in uniform—I seized two, and pointed out Monroe, and told the officer to take him into custody—I had Lee in one hand and Brown in the other, and one of them threw the purse into a public-house.</p>

I am a widow, living at 5, Cambridge-place, Greenwich—on 23d June, was walking along Circus-street—Monroe spoke to me—the female was with him—he asked me if I could direct him to the packet—I said it was some distance, and directed him—they then left me, and turned round again and said, 'o Is there not a train somewhere?"—I said, "Yes;" and if they liked to walk by my side I was going near there, and would point it out—they went a short distance, and then he said, "I think we will go by the packet;" and went away—the constable then spoke to me, and I said, "I fancy I have lost my purse"—I am almost sure there was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but I said 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. fearing to make a mistake—there were also two postage-stamps.</p>

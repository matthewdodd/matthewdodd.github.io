I am ten years old, and sell baked <hi rend="italic">taters</hi> at a stall by the Orange public-house—about four Saturdays ago, at a few minutes after 9 o'clock at night, the prisoners came to my stall; Haseman asked me for a pennyworth of potatoes, and gave me a half-crown—I said I had not got change, and one of them, I cannot say which, took it away from me—Scanlan then gave me a shilling—I gave her 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in half-pence, and three <hi rend="italic">taters</hi>, and they left—I showed the shilling to a lady who is here—she went after the prisoners, and they were brought back.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a barrow near the Orange public-house, and near this lad—about four Saturdays ago, about half-past 9 at night, I saw the prisoners go up to the lad's stall—the tall one asked for a pennyworth of potatoes—he gave them to her, and she gave him a half-crown—he turned round to ask me to change it for him, and she said, "Never mind I will give you a shilling"—the short one gave him a shilling; he gave her eleven penny<lb></lb>pieces change, and they went away—the boy handed the shilling to me—I bit a piece out of it; it was soft—I followed, overtook them twenty or thirty yards off, and asked them if they were aware they had given the little boy a bad shilling—they said they did not know it was bad—they both spoke at once; they gave me the 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., back, and the three potatoes, but in the confusion I cannot exactly tell which had the potatoes—they said that they would give me a b—punch in the eye, and then they said, "<hi rend="italic">Sling</hi>"—I did not then know what that meant—a policeman brought them back, and the child's father gave them in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. At the time in question I was residing at No. 128, High-street, Whitechapel. On the night of 20th Jan., I had been to the Haymarket theatre—I was returning from there, and about 1 o'clock got into Somerset-street, Whitechapel—on my way, I had been into the Turk's Head public house, to have a glass of ale, and there I met the prisoners; that was the first I saw of them—the prisoners followed me out, and walked with me—there was another woman with them, I cannot say whether there were more—I had not spoken to them in the public house—I cannot say how far I had got before anything happened, I suppose it was about five or six minutes after leaving the public house—one of them then snatched off my victorine, and the other my cloak, and passed it to another woman, and I was struck and knocked down by one of them—I called out, and a young woman came up, and then a policeman—the prisoners ran away, they were brought back by the policeman in five minutes or more, and I identified them—I have no doubt they are two of the women.</p>

               <p>was on a visit in London; I do not work here—I had been in London six weeks—I went to the Haymarket theatre alone; it was about 12 o'clock when I came out—the Turk's Head is some distance from the Haymarket; I went alone from the Haymarket to the Turk's Head, it was getting on for 1 o'clock when I got there—I am twenty-one years of age; I went into the public house by myself—I had a glass of ale—I had had something to drink before that, in the Haymarket, at a house close to the theatre; I went in there with a young man—I did not know him, I had a glass of gin there—I do not know what became of the young man after that, he left me to go home alone—I do not know how I came to go into a public house with a strange young man, I saw him in the theatre, I was in the pit—I did not go into any other house till I got to the Turk's Head—I was walking along the pavement when the prisoners interfered with me—the gin had taken a little effect upon me, but I knew what I was doing, or else I could not identify the prisoners—they followed me, came up to me, and took hold of me, and were walking by the side of me—they were laughing and talking, I do not know whether they talked to me, I did not pay any particular attention to them; they were the worse for liquor—I knew what I was about after they knocked me down; if I was stupid before, that made me sensible—I did not say anything when they took off my things, they only snatched them off—there are houses there on each side of the way, and gas lamps, but it is rather a lonely place late in the evening; and they did it when they saw that there was no one by—I called out for help—Lee took the victorine, and Phillips the cloak, and it was passed to the other woman; she was shorter than the prisoners—the witness came up in a minute or two after I called out, and the pri<lb></lb>soners ran away—I was standing up when the things were taken from me, not lying on my back—I did fall on my back, and that enabled me to look up and see them well—they did not knock me down till after the things were taken—I then saw their faces, they were quite close to me—I had never been to the theatre before that night, I come from Colchester—I had never seen the women before—they were at the side of me—the first thing that happened was a blow from behind, in the middle of my back; I then fell on my back, and then they pulled off my cloak and victorine—I was knocked down first, I had forgotten the evidence I gave last time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single; lama servant out of place. On the morning of 21st Jan., about 1 o'clock, I was coming down Somerset-street, and saw four women making a noise; I stopped and looked on—the two prisoners and another had got hold of the prosecutrix by the arms, they stopped her, and Lee pulled off the victorine, and Phillips the cape—the prosecutrix insisted upon their not taking the things off, and they gave her a blow, and knocked her down, and crossed over to the other side of the road—I went and picked up the prosecutrix, she was not able to get up—while I went to look for an officer the prisoners ran away—I had never seen them before—I saw them brought back by the officer—they are the two women.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of 1, Royal Naval Road, New Cross—I have also a dwellinghouse at 6, John's Terrace, Milton Court Road, Deptford—Mr. Everlin is my ground landlord—in July last, Bond came to me with reference to taking that house—he told me he had come from the country, and gave me a reference to Norfolk—he said that he was a farmer, and had had a fire in the country and lost 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of seeds, and he was not insured there—I entered into this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to let him that house—I saw him sign it; it is dated 1st August, 1866—that is the date on which he signed it—it is for letting for three years at 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he had been about the house some time previously—I went down to Ramsgate, and he took possession within a week—I told him before I accepted him as a tenant, that I should require him to insure the plate glass in the shop window, and after he had taken possession he came to my shop and asked me several questions, and, among others, if I could recommend him to a respectable insurance office where he could insure his furniture—I told him I had an agent who did my business, and I would write to him if he liked—he said that he should be much obliged if I would—I did so, and the agent took the trouble to come from Chelsea to see him, but he was absent—the house in question is a corner house, one face is to Milton Court Road, and the other to Alexandra Street—the principal door of the shop is at the angle, but the private entrance is in Alexandra Street—the shop window looks into Milton Court Road, and one shop window looks into Alexandra Street—immediately behind the shop is a parlour with a window looking into Alexandra Street, and behind that are the outer buildings with a passage between them—the private door in Alexandra Street leads into a passage which is beyond the parlour; there is no fireplace, or flue, or gas in the shop, and there was no gas in the street at the time of the fire—one night, about 12.30, I was called up—I went to the house and saw a lot of boxes in one corner of the room, some were open, but most of them were closed—I saw some of them opened—I shortly afterwards went over the house with Mr. Liddiard, the surveyor, and the fireman in possession called my attention to the boxes—they contained bits of charred material like silk or lace—Bond was with me, and the surveyor, for a minute or two—the surveyor asked him how the fire happened—he said that he did not know—that was a few days after the fire—the surveyor asked him who he left in the house—he said that he left a friend of his to take care of it—Bond asked him if he was sober—he said that he believed so, but he said, "It is true I left him a pint of gin;" that was all the answer he made—as we were looking over the premises we saw a sack of shavings with a name on it at the foot of the kitchen stairs, the cellar stairs—that was two or three days after the fire.</p>

"or something like that—they did not seem to endeavour to raise any alarm, so I thought I must, and ran off in my shirt sleeves to fetch assistance—I woman said, "Cannot you save that box? the fire is not at the back"—I got assistance, and saw the fire got under—when I came back there was a box in my garden—I was informed that Bond afterwards fetched it—he had his clothing on and his hat, and the girl had on a bonnet and a walking dress.</p>

"and she turned round to the man and said, "There is that box the fire has not got to it yet"—the man then went towards the side door and fetched a box—I think he must have fetched it down stairs, because I heard a noise, as if somebody was dragging a box down the, stairs—I said "Put it here" and he put it in our garden—either he or the girl gave me</p>

               <p>a black satin skirt, which I afterwards saw Mrs. Bond wearing; it was trimmed with velvet, and I remembered it again—there was no one to own the box, and it was taken inside our house, and remained there three or four days, till Mr. Bond came for it, and I gave to him—the man I saw in the road with the girl was a dark man—Nye is the man, to the best of my recollection—he had his hat on, and the female had a black bonnet on I think—they were fully dressed.</p>

I am a fireman at Rotherhithe station—on 28th August, from 2 to 2.30, I was put in possession of the house 6, John's Terrace, by Hamlin—I examined the place, but can form no idea of where the fire originated—I took care so long as I was in charge that nobody interfered—I gave charge to Trimmings—Bond came at about 6 o'clock on the morning of the fire, while I was still in possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the Rotherhithe station—I went down to the premises where the fire was, and was placed in charge by Dayman—my opinion is that the fire originated in the part of the shop facing Milton Court Road, under the bench where the instruments were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and surveyor, and live at Hackney—at the end of last August, a person named Hayho came to me, and in consequence of his communication I went to Bond's house in Milton Court Road—I looked over the premises with a view of surveying on his behalf, and talked to him about the machines in the shop; they were goffering, quilling, and other machines—he answered my questions; I was not fully acquainted with them, and asked him for what purpose they were used; he said he did not know—I said, "They are a sort of thing I am not acquainted with; what are they used for?" more especially in the spoilt state they were—he said, "They are quilling and goffering machines"—I said. "I</p>

               <p>shall not be able to make your claim out on this, unless you give me some information; where did you buy them?"—he said, "I do not know"—I said, "Can you show me a quilling machine from a goffering machine?"—he said,"No"—I said, "I cannot make out the claim, I must call in some assistance from the trade," and he referred me to Mr. Hayho, who knew the value of the goods and their purpose, as he had been in the line, and was a friend of his—I said that the fire was quite a trifling affair to what I had been led to believe; I expected I was called to a very extensive fire; he said it would have been a very good fire both for me and him, as far as my fees went and his case went, if he had not been led away, and made a d—fool of himself, by not being allowed to pursue his own course, or have his own road over the business—I asked him how that was—he said, "I have been led to pursue the course I have by the party who provided the goods; had it been left to me, had I done the job myself instead of trusting it to a fool, I should have left a door and a win<lb></lb>dow or two open to give it a good draught, I would have had it down"—I said, "Practice makes perfect; the second will be better, I suppose"—he said, "Oh! by G—this is the third"—I surveyed the house and sent the claim to Mr. Perry—I never saw Bond afterwards.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you mean that the second time he set fire to a house he would do it more neatly, when you said, "Practice makes perfect?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I meant that—I never saw Mr. Perry on that case, I had met him years before—I have known him over twenty years, and I saw him when I sent the claim in—that was after this conversation took place—I did not give the claim to Bond, I sent it by post or by hand to the insurance office—this is my claim (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Bond was before the Magistrate in May; it was a few weeks ago—I was not examined, but I saw the solicitor to the insurance company, who made some memo<lb></lb>randums from my evidence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell him all the truth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am on my oath—don't tell me about all the truth; I have taken an obligation here; I was sent for on Saturday night, a message was left at my house, that I was wanted at John's Place concerning a fire; I did not arrive at home till three o'clock on Saturday morning, after an arduous day's work, I was up at seven, and by ten o'clock T was in Greenwich Police-court, and there was a memorandum taken at the moment of my evidence, without re<lb></lb>ference</p>

               <p>to my boots; it was from memory: that was the only notice I had of it, and that is all I can remember—I knew nothing about who wanted me—I did not make a memorandum of the conversation between me and Bond, or any entry of it on paper—I did think it strange that a man who employed me to value goods for a fire company should make a confession of arson to me; they do not always do it—I hare been employed by many people to value goods, but recently I have retired from it rather; I have other business to attend to; I have done largely in it, and have communicated with many insurance offices.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 8, Bed Lion Street, Clerkenwell—in September or October last I became acquainted with a person named Hayho, and shortly afterwards went to his office, 10, Baaing-hall Street, where I made the acquaintance of the prisoner Nye—Hayho introduced him to me—I met Hayho and Nye at my house the same night;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100122"></xptr>
               <p>they spoke about the fire, and several other fires—Nye has told me that he keeps a general shop, and sells beer and all sorts, in Bromley—they spoke about a fire at Bond's, but I did not know Bond, and did not pay particular attention—Hayho said that it was a bad job, and asked Nye how he thought it would end—this was some time in October, about three weeks from the time I first saw Hayho, and before I was introduced to Bond—the conversation was chiefly about my being put into business—they conversed about fires—I do not recollect the particulars, but they made a jest of it, and seemed to be merry, and said that the money was coming—I after<lb></lb>wards met Nye and Bond at my house, not Hayho—I went down to Bromley with Hayho to see Nye, and saw him there—I went there to complain of Hayho not putting me into business as he said—they were taking some refreshment together, and Nye said, "I think she is a good one, and will go through it," meaning me; and Nye said he wished he had got a little money; he had got plenty of stock in his shop to go into two or three places—I was to meet Nye next morning at the Bow station to go with him to search for a house; I promised to do so, and Hayho said in Nye's presence that I was to state myself to be a crinoline manufacturer—I promised to meet him next morning, and did so—Nye was there; he he said we were not to walk together, he would walk first, or I would walk first; we were going to Stratford New Town, and we must not be seen together, for he had had a fire there six months before, and it would not do for him to be seen with me—we came to a house where there was a card in the window, "A house to let"—we made inquiries, and it belonged to Dr. Sweeting—I went to him and came back and spoke to Nye—I told him that I had taken the house, and inquired the terms, and all was satisfactory, and Dr. Sweeting would like a reference—I said, "It is a good house"—he said, "Yes, it is in the corner and could not stand better," the house was at Stratford New Town, by Bromley—after some further conversation concerning fires, which I cannot recollect, Nye asked me if I had ever been to the Surrey Theatre; I said, "No"—he said he should want me to go there some windy night, when the house we had taken would soon come down—he said, "Choose a windy night, old girl"—I said, "Then I suppose you mean to have a fire here?"—he said,' "I suppose Hayho has told you all about it"—I said, "He has not;" he has given me to understand that I was to have some machines there and to put a card in the window, and style myself a crinoline manufacturer, but I was not aware that a fire was to take place"—on passing the Phoenix Office, Nye said, "There, girl, there is the office where you will have to go and insure"—I took the house, but did not take possession—I did not go there—I had not been introduced to Bond at that time—there was a conversation in Nye's presence about a fire in Nye's house before I was introduced to Bond, but I did not feel interested in it, and did not bear it in my mind—on the second day after that Nye brought Bond to my house, 2, Napier Street, Deptford, and intro<lb></lb>duced him as Mr. Bond, the man who had had a fire in Milton Court Road, Deptford—Nye said he had been to Bond's, and there was not sufficient furniture there, as Hayho had represented, to go to this house which I had taken in Stratford New Town—I afterwards had conversations with Nye and Bond almost daily about Bond's fire—after we were at Stratford I went to see Mrs. Bond, and she supposed that I was really going to take the house to set fire to it—Bond and Nye inquired of each other what they thought of it, whether it was a bad job; and Bond inquired whether he</p>

               <p>must keep quiet—Nye said that he must, for he thought he had better not come forward—nothing was said about the insurance—they also said that Mr. Perry had some suspicions about the machinery, and did not feel satisfied about paying them—I met them on different occasions at my house, and Nye told me that he had set fire to Bond's house, and that Bond had employed him, and that he was going to give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he said that all had been prepared by Hayho, it was one of Hayho's messes; he had spoiled the thing—Nye said that he knew all about it, it had been arranged between them, and that Bond went to a coffee-shop by the Monument to sleep the night, and that he was to be at Bond's house to set the place alight, and was to go to the coffee-shop next morning—he mentioned the girl, and I wanted to know who she was—I had not seen, her then—he said that all preparations were made, and they had a bottle of gin and enjoyed themselves, and that after Bond left, he went into the shop and set light to it—I asked him what girl he meant, but I do not recollect his answer—he told me that a girl was in the house that night with him, that Bond had supplied a bottle of gin, and the bottle was left on the floor—I asked him how the girl came to be with him, and whether her parents were willing—he said they had known him some years, and would trust the girl anywhere with him; she had been out with him before—Bond was not there then—I went afterwards to his house and he to mine—he said he first went into the shop and set alight to that, and that there were machines there, but I cannot tell you the conversation—when Bond was present on another occasion Nye said he did not know how he should manage him—he wished him to go to Bromley—Bond said, "Oh! you must go into the country, the same as I did"—he said that him and Mrs. Bond were sup<lb></lb>posed to go into the country, but they went and slept at a coffee-shop at London Bridge, near the Monument—Bond said that Nye was there for the purpose of setting the fire off, and that the morning after the fire Nye came to the coffee-shop where he was sleeping; I understood him to say about half-past six in the morning, and told him that the fire had ccurred—Bond said that Nye had not done it to his liking, and Nye said he would do it better next time—the lace was shown to me—the first night I saw Mrs. Bond, a Sunday night; she showed me all the pieces of lace and a piece of silk—everything was said to be sent there by a man named Hayho, but they would have nothing more to do with him, when they got over this they would have a job by themselves somewhere—the lace was spoken of in Bond's presence up stairs—pieces of silk were Binged, and singed in large folds, but it had not been burnt altogether, and I said, "How re<lb></lb>markable!"—they said I was to have some pieces of lace to make up for bonnets—the lace was slightly marked—they said it came from Hayho's, and had been singed in another fire—I asked them where the lace was, and they said, down in the shop—I saw Bond and Nye continually, and had several conversations with them about the fire—Bond said that Mr. Perry should tell him they would not pay until the man who slept in the house the night of the fire was brought forward—Nye was there when he said that—on one occasion Nye, Bond, and I went down to Bromley together to meet Hayho; at least I went with Hayho, and Nye and Bond met us there—we came across a fireman named Jones in a public-house, but I did not hear the conversation between them—we were all inside—I do not recollect going out until we all left together—Jones left first—he had drunk with us inside—we met him outside—Hayho or Nye asked him in—I think Hayho—nothing passed particularly about the fire—the inter<lb></lb>view</p>

               <p>at my house on Saturday was after the visit to Bromley—Mr. and Mrs. Bond and Nye were present—it was Jones said Mr. Perry had refused to pay till the man was brought forward—I believe that was at the latter end of September, and it was in October we went to Bromley—they said the office would not pay, and they did not know what they should do—Bond said that as they seemed to want to see the man who slept in the house, would it not be better for Nye to go forward, and it was arranged that he should go on the Monday morning to the office—he was to meet Bond <hi rend="italic">promiscuously</hi> on London Bridge—Nye said it would be better for him to shave off his moustache—when the arrangement was made for him to go Nye said, "D—it, old boy, I must not go as Nye, I shall go as Noble"—he did not say why he should take that name—he said that I was to go to 1, Victory Street, Dockhead, to represent myself as Mrs. Carrow, should any one come from the office to inquire—Nye and Bond had arranged to meet each other on London Bridge in sight of a police constable, and to take notice of his number, and bring the constable forward, that it should look like business—it was arranged that Nye was to say at the office, if they asked him, that he was a single man, living on his means at Victory Place, Dockhead, and that sometimees he was at home and sometimes out; that he bought and sold again, and was sometimes away for weeks together, and that he was the man who slept in the house on the night of the fire, and that, owing to some words and blows between him and Bond, he had disappeared, and kept out of the way, because Bond had <hi rend="italic">rascallied</hi> him like a pickpocket, and that he was not aware when he went to the office that Bond was insured; otherwise he should have come forward before—I went on the Saturday with Bond and Nye to 1, Victory Place, and saw, Mr. and Mrs. Carroll and their daughter Mary; and Bond told me then that Mary Carroll was the girl who was at the fire—Nye was not present then—I went to Victory Place, Dockhead, on the Monday, but nobody came from the insurance office—I saw Nye again about the middle of the day (Bond was not there)—he said that he had been to the office, and he inquired if anybody had been from the office, and asked me and Mrs. Carroll if we saw any difference in him—we said, "No"—he said, "Cannot you see that my moustache is taken off?"—he said he had been to the office and represented himself as Mr. Noble, and he thought the office was now satisfied and the money would be paid in a few days, and he wished he had gone forward before; that they asked him what his occupation was, and he said he bought and sold, and was sometimes out and sometimes at home; that he was single and had lived there upwards of two years, and he left his address, 1, Victory Place, Dockhead, if they wanted anything further—he is not single; he is married—I went home to my house that day, and Mrs. Bond was there; Bond came in in the evening, but not Nye—they said that they were glad Nye had gone forward, and they thought all would be right in a few days—I saw Bond and Nye again the next week—Nye told me the office had paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe they had notice of when the office was going to pay; Nye came in, and Bond went home—Nye said that Bond had got 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was a small sum, and he regretted it was not more, and he should not ask him for anything, and he thought all parties ought to keep quiet till some<lb></lb>thing fresh turned up—I only saw them once or twice, I think, after that—I have not always gone by the same name; my proper name is Freer, but I go by the name of Cousins—I have since this, and before I gave information, several times applied for money to Nye, but have received</p>

COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many other names hare you gone by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two, Cousins and Hutchins—I was Mrs. Cousins; there was no Mr. Cousins—I am a dressmaker, at 2, Napier Street—I have lived there in apartments over twelve months, and by myself all the time—I carry on the dressmaking trade there, and nothing else—I live on the pay that I have from the dressmaking trade, and from the support that I have from the father of my little boy—I was never mar<lb></lb>ried—my child is with me—I said that I lived alone; you would not count my child as one—I have known Bond since about October—the first time I ever saw him he as good as told me that he had set fire to the place—it surprised me rather—I have never been engaged in any of these sort of things—I thought it was a very wrong thing—I did not give information to the police—I knew they were trying to get money from the London insurance office—I did not go to the insurance office—I took the house at Stratford New Town of Dr. Sweeting, in the name of Mrs. Hutchins, in October—there was no agreement—I saw him twice—I was to pay weekly—I have not seen Dr. Sweeting here to-day—letters passed between me and him—I did not know when I took the house of him that I was to have it burned down; I swear that—I thought I was to take it to carry on the trade of a crinoline manufacturer—crinolines have not quite gone out, but the trade is not so good as it was—Hayho is not here—I do not know that he still carries on business in Basinghall Street—he was going to supply the stuff to make the crinolines—I had never made any before, but I was to go there and make them without previous experience; I had been used to dressmaking, and have made plenty of crinolines for myself and other people, but I have never done it in any trade—Bond was to find the furniture for the house, and let me live in it—I was not to pay him anything for it—I got to know afterwards that it was to be set fire to; I heard that on the way to Hayho's office, two or three days after I had taken the house—I thought it very strange; of course I knew that it was very wicked and very wrong—I did not tell the police: I agreed to it—I should not have consented that the house should be burnt down, but I did agree to it—if the things had been put in, then I would not have allowed it to be burned down; I would have given information to the police or to somebody; and I should have kept the machines and the furniture—they have deceived me very much indeed—I befriended Bond when he had nothing to eat or to drink—I asked them to lend me money, and they refused—I threatened that if they did not give me money I would expose them to the uttermost, and said that I was going to a situation in Clerken<lb></lb>well, as housekeeper, and that I had "not done with that other beauty"—that was Hayho, he is the biggest beauty or the biggest rogue—I also wrote, "Not hearing from you in reply to my appeal to you, I beg to state that to-morrow I will surely go to Mr. Buzzey, and tell him everything I know respecting you and Bond, wrecking you all in the most foul of d—dissipation"—I suppose that was a slip of the pen—I have no knowledge of writing, "I made them a fair offer to lend me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I would pay them like a brick, and I would not say it unless I was bent upon what I say I am"—I do not recollect writing, "The office will look after me; nobody studies me after all this"—I have some recollection of part of that letter, but not the other</p>

               <p>—my memory is not bad—if it is there I will willingly admit it—I do not remember about the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote, "I have been grossly deceived by you all; there is this Mrs. Bond, a paltry sinner, has caused a great dis<lb></lb>turbance with my friends at my house"—she had insulted my friends, and I did not like her—I did not complain that Mr. Bond was strutting about with a gold watch—there are some expressions I recollect and some I do not—it was Mr. Nye who was strutting about with a gold watch—I do not know whether the girl Cowell is here—I saw her some time in May—she was at Victoria Place then—Bond often saw me—I was never at Stratford New Town except on two occasions—he visited me at 2, Napier Street—Mrs. Brice was my landlady there—she is not here that I am aware of—I occupied two rooms on the ground floor, and a Mr. and Mrs. Smith lived up stairs, besides the landlady—they are not here that I am aware of—Nye came six or seven times, and Bond almost daily, because Mrs. Bond was there—he generally came in the after-part of the day—when I could not get any money I told my master, Mr. Smith—he is not here—I told him soon after I left—I left on 11th February—I was applying for money about that time—Mr. Smith is an invalid, but when he is well he is foreman to Mr. Bracebridge—he is a respectable man—I told him in February a great deal of what I knew of this transaction—the first time I gave information to Mr. Buzzey was some time in March, and also in October, November, December, January, and February—that was because I could not get the money—I will not swear that I told Buzzey for any other reason than because I could not get the money—I knew the fire was to come off at Bromley, and I was determined if I exposed myself to expose them—if they had paid me the money my conscience would not have been satisfied, because I never intended the fire to come off—if I had had the money I should have given information—it had been a secret a long time—I wanted money and I threatened them—if they had given me money I would have told all the same, but I did not want them to give me money, my conscience was awakened from the first, when we went to Stratford—I went to Mr. Buzzey on the second occasion and did not tell, because I considered Hayho's wife and children, and I could not tell; I felt for him—that was really part of the reason, and Mrs. Bond told me that Nye was keeping her—I did not feel jealous of this girl, because she was living with her parents—I should have exposed them, but I took a long time.</p>

               <p>the first time I knew Nye was in October, and Bond the same month—I was not very intimate with Bond: I was intimate with Nye—it is not very likely that I am the girl that slept in the house that was burnt, or else I should not appear here—I have seen the girl since—I was lodging at 2, Napier Street, Deptford, in October—it is a private lodging—I was a dress<lb></lb>maker there—Hayho came there several times; I cannot say how many—he first visited me about a month from the time I first saw him, and a fort<lb></lb>night or three weeks before I first knew Nye—I first met Hayho at New Cross Station, and after that he came to visit me three or four times—he brought Nye with him, and Nye brought Bond—no one was in the habit of visiting me—I cannot say how many did actually see me; I was not without friends, no more than other people—I do not think any<lb></lb>body but Hayho was present at the conversation between Nye, Bond, and myself in October—I understand that Hayho is at 10, Basinghall Street—no one introduced Buzzey to me—I did not meet him at a station, I lived within five minutes' walk of him—I wrote these letters to Nye during the time I knew them—I cannot say that I received visits exactly—it was only Bond coming with Nye and Hayho—I do not think they ever came all three together—when Hayho came he was generally alone—I do not remember the three ever being together at my place—I do not know whether there is anybody here from the house where I lodged—I was in the habit of asking Nye for money before I wrote to him—he left 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the mantelpiece on one occasion, and he gave my little boy something—I have asked him to lend me money, and said that he could have anything that I had in my possession till he had the money back again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the West Ham and Stratford Fire Brigade—on an afternoon in September last, in passing down the Stratford Bridge Road, Stratford, I met Nye, the last witness, a small man, and Hayho—I saw them together, and went into a public-house with them; I had a glass of ale with them. (<hi rend="italic">This evidence being objected to as referring to matter subsequent to the fire in question, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLES</hi>, referring to a case decided by himself said he would not receive evi<lb></lb>dence relating to subsequent fires; he would admit evidence of previous fires occurring in houses occupied by either of the prisoners, not with a view of going into the character of those fires, but merely for the purpose of excluding the notion of accident in the present case.</hi>) In the year 1866 I was called to a fire in Chatsworth Road, Forest Grate—I have the report I sent in next morning; it was in January or February—it was about a quarter to eight on a Sunday morning when I received a message and was called to the fire; it was at a chandler's shop—I saw the prisoner Nye there after I got the fire out—I learnt from him that he was the owner of the house; his wife was there in the back parlour—Nye told me he was going to make a claim on the Home and Colonial office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assessor of losses by fire to the London Assur<lb></lb>ance Company, and live in Blomfield Street, Finsbury—I remember the fire occurring in Milton Court Road—on 28th August I went to inspect the premises—I saw some goffering machines and winding machines in the shop—they were incomplete, not in working order, apart from the injury by the fire—I saw sixty burnt cardboard boxes in the back parlour; also a deal box about three feet long and twenty wide, full of cuttings of various sorts, burnt; nothing perfect, all pieces—the box itself was not burnt—in the basement I saw two sacks of shavings, one partly emptied out and strewed about under the stairs—on 1st September I received a claim from Mr. Rumsey with respect to the premises—this is it—it is for 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were insured for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Rumsey called with the claim, but I never went into any settlement with him—I told him, from what I had seen, that I was not satisfied with the appearance of the place, and he said he would not be answerable for the claim, he merely left it with me; I did not see him after that; he did not come by way of getting a settlement or anything of the sort—on 11th September I made inquiry among the firemen; I made inquiry where the machines had come from—I went down to the house on the morning of the fire—I did not see Bond that morning; I saw Mrs. Bond, and Bond called on me the following morning—I asked him the cause of the fire; he could not tell me anything about it—he told me he had slept at a coffee-house in Fish Street Hill that evening with his wife, intending to go to Norfolk next morning, and that he had placed a person in charge of the house while he was away—I asked him to produce the person—he said he could not find him; he had not seen him since he had come to inform him about the fire in the morning—he called several times afterwards, and never could produce Noble, which was the name he gave—on 15th October he called, and I told him that he would not get his money without producing Noble—in November he brought Nye, and introduced him as the man who was on the premises on the night of the fire—I asked him if he could account for it—he said he could not—I asked if he was in bed at the time of the fire—he said, yes, he went to bed about ten o'clock, and was awoke about one in the morning by the fire—I asked if he was alone in the house—he hesitated at first, but afterwards admitted that he had a young woman there to sleep with him—I asked him what he was—he said a commission agent—he also told me the same tale about Bond going to Norfolk, leaving him in charge of the house, and that he went to Bond next morning to let him know of the fire—Bond told me that the reason he had not brought him before was that they had had a quarrel, and that he met him accidentally on London Bridge and had brought him on to me—Nye was present when Bond said this—Nye gave an address somewhere in Dockhead; I don't think it was written down; our clerk can tell you; he was present on pretty nearly all the occasions; to the best of my memory it was on 9th November that Bond and Noble called—I think the money was ultimately paid in De<lb></lb>cember—this is the receipt—it is dated 9th November—it is for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the cheque, with Bond's endorsement—it was paid to him—it is dated 9th November; the manager paid him—I asked Bond if he had not had a fire at Greenwich; he said, "No"—he told me he had had two fires in Norfolk, but he was uninsured.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Davey and Fur<lb></lb>nival, tobacconists, of Whitechapel, and am agent to the London and Liverpool Insurance Company—on 5th March, 1866, Nye came to me—I did not know him previously—he said he wished to insure his place; he had seen Mr. Davey on the previous Sunday—I said I was an agent for the London and Liverpool, and he could not do better than insure in that—he said he wished to insure at once, if I liked, he would a deposit at once; he did so—he insured for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one house, in the name of Tho<lb></lb>mas Nye, 4, St. Leonard Street, High Street, Bromley by Bow, and paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit—I gave him a deposit receipt, of which these are copies—he also effected an insurance upon another house for his brother-in-law, named Alexander Ashford, for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of 38, St. James Street, Green Street, Bethnal Green, and paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit upon that—I saw him again the day after—I saw him first looking in at the door—he came in and said a very unfortunate circumstance occurred last night, there had been a fire at his brother-in-law's—I said, "Why, you don't mean to say at the house you insured yesterday?"—he said, "Yes"—that was 38, St. James Street, Bethnal Green—I subsequently wrote and informed him that the pro<lb></lb>posals were not entertained—I paid him back one deposit, on his own insurance, he would not take the other—no claim was made through me; I never saw him afterwards.</p>

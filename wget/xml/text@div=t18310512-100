               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long before you missed your watch had you seen it? A. I could not see it in my pocket, but I know it was there - I am nearly eighty years of age, but I have not lost my senses yet- I did not feel the watch go, but I felt the jerk, and the bolt he made gave me suspicion - I said, "My watch is gone;" he did it dextrously; I had seen it a quarter or half an hour before - I was going up the gateway, and he tried to place himself in the way, that I should not go in the doorway; there was no push till the horses came up, then he pushed, and took my watch, but he used no violence.</p>

            . I was at the Bull inn, Aldgate - I went to the hackney-coach door, let the steps down, and took out the prosecutor's luggage; a coach was coming down the yard, and the prisoner took the prosecutor's watch out of his pocket; he ran off, and very nearly pushed me down - I did not pursue him, but staid with the luggage; I did not see the prisoner stopped, but I will take my oath he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On which side of the coach was the pastrycook's door? A. On the right side, and I was on the same side; I did not say the coach was between me and the prisoner; I said I was at the door, and the coach was coming down the yard - the prosecutor gave me the care of his luggage; the stage-coach was coming out of the yard as the hackney-coach stopped - the stage was between me and the prisoner; I saw him in custody in about ten minutes - I did not see any strange man come up with the watch, and say to the prosecutor, "Here is your watch - that man is innocent;" I swear it did not pass.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was coming from Petticoat-lane to Aldgate church, and heard a cry of Stop thief! the prisoner came right up to my face- he was running, and turned short into Black Horse-yard - I pursued, and took him in the gateway; a small struggle ensued, and he stooped to throw something down, but I could not see what - a great crowd collected; I pushed him into Mr. Manning's shop - the prosecutor came, and said, "Have you got my watch?" I said, "No, I saw him drop something, but I don't know what;" I begged a gertleman to go and look, telling him where I had seen something dropped - one of the persons brought in the watch, and the prosecutor owned it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know who brought it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120057"></xptr>back? A. No, it was a gentleman whom I begged to go and see what the prisoner had put down - I swear he did not say, "Here is the watch - that young man knows nothing of it;" I begged the gentleman to go round the corner and look for the watch, but I do not know where he did go - when I heard the alarm no one was running before the prisoner - some persons were pursuing him; I did not state before the Magistrate that I saw him running with others - I was not running; he faced me - I do not think I stated he was running with others; if I did I did not speak the truth - I really do not think I did say so.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am entirely innocent - I never saw the gentleman nor the watch.</p>

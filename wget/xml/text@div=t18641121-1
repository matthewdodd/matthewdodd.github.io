               <p>him with a sheet of note-paper—I did so—it was the common note-paper used in the office—I asked him if he required an envelope—he said, "No"—he did not write on the paper, but folded it up, put it in his pocket, and retired—I believe the paper on which the order is written to be the same sheet, it is exactly similar to the paper which was then in use—I have seen the prisoner write many times, and believe the order to be his writing—I have seen him write the signature of Major. Richards, so that I could scarcely know it—I know Major Richards' writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived with the prisoner at Mrs. Jones's, Owen's-court—we passed as Mr. and Mrs. Lane—we afterwards removed to Remmington-street, I cannot remember the date—on 30th or 31st August I bought a silk jacket at Mr. Smith's, a draper, of Middle-row, Holborn, for a guinea—I got this invoice at the time—I paid with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which a gentleman gave me; you all know what I am—the gentleman is not in Court to-day—I had it as a present—the prisoner did not give it me—I never saw him with anything more than gold and silver—he has always had gold and silver for the four years I have known him—he has never been without—I lived more than two years with him, and was living with him in Remmington-street up to the time he was taken—I showed him the jacket—he did not know that I was going to buy it till I brought it home—I can swear that the prisoner is not the person from whom I received the <hi rend="italic">£5.</hi> note—I do not know that he has a companion, a young man of 18, of fair complexion—I do not notice their complexions, and I do not know dark or fair—I did not see him with a man of fair complexion when I showed him the mantle: he was alone and nobody else saw it—he went out that day, it might be at</p>

               <p>ten, or four, or six; when he went out I used to go out. Mr. Wilson, whose name is on the back of this note, is the gentleman who gave it me I wrote his name—this is my writing. Mr. Wilson gave it me on the morning of the day I bought the jacket—I should not know him again, but he gave it me as a present, what for Mr. Funnell will explain—I met Mr. Wilson in Oxford-street, and was with him two hours—I cannot tell you where he lives—if I were a gentleman tomorrow I would not tell a lady where I lived on such an occasion—I have never been to the head-quarters of the corps—I did go to the private residence of Colonel Richards when my poor dear fellow lay on a bed of fever—I went for my office money, and he said that it was through being in public-houses, I said that it was false. I have also been to Mr. Laurie for my office money for cleaning the office—the prisoner was not in very bad circumstances up to July—I did go and ask for money, and say that lie was almost starving, that was when I had spent a great deal; through his being ill, I was rather low.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Were you very well acquainted with the Milne, family and Sergeant-major Hunt for several years. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I may have been in the company of most of the officers of the corps, I should not know any difference—in March, 1863, when you were very ill, I went to the office and asked Major Hunt for your policy of insurance which was about to expire—he would not give it to me, but one of the officers took it in hand and found it for me—Sergeant-major Hunt was not friendly to me, he was not on good terms even, there was a prejudice—one of the sergeants of the regiment wrote a character for me—the sergeants know me, but I will not know them—I have received two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes within the last three months. On 13th August I went to the Isle of Wight for two or three days—I did not tell you where I was going till I came home—a week afterwards I showed you a note with a number of names on it—I made the party who gave it to me put his name on it—he wrote something, I do not know what name it is—a week or two after we went to Remmington-street, a cab came to the door at 12 o'clock at night—two gentlemen belonging to me were in it—I was out and came up to the door just as they were going away—it was one of those gentlemen who gave me the latter 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, I went to the Isle of Wight with him.</p>

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean the note that you bought the jacket with. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that was bought with the note I received in Oxford-street, this one—this "Mr. Wilson" is my writing—the gentleman would not put his name on it, but told me to use his name, and I wrote his name down—this one with a number of names on it, is the one I received in the Isle of Wight—I changed that at Mr. Chapman's; I think the name is the Sportsman, in the City-road, opposite a china shop and next door to a church—the prisoner has not been in any employment this year—the prisoner is not to be liable for what I do; I am a lady, getting my living honestly and plenty of money if they will give it to me, and if they do not they will not have me.</p>

I am in the employment of Mr. Smith, draper, of Middle-row, Holborn—I could not swear to seeing the last witness at our shop on 30th or 31st August—this invoice is my writing—looking at that I can say that I sold a silk jacket to a young woman and gave that invoice—the price was 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in payment—I gave it to the young lady to put her address on it, and then gave it to Mr. Smith, who endorsed his name on it—this is the note—I saw the female write the name on the back.</p>

On 15th September I took the prisoner into custody, at 31, Remmington-street, City-road—he had a leather bag there—I asked him if the bag belonged to him—he said yes—I took these papers from a side pocket in the bag—I said "Are these yours?"—he said, "Yes, they are all mine"—there were a good many more than these—amongst them is a letter addressed to Corporal Law from Colonel Richards—I told him the charge—he said he knew nothing about it—I found 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on him—I also found in the same room another sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was claimed by Mary Ann Knight—I gave it up to her—I found this invoice of the jacket amongst the papers.</p>

            . On the 19th of March, being just come out of church, I saw the prisoner make several attempts at the prosecutor's pocket, and at last I saw him take his handkerchief out. I told the gentleman he had lost his handkerchief; he felt in his pocket, and said he had. I had the prisoner by the collar. He pulled it out of his bosom, and dropt it down. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) The prisoner confessed the fact, and begged mercy.</p>

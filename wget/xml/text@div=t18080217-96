            . Q. You live in Old Street-road and are a pawnbroker. - A. Yes. On the 10th of February, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my shop to pledge a linen shirt for five shillings; I looked at the shirt, it was of a very fine quality; she said she had pledged a shirt at my shop before, on the 27th of January, for five shillings, in the name of Ann Hall; I asked her whose they were; she said they were her husband's,

            , that he was a brewer's servant, and lived with Mr. Robert's, East Smithfield. I asked her if she made the shirts; she said she did; she bought the cloth in Bishopgate-street, and gave two shillings and sixpence or three shillings a yard for it; I asked her if she was quite sure that she made the shirts herself; she said it was her own work, she made them; she then said that they were not her making, that they were her husband's shirts before she knew him; that they were brought to her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170055"></xptr>by a young man, her husband's brother; in a few minutes I questioned her again, she then said she was not married at all, she was going to be married to Ned to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any thing with her. - A. A small bundle which I have here, containing two shirts of the same quality as the one she offered to pledge; I asked her what was the reason she brought three shirts and she meaned only to pawn one; she said she was going to take the other two to Mr. Francis's in Shoreditch; in consequence of that I sent for the officer and had her apprehended.</p>

A servant; I believe she left her place to be married to this young man's brother; she told me where she lived and took me to her apartments; I searched it, I found in a chest that she took a key out of her pocket and opened it, these shirts; it contained men's apparel; there might be women's apparel, I do not recollect any, there were a coat or two and breeches in the chest.

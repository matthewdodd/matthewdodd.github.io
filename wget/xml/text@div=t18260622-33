I fetched the watchman, who took him; there were a few keys and things found upon him; I had left my hat on a shelf, and my wife's bonnet was kept in a box on another shelf. The bag of linen has not been found. The property, including the linen, was worth 2l. 10s.</p>

            . I am the wife of James Lovell, and lodge at this house. I heard something falling down stairs at a quarter to two o'clock; I got out of bed, opened the window, and saw the prisoner go out at the street door, and turn the corner of the street with a bundle; I got into bed, and told my husband what I had seen. I heard nothing more till about three o'clock in the morning, when I heard a person go up stairs; the person in the next room desired my husband to get up; he went up stairs, and the prisoner was found locked in the top room. I went and called Haywood; at a quarter to two o'clock I had seen the prisoner go out, by the light of the gas, and am sure he is the man. When he was taken in the room he said if Haywood would let him go he should lose nothing by him; Haywood said he missed a bundle of linen - he said he had taken it, but would not tell where - the hat and bonnet were tied up in a handkerchief, on the ground.</p>

            . I am a beadle. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house about four o'clock in the morning; I searched him, and in his breast pocket I found eight keys, one of which was a latch-key, and opens Haywood's street door - and in his right-hand breeches pocket I found another key, which opens the back attic door, where the things are kept. I have seen them tried.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Who did you give the keys to? A. I put them on the constable of the night's table, but I took particular notice of them first, and observed the mark of a vice on the latch-key. Furzman opened the door with them in my presence. I am sure they are the same; this key has been forced.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I had been out to spend the evening at a friend's house; I did not leave there till near three o'clock, and it being too late to go to my lodging I walked about till near four, and came into St. Andrew-street, when I saw Mr. Haywood's street door open; a friend of mine lodged in the house, of the name of Williams, and I thought I would go up to him, and lay down for a few hours; I went up to the top, and then saw the back attic open also - I went in, and saw a bundle tied up and a pair of boots; I looked round, and saw a quantity of harness - I thought was Mr. Williams' work-shop, as I knew he was a plater of harness work; I then sat down on a trunk, and intended to stay in that room and not disturb him; and I believe I did put on the boots, but not with intent of robbery. I was much intoxicated at the time, or I should not have acted with that impropriety. I never had left the house from the first when I went up stairs - I did not open any door in Mr. Haywood's house, and had not intent to rob any one.</p>

            . There were no marks of violence on the outer door. Williams is a coach-plater, and lives on the second floor - the prisoner was found in the room above; Williams ran up with the rest of the people, and saw the prisoner - he said he thought his name was Clark - I did not hear him say any thing more. Williams has a key to let himself in; I cannot say this key is not his.</p>

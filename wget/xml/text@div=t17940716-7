               <p>Q. Where was the handkerchief at that time? - I got it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take it out of your pocket? - She locked the door, and I did not know for what; she then came into the room again, and snatched the handkerchief out of my hand, and ran out.</p>

            Was there any light in the room? - No, I could not tell where I was; she got a light in her hand when she came in the second time, and I was on the floor of the ground when she took the money from me; she went out, and I went after her into another woman's house.</p>
               <p>Q. After she had snatched the money out of your hand, in the handkerchief, where did she go? - That woman, Hannah Roper, and another woman along with her, came and took her out of doors; they catched her by the arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the house? - Yes, they were in the fore room, on the same floor. When she snatched the money out of my hand, she went in where these two other women were; I went to her there, and catched hold of her there, and catched hold of my handkerchief, and she had the money then in her hand; she had taken it out of the handkerchief; I found nothing in it but the half guinea, silver money, which tumbled on the ground; then that woman, Roper, and some other woman put her out of the house, and an old woman catched hold of me, and said, stop young man, you shall have your money.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't understand your taking your money out of your pocket and putting it into your handkerchief? - I think I could keep it faster in my handkerchief than in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of her afterwards? - I came into the street and called the watch, when he called ten o'clock, and I went back to that same house where I had been, and the door was locked, and I went and asked for the girl that had got my money, of the old woman that took me by the jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Mary Broke after this? Where did she go? - I don't know where she went; the officer found her, I don't know where; I did not get any of my money back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking? - Oh, no. I came from on board, and my captain he paid me my money at half past eight, and I went to Limehouse to pay two or three pounds for clothes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Burke. This man came to me quite in liquor, and I was rather in liquor myself; I was sitting at the door, and he came to me and asked me whether I would go to bed with him? I told him I would make the agreement, as it was late at night. I went with him backwards into the room, and he gave me four shillings out of his handkerchief; I gave the woman of the house one shilling for the bed; with that I went to bed with him, and I went to sleep; and I awaked, and he wanted to use me in a very violent manner indeed, which was inexpressible; and he said if I would not, he would kick me out of bed; accordingly he gave me a kick in the small of my back, and I got out of bed in my smock, saving your presence, my lord; and then he said he would have his money back; accordingly he got up and put on his clothes, and went away; and I went to bed in the same room; in the morning I got up and went towards Stepney, and I met him, and he said, for a b-dy whore, he would have his revenge on me. He has been seen by several solks sporting his money about; and he said he had lost six guineas before he came to me, and he was very groggy in liquor, and he wanted to use me very indecent.</p>

On the 10th of October, about eleven o'clock at night, I saw Chambers in the Commercial-road; I gave her some porter at a public-house, and accompained her home - she asked for gin; I gave her sixpence to fetch some, and while she was gone for it, I took my four half-crowns out of my pocket, and put them into my fob - she returned without any gin; we went to bed together - I told her I must go out by two o'clock in the morning, and to call me if I should fall asleep; I was awoke between two and three o'clock by the prisoner Horncastle pulling me by the arm- I had not seen him before; he said I should go out of the house, for I had no business there - I then missed my money, and said I would not go till it was returned; my trousers, which I had put under the bolster, were on the floor; I asked for the woman - he said there was no woman in the house, that I had no business there, and he would turn me out; he attempted to turn me out - we had an altercation in the passage; the door was opened to put me out, and the Policeman came in - he brought Chambers into the passage to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q.How far from your home did you meet her? A.About a quarter of a mile; she took me to a room one street from where I live- I wanted to be called at two o'clock, saying I had a cow to attend to that was ill, but I meant to go home; I am married, and have five children - I was a little in liquor; I was heavy to sleep, but had my recollection perfectly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not say at the public-house, "Come, mistress, give me my change, for it is my last shilling?" A. I do not recollect it - if I did say so, it was not the case.</p>

            . I was going along my beat, between two and three o'clock in the morning, and heard a loud talking - when I came to the door of this house I saw Horncastle, with a candlestick in one hand, endeavouring to get the prosecutor out; he said he had been robbed by a woman - Horncastle said there was no woman in the house; I searched the house, and found Chambers in the cellar, in her night clothes; she had no light, and said,"Oh, here you are;" she begged me not to take her, and she would do any thing in the world to make me a recompence - I took her to the prosecutor; she declared her innocence, but begged him not to press any thing against her - I found a sixpence and 15 1/2d. on her, and a half-crown and a sixpence on Horncastle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know her before? A. By seeing her in the street - I am given to understand the house is her own property, and believe it not to be a house of ill-fame; I did not know her as a prostitute - the prosecutor was tipsy.</p>

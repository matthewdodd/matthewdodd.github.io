I went up stairs, and pulled off my cloaths, in order to go to bed, and the woman at the bar came up, and took away the things, except my shirt and trowsers.

I said but little, fearing he would break my head: he bid me go along, and called me Black D - l.

            . I live in Rosemary-lane, about two hundred yards from the prisoner's house, which is up an alley, in Rag fair. The prosecutor is a Lascar; he came to my house that morning, without shoes or stockings, and told me he had been robbed, as he has now mentioned: I went with him to the prisoner's house, and took Mr. Cottrell along with us, he being a beadle, but neither the prisoner nor his wife were at home. We went to the public-houses to look for them, and was informed the man was at the Ship, in Well-street: we found him behind the bar, drinking a pint of purl; the prosecutor said he was the man. While we were talking with him, in came his wife; then the Lascar said, that is the woman: we took them away; but going along, they talked Irish together; so I took one, and Mr. Cottrell the other, to prevent their talking. We took them to the Justice in Whitechapel: before they were ready to examine them, the woman took this sash (which the Lascar calls his silk purse; it ties round him, and in which he ties up his money) she took it from under her arm, and was going to drop it, but a man took it out of her hand, and delivered it to me. (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) When before the Justice, I opened it, and there were in it Two Guineas, a Rupee, and one Firnam: the woman was searched, and in her pocket was found Thirteen Shillings and Four-pence Half-penny, and a white purse. (The purse produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

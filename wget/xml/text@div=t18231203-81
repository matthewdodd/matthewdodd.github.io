About a fortnight before this occurred, there was a party of people at the Bird-cage, public-house, jumping in sacks - my brother and his companions came there - the prisoners were there. George went to my brother, and took a sack which laid by his side and said it was his; my brother said it was not; there was a quarrel about it, and Fawcett said, " My George shall fight you for a leg of mutton and trimmings." One shilling was put down by each party to bind the fight - they were to stake the money on the Wednesday following to make up the mutton. My brother did not go on the Wednesday to put down his stake, and it was fixed for Saturday night - he did not go then, and on Sunday night George came to the public-house next door to where we live, and asked my brother if it was to be a fight or not? - He said he did not care, if anybody liked to put down the money for them. It was then to be a sovereign instead of the mutton. Five shillings were put down by my brother, I believe; and on the Monday they met at the Pitt's Head Yard, Lucas-street - my brother was there - the prisoners came down about two o'clock, and the rest of the money was put down. They began to fight in a <placeName id="t18231203-81-crimeloc435">field in Bow parish</placeName>

Pell and Webb were present, and Martin - he was second to George. Pell was my brother's second - they fought an hour and five minutes - I stood inside the ring most of the time. A constable came into the ring and interfered, but was driven out by Martin and Fawcett - a ring was formed by the people - my brother was knocked down, and could not come to time again. The seconds remained there all the time encouraging them. Martin ran after the officer, and said if he did not get out of the ring he would knock his b - y head off. My brother was laid on a table in the tea-ground - then taken into a room, where he laid about twenty minutes, and died. The seconds came to him there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your brother was taller and stronger than George - A. No; George was rather the tallest. I was not second or anything else - Lloyd endeavoured to persuade him to leave off, but he would not. I cannot say whether he wished to leave off or not - they were very good friends.</p>
               <p>Q. The fight was a trial of strength - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the dispute happened about the sacks, did not Fawcett say, "Tom, I'll have nothing to do with your fighting at all, and will not have you fight." - A. No; he encouraged it, and assisted by giving rum to Martin and George. Somebody gave my brother rum.</p>
               <p>JUROR. Q. In what respect did Fawcett resist the constable's authority - A. He ran after him with a stick in his hand, and said, "Go out of the ring, you have no business with it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDEROAST. Q.Were you at the Pitt's Head when the money was put down - A. Yes; Barnes and Collins were there - they did not endeavour to settle it without fighting. George said he did not want to fight, but his master wished him. When my brother entered the ring, he said, if he was beaten he would be carried out.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Bethnal-green-road. I was present at the fight - Fawcett was the instigation of it - Gibson is my fellow-servant - Fawcett is George's master - he was the first man who mentioned about fighting, for when George took up an empty sack, Gibson said it was his - he said it was not, and pulled it away. Fawcett said, "George shall fight you for a leg of mutton and trimmings." Fawcett attended the fight, and supplied them with lemons. The constable went into the ring twice, and desired them to leave off. Gibson said, "I think too much of my sovereign to leave off." Somebody hallooed out to put the constable out of the ring,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030040"></xptr>and the next time he went into the ring, Martin ran after him, and was going to hit him out of the ring, but he got away.

I left him, but returned, and told him, I thought George did not want to fight. He said, "Go along, you d - d old b - h." This was at ten or eleven o'clock in the morning.

Fawcett had a stick in his hand, and a lemon, and at times held the bottle - a man appeared to interfere, but I could not hear what he said. I got pushed about, and at last saw Gibson fall backward on his head. There was a round after that, and he then appeared quite senseless. About five or six rounds before the last, Gibson wished to leave off - I saw Fawcett and the rest of the seconds trying to make him fight again - he appeared trying to get off his second's knee - they seemed to try to keep him up, and make him go on again, and, about that time, the constable went into the ring.</p>

Fawcett had a stick in his hand at first, but Wilson took it from him; he uses a walking-stick. I did not see a lemon in his hand, or give any drink to the parties, but will not swear, that he did not. I heard Fawcett say, at his own house, that he would have nothing to do with it.</p>

            . I know both the prisoners. George, I, and another went to the Pitt's Head, with intention of shaking hands and making it up. Gibson called George out, and said it was no use for them to fight for mutton for others to eat, but they would fight for a sovereign, and then it would he put in the newspaper. I heard Gibson say, D - n his b - y eyes, he would never shew his face in Hackney again.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was he keeping the ring to prevent people breaking in - A. No; quite in a humble manner, walking about inactive. I cannot swear that he had not a lemon - I did not see it.</p>

            . I live in Bethnal-green-road. I was in front of the ring nearly all the time. Fawcett did not appear active - my attention was principally fixed on him, for they said he was master of one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Instead of looking at the combatants you looked at the master - A. I looked at them besides. Fawcett had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030041"></xptr>a stick in his hand at first, but a person took it away; that was half an hour before the battle ended - he used it as a walking stick. I did not see a lemon in his hand. He kept walking right round the circle.</p>

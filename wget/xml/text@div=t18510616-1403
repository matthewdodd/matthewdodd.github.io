                  </hi>. I live with my father, Ebenezer Cole, a news-paper-vendor. The prisoner was in his employ—it was his duty to receive weekly accounts, and put them down in a book when he came home, but not quarterly ones—I have not got his book here—it is kept lying in the office for him to write in it when he comes home—it is his duty to give the money he receives to me—I accused him of receiving the money; he said he had not had it—I took him down to Mr. Hodges, who recognised him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 167, Regent-street. The prisoner was foreman in my employ up to 23rd Sept., when he was discharged from my service—while he was in my service, he was in the habit of collecting money for me—he had no right to do so, and no authority from me to do so after he was discharged—I had a customer named Eastop; he owed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at that time—that has never been received by me—the prisoner had no right to go to Mr. Eastop for it.</p>

O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been a tailor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since 1851—the prisoner had been in business as a tailor—he had been shopman to Mr. Hayes—he had never been in business for himself to my knowledge—he first came to me in the beginning of March, 1851; he has been with me ever since, but he left me for six months to go to Mr. Hayes—I did not go to Mr. Hayes to get him back—I wrote to the prisoner to come back—that was on 19th April, 1852—since that he has been constant in my employ—the 23rd Sept. was on a Saturday; that was the day I discharged him—I did not give him a week's notice—I do not know whether that is usual in our business—I do not know that the prisoner claimed a week's notice, or a week's wages—I do not recollect that he claimed 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or a week's wages from me—he presented me with a bill bringing me in his debt 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not that bill; it is lost—he presented it to me on Monday, the 25th Sept.—I do not recollect that on that Monday he claimed 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my discharging him—I had given him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of goods on sale or return—he took a coat and trowsers out two or three days before I discharged him; that would leave me 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his debt—I did not give him in charge for obtaining those goods under false pretences, but for obtaining goods on my account to the amount of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at my woollen draper's; he was discharged from that, because they would not prosecute him—I gave him into custody three days after he was discharged—Mr. Eastop was a customer of mine—Mr. Bibb introduced him—I have seen him—I received an order from him in person yesterday—I do not recollect that I received an order from him in person before—I gave the prisoner in charge—I never came to any settlement with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What wages had the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Thirty shillings a week—the reason I did not give him any notice was, I sent him out a week before on my business, and he never came home all day—I called that neglecting my business—I forgave him that, and on the 22nd, in the evening, I asked him to make me out a bill of a customer that owed me 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185412180029"></xptr>
               <p>I intended to go to get that money the next morning, as I was in want of it, and after I left he spoke to my foreman, and in the morning when I came to the shop, I asked where Mr. Bibb was, and my foreman said he was gone to cash a cheque—he went before breakfast, and did not come home till 1 o'clock—it was in consequent of his being absent from business on the 23rd, that I discharged him—he had goods from me to the amount of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he is still in my debt that amount—I owed him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., not 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never received any order from Mr. Eastop till yesterday—a great many customers come, others write—the first tune I gave this man in charge, he obtained 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of cloth at one of my woollen drapers on my account; he was discharged, because the draper would not come forward; he would claim the money of me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an artist. On 26th Sept. the prisoner called on me in Gough-square; he said he had called for the account, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I owed to Mr. Enders—he had been in the habit of bringing me goods from Mr. Enders before, and received the money—I gave him but 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., because I was short of change—he gave me the receipt for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is it—he brought it ready receipted—I certainly would not have paid this money if I had known he had been discharged from the service.</p>

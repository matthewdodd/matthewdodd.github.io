                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Norris—on 13th June, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I had come up from Somersetshire, and got into an omnibus at the Great Western Railway Station—I had my little girl with me, and various parcels and flannels—I went to the further end of the omnibus, on the right hand side—my little girl Bat next to me on my left—my left hand was nearest to the door—a Mrs. Harding, a lady from Sydenham, came in—she came to the extreme end, and placed her bonnet-box on my parcels—the prisoner then came in—Taylor sat next to Mrs. Harding and opposite me—Easthope sat next to my little girl—the omnibus stopped at the Bank, and I took my purse from my pocket, took out a half-crown, and found I had only one small silver coin, either a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, two sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns, to the best of my knowledge—I replaced my purse in my pocket in my dress—Taylor then said to Easthope, "We will get out here, dear"—Easthope immediately got out, and Taylor pushed herself very violently against me—I remonstrated with her—I had a parcel in each hand, which rendered me powerless with respect to my pocket—I felt a distinct tug at my pocket—I said, "Don't push against me in that way, there is plenty of time"—it was as though a person was abstracting something—she passed out, and I immediately found I had been robbed—my purse was gone—I said some-thing to the conductor—the omnibus was stopped and I got out—the prisoners had then got across the road to the Mansion-house, and were together in conversation—I caught hold of them and said, "You have robbed me of my purse"—I think they both said that it was a mistake—two con-stables came up, and I gave them in charge—there was also in my purse, a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamp, a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. one, and a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. one.</p>

On 13th June, about 10 o'clock n the evening, I saw the prosecutrix at the Mansion-house, standing on the pavement holding the prisoners, one in each hand—I took Taylor, and Martin took Easthope—Taylor rather resisted—in going to the station, she said the lady in black had made a mistake—the inspector asked Taylor her name and address at the station—she said she would not give it till the lady arrived—she voluntarily gave the inspector her purse, and then gave her address—the inspector asked her what the purse contained—she said, "There is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one compartment, and some silver"—the inspector told her to be quite sure and mind what she said; and then she said, "There is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in one compartment, a sovereign and a half-sovereign in gold, some small silver in another compartment, and some postage stamps"—the purse was examined in my presence, and this list, which I made the same evening, is what it con-tained: a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the first compartment; in the second compartment a half-crown, two sixpences, and a threepenny piece; in the third compartment a sovereign and two half-sovereigns, a pencil-case, and some postage stamps—Easthorpe gave up 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, a pair of spectacles, and a knife—she gave her address—Taylor said that she had come from Ascot races—the conductor who was there said that there were no trains from there to Ascot, and that he did not believe she had come from Ascot—she said she had come direct from Ascot by the train—I asked Taylor whether she knew Easthope—she said, "Most preposterous!" or "Monstrous!" I do not know which it was—I said, "Do you really mean to say you do not know her?"she said, "No."</p>

               <p>This man had dressed your hair for some time, and you never suspected him? - I never suspected him; I suspected an innocent person.</p>

               <p>The prisoner at the bar has brought at different times five and twenty pair of shoes to me; I am sure as to the man. (The shoes produced and deposed to.) The last time he came with four pair, and I stopped him.</p>
               <p>How came you to take so many pair in of this man? - He had the appearance of a hair-dresser; and he said at first bringing of the shoes, that he dressed two gentlemen who were partners in a shoe-ware-house, and that they always paid him in goods, and that was how he came by them.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that you ought to put down the name of the owner? - He pledged them as his own property, and said he was a master hair-dresser, and that he lived in Slop-alley, in Holborn; I had confidence in what he said.</p>
               <p>Court. Great confidence indeed you gentlemen must have, to suffer a man to come with five and twenty pair of shoes, from September to January? - I did not know I had so many; and seeing I had so many, made me make farther enquiry.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What did you lend on each of these five pair mentioned in the indictment? - I lent three shillings on each pair.</p>
               <p>Court to Cartwright. What are they worth? - I sell them for five and six-pence a pair; they are worth to the trade about four and ten-pence.</p>

I saw the two prisoners together in Bishopsgate-street, loitering about—I saw them both go and look into the window of Mr. M'Donald's shop—Mail then went into the shop, and Nicholls walked backwards and forwards outside—Mail came out in about two minutes, and I went into the shop—Mrs. M'Donald showed me a crown piece—it was marked in my presence, and I left it with her—it was given me again last Tuesday, and I can recognize it as the same—when Mail came out of the shop, Nicholls crossed over to her, and they went away together—I lost sight of them—on Tuesday, 30th Dec., I saw the prisoners again, in Bishopsgate-street—I saw Mail alone, and I followed her, and Nicholls met her in the street in about two minutes—I at once took them into custody—I gave Mail to another officer, and Nicholls ran off—I am certain he is the same man I had seen with Mail before—I had seen them three times previously together—I ran after Nicholls, he was stopped by a gentleman, and I took him to the station—I found on him a knife, but no money—Mail was searched by the female searcher, who gave me this crown piece the next day at the Mansion House.</p>

            . I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; they were on a horse in the kitchen; I missed them between nine and ten at night; I had seen them about five minutes before; every thing on the horse were gone except the cuffs of the gowns; there was nobody in the kitchen. On the 4th of June my brother informed me he had seen the prisoner with one of the gowns and aprons on.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Burn: the gown was pledged at our shop for 3 s. by a woman; I do not know the woman. Mr. Butterfield came with the prisoner and took it out.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Did the prisoner go with you to the pawnbroker's after she was taken up?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes; Maylin took her up and brought her to my house, and she confessed where she had pawned the gown; I went with her, and she took it out; it was given into Maylin's custody. (The gown deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I bought it of a woman in Rag-fair, who had it on her arm with some other things.</p>

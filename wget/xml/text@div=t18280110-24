On the 22d of December, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I dusted my boxes, and put them in the window; I went to clean the lamp, and found the boxes disturbed, and on examining I found the window broken, and three snuff-boxes taken out; I believe the glass was cut before, but they had cut the putty, and taken the piece quite out - it must have been cut out. I had not noticed the prisoner near the house. I have since seen a box in the officer's possession, which I thought was mine - my house is next to the Infirmary.</p>

            . I live with my father, who is a shoe-maker, in Orchard-street, Westminster. I have known the prisoner about four years; I saw him one Saturday, between three and four o'clock, in Birdcage-walk, with two snuff-boxes - one was brown, mounted with silver, and the other was pewter; he told me he had got them out of a broken window, next door to the Infirmary: he did not mention anybody's name; I was not there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had you not been with me all day, till about four o'clock? A. I was not; it was on the Saturday before Christmas that he told me of this.</p>

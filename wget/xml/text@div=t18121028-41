             very well; he is at sea. The prisoner told me he was a shipwright, and that he had been to Botany bay with this young man. I told him, it must have been a good many years ago. I am sure the prisoner is the man. My watch was in a case like a time-piece, over the mantle-piece, and I am sure it was there when the prisoner was in the room. He told me, that he was in a starving condition; he had not broke his fast from Monday morning, and this was Wednesday. I gave him bread and cheese. I told him, it was the best that I had for my father-less family. Mr. Steward's coachman called me out of the room. The coachman lives in the Mews. I returned; and as I was coming into the room I heard the sound of glass. I called out,

I followed him, and kept him in sight to America-square. He turned into John-street, and there I lost eight of him. He got away entirely then. On the 1st of October I met him in Cornhill. I asked him if he had heard of the man that he was enquiring about. He said, what,

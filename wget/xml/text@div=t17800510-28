             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am <rs id="t17800510-28-viclabel154" type="occupation">in the royal artillery</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17800510-28-victim332 t17800510-28-viclabel154"></join>. On Thursday the 13th of April I fell in company with the prisoner at eleven o'clock at night, or after; I met with her at the end of Dyot-street, in my way home.</p>
               <p>Did she pick you up or you pick her up? - She picked me up; she asked me if I would go and treat her? I told her I was a soldier, I thought she was as able to treat me as I was her.</p>
               <p>Was you quite sober? - Not quite sober; but I was not in such a state of intoxication as to incapacitate me from knowing what I was about; we went into a room, I understood afterwards it was in <placeName id="t17800510-28-crimeloc155">Church-lane</placeName>

               <p>Did you go to bed with her? - No.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay with her? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>What money had you in your pocket? - As soon as I went into the room a woman came up and demanded three pence for the use of the room; I gave her three pennyworth of halfpence. I told the prisoner I was very dry and should be much obliged to her to send for a pot of beer; I gave her sixpence to pay for it; she sent the woman for it who came up into the room and demanded the three pence; the beer was brought; I told the woman she might keep the halfpence, and I did not take the change. I drank once of the pot of beer; she drank of it; then set it down. She asked me to give her a shilling? I pulled out all my money and held it in my hand. I had not a shilling; the loose money which I had, besides this guinea and a half, amounted to ten pence or ten pence halfpenny. I took the guinea and a half out from among my halfpence and put it in my right hand breeches pocket; the prisoner saw me do so; I gave her the halfpence; then we went upon the bed together.</p>
               <p>How long might you lie there? - I do not suppose above five minutes; during the conversation I found her left hand once or twice in my right hand breeches pocket; I removed her hand once or twice; I then felt her hand deeper in my pocket.</p>
               <p>This was all while you were upon the bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose your breeches were down at this time? - Yes; undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive her take the money from you? - When I felt her hand deeper in my pocket she drew it out hastily; I put my hand into my pocket and immediately missed my money; I rose up and said, that kind of usage would not do with me; she asked me what? I said she had picked my pocket; she denied it; we had words; two men and a woman came up into the room, after some little conversation, they pulled me about; they pulled the eye off my jacket; they wanted to take charge of me to take me away. I swore I would not leave the room till I had my money returned; they wanted to search her; I objected to that; I did not know but they might be confederates. I was not out of the room, nor would I suffer them to go nigh her; they asked if they should search the room? I said, I had no objection to their searching the room. I looked with a candle and lantern upon the floor and the bed, and there was nothing found; they took both the prisoner and me to the watch-house. I there told the constable of the night my case; and the prisoner was taken to St. Giles's round-house; she was searched at the watch house but nothing was found upon her.</p>
               <p>What became of the men? - I do not know; they afterwards proved to be watchmen.</p>
               <p>What you called out thieves, I suppose? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What brought the watchmen up? - They said they had heard a noise as they passed by in the street; there were words; our conversation was rather loud, after I told her she had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Was the woman the same who fetched you the liquor? - To the best of my knowledge it was.</p>
               <p>You say you felt the prisoner's hand in your right hand pocket two or three times, but the last time you felt her hand deeper in your pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When she drew her hand out hastily you got up immediately and felt the money gone; - I did.</p>

               <p>Did you look about the bed to see whether the money might have have been scattered? - No; the watchmen did.</p>
               <p>Are the watchmen here? - They are not.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When this man picked me up he went home with me; he sent for a pot of beer; he said he would give me all the money he had, which was ten pence halfpenny; when he gave it me I asked him if he had any more? He said he had no more money. I had not been with him above five minutes before he said he missed this money. He pulled his pocket out before to convince me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100038"></xptr>he had no more money; when he gave it me, he said he would come to me again. I took it; he said he missed his money in five minutes after I was with him. I called up the landlady and said, this man said he missed his money. She went down and fetched up the watchmen. He would not believe that they were officers of the night; he would not let them come nigh me to search me; they insisted upon us both going to the watch house; they searched me there and found nothing about me; I had not a farthing in the world but what he gave me.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. How came you, as a private soldier, to have a guinea and a half in your pocket? - I live with an officer in town; I am his servant; I had six shillings and five pence when I set out in the morning. I had six weeks pay due to me, which, at five shillings and sixpence a week, amounts to one pound thirteen shillings, which the paymaster of the company paid me, excepting three halfpence; I spent all the rest, except the money I had in my pocket.</p>

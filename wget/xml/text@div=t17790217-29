The two sashes on the ground-floor were open; the frame of one of the windows was broke. I had shut the windows, and fastened them in the inside with an iron pin. When I went into the room, one of the windows was down flush. The person must have got in at the top of it; the other sash was up. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). The window looks into a publick passage. I saw the things in the room ten minutes before, and the windows were both fast. No person had been in the room from the time I saw the things there to the time I missed them. When I went into the room I saw the prisoner go from the window. I pursued, and laid hold of him; he made a plunge to got away I secured him; he dropped a bag with the things. I am sure there was copper in the bag by the rattle of it. Deathridge came up, and I told him where the bag was.</p>

               <p>On the 24th of Janury, a little after seven o'clock, I heard somebody cry out. I met Mr. Smith; he told me he had been robbed, and that I should find the bag of things in the beginning of the passage. I went and found the bag in the place he directed me to. I brought the bag to the Rose, and then went to the White Hart; there the prisoner took out a string, and said that string belonged to the bag.</p>

I saw the prisoner go up to bed that night; he had two men to help him up to bed; he fell down two or three times in the tap-room before he went out, he was so much in liquor. His wife and he have a room in the gallery. It was within a few minutes of one when he went to bed. I helped to get him up with his wife. He lived in the same gallery with me.</p>

He was out of employ, and his wife worked to support him. When he took the lodging he asked to have a key to let himself in. He said he might be kept out late. I told him I would not suffer any body to have a key, but ostler, and the person who keeps the tap. I told him I was generally up till one, and would let him in; if he came after that time, had rung the bell, he should be let in. I did not see him that night; but, when they were getting him up to bed, I heard somebody say to his wife they did not think he would swear in. His wife said he would swear as well as others when he was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - It might be between eleven and twelve, or after twelve; cannot say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

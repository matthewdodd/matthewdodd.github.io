                  </hi>. I am carman to Arthur M'Namara, and Co., of Castle Street, Finsbury. On 3rd March, I was delivering fish at Billings<lb></lb>gate, from my van, from the Eastern Counties Railway—I know the pri<lb></lb>soner, he works along with Simpson, for Ford; I saw him on that morning about Billingsgate—he came and asked me for three packages for Ford—I told him I had not got any, and he went away—I had no packages for Ford—just before 6 o'clock, when I was busy behind, I saw him take one of the packages off the front of the van—I said, "Give us a ticket for it"—he said, "Simpson will give you the ticket for it"—it was a <hi rend="italic">pad</hi> of soles, with a straw top, and belonged to Mr. Long.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Forge, a fish salesman, of Billingsgate Market. The prisoner sometimes assists me in getting fish from the vans, and carrying it—he told me on the morning of 3rd March, that there was no fish for me on Turner's van, for he had inquired—I was looking out for three packages of Yarmouth fish about a quarter to 6 o'clock, and got them from other vans—I did not authorise the prisoner to take any <hi rend="italic">pads</hi> for me from Mr. Turner's van—I delivered the three packages I received to my master.</p>

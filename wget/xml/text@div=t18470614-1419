                  </hi>. I am a baker in the employ of Mr. Payne, in Hack<lb></lb>ney-road. I sell bread at No. 130, Long-alley—I used to employ the pri<lb></lb>soner in carrying bread from my master's shop to my shop—on the 19th of May I counted forty-six half-quartern loaves and placed them in the bottom of the barrow; a sack was placed over them, and sixteen quartern bricks, and two halves, were placed on the top of the sack—I employed the prisoner to take them to my shop, and told him to wait there till I came home—he asked me how long I should be before I got home—I said I did not know exactly, I might be half-an-hour—he asked me particularly that evening, more than he had ever done before—when I had got to my shop, I found him outside my shop—the bread had been removed from the barrow, and was inside the shop—my wife asked me the quantity of bread I had sent home—I told her, and she said that bread did not come home; she said some bread was taken from the bottom of the barrow, and the sack was taken from the top and tucked down to fill the place of six half-quartern loaves, which I missed—I asked the prisoner how it was he had not brought home the quan<lb></lb>tity I gave him—he said I could not have put it in the barrow—I said I did, and told him what quantity of bread there was—I am certain I put that quantity in the barrow.</p>

On the 19th of May I saw forty-six half-quartern loaves placed in the bottom of the bar<lb></lb>row, and the sack was covered over them—Wenlock has given a correct account of the mode of packing the barrow—there was no bread removed from the barrow after I saw the quantity of loaves in it, till it was in the prisoner's possession to take away</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Wenlock. I remember the prisoner bringing the bread to our shop in the barrow—there were forty half-quarterns placed at the bottom of the barrow, and sixteen quarterns and two half-quarterns on the top—when the prisoner brought the barrow to me, I said, "How is it my husband has not filled the bottom of the barrow?"—he made no reply—I asked him a second time, and he said, "I suppose he could get no more," or something to that effect, but I could not rightly un<lb></lb>derstand what he did say—there were only forty half-quartern loaves at the bottom of the barrow, and the sack was drawn off and wedged down where the six loaves ought to be—I had not sold any bread out of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you sell any bread? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No new bread—I sold but one half-quartern, and that was stale—I knew the quantity my husband had ordered, and that led me to suspect—I had missed bread two or three times, but I said nothing about it—I was not in the back room when my husband came—I was in the shop, counting the bread—I asked how many quarterns he had sent—he said, "Forty"—I said, "I can't make forty of them"—we all three counted them, and missed six half-quartern loaves.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM FRANKLIN. I am in partnership with Mr. Tiffin the prisoner; we are potters, and manufacturers of crucibles. On the night of the <rs id="t18160918-49-cd263" type="crimeDate">27th of July</rs>

Mr. Tiffin had gone round the premises as usual with his lanthorn and a pistol, to see that nobody was lurking about the premises. When I saw Mr. Tiffin immediately afterwards, he told me he had gone down to his cart shed as usual, and as he was going down, his little dog began to bark, upon which he looked over the light of his lanthorn, and saw a man on the premises near the wall; when he saw the man, he told him he should go out, or if he did not, he would shoot him; instead of going out when he told the man, the man ran upon him, and as he was coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180049"></xptr>up, he told him to keep off; but the man kept running on. Then he retreated a few paces back, and the man followed him up within a few paces. He then fired, and the man fell. He said, he did not know whether he was dead or wounded; by his desire I went for a watchman, and we found the man lying on his back quite dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. These premises were completely enclosed; our manufactory had been robbed a very short time previous, and the counting-house had been broken open. The prisoner said, he fired in his own defence, and if he could have avoided it he would not have done it.</p>
               <p>JOHN BENSON, and SAMUEL DOBSON, described the premises.</p>

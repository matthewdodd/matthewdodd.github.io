            . I live in Miller's-buildings, Stepney-fields. On the 10th of June, I sent my child to school with her beads on; she is five years and nine months old. The school is seven or eight doors off; she came home at twelve o'clock. I heard her knock at the door - I was opening it, and heard her call out violently,</p>
               <p>"My beads, my beads! a boy has stolen them and run away." I had a baby in my arms; I put it down, and ran out, and saw the prisoner about twenty yards from the door, running in a field; a woman stopped him; I came up - he said he stopped to take up a piece of rag by the child, but did not take the beads. I saw the necklace found in the field - a great many boys came round, and rescued him from me; but Scales stopped him.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live opposite the house. I saw a crowd, and heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running; the mob were pursuing him - I got up to him; the prosecutrix said he had taken her child's beads. I searched him, but could not find them. They said another boy near him was one of the party, and while I was searching the boy I saw the prisoner stooping down - they called out that he had got them; I went up, and found them laying by him on the ground; he said he did not take them - I found them close by him, hid under some clay.</p>

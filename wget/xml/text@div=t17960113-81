               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it it was only from information that you learned where he lived? - A. Yes; the prisoner was up stairs; when I went in the lit a candle, and I looked into the closet under the stairs, and saw some wood there; I went up one flight of stairs, and saw the prisoner sitting on a bed; I asked him why he was not come to work that afterternoon; he said he was coming: he had been in the yard about three hours before, I told him to walk down stairs with me, which he did; I went to the place where I had seen the wood under the stairs; I asked him how it came there, and began to turn it out; he said he had found the wood, some of it, and some he bought; there were about eleven logs of wood, some oak and some ash.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it wood for firing? - A. Some of it was, and some a little useful, but most of it firewood.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a little useful? - A. In some respects of trade, such as wheelbarrow wheels.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any of these of logs of wood belonging to Mr. Tomlins? - A. I cannot take upon-me positively to swear, because there are so many pieces of wood of a likeness.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any distinction between these pieces of wood? - A. Yes; some of them were plank ends, the ends of planks sawed off.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of it here? - A. Yes; a small quantity; others of them were ends of slab, the outside pieces of timber when it is broke down?</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing among this wood that you could suppose was Mr. Tomlins's? - A. I thought as such.</p>
               <p>Q. But was there any thing that you could six upon as being his property? - A. One piece of ash out from the inside of a folly of a wheel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You would never have dreamed of this if it had not been for good Mrs. Elsworthy, I suppose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You neither missed nor suspected any thing was gone till the came there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you know enough of Mrs. Elsworthy's family and the prisoner's, to know the terms upon which they have lived lately? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. These were very trifling things indeed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you would have put them into your apron and carried them home, as fire-wood, not thinking them of any value? - A. I should not have done it myself, because these things are not allowed in the yard.</p>
               <p>Jury. The piece that was cut out of a selly, did you try it to the piece that you supposed it cut off from? - A. No, I did not; I knew it by a scratch that was on the side of the piece</p>
               <p>Court. But did you compare that piece with the selly? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then how do you know it came from thence? - A It answered to the compass of the selly mould.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the selly mould here? -

               <p>I took my apartment of William Ready; he keeps the house; the place that I have opens to Bryanstone-street; it is the ground floor; Ready and his wife have the privilege of going through my room to their apartment; I have not been five weeks in the place; since I knew them, the prisoner has brought these logs of wood through my apartment at nights, when he came from work every night; last Monday week was the last time that I observed it; it was when he came from work that he brought the first quantity: some of it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130127"></xptr>he put in their own room, and some of it in the place where I paid the rent for; I had the use of setting my pans and coals under the stairs where the wood was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any wood in that place? - A. I had some coals there, but no wood, except a pennyworth that I got to light my fires.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any night that he brought wood into this place below? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time when Saunders came to your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What place did he see where any wood was? - A. Under the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought in that wood that Saunders saw under the stairs? -

            He has brought in wood every night, and I never knew any body else put any there; nobody had access there but him and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any wood there? - A. No, only penny bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. You had brought none of that that Saunders saw there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You rent a part of this man's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You owe him a little rent, perhaps? - A. I owe him a week's rent to-day, and I sent it to his wife, and she would not take it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the man in his master's yard, I suppose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But you charitably suppose he must get all this wood from his master's yard? - A. I never saw him take any from there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask them to lend you a little of this wood to light your fire with? - A. No; I am a poor woman, only doing my honest endeavours; I once asked his wife to lend me a few shavings when I had a nurse child, which I should have done to any one; any one would have done it for me, if they knew me.</p>
               <p>Q. But Mrs. Ready being an ill-natured woman, would not let you have it? - A. No; she let me have it.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Mrs. Ready have had a little quarrel lately? - A. No, not till now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Wallis? - A. I did not, till this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. He is the prisoner's landlord? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Mr. Wallis's, did not you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any conversation with Mr. Wallis, perhaps? - A. He was very angry with me, but he was perfectly satisfied when I told him about the wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him that you would say just what he liked upon the occasion? - A. I told him if he would with me to speak less than what I know was true, I did not wish the poor man to be hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen Mr. Wallis here to-day, I suppose? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I shall call Mr. Wallis presently.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say that Mr. Wallis mad some application to you upon the subject? - A. He came to me and was very angry; he said, that woman was going to hang the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that woman? - A. Me.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not say to you that woman? - A. He said it at the door in my hearing; I told him I had done nothing but what I thought I ought to do; I had taken the man in to see the wood; Mr. Wallis shook his head and said, he had had him a many times in his house amongst his plate and amongst his cloaths, and he had never found any thing amiss of him, and he was surprised to see the quantity of wood that there was.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he express that he was surprized? - A. Yes; he said he could not have believed it.</p>
               <p>Court to Saunders. What wood have you got here? - A. Five pieces. (producing them).</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the wood that was taken from the house? - A. This is a piece of it; I took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where has it been since? - A. In the place the woman called the passage, until Thursday I put it into a bag.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you found it? - A. On Tuesday; I left it in the passage of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you find it afterwards? - A. In the same passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to swear that the piece of wood you left in the passage on Tuesday, was that you saw afterwards? - A. I cannot swear to it; it is very like it; it is the same kind of wood.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you make any mark upon it? - A. No;(produces another piece) this is a piece of ash cut out of a telly; I was ordered to take the man, and I left the wood behind in a heap; when I went on Thursday, it lay upon the spot where I had left it, and it is the same kind of wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you nothing that will fit it in Mr. Tomlins's yard? - A I have not tried it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you got any that you can swear to? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Court. There being nothing that he can swear to as the property of the prosecutor, the consequence is, upon that ground, that the prisoner must be acquitted; but I should be very sorry to have it go abroad, that the prisoner had a right, or any man, to take such pieces from any yard.</p>
               <p>Jury. That cannot go abroad, my Lord, when we have taken so much pains with it as we have; they have clearly no such right.</p>

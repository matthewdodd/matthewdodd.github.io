               <p>Q. Where did you take this account, at your own house? - No, at Mr. Adams's, it was dictated by Mrs. Fleming, as the account of things she had taken, and the articles I desired her to put on one side, that they might be forth coming.</p>
               <p>Q. On shewing the prisoner that account, what did he say? - He said he had stole the goods, sold them, and received the money for them.</p>

I never see any glass brought, my sister has bought some glass tumblers, the first she bought I took no notice of the second time she told me that he appeared to be an odd tradesmen, for he brought the goods in his pocket; I requested my sister when he came again to let me see him, when he came the third time I was told, and I went into the shop and looked at him, I went into the shop and walked out again, and had some suspicion that he lived at some glass warehouse, and he was robbing his master; the next time he came it was in the night, when he brought the goblets, I did not see him, my shop was shut up; the next time he came I saw him, and followed him along London Wall, that was on the 10th of April, Thursday, about five o'clock, just at dark; I followed him from No. 67, Fore-street, to London Wall, where I lost sight of him at the bottom of Phillip-lane; he came again on Saturday evening, and I followed him up the street, and he went into Mr. Spodes, and I, after he came out, went into Mr. Spodes, and asked them where he lived? and they told me he lived with Mr. Marsh; and I applied to Mr. Marsh's house, and he was not within, and I left my card, requesting that he would come down; the servant asked if any body else would do? I told him no. On Tuesday morning Mr. Marsh came down to me, I then told him that I had a suspicion that he had a servant that robbed him, and described the old man, the prisoner at the bar, I then went with Mr. Marsh and shewed him the goods that he had brought and Mr. Marsh looked at the goods and said, that he had not a doubt but they were his property, the goods are part of them here, they were put bye, I marked every article that they might be known afterwards, all that were not sold, they were delivered to the constable, Smith.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. Are they in the account you gave to Mr. Marsh of goods bought? - All but the four which were bought subsequent to giving the account to Mr. Marsh.</p>
               <p>Adams. Mr. Marsh desired me to give him an order when he came again, for some cut glass and cut falts, whereby he should be able to detect the prisoner, but he absconded before he brought these, because when he came the last time there was a man in the shop who knew him.</p>

               <p>Marsh. I believe it is my property, but I cannot swear to them, he told me that he stole them from me, and sold them to Mrs. Fleming and received the money.</p>

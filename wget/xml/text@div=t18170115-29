            . I am a constable; I saw the prisoner crossing the top of Ludgate-hill with the beef on his back; he was coming from the market; when he saw me he turned round, and went down Ludgate-hill very fast. I laid hold of him at the top of Creed-lane. I asked him what he had got, he said a man had given it to him, threw it down at my feet, and ran away; I pursued him, and took him to the watch-house; he was not out of my sight. Mr. Silverside claimed the beef.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 45, Lansdowne Place, South Lambeth, and am clerk to a provision merchant—on 13th August I was with a horse and cab at the" Weymouth Arms, "Wejmouth Street, New Kent Road—I had in the cab a box, a carpet bag containing a mackintosh coat, three pair of goloshes, a pair of side-spring boots, and a pair of small sand boots—I was that night from-the eab about three minutes, and when I returned I missed the bag and contents—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I think it was between eleven and twelve o'clock at night when I lost them.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman P 48). On the night of 13th August I received information from Mr. Gardner—I also received information in another quarter which caused me to go to Nelson Court, Walworth, where I found the prisoner Shea—a conversation took, place between us relative to the bag, which induced me to take him to the Waterloo Road, No. 13—it is a tobacconist's and a brothel—I there found the female prisoner, and the male prisoner Evans, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> "Spicey"—Shea was in my company at the time—I introduced three other constables and Shea into the back parlour—I there found this bag and the contents—I believe the mackintosh was partly out of the bag—the bag appeared to me to be open, and I could see the mackintosh—I asked Shea if the man Evans was the one who purchased the bag of him—he said, "Yes"—I told Evans to dress himself, and put</p>

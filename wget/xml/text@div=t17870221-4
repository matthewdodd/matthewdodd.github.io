               <p>Who did you leave at home besides her? - Nobody to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening did you go out? - Between six and seven.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - On Thursday last the prisoner came to the door with me, held the door in her hand, and shut it after me.</p>
               <p>I think you say you left nobody at home but her? - Nobody that I know of; when I came home, I found Mr. Bowden there; he did not live with me; he called on me as a visitor now and then; there was no part of the house broke open, but a cupboard was atempted to be broke open; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment at least; I put a principal part of the things I lost in the indictment; the things were taken principally from my dressing room, up two pair of stairs adjoining to a bed room.</p>
               <p>Were the drawers of that room rifled? - Yes, they were; the upper part was a book-case; the prisoner Connolly was gone when I came home, and took the key with her; I never saw her again till she was apprehended.</p>
               <p>How long after he was she apprended? - The next day to the best of my knowledge; I think it was about three o'clock; I saw her at Sir Sampson's in custody; she said, nothing to me at all; she denied any knowledge of the things.</p>
               <p>Did she give any reason for having absconded and left your house without notice? - Not in the least; but a letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You must not tell us what she said in that letter.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ask her why she had left your house? - I did, but she did not make any answer.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the letter was in her hand writing? - It was compared with her writing, and I have seen her write bills.</p>
               <p>From that do you believe that letter to be her hand writing? - As far as I think I believe it is; I think this to be the very same letter; I received that in the evening of the day she was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>On Thursday evening, between six and seven, I went out with Miss Plomer, from her house in Howland-street; she was kind enough to say she would set me down at Covent Garden theatre, as she was going to spend her evening in the city; the maid lighted us to the door, held the door in her hand, and shut the door with a candle in her hand; that was a little before seven; I parted with Miss Plomer at Covent Garden, and I returned to her house again just as the watchman had gone his round for ten o'clock; I knocked at the door and nobody answered; I then pushed at the door, and found that the bolt was just hung on the thing that receives it; just pressed upon it; I pushed the door from me, and it opened; I then walked into the parlour, and found a part of a mould candle laying on the table, lighted, burning in its own grease on the table; I was so very much confused that I did not immediately extinguish the light, but looked round the room, and on the side board in the recess, I found this article. (A sort of chissel or crow.) I also found they had been attempting to break open the door of the cupboard, but had not been able to force it open; I then went out and called the watchman; I found nobody in the house; the watchman went into the kitchen; and I looked for this silver tea pot and stand, and the milk pail, which we had just used at tea, and found they were gone, and two of the drawers in the dresser open, and this metal watch was gone, which used to stand on the chimney; I then went up stairs, and found in the first bed room, that they had stripped off the chintz curtains from the rods, and had taken the coverlid off; I then went up stairs to the room adjoining to the room where Miss Plomer sleeps, and I found it stripped of every thing; the wearing apparel almost entirely gone; after searching the house entirely round, and being convinced there was nobody in the house, I told the watchman to go out and watch if anybody came to the door, and leave me in the house till Miss Plomer returned; she came back about twelve; I went to the door on hearing a coach stop, and apprized her of her loss; she was very much confused, I endeavoured to appease her with all the arguments I could; at last, when she was sufficiently so, I took an account of all the things that were missing, all that she could recollect that evening; in the morning early, I accompanied her to Sir Sampson Wright's office, who advised us to make enquiry at the place where she last lived, which was Mrs. Vincent's, in Hanover-street, Hanover-square; I went there, and in consequence of the information I received, we went to Mrs. Hicks, in David-street, Berkley-square.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Had you her character from Mrs. Vincent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bowden. Mrs. Hicks gave us a direction to the prisoner at the bar's sister; a Mrs. Boss, in Joys-court, Oxford-street; we went there, and I took the coachman with me into the court, and I found the aunt of the prisoner, whose name was Connolly, and she went with me to Mrs. Boss's lodging in New James-street; she was not at home, but I saw her daughter; we interrogated them, both the old woman, and Mrs. Boss's daughter, and took both to Sir Sampson's; the girl was examined, and by what appeared on her examination, we were directed to

Last Monday evening was a week, to the best of my knowledge, I returned with Miss Plomer, who had been out, and she went down into the kitchen, and came up very much confused, and said there was a blackguard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210011"></xptr>looking man in the kitchen, and desired me to go down to see him, which I did, and it was the prisoner Daley.</p>
               <p>Was there any other servant but Connolly? - No other servant regularly kept, but a woman occasionally to assist her; this hammer was found the next day in the back kitchen, which was not the property of Miss Plomer, nor the iron crow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man in the kitchen you had never seen before? - No, never to my knowledge; I went to the cistern, and washed my hands, and when I returned, I looked at him again; I am sure of his person.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. It is mine, I hemmed it myself; there is no mark on it, nor a letter; there were five more; they are my property.</p>
               <p>(The gold ear wires that were found in his fob shewn to the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>They are very like a pair that I had in a toilet drawer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Those are a very common sort? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Shew the prosecutrix the muslin handkerchief that was found on the prisoner's neck, and the stomacher, which was found in Connolly's pocket? - This is mine, it is a stomacher belonging to a dress; I know this handkerchief particularly, by a corner being torn out, and darned the first time I had it on.</p>

               <p>Court. Shew Miss Plomer the key that opened her house? - I believe this to be the key of my door, but there is no particular mark to it; I have lost the key of my door.</p>
               <p>Court. The cloak that you found in Connolly's pocket shew to Miss Plomer - This is mine, I know it particularly, I made it myself, and the lace was torn in a particular part; I have no doubt of its being mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Shew the shift that was found on the prisoner Connolly to Miss Plomer? - This is mine, but the P is taken out, here is C No. 10.</p>
               <p>Where was that plate found? - In a box that was nailed up.</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. I tried the key found in his pocket, and it opened the box where the plate was found.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at two or three of the most material articles that were found in the box.</p>
               <p>Miss Plomer. I am positive this is my watch, for I wore it some time without the outside case, and thereby damaged the enamel; it was in one of my drawers; I know this tea-pot and stand; I am sure they are mine.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in the same house with the prisoner Daley; about half past ten, on Thursday night, he came in with a large bundle; nobody was with him; I thought it was my husband at the door; I went to the door to open it, and it was the prisoner with the bundle; he carried it up stairs, and when he came down again, I asked him if he was going to be married, and if it was his household furniture that he brought in, he said yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. You saw the maid shut the door, after you when you went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210013"></xptr>Are there any more doors than one? - Only one street door; I cannot say I had been down within an hour or two of the time I went out; I am sure none of the doors or windows were open when I sat in the coach; I saw all the front windows were shut.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Bowden. When you went down stairs, did you observe whether the back doors were open or shut? - I cannot exactly say, I was most exceedingly confused; there is a very small yard behind the house, with a tolerable high wall, and no door out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Miss Plomer. I did not observe the back door, I was so frightened.</p>
               <p>Was any door of the house broke open? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You take all the receipts in your own name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the house originally let to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who pays the land-tax? - Myself.</p>
               <p>Has no gentleman paid it for you? - No.</p>
               <p>Has there been no agreement, that in case you do not pay them, another person should? - Never.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been married? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Daley. I knows nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This is an indictment for burglary; it is clear that no force had been made use of on the door of the house; the door is in that state in which it might be left by neglect of a servant.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no proof of any forcible breaking certainly; but I am of opinion, that if the Jury should believe this theft to have been committed by both the prisoners, the servant and Daley, that the servant's opening the door to that man to let him in, for the purpose of robbing the house, is burglary in them both: the fact I shall leave to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It depends on the idea that this man was not in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. It does so.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. About what value were the things lost? - About fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Connolly called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Daley. She gave the things to me, and said they were some things of consequence, and I took the bundle to my room, and I locked the door, which had not been locked for three months before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Daley called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Connolly. My Lord, my mistress desired me to move those things, as she was going to leave her lodgings, and I have a witness of that.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. You might as well suppose I was going to set the house on fire.</p>

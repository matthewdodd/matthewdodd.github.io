Yesterday se'nnight I went out about eight o'clock in the evening, I left seven carcases hanging in the shop. At about half after nine, my wife came to me at a neighbour's house, and said a sheep had been stolen. I went home and saw the sheep all over dirt. I went to the watch-house where the prisoner was in custody, and asked him where he got it. He said somewhere by the market. I asked him where abouts? and then he said from the door of my shop. He said another boy bid him go and take it.</p>
               <p>Did you make use of any promise to induce him to confess? - No.</p>
               <p>Or did you threaten him if he did not tell the truth? - No; I did not.</p>

               <p>I went to Mr. Paul's that evening. I sat down in a little room within the shop. A little after nine o'clock I saw a carcass of a sheep taken out at the shop door.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body take it out? - No; I did not. I saw only a part of it as it went out at the shop door. I went and called Stop thief! I saw the sheep on a man's shoulder; he threw it off his shoulder, and Mrs. Paul pursued him, I did not go after him.</p>

               <p>I pursued the prisoner. I saw him cross the kennel, and saw the carcass drop, but did not see him throw it down. I followed him and cried Stop thief! till he ran through Elder-yard into Chapel-street, there he was stopped. I never lost sight of him from the time he ran from the sheep till he was stopped.</p>

               <p>I saw the carcass lie on the ground. I was going to pick it up. A person cried, Stop thief! and then I threw it down and ran away.</p>

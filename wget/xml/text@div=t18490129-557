                  </hi>. I am an errand-boy at the Castle Inn, Castle-street, Golden<lb></lb>square. On 17th Nov. I was in the service of Mr. Bather, and knew the prisoner there—he sent me on that day to Mr. Costa's, in Jermyn-street, with this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which is in his writing—I took it, got the goods, and took them to the prisoner at the shop—here are three other orders which I took at different times.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Jermyn-street. On 9th Dec. Mark brought me this order—I gave him the goods, thinking it was Mr. Bather's writing, because I owed him a bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am an engraver, and have carried on the business of a scale-maker—the prisoner was in my employ—I did not send him to Mr. Costa's shop to get goods for me—these orders are not my writing—I never authorized the prisoner to sign my name—I never sent him to Mr. Costa for goods on my account.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will you swear you never authorized him to write your name for anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the prisoner never sent me a note requesting money; I do not owe him any—he seat me a note discharging himself—I am in Whitecross-street now, on a fictitious affair—my father left his business to the prisoner; and my mother and I purchased it of him for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he had not money to carry it on—I do not understand much about it—I do not know how long he was in my father's service—my father died</p>

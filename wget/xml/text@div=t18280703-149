            . I am a clerk. I went to the prosecutor's shop on the 6th of June and bought two mangle end irons of the prisoner, for which I paid 5s. 2d.; I either gave it to the prisoner, or put it on the desk - it was about half-past seven o'clock in the morning; I received a bill of them from the prisoner.</p>

             re-examined. He never accounted to me for this money; it was his duty to put it down in this book and give me the money: I went out of town on the Saturday - I called the prisoner and asked if any one had been there; he said No - I said "Come in, and let us settle about your tolls;" he owed me 2s. 6d., which he gave me; he said nothing about this 5s. 2d. - it was about two hours after he received it; he was taken into custody on the Tuesday following - I had left him there to give him an opportunity of settling this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS Q. Have you any till? A. No; I did not ask if he had received any money - I asked if any one had been there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Saturday previous to this, Mr. Paine discharged the clerk, and during that time I was bound to receive money on his account if anybody came for goods; on the Friday he called me to settle my tolls - they came to 8d.; he asked if I had had anybody there for him - I told him of course not: on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030066"></xptr>Saturday evening I expected him to settle with me, when there would have been some more due to me for cart grease, tolls and oil, but before breakfast he went out of town.</p>

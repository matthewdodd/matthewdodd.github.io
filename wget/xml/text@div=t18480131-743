On 18th Jan., at half-past eight o'clock at night, I saw two boats coming from the barge, at King and Queen Wharf—there were two other craft lying alongside the lighter in which this iron was—Bryan and Hagerty were in one of the boats and Cassidy and M'Carthy in the other—I rowed after the boat in which Bryan and Hagerty were, and saw one of them throw a bag overboard, which appeared to have something heavy in it—it was a moonlight night—I came up to the boat, put an officer on board, and went in pursuit of the one in which I had seen Cassidy and M'Carthy—I called "Stop thief!"—Cassidy and M'Carthy jumped out of the boat into the mud, and ran away—I did not see Griffin, but it turned out afterwards that he had been there—he afterwards brought M'Carthy and Cassidy to me—I examined the boat in which they had been,</p>

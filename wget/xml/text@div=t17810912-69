               <p>On the 9th of August, I came from Gravesend. I had been discharged out of the hospital: I was very weak and ill: between nine and ten at night, in <placeName id="t17810912-69-crimeloc347">Golden-lane</placeName>

I said, this is Mr. Bennett's: she said, Yes; this is Mr. Bennett's: then she pulled me up stairs by the arm. When I came into the one-pair-of stairs room, she asked me for some money to drink: I gave her sixpence; when she threw me on the bed, having previously called out for another woman, by the name of Nancy Green, to come into the room. She then clapped her knee upon my belly: and then Green took hold of the handkerchief about my neck, and held me by that; then the prisoner took a handkerchief out of my waistcoat pocket, and threw it to Green: then they attempted to take out another handkerchief, which had ten guineas in it: I struggled for that: then she d - n'd my eyes, and said she would run me through with a knife, if I did not let go the handkerchief. Upon which I let it go, money and all, for I was in bodily fear: then they ran down stairs: I followed them, and went to a neighbour's I knew, and they were taken up that night.</p>

               <p>Before ten that night, the prosecutor came to me, and said he was robbed. I went after the woman, and endeavoured to find her: when she was taken, after having said she had but one penny, which she would spend in gin, she dropped a guinea on the floor: we took her into another room, and there she dropped another guinea; while searching her, another guinea dropped out of her breast; that she took up, and swallowed: she had no smock on: I did not not search her further. Going to Clerkenwell, she said, D - n you, you have got two of the man's guineas; but I swallowed one, and if I had them, I would swallow them too.</p>

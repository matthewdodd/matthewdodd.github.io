                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. John Seward and another, at Pop-lar. The prisoner was their labourer—on the 27th of March I was informed of something by our time-keeper—I looked under the water-trough, and saw some copper rivets—I watched, and in the evening I saw the prisoner come and kneel down, and draw something from under the trough, and put it into his jacket pocket—I came away, and he was taking his course round the out<lb></lb>side of the premises—I went and told him to go after one of the labourers—I kept my eye on him, and saw him go to another part of the shop—I then went and collared him—I charged him with having the rivets—he begged my pardon—I asked him where he took them from—he said, "From No. 2 store," which is where the copper and brass are kept—I found these rivets at the end of the shop where he had gone when I sent him for the labourer—there are sixteen of them, worth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

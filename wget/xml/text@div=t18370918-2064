               <p>noon, the 19th of August, I went on hoard the <hi rend="italic">Spartan</hi>—there were two barges taking in ballast at the time—the prisoner Cunningham was inside a barge alongside the vessel—I told him I had come down in consequence of the prosecutor having lost his watch on board—that he believed some of the ballast-men had got it, and I should search all of them—he made answer, with another man in the barge, that they could answer for them selves that they had not got it—Sherwood, a policeman, was with me—I told him to search them in the barge while I went on board the ship—I was called back, and Sherwood delivered me a watch, in Cunningham's presence, and said, "I have found the watch on this man"—I asked Cunningham how he came by it—he said a man named Collins gave it to him—Collins was sent for, and I told him what Cunningham had said—he said, "No, I did not give it to him"—Cunningham said, "You know very well you did give it to me; why do you tell any story about it?"—I told Collins to come down into the craft—he then said he did give him the watch, that he picked it up, and Cunningham begged him to give it to him, that he said, "We had better give it up; there will be some inquiry about it; "but Cunningham said, "No; give it to me; I will take care of it."</p>

In consequence of Blyth informing me of this, I searched Cunningham, and found the watch concealed under the waistband of his trowsers, with his handkerchief wrapped round it—I asked him what it was—he said the watch—I asked how he came by it, he said a man who was at work with him gave it him—I asked his name, he said William Collins.</p>

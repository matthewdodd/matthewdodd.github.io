                  </hi>. I am a pensioner of the Bombay Artillery. I came home in the <hi rend="italic">Lady Feversham</hi>—I landed at Blackwall on the 11th of June, about seven o'clock in the morning, with a person of the name of Henry—I had a box with me containing the articles stated and the money—when I came on shore I went into the Kings Arms public-house—I saw some comrades, and told them I wanted to get the boxes out of the boat—I went out, and saw the prisoner—I told him to come and assist me with the boxes out of the boat—he went with me to the boat—we took the boxes out, and brought them up to the public-house, and laid them in front of the bar—I asked him to show me a place to get shaved, and he went with me to a barber's—after I was shaved we came back to the same public-house, and found the things where they were left—I and my comrades brought the boxes out, and laid them on a cart—we took them out again, and laid them on the pathway, and I went in to settle—the pri<lb></lb>soner was standing convenient to the pathway, close to where we laid down the boxes—I told him I wanted to go to Leadenhall-street, as be<lb></lb>ing the most convenient to the India House—I returned to the public-house to settle with the landlady, and when I came out the prisoner was gone and my property—I expected to find him there—I have never seen my property since, nor did I see the prisoner till he was at Lambeth-street police-office—he was then quite in a different dress—I am certain he it the person—I went with him to the shop, and walked with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am driver of a Blackwall omnibus—I remember the day of the soldier's landing—at a quarter before eight o'clock that morning the prisoner brought two boxes, lashed together, to my omnibus, which was fifteen or twenty yards from the King's Arms—he said he wanted to go to town—I was on the box, about to start—I said, "Hand the boxes up to me," and he did—we got them on the omnibus—he then said, "I must go back, I have a friend wants to go with me"—he went, and I waited five or six minutes—he did not come—I called to him, and he got up—he said, "I can pay your demand"—I drove him up to town—he wanted to be put down—I put him down at the corner of Red Lion-street, and gave him his luggage—I said, "Come, pay me, because I am in a hurry"—he said, "I have no money; if you will send a person with me to the Rossiter's Arms, to Mr. Dyke's, I will pay you"—I looked round, as I could not see any one, I let him go, and he went up Red Lion-street, with the two boxes—in the course of the day I heard of this, and went in the evening to find the public-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there several soldiers and seamen about the stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—this was close adjoining the public-house—I did not see that there were any drinking—the boxes were on the prisoner's back—he helped to shove them up—he went back to fetch a friend—I saw him go back to the stairs where the soldiers were landing—I could not see him address any body, from the bustle there was—I could not tell whether he was speaking to any one when he went back—I called him several times, and hurried him as much as I could to come—I think the conductor went to him once—I never saw the prosecutor at that time—I did not hear the prisoner call to any one to come to him.</p>

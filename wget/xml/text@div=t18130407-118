On the 8th of March, in the afternoon, when I first saw the prisoner in the shop, I saw her put something into her pocket-hole; it was something black. The young man was gone to the other end of the shop to fetch her some coloured silk handkerchiefs to look at. When the young man came back she asked to look at some black silk stockings. I fetched her some. She said they were not good enough. The young man went out, and fetched two parcels; they were not good enough. She desired him to go out and fetch her some better. She took one pair of black silk stockings, and put them under her handkerchief. She said, they were not good enough; she sent him out again. She then took another pair. She sent him to get some white silk handkerchiefs, and while he was gone she took the silk handkerchiefs from under her arm, and put them in her pocket. She looked out what she intended to purchase, and desired him to send them to to No. 17, Glasses-street, Piccadilly. She went out of the shop. I went after her. I asked her to walk back; there was something of a mistake. She said she would not. I told her she must. I brought her into the shop. I was going to take them from her. Mr. Allen said, I must not search her; I must send for a constable. Oh, no, said she, I will give you what I have got. She dropped four pair of silk stockings, and five black silk handkerchiefs. These are the stockings and handkerchiefs. They are the property of Mr. Allen.</p>

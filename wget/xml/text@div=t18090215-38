I had suspicion of the man, I watched him; I saw him lurking about the copper, something disturbed him, and he walked away from it. I went up to him and asked him why he did not go and look out for work, why he loitered about there, we had nothing for him to do, I told him; he went away. Then I went into the counting house upon my business; when I came out I saw him come away from the copper again; I had suspicion that he had got something, I was standing and talking to him; he said only look what a lot of ice there is in the river, it is enough to overturn a barge; I turned my head to look at the ice, he stooped, I heard the copper fall; I turned round and saw the copper falling, one corner just touched the ground just as I saw it; he said halloa; I said you shall go before Mr. Pigeon now; I have looked after you some time; he said, don't let me go, bless your eyes do not; I called a man on the wharf, and he called Mr. Pidgeon; he was then taken to the counter.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went down to look for work as usual; I staid on the wharf twenty minutes, I stood talking to this man just by where the copper was piled; one of the pieces of copper fell down; when I turned round he said you want to steal the copper; I said I did not; he said you shall not run away, you shall see Mr. Pidgeon; I said I would as soon see Mr. Pidgeon as any one; I had touched nothing, nor nothing had I upon me, nor never laid my hands upon the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hall. How far was he from where the copper stood - A. About six yards from the copper from what I saw; he had the copper behind him, under his great coat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

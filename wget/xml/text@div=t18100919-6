               <p>Q. On the evening of that day did the prisoner go from Fulham - A. Yes, before eight o'clock, to see his friends. He went to sleep in town to go the next morning by the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure any part of the house before you went to bed - A. The greater part.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure that part of the house that was broken open - A. No; the shutter was very old; it was secured by iron bars.</p>
               <p>Q. What window is that - A. It is the window in the servants' hall, that looks upon the lawn in the garden; the shutters were shut to; I cannot say whether the window was down or not. I left the house near twelve o'clock. I do not sleep in the house. I had seen the plate all safe in the house two or three hours before.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen whether the window of the servants' hall had been shut that night - A. I cannot say; the shutters had been put to; there were no fastenings to them. About six o'clock in the morning I was called by the coachman; I came down stairs and went into the pantry; I missed a silver tea-pot, fourteen table-spoons, and all the articles mentioned in the indictment. I then went into the servants' hall, I found the window open; there were six iron bars inside, that secured the window, one of them was forced of one side, and one of the outside wooden bars was broken, it had been forced away, I found it upon the lawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any matches on the lawn - A. I saw them matches and about two inches of candle, it appeared to have been lit.</p>

               <p>Q. When that bar was put of one side, was there room enough for a man to enter - A. Yes; and two wooden rails outside had been sawed across and then forced away.</p>

He asked me to make up a bed for him, he was going off early, at five o'clock in the morning, by the coach, into the country. I made up I bed for him, I heard him go up stairs to his bedroom a little after twelve o'clock. I was in my bedroom by a little after eleven. He had been below alone three quarters of an hour before he came to bed. I heard him go down stairs and go out of the street door about three minutes after he had been in his room. The street door fastens with a spring lock, he pulled the door three times before he left it, it shuts very hard.</p>
               <p>Q. In the morning when you came down did you observe the appearance of there having been any fire in the servants' hall - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine the condition of the bed that you made up for him to sleep in - A. Yes, it was very much tumbled, as if a person had slept all night in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him come in that house after he had left it - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him in the morning - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>JOHN PERKS. I am a police officer. On the morning of the 24th of August I went to Mr. Ord's house and examined the manner in which it had been broke open; the entry appeared to have been made by the two wooden bars being sawed away, and then an iron bar, out of five or six, was turned of one side, the two screws were drawn out and left on the sill of the window inside, and the window was open. At two in the afternoon of the same day, I went to the White-horse cellar, Piccadilly, I there observed the prisoner sitting on this deal box, I asked him if it was his box, he replied yes. I tied his hands together and put him in a coach. On his way to the office he began to cry, and endeavoured to beat himself; he said, I have robbed the best of masters; I begged him to desist saying any thing further to me. I took him to the office, and opened the box, it contained the whole of the articles mentioned in the indictment. He said every article of plate was there, he had made away with none.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the whole of the articles in the indictment in that box - A. They were. On searching him, I found this black crape, this screw-driver, some lead melted in various forms, and some loose gunpowder. In his jacket pocket I found the duplicate of a pair of pistols, which appeared to have been pledged at Rochford's the same morning. In the morning I went to the lawn I discovered these matches and a candle under a clump of trees.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Cable.) Are these matches and the piece of candle the same that you saw there - A. Yes; I left them there.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Perks.) Has that candle been used - A.Yes, it has. I previously saw this candle and matches when I first went to the house, and under the apprehension of apprehending the prisoner, I desired them to let them remain.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lupton.) Look at that plate - A. I have examined them all, I have not the smallest doubt of their being my master's, and that they are worth more than 20 l.</p>

On Tuesday, 13th Oct, the prisoners came to my shop—Sullivan said, "Show this gentleman a coat," pointing to Bolyne—I showed him some, and he tried on several—Sullivan examined them, and told him whether they fitted—at last they chose one—Sullivan said, "I think that fits you very well," and Bolyne said, "Very well, we will have it"—the price agreed upon was 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then asked to be shown a waistcoat—I showed him several—he chose one at 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Sullivan said to Bolyne, "You had better pay for them," and Bolyne gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I looked at it, and thought it was not a good one—I gave it him back, and told him to write his name and address on the back, which he did—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the note, and this is what I saw him write, "William Walters, 16, Princes Street"—I then said, "I must go and get change"—I went out, and showed it to Mr. Clarke, at Bull and Wilson's—I then returned to the shop—I looked in, and, thinking the prisoners were still there, I ran over to Luxmor's to be certain whether it was good or not—when I came back neither of the prisoners were there—I had seen a policeman when I went out, and told him to watch them—I went with him in search of them, and as I returned I saw Sullivan standing in a doorway on the opposite side of the way—I immediately went over to him, and said, "It is a strange thing your friend should go away and leave the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and the change; I have the change for him; where is he?"—he said he had only gone to get a glass of ale, he would be there directly—a</p>

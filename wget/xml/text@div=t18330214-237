            . I am a builder - I live in Dorchester-place, and am agent to the ground landlord of these carcases. I went over these five carcases one day last week - I suppose they have sustained damage to the amount of 200l. and upwards; joists, bricks, and slates, have been taken away, the chimney-pots destroyed, and the carcases greatly demolished - I know where the prisoner lives; there is a door from her garden to the back part of these carcases - I went to her house with two boys last Wednesday; I saw the prisoner there, and said, "I understood you are encouraging these boys to destroy these houses, and loosen the timbers - I am credibly informed there is a quantity of the materials in your cottage;" she said there was no property in her house belonging to any one but herself - I told her I was confident there was, and I was going to get an officer with a search-warrant, unless the property was delivered up; I left a man to watch the premises - I went away, and returned the same day with the officer; I then told her, I should, as a friend, wish her to give up the timber belonging to these houses - she said, "Come in, Sir;" I walked in with the officer as far as the parlour-door; I then said, "Mrs. Birch, you have got a good deal of the property belonging to these houses, and I am authorised by the proprietor to require you to give it up;" she said, "O deary me, we have nothing belonging to these houses" - I turned and looked into the other parlour on the left hand, and saw, I suppose, fifty or sixty pieces of timber piled up - or probably more; I said, "This is the timber we are looking for" - she said "O no, I gave either 2l. 3s. or 3l. 3s. for them, and a load of bricks;" I said, "Who did you buy it of? you must have had a great burgain" - she said, "I bought it of Mr. Morand;" I said, "What, the broker" - she said,"Yes, he is a broker;" I suppose the value of a load of bricks and the timber I saw would be 10l. or 12l. - the bricklayer came in at the time, and she said, "Here is a man who can prove I had them of Mr. Morand; and I had some words about paying the balance of the money, and he saw it come;" she said to him, "Did not you, Mr. Milwood; did not you see it come" - he said, "I saw a load of bricks and a piece or two of timber;" I said, "Did you see all this?" - he said, No; I asked the prisoner if she had any receipt, and she said it should be given at a proper time; I said we should persevere, and she said we might do as we pleased - I begged of her repeatedly to give it up, but she refused; I said there would certainly be a prosecution follow, as the property belonged to these premises - she said it did not; I then went to my employer, and then went to the prisoner's premises with the officer, and found a large quantity of wood, I believe ninety-four pieces in the whole, also a small piece of lead worth about 2s., and some slates - I compared the timber found at the prisoner's with the remainder of the joists left on the buildings; it matched in length and size, and its being faulty at one end - it tallied in every respect, and I have no doubt whatever that it came from there - here are two pieces I can speak to more particularly; I have matched one piece to the place it came from in the carcases, and it matched to the greatest nicety - the ends of these pieces have been cut off and rubbed with dirt; I have seen boys on the carcases from time to time, (and among the rest, Barnes,) throwing bricks into the prisoner's garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How many times did you go to the prisoner's cottage? A. Three times, and the first time I told her the charge, and wished her to give it up, which she refused to do; I first went on the Wednesday, and then again on the Thursday - I am aware that at auctions property is bought for much less than at shops.</p>
               <p>MR. ROWE. Q. Did the prisoner ever state that she purchased these goods at an auction? A. No, she did not.</p>

I went with this witness, on Friday morning last, to search the prisoner's house; I read my warrant to her, and told her she was in custody, and I was going to take her and the whole of the timber away - I had seen the timber there the day before, when I went to apprehend one of the persons who is to give evidence, and she then said she did not know any such person; I found more than ninety pieces of timber in her house, there was a whole van load - I examined it, and found about half of the ends had been sawed off in a roughish manner; it had been newly done, but some dirt had been rubbed over it to make it appear old;. I said to a person who was with me, that I supposed there was not much pigeon left on the tops of the houses, and the prisoner said, "Oh, deary me, I have got a piece of lead; I heard a great noise between four and five o'clock one morning; I got up, went to one of the houses, and found a piece of lead, which I have in the house" - I recollected that I had seen a piece of lead on a range, but it was then missing - I found it stuffed behind a grate; I found is a cupboard, a number of bits of wood split up - I said, "Mrs. Birch, what is this?" she said, "Only a little fire-wood, and the back of an old cupboard;" I said, "I shall take it away;" she put her hands on me, and said,"Oh, don't take my fire-wood away, it is only wood I have got to light my fire;" I said, "I shall take it, and keep your hands off, or it will be the worse for you;" this is it; when I went and said I came to take her and the timber, she said, "O Lord, what a piece of work there is about this timber - I bought it of a man of the name of Morand, and paid for it; I gave 3l. 3s. for it, and a quantity of bricks" - I said, "You had a very cheap bargain, have you any bill?" she pretended to look among some papers for it, but could not find it - she said she did not know where the man lived, but she afterwards told me where he had lived; I saw part of this timber fitted to the carcases - it matched according to my judgment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She told you where Morand lived? A. Yes, but I went, and he had been dead nine weeks.</p>

I am a bricklayer, and have been occasionally employed by the prisoner - I remember a load of timber and bricks coming to her in November; I was at that time working for Mr. Griffiths - I ran over but as my labourer was mixing compo', I could not stop; I heard the prisoner arguing with the men at the gate, about 3s. they had overcharged for coming - on another occasion I saw a quantity of timber go in a cart; my brother was with me then measuring a foundation - I understand the prisoner has her cottage on a repairing lease.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you in the habit of frequenting that neighbourhood? A. I live within a short distance of it; I know there are some carcases - I do not know how many; I was the person who carried up the wall in her garden - the boys were not throwing bricks over into the garden while I was there; the wall I built was composed of old and new bricks - I should think four or five thousand new bricks was delivered from time to time; I do not know of any of the joints of the carcases being taken away - I have not received any money from the prisoner since she has been in custody; I did not notice whether the timber which came in the cart was such as these - I cannot tell whether the cart had one or two horses: I did not notice the same that was on it - I should not know the man who drove it; it was a fairish cart - it was bricks that came when there was the haggling about the money - I saw some old doors among the timber that came; there were some old doors - I cannot say whether there were any slates or not.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I worked for the prisoner, in building a wall; I know the five carcases, they have been standing seven or eight years; I found the bricks on the premises, which I used in building the wall - a great many of them had been used before; I did not notice whether they were such as the carcases were built with - there are a great many<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140110"></xptr>boys playing about there; but I know nothing about bricks being pulled down - I saw wood and bricks brought to the prisoner's house in a fairish sized cart, a rubbish cart; the person who brought it, does jobbing for bricklayers - I did not notice the colour of the horse, there were two at one time, and one the other - I do not know where the timbers were put in the prisoner's house - I was at my work in the back yard - the cart came by the street; I do not know any thing of the driver - I know there was a man making a dispute about some money; he was a tallish thin man - I did not notice his dress; it was some time in November - I never saw a single brick thrown from the houses while I was there.</p>

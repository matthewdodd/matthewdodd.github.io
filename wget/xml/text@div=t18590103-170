                  </hi>. I am an excavator, living at Plaistow-marshes. On Christmas eve about a quarter past 7 o'clock I came to the Fenchurch-street station—when I had got about fifty yards from the station the prisoner came up to me—she said, "I beg your pardon, sir, I thought you were my friend come to see me"—I said, "You have made a mistake this time, I am not your friend"—she said, "I am sure you must be him, for you are just like him in every way"—I said, "You are mistaken, my girl, I am not him"—she then wanted a glass of something to drink—I said, "No; I won't give you anything to drink"—when she found I would not give her any she wanted to give me some—I said, "No; I neither want you or your drink"—we walked along the street; she kept along with me—she said, "Come, let us go in somewhere"—I said, "No, I am not going in anywhere with you"—we walked together about twenty yards, and then she wanted to give me her address—I said, "I neither want you nor your address—I could not get <hi rend="italic">shot</hi> of her, so I stepped on one side to take her address, and while standing there she put her hand into my pocket and took my purse—I believe it was in my trousers pocket—she then began to run away—I said, "Stop my girl, I want you"—her companion stepped up to me, caught hold of me, and said, "That is your road, sir"—I said, "No, this is my way;" I shoved him on one side, and ran after the prisoner, and caught her just as she was going into a house—I cannot say in what street it was she had run I should think about 100 yards from where she took the purse—I caught hold of her, and the purse was in her hand—I took it out of her hand—I found it was light—I said, "Give up the remainder"—she said she had not got any other—I said, "Yes you have, for I am sure there is some gone; if you do not give it up in a minute, I will have a policeman to you—she said, "I have not got any"—I said, "Give it up"—she would not, and I called a policeman—he came down, and said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "This girl has picked my pocket of my purse, and what was in it"—my purse contained 5 sovereigns, 2 half-sovereigns, and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was so confused I could not count it at the time—I gave it to the policeman when I got to the station.</p>

               <p>minutes before she asked me to drink—I did not put my arm round her at all—she did not say that she was afraid the police might find her if any thing took place in the street—I don't recollect any such words—I swear she did not say so—I believe the purse was in my left hand trousers pocket—I am sure it was—I cannot pledge my oath of it—I know it was either in my waistcoat or my trousers pocket—I do not know the name of the place where I seized her with the purse—I mean to swear that she ran away—she ran about 100 yards, and when I came up to her she had the purse in her right hand; the policeman has it—the silver in it was three half-crowns, nine shillings, and a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I am able to swear that—I did not tell the policeman what the coins were; I told him I did not know—I have recollected since.</p>

On Christmas-eve, about half-past 7 o'clock, I took the prisoner into custody, in Weighhouse-yard, Love-lane, Eastcheap—I came up at the time the prosecutor had hold of her—he said, "This woman has robbed me of my purse, and I shall give her into custody"—I said, "Where is the purse?"—he said, "I have it here"—he had got it doubled up—I did not take the purse then, until we got to the station—there were two of her associates there at the time—she was searched at the station, and nothing was found on her—when I opened the purse, it contained 5 sovereigns, 2 half-sovereigns, half-a-crown, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—the prosecutor said, in the prisoner's presence, that there ought to be 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the purse—the streets leading from Fenchurch-street to London-bridge, are broad streets—I consider Mark-lane a broad street.</p>

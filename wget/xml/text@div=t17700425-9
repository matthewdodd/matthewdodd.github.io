            . On the 7th of March, about half an hour after eight at night, coming towards London in my chariot, my wife and my sister were with me. I saw two men on horseback; I hardly saw the first. It was about two hundred yards from a house where they had called for some gin. They commanded the coachman to stop. One of them came up to that side I sat on, put a pistol in, and demanded my money. I was on the off side. I gave him a six-and-nine-penny piece, and about eight or nine shillings in silver. On his going off he fired a pistol; whether he aimed at the coachman or not, I know not; he had threatened to shoot him. When I came to town, I went to Sir

A highwayman rode up to the chariot; he was in a plain sort of a coat and a black mask over his face, and a round hat on; his coat was buttoned to him, and the cape pulled up round his face; his horse was a lightish bay, about 14 hands high. It was very moon-light. He threatened to blow the coachman's brains out: another man came up when he had done. He then fired at us. He said something; I just looked back, and the pistol went off within a few yards of me; I heard the ball whiz on the right side the carriage. I cannot swear to the man because he had a scarfe before his face. As we came by the Britannia they were calling there for gin. I saw the second man come up from the Britannia.

            . I am a constable. When Gew was stopped, I desired him to take his hand out of his left hand waistcoat pocket; then I took out this pistol and this crape, and this horn, with some powder in it. (Produced in court). I found a sword, broke in two pieces, upon the tester of his bed. I asked him if he had any accomplice with him; he told me he had, one Marshall, and described his clothes. When he was taken he had a pistol under his left arm, and a cutlass under his right. (That pistol produced.)</p>

            . I was at Sir John Fielding's office when Gew was brought in; his girl was brought also. She gave a description of Marshall; she said he was dressed in such and such clothes; that he had a cutlass under his arm and a pistol in his pocket, and threatened to blow any body's brains out that should offer to attack him. As I was going down Prince's-street, I saw him at the end of a court talking to a person. I looked very hard at him. I went and asked Mr. Gandall's man, whether he knew the man he was after in the morning; he said he did not. Then I went back to Sir

He went up to him, and asked him if his name was Marshall; he answered it was not; he mentioned some other name. I was up with them at the same time. The person said, I beg pardon, I thought you was the person. I must beg leave to look at your waistcoat (he had been described to have a striped linen waistcoat under another, and a cutlass under that) He took up the slap of his upper waistcoat, and said, Your name is Marshall, I am sure, and said to me, Mr. Taylor, Search him. I did, and found a pistol in his right side waistcoat pocket, and a cutlass under his left arm; the pistol was not loaded. I took a brace of balls and a white crape out of his pocket.</p>

            . I live at the White-horse in Castle-street, Long-acre. On Monday, the 5th of March, the two prisoners came and hired two horses of me for the Tuesday to go to Rumford together; Marshall was the person that spoke; they were to be ready by ten o'clock at their lodgings. I had them down at the time; they returned about eleven at night. On the Wednesday they hired two more; one of them was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250015"></xptr> mare, which they did not choose to ride, and I hired one for them; they said they were to go to Greenwich: they went out about four, and came home about twelve at night. They ordered two other horses on the Saturday, and not coming in time I had let them out.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of horses did they ride the first day?</p>
               <p>Downing. They were two dark brown horses with swish tails.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they ride the second time, which was the 7th of March?</p>
               <p>Downing. One of them was one of the same horses, and the other a little chestnut, or rather a sorrel, with a swish tail.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition was the sorrel horse?</p>
               <p>Downing. In good condition. They mounted first in Wych-street; the second day in Mr. Savage's yard where I live. I remember Marshall a boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them together before?</p>
               <p>Downing. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When they mounted the second day, which horse did Gew ride?</p>
               <p>Downing. He mounted the light-coloured horse.</p>

               <p>Marshall's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of the fact. I own I had a pistol and cutlass upon me; the pistols I bought in Holborn, and took them down in my pocket. When I went to Sudbury we fired them off as we were going along. As to that caul which I had in my pocket, when I had my hair dressed I used to lie in it. We were at Rumford the first day, and the second we dined at the Bell at Dulwich. I was brought up a farmer, and had a fortune left me, a trifle a year for my life.</p>
               <p>Marshall called two people to his character; one said he was a <rs id="t17700425-9-deflabel68" type="occupation">servant</rs>

Yes; at a quarter before twelve I saw the prisoner at the bar; he had a flag basket; there appeared to be something in the basket, which turned out to be a sack; he went to the hedge about twenty yards from where those boilers were concealed; he hid the basket and took out the sack, and went to the place where the boilers were; he put them in the sack and put them on his shoulder and made off with them.</p>

At the public house, next to the office in Worship-street, he acknowledged in the presence of the prosecutor, having the sack and the boilers on his shoulders; he said he found them, and the gardener told him, they did not belong to him he then put them down and went away.</p>

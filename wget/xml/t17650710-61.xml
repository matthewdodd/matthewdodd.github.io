            . I am Constable of the parish of St. Martin's: on the 22d of June, it was my turn to go round the parish at night; we found a man in Hedge-lane had lost his watch; I laid hold of the person suspected to have taken it; but the boy made his escape: the boy at the bar, and the evidence Linnerkin appearing to belong to him, we secured them: there were several handkerchiefs found on the prisoner. Upon the handkerchiefs being found, the boys made information, that they used to sell the handkerchiefs to Mrs. Bennet; and these handkerchiefs were found in her house. (Producing seven linen handkerchiefs, of different colours, washed and ironed.) The boys have swore they sold her them; she sells old clothes. We took the evidence there; he said there lie the handkerchiefs: she acknowledged buying some of the boys, and said we might take them: she said she asked the boys how they came by them, and they said they tossed up for them.</p>

I went along with the constable from Sir John Fielding's office; when we came to the shop of Bennet, the evidence pointed up to the handkerchiefs; there were several others there: he took these out, and said he believed they sold her them, which they had stole; the woman acknowledged she had bought handkerchiefs of them, but did not know they were stole.</p>

I am stationed at West Ham—about five minutes to <hi rend="italic">i</hi> o'clock on the morning of 26th March I was on duty on the footway skirting the Great Eastern line, at West Ham—I saw the prisoner passing a piece of ground at the side of the line with something bulky on his shoulder—I ran after him up the line—he turned round and came towards me—I asked him what he had got—he said "It looks like some railway cushions"—I asked him where he got them and he said he picked them up between there and Custom House Station—I said "You could not have picked them up there as you were going along this waste piece of ground—he said he was going to Woolwich—there were four cushions—I took him to the police-station and charged him with the unlawful possession—he said again he picked them up—I went to the North Woolwich Railway Station and examined the carriages with the inspector there and found four cushions missing from one compartment—they were horsehair cushions.</p>

I saw the cushions safe in the carriages at 9 o'clock at night—about five o'clock the next morning my attention was called and I found four cushions missing—the prisoner had no right there at all—the carriages were standing in a siding at the North Woolwich Station, rather more than a mile from where the prisoner was taken—the cushions are worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the windows were up and the doors were locked at 9 o'clock the previous night, and they were all locked the next morning—the prisoner was searched; no key was found upon him; but an old nail, or anything of that kind, will, open the doors.</p>

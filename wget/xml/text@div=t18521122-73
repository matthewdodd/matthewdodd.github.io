                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Payne, of Billinghurst, in Sussex—the prisoner's sister was lodging at my house—the prisoner lived at Five Oaks, near Billinghurst; she came to see her sister three times while she lodged at my house—on the Sunday before she went to London she was at our house, and drank tea with her brother and sister—I heard her sister ask her if she was in the family way—she said no, she was not, she was quite innocent as she (her sister) was herself—she came back on 21st Oct.—she had then been in London a month come the following Monday, so that it was</p>

               <p>three weeks and four days before 21st Oct. that that conversation took place—when she returned she was in a very delicate state of health, she was just able to walk across the kitchen—I asked her what was the matter; she told me she had been ill ever since she had been in London, from catching a cold in going up by the railway—she did not say she had been confined—I attended on her—she asked for some cold water, and I did not feel that she ought to have it—I asked her if she had been to the Lying-in Hospital in London—she said she had not, she had been living at a respectable place, Mr. Whitby's, Commercial-road, Peckham—she was not able to get up next day, and I waited on her, and saw milk running out of her breasts, as if she had been delivered of a child—I moved her out of bed, and saw several stains of blood on the bed—I asked her if she had not had a baby; she said yes, she had—I asked her where it was; she told me she left it in London; that she had cut it up with a carving-knife, and forced it down the water-closet—she said it was born dead—I asked her whether her mistress knew it; she said she did not, for she scoured the water-closet all out, that her mis<lb></lb>tress should not see anything of it—next day I sent for Mr. Evershed, the surgeon, who came and examined her in my presence—on the Friday she said that where she lived at Mrs. Towsey's she filled a large copper of water (eighteen pails) for washing, during which time her baby was ready to come from her, and after that time she never felt it move till she was delivered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Camberwell—on 26th Oct. I was sent for to James's-terrace, Commercial-road, Peckham, where I saw sergeant Quinnear, who directed my attention to the privy—it had a pan and pipe to it, which were removed by Quinnear, and I saw the palm of the right hand of a child lying on the surface of the soil—Quinnear brought me afterwards the other parts of the body, the head separated into two portions, the left shoulder and arm, the right hand and fore-arm, the ribs were divided from the spine on the left side, dividing the body again between the vertebrse—there were about eighteen pieces—the right arm from the elbow to the shoulder, the brain, and the liver were deficient—the heart was there, but detached from the body—the Jungs were there, and appeared to have been inflated, they decrepitated; the hip was divided, and on comparing the left hip with the left thigh, I found that it was a female child cut up in the middle of the body.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Collins. of Somers'-town. I paid the prisoner 8s., on the 19th of July, for Mr. Cooper, on account of Mr. Collins.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.May you not make some little mistake in this? A. No - we book every thing every night; I have the bill and the receipt here - here is the bill; it is for 8s. 0 1/2d. - I put it down in the daybook, but the book is not here; I paid it on Tuesday - there is no name on the bill, but we do not mind such small things; we generally throw them into the fire - I book them the day they are paid.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who wrote this receipt at the bottom? A. The prisoner, and I have written on the back, "Mr. Cooper, bread, settled the 19th of July."</p>

            . I live with Mr. Lyle, in Mecklenburg-square, I paid the prisoner 11s. 4d. the day before he left Mr. Cooper; it was in September - I heard a complaint within two days: here are several bills, and two of them were written "Received" by me, because the prisoner said he had no pencil.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell the day of the week on which you paid these two bills? A. On the Monday; I recollect the amount.</p>
               <p>MR. COOPER re-examined. Q. When did the prisoner quit your service? A. On the 1st of October; he never accounted to me for any sum of money received from Mr. Lyle since the 1st of June.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not in consequence of looking at your book that you swear that? A. No - when I heard of it I certainly looked at my books.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you, from your memory, know that you had not received any money of him for some time? A. Yes - I had not for a month or two.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never receipted any of Mr. Lyle's bills, nor received any.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. COOPER. Q. Did the prisoner account to any other person in your family for money received? A. Yes, to my wife when I am not in the way, but we put it down every day in the book; Mr. Lyle had never run a long account before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you happen to know whether you accounted with the prisoner on the 19th of July? A. Yes, he paid me that day; the book is here - if he pays my wife she puts it down; I made out a bill to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18311020-88-person691">Lyle</persName>
             every week, and gave them to the prisoner - the last I made out was 4l. 3s. 2d.; the prisoner destroyed my bills, and made others - these bills are his writing, not mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Have you not a daughter? A. Yes, two or three: one of them used to keep my books, but she is in the country - I only know by the book what my wife has received; I never received the 11s. 4d.</p>

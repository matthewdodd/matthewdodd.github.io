               <p>Q. Do you know who went last to bed - A. I did. I fastened the doors and windows myself, and in the morning I was first up. When I came down I saw both the parlour doors open, and the drawers of the bureau spread about the floor, the secretary, and all the other drawers taken out in the other parlour and laid on the floor; the street door was open also.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your house stand by itself, or adjoining any others - A. There is a private entrance in the yard to come into the house; it is the principal entrance to my house.

               <p>Q. He is a married man - A. Yes, he lives in a room over a stable; we searched this room; we found the gun in the cieling that covered his bed room. The officer took the gun. The prisoner came home in about an hour, we took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when Townrow brought you the caddy, what did you do with the caddy - A. I kept it at home, and when we took the prisoner to Bow-street, I took the caddy there, I produced it to the magistrate, and then the officer had it. The officer's name is Salmon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. I think you said it was six o'clock when you came down stairs - A. Yes it was quite light then, I was the first person up in the house.

               <p>Q. He was indebted to you for a small sum of money, was not he - A. Not my debt, it was my father's; my father gave me the bill to carry to him, because I lived nearer than he did; I gave him the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130028"></xptr> bill about a month or six weeks ago; I met him in Oxford-street; I gave him the bill, and made demand for payment. He told me he could not pay it; then he asked me where I lived. He said he would call at my house in three weeks time. I called at his house on Sunday the 3d of May; he never called at my house on the Sunday before I had the caddy.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, before you gave the caddy to Townrow you called upon him the 3d of May he was not at home - A. I saw his wife; she told me if I would come up on Tuesday evening following I might depend upon having the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of the bill - A. Twelve shillings and four pence. I called on the Tuesday, and he could not pay me then. He was at home; he wished me to come up on the Sunday following and measure him for a pair of shoes, and then he would positively pay me. He told me he could not pay me then, he had made a caddie for a person, and that person was to call at twelve o'clock on that day, and as the person had not called that was the reason that he could not pay me. He shewed me the caddy. I left his house then, and went to Mr. Townrow; I told him what I had seen; he asked me what kind of a caddy it was; I told him. He advised me to go, and purchase the caddy.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of his advice did you go back to Goff - A. Yes, the same evening, and I met Goff's wife at the door. I told his wife if the person had not come for the caddy while I had been away I would purchase it, if he had no objection. Goff was there himself. They readily agreed for me to have the caddy. I offered to pay nine or ten shillings then besides the bill, and when I had made Goff's shoes I would pay the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that the bargain was made, was it - A. Yes. He tied the caddy in a pocket handkerchief himself, and that same hour I carried the caddy to Townrow. That is all I know of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember going with Mr. Hopkins to the house of the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, on the 6th of May. The prisoner was not at home. In searching the loft, there is a temporary room built in the loft, the top of the room does not reach the top of the loft.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a little room parted off from the loft - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The top of which does not touch the ceiling - A. It does not. On the top of this room I found a gun, between that and the ceiling.</p>
               <p>Q. So that it was not visible to the eye - A. No, it was too high; I was obliged to get up on a trunk to get it down.</p>
               <p>Q. You got up on the trunk - A. Yes, and then I saw it handed to the prosecutor the moment the prosecutor saw the gun; he said, this is my gun, I can swear to it. I have had the gun in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. The prisoner was not there - A. No. This is the gun, and these pistols I found upon the mantle-piece, they were loaded with powder and ball, (I have since drawed the charge), and a powder horn with powder and ball in it. I was not present at the apprehending of the prisoner. I was obliged to return to Bow-street to attend an examination.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I was present at the search of the house. I had the search warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose Salmon has given a true account of what was found there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehended the prisoner, did you - A. Yes, on the 6th of May; on the same day. I apprehended him in the stable, before he same up stairs, as he was coming in; I ordered him to go up stairs. I was searching his pockets, I found nothing in his pockets. He said, this is through going into bad company. I neither encouraged him, nor used any threats at all. He said, this is the instigation of being in bad company; it has brought me into this. I found these things, a dark lanthorn, and phosphorus box, before he came home, they were hid under the boards in the bed-room. One of the boards had been taken up, and was loose; I lifted up the board and found the dark lanthorn and phosphorus box, matches and skeleton keys, a picklock key, a centre bit, and a small chissel, and a wrenching tool, and some duplicates I found upon the mantle piece that I believe is his own property.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to prosecutor. When you got up about six o'clock you found your doors open, did you examine the door to see if any violence had been used to get in - A. I did. The house door was locked on the inside; he unlocked it after he got it. I left the key in the door. I could see that they got in at the window; the square of glass in the centre of the sash was broken; the sashes were double hung; the top sash came down, and the bottom sash lifted up. The lower pane of glass in the top sash was broken, so that any person by a hand might open the fastening of the sash, and when the sash was unhasped they might throw up the lower sash, and a block of wood was placed outside to enable them to get in. The tea caddy is mine; the lock was taken off, and put on again without any screw; I took the lock off to get a key to it, and put the lock on again without any screws, and it was without any screws when I found it. The gun is mine, it has a stop lock, and the same name, and the end I have had new steeled. I brought this gun into the parlour for a young man coming out of the country to clean on the Saturday; and the tea-caddy I had seen there a day or two before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking on the Saturday morning previous to my being detected on the Wednesday, I met a young man, he said he was going into the country; he asked me to put some things bye for him; I told him, I could. On the Sunday morning he brought them. When he produced the things I did not much like to have them, but did not like to deny, having promised to take care of them for him. I took up a board in the floor, and put them under. I did not like my wife's mother to see them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

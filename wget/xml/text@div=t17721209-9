            . I am servant to Mr. Mackintosh. The prisoner, who passed for a deaf and dumb woman, served the house with chips for four months; she came on Saturday night the 14th of November, about five o'clock, to see if we wanted chips; she made signs that she was ready to starve with cold; I let her sit by the fire, which she did for a quarter of an hour; she sat near a table upon which I suppose the spoon was, for a spoon was put upon that table that afternoon, which I don't recollect being removed; she staid about a quarter of an hour. A message was brought me that one of my spoons was at Mr. Wood's in the Minories; then I looked among the spoons and found one wanting.</p>

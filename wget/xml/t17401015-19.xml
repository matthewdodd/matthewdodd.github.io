I am positive I had my Watch and my Money when I went with the Prisoner into the House.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Are you sure I am the Woman?</p>
               <p>Frazier. Yes, I am certainly sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I fancy you must be mistaken; pray don't take a false Oath: When you saw me in the Compter did you know me?</p>
               <p>Frazier. Yes; and I said, that is the Woman who robb'd me.</p>

            . I live in Russel-Street; the Prisoner was my Lodger: I did not see the Prosecutor come in with her, for I was a-bed, but he went out when I was at Dinner. He asked where the Woman was, and told me she had robb'd him, and I should suffer if I did not take her; she owed me 4 s. when she went away, and paid me not a Farthing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing of what the Gentleman accuses me, and the Room was as common to every Body as it was to me; I have lost several Things out of it myself.</p>

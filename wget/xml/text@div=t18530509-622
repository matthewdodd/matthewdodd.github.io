                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband's niece. I am in the employ of Taddy and Co., tobacco manufacturers, of the Minories—the prisoner has, been employed there nearly seventeen years, to the best of my recollection,—her time to come was 11 o'clock in the morning—on Tuesday, 26th April, she came rather earlier than usual—I was sitting at my employ, and noticed that she was looking at me—she went into her place, turned her back, and stooped down; when she got up she saw me, and she broke up a few siftings of tobacco and put them in a bag—that occasioned my suspicion, and I kept my eye on her, where she sat—between 12 and 1 o'clock she went down into the cellar to cook her dinner, and I went to her place, lifted up a bag, and saw this bundle there (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in a handkerchief, and is full of tobacco—she came back from cooking her dinner just before 1 o'clock, and I said to her, "You good-for-nothing hussey, what are you going to do with this?" and showed her the bundle—she said nothing, and I thought it was my duty to go to my employers and acquaint them of it—I told Mr. Townsend, and then fetched her Into the counting-house, and the bundle—she was asked if that handkerchief was hers, and she said. "Yes"—she was asked what aha was going to do with it, and she said she was going to take it down to some man, mentioning his name—then she was asked when she was there last, and the said "Last night" (an officer was there)—I told her she had better tell the truth—I think that was when she acknowledged the handkerchief—nobody</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Taddy and Co.; there is a partner named Alexander Hatfield, and there are two others. Their tobacco works are of great extent—tobacco to a considerable amount could be taken without being missed—I have been there sixteen years—they make cigars and snuff, and work up some tons of tobacco in a week—Mrs. Milo was forewoman, it was her duty to overlook the other women, and superintend the work, but not to search—she has been employed there I believe nineteen years—here is a sample of the tobacco which was given to the prisoner to work; it has been liquored, and corresponds with that in the bundle.</p>

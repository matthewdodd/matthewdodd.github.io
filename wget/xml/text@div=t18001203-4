             sworn. - On Sunday night, the 16th of November, I apprehended the prisoner coming up Drury-lane, with a bed on his shoulder,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030004"></xptr>and a blanket and bolster; I asked him where he was going with that bed; he told me he had brought them from his lodgings; I asked him how he came to bring them away at that time of night; he said, because he could not pay his lodgings; I suspected that the bed was stolen; I sprung my rattle, and he slung the bed off his shoulder, and ran down one of the courts in Drury-lane; by some accident he tripped himself up, and I came a top of him; Lynch and another watchman came up, and assisted me, and we took the bed, blankets, and bolster, to the watch-house; the next morning Mrs. Gayner claimed the property at the watch-house. (Produces the property.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gayner. This is the bed, blanket, and bolster, that I lost.</p>
               <p>Q.Which room were these things in? - A. On the ground-floor; he lodged up one pair of stairs; the house is let to lodgers; the door was locked, here is the key that I had in my pocket, and here is the key it was opened with, which I found in the lock; it was let to a lodger that was to have come on the Monday following; the next morning I found the room-door half open.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the value of these things? - A.Thirty-five shillings for the bed, half-a-crown for the bolster, and half-a-crown a piece for the blankets; I saw the door locked at eleven at night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.This bed had been let to some person that was to come into the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you delivered the key? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That person who was to come, was to have the use of the bed, and the other furniture? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband has two houses, I believe; they were originally two houses, but are now formed into one? - A. No; it was always one house.</p>
               <p>Q.There is an open passage common to all the inhabitants of your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Does your husband live in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street; the magistrates desired me to go and see the situation of the house, to see whether it was a burglary or not; I found a common door to the house; Mr. and Mrs. Gayner lived in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Is not that a common door communicating to the lodgings, and is there not a separate door communicating to that part which is occupied by the landlord? - A. Yes; there are two doors to one house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Though there are two doors, it is all one house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going home, and a man offered me one shilling to carry this bed for him; that was at the corner of Queen-street; and as soon as I had got it upon my back, the watchman stopped me and the man run away.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH AUSTIN sworn. - I am uncle to the prisoner; I never knew that the prisoner lodged in Mrs. Gayner's house; I understand he has been there with bad women, the house is full of them; I never heard any thing against his character before, he is a shoe-maker.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Gayner.) Q.Are there any women that live in your house? - A. Yes, three; the woman that he lived with came along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner pay you any rent? - A. No, he was not a lodger.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

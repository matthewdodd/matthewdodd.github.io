                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 5, Glasshouse-street, White-chapel; I knew the deceased Julia Looney. On Sunday 21st Aug., I was sitting with her and two or three other women in Glasshouse-buildings, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the day—the prisoner came up—she attempted to put her finger into Looney's eye, and said, "You b—y young b—h, I owe it to you"—Looney said, "Do you?"—the prisoner struck her on the shoulder, and Looney resented the blow back again and hit her on the shoulder—they fought together, and the prisoner dragged Looney by the hair of her head from one side of the road to the other—I perceived that the prisoner was too much for Looney, and I parted them—Looney directly took up a handful of mud out of the gutter and dropped it on the prisoner's frock, she had on a new frock and white stockings—the prisoner was very vexed and said, "You b—y young we, I will be the death of you!"—she stooped down and picked up a handful of mud, but what was in it I do not know—she threw it at Looney, and it went on her head—I went to wipe the dirt off her head, and it was bleeding very much indeed—she had no bonnet on—she was taken into No. 5, Glasshouse-buildings—I saw her on the Tuesday following at Spitalfields workhouse, the same day that she died, and I saw her dead on the Wednesday.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner and the prosecutor—on the night the prisoner was taken up I was passing the house they live in, as near as I can guess, between twelve and one o'clock—the house is let out in tenements—I heard violent words between Hallisey's wife in the passage—she called the prisoner a b—'s son, a w—'s son, or a hang<lb></lb>man, for keeping her from going in and out through the passage—her husband came up and asked me what brought me there at that time, and said what was between them and him they could decide without me—I said, "Hallisey, did I ever offend you, or say any thing on one side or the other?"—I stood by—Hallisey asked me to go out, and I moved more to Murphy's room door, which was on my left hand side—I was in the passage at the time; Hallisey's wife went into Murphy's room door, and I went in after her—she sat on the bed by the side of Murphy, and said whatever had occurred between either of them, she knew she could cool Murphy's passion—Murphy was on the bed at the time—John Hal<lb></lb>lisey sat on the bed by the side—the prisoner's two children were in the bed, crying—I stood along-side Hallisey's wife, and Hallisey came in on my left side—Murphy told him to keep out of his sight, calling him a ruffian, and told him to keep away from him—Hallisey asked him to come out to the public-house, and have part of a pot of beer with him—Murphy <hi rend="italic">denied</hi> going out—Hallisey's wife asked him again to go out, and have beer—Murphy <hi rend="italic">denied</hi> it—Murphy said, "If I would go out and have a pint of beer with him, he had no objection—I said it was too late, as the children were then crying—with that the two men scuffled on the bed-side—I saw no more—when I came out, I saw Hallisey's wife robbing her husband's hand, and said it was nothing—I did not think it was prudent for me to see a man opening the waist of his smallclothes, so I turned on one side, and she screamed out "Murder."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he twice asked him to go and have beer, and he refused? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and Murphy said, if I would go with him to drink beer, he would have no objection—I said, no, any body who wished him well, would not wish him to go out that night—I then saw the two men scuffling at the bed-side, and I turned out at the street door—when I got to the door, I saw Hallisey's wife rubbing her husband's hands at the back, and said it was nothing—the man put his right hand in the waist of his small-clothes—I being a widow, did not think it prudent to stop to see any more—I went towards my home, for the prisoner's wife was at my house—not in my room, but in the house I lodge in—I went home to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Murphy give any reason for calling Hallisey a ruffian? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said, any body who had any thing to do with his wife in his absence, should keep out of his sight—I am certain he used that expression—I did not see any bread in the bed for the children—I have known Murphy, as near as I can guess, about sixteen years, if not better—I found him nothing but a quiet good-natured man, as far as I can understand—I have heard he was very kind to the prosecutor when he was ill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a married woman. On the Saturday night, on which the prisoner was taken up, I saw him between eight and nine o'clock, at my own door—he asked if I had seen his wife—I said I had not, and he went up stairs—I was talking to Mrs. Mahoney.</p>

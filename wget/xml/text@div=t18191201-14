            . I live at the Adam and Eve, public-house, Jewin-street; the prisoner came into my house with a Jewess; he had a bundle of clothes tied up in a handkerchief, which he untied, and offered to her for sale. It struck me, by the appearance of the clothes, that he had not come honestly by them, and I fetched an officer, told him the circumstance, and he took him into custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2d of November I was in Jewin-street; Jones called me into his taproom, and I found the prisoner there with the bundle before him. I asked him what he was going to do with the things? He said he was going to sell them. I told him he had better keep them, but he said he should do as he liked with his own property. I said by the appearance of the clothes they did not suit his person, for they belonged to a shorter man, and the waistcoat belonged to some livery servant - he said they were his own. I turned, and saw there was a Jewess in the taproom, with a pair of velveteen breeches in her hand, which Jones said he had given to her. I searched the prisoner, and found nothing on him but a snuff-box in his hat, representing a double-barrelled pistol. I took him to the Bull and Mouth, Inn, where these things were claimed.</p>

            . The prosecutor lodges with me. On the 2d of November, about eleven o'clock in the morning, he came home, brought the prisoner with him, and went into his apartment. He had not been there five or six minutes, before the prisoner came down, and said,</p>
               <p>"It is awkward for me Ma'am, for I am quite a stranger here; Mrs. Smith (meaning the prosecutor's wife) is my sister."<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010013"></xptr>He then said his poor mother laid on her death bed, that the prosecutor had been drinking, and was laying on the bed - he asked me where they got their beer from? I said I rather thought it was opposite the Castle and Falcon, tavern, in Aldersgate-street. I knew of whom they had it, but I found he had had enough, as he staggered and fell against the wainscot of the passage. He went out for the beer, came back with some a few minutes after, and went up stairs. He came down again in five or six minutes with a bundle in his left hand, and a pair of boots in his right hand, which I had seen Smith wearing a a few days before - I let him go away. About an hour after a person came from the officer, and asked for the prosecutor. I went up, and found him laying on the bed fast asleep - he was drunk. He missed his things.</p>

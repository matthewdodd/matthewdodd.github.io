                  </hi>. I am butler to Mr. Robert Tompkinson, 23 James Street, Buckingham Gate—on 15th February I retired between 11 and 12 o'clock—I slept in the pantry—I had closed the windows and locked the doors, and was the last to go to bed—between 12 and 1 o'clock I heard a shuffling sound in the kitchen—there is a small passage between the pentry and the kitchen—the kitchen door was open—I listened for a time, and than heard a creaking sound going up the kitchen stairs—they are wooden stairs—the door at the top of the kitchen stairs was open—at the end of the</p>

               <p>sage into which this door from the kitchen opens, there is another door leading into the back garden—I heard those doors opened—I listened again and raised myself up in bed, and called out, "Who's there?" three times, as loud as I could—there was no answers—then I heard the bolt of the outer garden door, which goes rather hard, and then heard the lock of the same door—it was both bolted and locked—I did not hear the door closed—I heard then a sound as if some one was putting on their shoes—I never left the pantry—about two or three minutes afterwards the area bell was rung—I got up as soon as I could, went to the area door, and saw Policeman 462, who drew my attention to a broken square of glass in the area window of the scullery—it is in the front of the basement—it is higher than the front of the house—a flight of steps leads into the garden—the scullery-window is secured by bars inside—I cannot say whether it would be possible for any<lb></lb>body to get in between the bars if a pane had been removed—they are about 61/2 inches apart—under the broken window I found a coat—there was nothing disturbed and nothing missing—the door at the top of the kitchen stairs, the inner door, and the garden door were all three open—shortly afterwards a communication was made to me by another constable, and I went to the police-station and found the prisoner there.</p>

About 1 a.m. on 16th February I was at Buckingham Gate, and heard the smashing of glass in James Street—I went there; it is about 200 yards distant, and leads into Buckingham Gate—I found the scullery window in the area of No. 28 had been broken—I found this coat lying under the window—the bars were straight in their place—they were 61/2 inches apart and inside the window—I rang the bell, and McAuliffe came to the door—before that, I had com<lb></lb>municated with another constable—I and McAuliffe and the other constable went through the house and made an examination—there are some stairs leading from the kitchen into the passage, and a door at the top of the stairs was open—on the handle of the kitchen door we found marks of blood—there is another door at the end of the passage, on the handle of which we found blood; also on the handle of a door leading into the garden, and in the scullery where the window was broken—there was a spot of blood on this; duster (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was lying on the table near the window—I after<lb></lb>wards received a communication from the police-sergeant, and went to the station with McAuliffe—the prisoner was in custody; he had no coat on—I found no implements for cutting glass on him or for housebreaking.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman B</hi> 163). On Sunday morning, February 16th, I was in Catherine Street, which runs at the back of the houses in James Street—Catherine Place has access to the public thoroughfare, and the backs of the houses in James Street open there—I went into Catherine Place, received information from another constable, and remained there—the houses, in James Street skirt Catherine Place—the backs of Catherine Street lead, to the backs of James Street—the backs of James Street are on one side, and on the other of Catherine Street—the two streets are parallel, with Catherine Place between them—I heard a noise at the backs of the James Street gardens, like some one climbing walls—I then heard the back gate of 12, James Street tried—I secreted myself under a wall in Catherine Place</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903030028"></xptr>
               <p>I heard a paling snap, and then saw the prisoner in his shirt-sleeves upon a wall about 12 feet high in Catherine Place; the back-garden wall of No. 12 James Street—he made a spring into the back garden of 5, Catherine Place, about six yards from where I stood—the wall runs to the back of Catherine Place—there is no street between the two gardens; the wall runs between them—I apprehended him upon the spot, and said, "What have you been doing over the wall?"—he made no reply—I called out for assistance—another constable came, and we took him in custody—while I was single-handed, he pulled himself away from me, and then I called for assistance—we took him to the station, where I saw a large cut on his right hand—it had been bleeding—shortly afterwards, McAuliffe and the constable came to the station together, bringing this coat—the pri<lb></lb>soner, when being examined before the Magistrate, said, "May I have my coat, your Worship?"—he pointed to the coat lying on the table, which McAuliffe had brought to the station—that was said about the middle of the case—the Court was not draughty; I did not feel the cold.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant B</hi>). I examined the premises at 28, James Street on Sunday morning, 16th February, about 10.30—in the scullery window in the area the glass of the second pane had been removed, and the entry was effected by a person getting in between the first and second ban—the interval between the bars was 61/2 inches—they are 4 feet 2 inches long with no centre-piece, so that with pressure they would give to the body by a person entering feet first—at the back I found marks on the wall of this house—the top bar of the window is fixed outside—the remaining five bars are inside—the width between them is 6 1/2 inches, but the pane is 2 feet 2 inches by 12 inches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The broken window was totally out—there was a mark as if a knife had been inserted—the putty was taken out and there was broken glass—I found no instrument—the bars would bend or give; I tried them myself—I did not get through them—when the prisoner was locked up he had two great-coats given him by the inspector because he was wet through—at the police-court he was in his shirt-sleeves—the pane of glass had been cut from the outside—an expert man could get out there as well as he could get in.</p>

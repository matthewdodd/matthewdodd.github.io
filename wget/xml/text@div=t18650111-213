                  <hi rend="italic">Harrison's Defence.</hi> The only evidence against me is my getting into the cab containing the stolen property. I will explain how I came to be there. I was walking down Carnaby-street, and was stopped by a man named Fisher. He called a cab, and drove me to the Prince of Prussia. On being asked inside I went with him to Lower John-street, where Goldstine was. I then went with them to the other public-house, and I was asked by them to ask if a parcel might be left there, and I did, not knowing the property was stolen. I wish my employer to speak as to my character. I believe he is in Court. The woman living in Berkeley-street positively said at the Police-court that she did not know the other man who came, and now she says that she believes it was me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gordon's Defence.</hi> I am a barman. I left home about four months ago, and had plenty of money, which I had saved. I have never been in such a place before, and when I get out I will never come again. I can assure you I am innocent. I was walking in Carnaby-street, and met Streeton, and he said, "Will you have a ride?"He called a cab, and going along, I said to him, "What have you here?" He said, "Cloth." I said, "Where did you get it from?" He said, "From the Goswell-road." When we got to Poland-street we met Harrison, and he said, "You are to drive to Golden<lb></lb>square." They then said, "You had better ride outside," and I did. After we got to the Duke of Clarence, they took the cloth inside, and treated the cabman. I then said, "I am going home to dinner." Streeton said, "We</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501110121"></xptr>
               <p>are going all the same way, we are going to the Prince of Prussia, Golden<lb></lb>square, because I have a friend to meet." We went there, and waited, and Inspector Potter came and charged all of us with the robbery, which I am innocent of. It was committed by Streeton and another man named G. Fisher, as I have heard since I have been in the House of Detention. I never saw the cabman till I saw him in Carnaby-street, neither did I give him any cloth, on my oath. The cloth was taken to Goldstine's place at King's-cross.</p>

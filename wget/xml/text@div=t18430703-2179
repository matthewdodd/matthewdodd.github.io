I was on duty in East Ham, on the morning of the 27th of June—I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Maxwell's yard, with a wagon loaded with new potatoes—in consequence of what I had heard I stopped him, and asked what he had got on the wagon beside potatoes—he said victuals for his horses—the constable with me found on the wagon a sack, with about two bushels and a half of mixed corn in it, and another sack, containing about one bushel and a half of clear oats, was under the fore-ladder of the wagon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of William Maxwell, and live with him at East Ham—the prisoner worked for my father. On a Sunday, about the 16th or 18th of June, I found some oats concealed in one of the granaries, where we hardly ever went—on the Tuesday after I missed some oats, and on the Monday after that I missed more—I told the officer, and we put some small pieces of paper, with the letter "M" on them, doubled up among the oats—I saw the oats produced by the policeman, and on examining them I found the same bits of paper—the prisoner had no authority to take them out for his horses—he had mixed corn besides—he had lived with my father ten months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had got very little mixed corn, and was going to mix this when I baited. I was going a long journey; the horses had had green victuals, and did not care to eat corn: but they would eat this when they were out. Mr. Maxwell said, if the horses did not look well he would take the allowance off me.</p>

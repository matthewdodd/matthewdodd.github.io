                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that this was not a forgery at common law; there was no doubt that the making, or alteration of another man's instrument would be a forgery at common law, but the evidence in this case hardly supported that proposition; the mere uttering of the labels could be no prejudice to Mr. Bor<lb></lb>wick; they were only the vehicles in which certain powder was enclosed and passed off to the public; there was no evidence that the labels were uttered as genuine papers, but only that the powder was alleged to be Mr. Borwick's; if this was to be held a forgery, the same might be held as to any compound, per<lb></lb>fume, or article of manufacture which had become well known to the public, the name of which was almost synonymous with the article itself, as a "Brougham," or a "Wellington," or "Morison's Pills;" if there had been any patent for the article, it would be the subject matter of an injunction in Chancery, but it could hardly be held to be a subject for a criminal prosecution; as to the baking powder, there was a fatal variance between the original and that alleged to be a forgery; in the former, there were the words, "the public are requested to see that each packet is signed George Borwick, without which none are genuine;" in the latter those words were omitted; how, then, could that he said to be a forgery of Mr. Borwick's labels; to be a forgery it must bear such a resemblance as would impose upon persons of ordinary caution, which this was not calculated to do; as to the egg powder label, there was also a difference in type. The evidence amounted to no more than a making use of the name of Borwick to indicate the use of the powder, in the same way as the names of Brougham or Wellington would indicate the articles whose names they bore; in the case of Reg. v. Closs, the Court of Criminal Appeal had held that the writing upon a picture the name of "Linnell" was not a forgery, and that case was precisely similar to the present.</hi>

SLEIGH</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in reply, requested the Court to bear in mind that this was not an indictment under any statute, but simply a charge of forgery at common law, which, he contended, this case could not amount to; it was identical with Reg. v. Closs; there was no difference between the packet of powder and the picture; the name of "Borwick" on the powder was a mere arbitrary mark of the maker, in the same way as the name of Linnell on the picture, or as the name of Mordan on a pencil, or Manton on a gun.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that this case was perfectly distinct from the case of Reg. v. Closs, because that proceeded, as had been stated, entirely upon the fact of a picture not being a document; this case seemed to come within the ordinary definition laid down in the text books, of forgery at common law, and although he was not aware of the same case having occurred previously, he would not stop the case here; but if it was wished, he should not object to reserve the point for the Court of Criminal Appeal. In leaving the case to the Jury, he stated that the question for them was, whether this was a document so framed as to be calculated to deceive persons of ordinary observation, and to make them believe that it was a genuine document, and whether the prisoner forged that paper, intending to defraud the different parties by so deceiving them.</hi>

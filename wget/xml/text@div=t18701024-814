                  </hi>. I am assistant-storekeeper at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum—Mrs. Brindley was cook there, Eliza Gorman was kitchen-maid, and Mary Ann Gorman was a nurse—tea, sago, rice,</p>

               <p>arrow-root, and things of that description were served out to Brindley daily—on Friday, 30th September, Mary Ann Gorman was about to leave the Asylum—I do not know whether she was not in health—her luggage was sent down to the store-room, with a pass from the matron—I had to give another past for the luggage to go to the porter—I did so, and it was taken to the porter about 2 o'clock, on the Sunday afternoon—on the Saturday morning in consequence of information, that luggage was fetched back to the Store Yard—I sent for Mary Ann Gorman, and it was opened in a police sergeants presence—I took from the hamper, packages of sago, rice, sugar, arrow root, and split peas, wrapped in pieces of linen and calico, such as the patients' clothing is made of—there was no key to the box, the sergeant uncorded it, and we found four cotton print dresses, a pair of stays, three pocket handkerchiefs, petticoats, towels, a small looking-glass, and two parcels, one of which was a brown paper bag, such as used in the Asylum, con<lb></lb>taining 5 or 6 lbs. of tea; the other was an apron tied up, with from twelve to sixteen yards of tape and filleting, which is material used in the Asylm—it contained about 5 lbs. of tea, and 2 lbs. of soap—before opening the parcels, I spoke to her and inquired of her what she said—I sent for Brindlej, who came, and I then said "Gorman says you gave her the parcel, Mrs. Brindley," referring to the brown paper parcel—she said "I did nothing of the kind, how dare you say so?"—Gorman said that she did, and Brindley said "I had possession of the parcel to take care of for you till you went home, if that is what you mean"—Brindley said that it was given to her to take care of by Eliza Ann Gorman, who was there at the time—I said "What of this parcel," the white paper one—she said ", My sister also gave me that"—Brindley said that she bought it in London, and gave it to her siter to take home to her mother—I keep the key of the principal store, and see the whole of the provisions weighed out, and they are <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> from the slides to the stores—the tea and soap are of precisely the same character as that used in the Asylum, and the articles of clothing are marked.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi>). On Saturday, 1st October, I saw this hamper and box examined—a brown paper parcel was taken out when Brindley came—I have heard Mr. Clark examined, his statement is correct—I heard E. A. Gorman say that she bought the tea and soap in London to send to her mother—there were twelve or fourteen yards of tape round the parcel when she said that—this is the County Lunatic Asylum.</p>

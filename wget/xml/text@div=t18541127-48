On Monday, 6th Nov., we were making fireworks—we had not been making them all day on Sunday—we did not begin before Sunday night—I was in the down stairs room—there are two rooms up stairs, and two down—my mother and the young woman who did it, Elizabeth Ford, were also in the down stairs room—Ford was finishing a squib—there was a tallow candle on the table—it was not a very large table, a little bigger than this desk (<hi rend="italic">the Judges desk</hi>)—my mother, myself, and Ford were working at the table—there was nothing round the flame of the candle—there were some snuffers there—I saw Ford snuff the candle with her fingers—I suppose the snuff burnt her fingers, and she dropped it on the table, on an unfinished cracker—it set the cracker alight—there were some more fireworks on that table, and some upon another table—there was a blow up in the room—Elizabeth Ford was not killed; she is in the hospital, doing nicely—my mother died in the hospital, from the injuries she received—my sisters were upstairs in bed; they were killed—my father was in the yard—he was not in the room at the time.</p>

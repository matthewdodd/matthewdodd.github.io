                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Pen<lb></lb>nington-street, St. George's. On the 7th of April, about half-past four o'clock I was pressing through a crowd on Tower-hill—there were several mountebanks or conjurors there—on seeing two policemen approach to disperse them, the crowd rushed towards the iron railing—I had not been standing still two or three minutes, before I felt something pressing close against me—I saw the prisoner standing close against me, with his coat thrown open over my waistcoat, so as to prevent any one seeing what he was doing—I saw my watch in his hand—it had a guard to it, which was round my neck, and kept it fixed to my person—I beckoned to a police<lb></lb>man on the opposite side, who immediately came and took him into custody.</p>

We went to go to tea about six o'clock, and my wife went to look for the spoons, and there was only one tea spoon there, and there were three put into the drawer; we missed all the spoons there but one, we missed two table spoons, and two tea spoons; after that I was advised to go to Marlborough-street, to take a warrant on suspicion, accordingly I did, and I went to Tottenham-court-road to enquire where he lived, and I found he lived at one Clark's, a broker, at the bottom of Tottenham court-road, while me and the constable were waiting there, he came with the load of chairs, which he went for, and then after that he left the chairs, and we were going to Marlborough-street with him, but before that the constable examined him, took him up to his lodgings, the two pair of stairs back room, and there was nothing at all on him, then we were going to Marlborough-street, and we met the justice, we then returned home again and let him go home with the chairs, and from there we went with him to St. Giles's watch-house, after that we came back again, and I came up to the door where he lodged, he was put into the watch-house, and his wife was coming out with something in her apron, I called to the constable, and he came up to her and told her he wanted to speak to her, and they came up stairs, and I followed after, the woman went up first, and the constable next to her, after that I followed and as soon as she got into the room, she throwed the table spoons out of window.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>I am constable of St. Giles's parish. On the 9th of July Mr. Wilson came to me for to serve a warrant on Mr. Hayes the prisoner at the bar, accordingly I went to the bottom of Tottenham-court-road, waited there a few minutes, and saw Mr. Hayes come with a load of chairs on his back; I told him that I had a warrant against him, on suspicion of taking some spoons away.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where his wife was at that time? - No, I did not I searched him and found nothing at all on him, I went up into his room, and found nothing there that could lead to any discovery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his wife there? - No, from thence I was going to Marlborough-street, the magistrate was going, from the office; I let him go home with his chairs then, and then I took him to the watch-house for that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he an opportunity of going up stairs in that time? - No, after I had left him in the watch-house, Mr. Wilson was afraid he should never see his spoons any more, I told him I would call at the house and see if we could see his wife, accordingly we went and knocked at the door, twice or thrice, and we saw the prisoner's wife come out of the shop door, and going across Tottenham-court-road; seeing a woman and thinking it was Mrs. Hayes, I called to her, says I, Mrs. Hayes, I want to speak to you, we went into the passage, says she what do you want with me, I told her if she had no objection I wished to go up and look into her room; she asked me what I had done with her husband, I told her that he was in the watch-house, we went up stairs, as soon as ever we entered the room the window being up, the under sash being up, she put her hand in her apron, which was thrown over her arm, she took these two spoons from her apron, and she threw them out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110031"></xptr>of the window, she then said now what do you want with me? I called to an officer that was on the stairs, and told him to take care of this woman; I could see where one of the spoons were and stood in the room, I gave the woman into the constables custody, I went down, and by the help of a ladder, I got over a small building that was in the yard over some tiles. I found these two table spoons which I saw her throw out of the window, I took them, and kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Court to Wilson. Look at these spoons. - They are my spoons I know them by the cypher, it is my own cypher, I. E. W.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner's wife at all at your house? - Yes, she was, she came to the stairs, but was never in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up and down stairs, so you cannot say? - I was not up the stairs while she was in the house, she only came to call him to fetch this load.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Wilson asked me if I had a bed key, I told him no, and I went out to get one.</p>
               <p>Court to Wilson. What has his character been? - I know very little of his character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I could not get a bed key, Mr. Wilson got a bed key before me; when I came in I went up and assisted him to put up a bedstead, with that I had orders to go down to Mr. Parker's, the pawnbroker, in Fleet-street, to carry some chairs to Margaret-street, so with that when I came by my own door, Mr. Cole told me that they had a warrant for me.</p>
               <p>Court to Constable. What is his character? - I never heard any thing amiss of him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw any thing of the spoons, nor nothing, no more if I was to die for them this very moment.</p>
               <p>Court to Cole. Did he go with you readily? - He did.</p>

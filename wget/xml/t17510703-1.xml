            . I am a watchman in the Tower ward: On the 18th of June, about 11 o'clock at night, I was at the bottom of St. Dunstan's-hill, the prisoner came towards me, and made a stop about ten yards from me. I went to him and ask'd him what he had got, he said, seeds. I set down my lanthorn, and took him by the collar; he jump'd away from me and ran up the hill. I pursued him, he fell down at the bottom of St. Mary's-hill, and was taken. The sugar was produced in court, and weighed 114 pound, the sack was mark'd COURT. I had light enough by my candle to know him again.</p>

            . I am employed by Alderman Bethel at the water-side; there was a hogshead of Mr. Thomason's plunder'd about that time, it had lost 125 pounds; it stood in a ware-house at Wiggens's key, which is cross the street from Wiggens's key.</p>

               <p>Taylor. No, my Lord, I was not: the persons that weighed it are not here.</p>

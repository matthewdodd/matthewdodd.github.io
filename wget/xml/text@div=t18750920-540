I am the wife of the last witness—on Thursday, 12th August, I was out with my husband between 11 and 12 o'clock—we saw the prisoner at the Gipsy Queen, he called us in—we had some drink there and then went to a beershop, then to the Thurloe and afterwards to the Horns, drinking at some of the places during the day—I remember the prisoner asking if we knew of a chemist's shop, that was after we came out of the public-house opposite the chemist's—my husband told him there was one there and he went across to it, he came out again but did not say whether he had got anything or what he went after—we came out of the Horns about 5 o'clock or it might be a little after—I tumbled down and cut my eye—we afterwards went home to our house—Mrs. Hudson came in to dress my head—the prisoner gave us some stuff out of the bottle and then he asked Mrs. Hudson if she would have some and she partook of it, he gave her some out of the glass, the same as we had—after that he said she had better go indoors, and when she got to the door he said she had better have a drop more and he gave her the bottle and she drank out of it and went indoors—after she' had drank it he said "La, ma'am, you have drunk enough to kill a pig," and he turned round into the house and put the bottle in his pocket—after he had gone I was taken ill, I fell off the chair on to the floor—I got my fingers in my mouth and my jaw got <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi>, and I could not get them out again—Dr. Harris came and attended to me—I am getting quite right now—when the prisoner gave us the stuff he said "You had better drink it and <hi rend="italic">get</hi> upstairs"—I understood him that he was a</p>

I am a surgeon at Lower Norwood—on Thursday evening, 12th August, I was sent for to No. 6, Providence Place; it was about 6.20 when I got there—I found Mrs. Hudson on the floor; she appeared to be in great abdominal pain—I could not at that moment tell what from—she said a doctor at No. 10 had given her some medicine; I then saw a spasm, accompanied with an arching of the back—I recognised that as a symptom of poisoning by strychnine—I immediately went for an emetic—I was only gone a minute and a half or two minutes, but she was dead before the emetic could be raised to her lips—she died just before I reached the door—I had taken a-boy with me, who ran on in front—on the Friday I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the heart was empty, and from the appearances I was able to form an opinion that death was consistent with poisoning by strychnine—I saw no other cause of death—an overdose of strychnine would quite account for the appearances I saw—in my judgment that was the cause of death—the stomach was almost empty—I took it out and tied it securely at the esophagus, and the intestines also; they were very nearly empty—the stomach was done up and sent to Dr. Muter—on the same Thursday evening, from what I heard after Mrs. Hudson was dead, I went in to No. 10—I found the prisoner there and Mr. and Mrs. Taylor—the prisoner was the worse for drink; he was slightly intoxicated—Taylor was much worse, and Mrs. Taylor exceedingly so—the prisoner knew perfectly what he was about—I asked him if he had given Mrs. Hudson anything—he said "No, but I have been doing all I could for these poor creatures, who are drunk," or something of that kind—I examined Taylor at once; I did not then see any marks of poisoning by strychnine—about</p>

               <p>three-quarters of an hour afterwards I did, the arching of the back—I administered an emetic to him; the prisoner had left then—I gave Taylor two emetics; he vomited—I took possession of the vomit, put it into a bottle, and it was sent to Dr. Muter—Mr. Taylor did not appear to be Buffering so much from the strychnine as her husband; the symptoms were less marked, simply spasm—I saw no characteristic arching; the spasms were consistent with her having had a mild dose of strychnine in solution—being under the influence of liquor it might not act so powerfully; they are perfectly well now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have never used strychnine as a remedy for intemperance, or known it so used; it is a valuable tonic—I believe it has a counteracting effect, but it is not used as a remedy—I am familiar with Dr. Taylor's work on "Medical Jurisprudence"—I quite agree with this at page 176, ninth edition: "Of the appearances observed in poisoning with strychnine there are none which can be considered strictly characteristic"—there are none taken by themselves, but there are other certain symptoms, taken with other facts, which help to bring the cause of death to a decision—there might be a spasm and an arching not due to strychnine—the symptoms before death, taken with certain appearances after death, would in my mind leave no doubt—the appearances after death alone I should say are not conclusive—I have no experience of the fatal effects of strych<lb></lb>nine in the human body—I believe it has been known to be as short as fifteen or twenty minutes—in Taylor's case it was over an hour before the symptoms showed themselves—it was very nearly 6.30 when I saw Mrs. Hudson dead—the case of Dr. Warner cited by Dr. Taylor, where death took place in twenty minutes, would, I think, be one of the most rapid fatal cases—you did not seem to be in any baste <hi rend="italic">to go</hi>, or to be trying to avoid me—I don't think I noticed that your legs were at all constricted or bowed—I noticed a slight stagger, as though you had been drinking—lock-jaw is a light symptom of poisoning by strychnine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant P</hi> 35). From information I received on this Thursday evening I went to the London, Brighton and South Coast Station at Lower Norwood, and found the prisoner on a seat at the platform—I told him I should have to take him to the station for causing the death of a woman named Hudson, and also with attempting to administer poison to two other persons—he said "I know nothing about it"—I took him to the station, and he was charged with causing Mrs. Hudson's death by administering to her a poisonous draught, namely, strychnine, and also with attempting the deaths of two other persons with the same poison—he said "I had been drinking with Taylor and his wife, and I did administer' strychnine to them in a wine glass of water; the deceased woman Hudson I know nothing about"—he wished me to take that down, and I did so—I searched him and found this small medicine bottle in his inside breast coat pocket; there was about a table—spoonful of a white liquid in it—I gave it to Inspector Dorgan—the prisoner said, when I took the bottle from him, that it contained strychnine—I afterwards went to 10, Providence Place; I found Taylor and his wife both ill—this wine glass was on the mantelpiece; I gave it to the inspector—the prisoner was very drunk and very excited at the station—I visited him in the cell at 1 o'clock in the morning; he then said that he had been a great drinker, and had been in the habit of taking strychnine to deaden the drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Kennington Road—I am public analyst for the parish of Lambeth—I received this jar and other things—the medicine bottle was sealed up—I examined the solution in it; there was about a tea-spoonful in it, about one fluid drachm—it was a solution of strychnine; that is in the pharmacopea as a medicine—it is a powerful tonic—the mixed official dose is 10 drops—it is of a recognised strength—I should say that a teaspoonful might be enough to kill; that would be 60 drops—a medicine of that kind requires to be administered with proper care and skill; it is one of the medicines scheduled in the Poisons Act that a chemist has no right to sell without a doctor's prescription, or registering the name and address of the person to whom he sells it—the stone jar was sealed; it contained a stomach—there was a very small quantity of fluid in it; I should say not much over a tablespoonful, if that—I examined that, and found it contained strychnine—I did not weigh the quantity, it appeared so very small—I examined the bottle containing the vomit; that was sealed with red wax—I found it contained sulphate of zinc and strychnine, and a large quantity of alcohol—sulphate of. zinc is used as an emetic—I have read that alcohol will deaden the effect of strychnine—a large quantity of strychnine taken on an empty stomach would cause death more rapidly; if taken with food, its effects would be diminished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> All that I can say is that I found sufficient strychnine in the stomach to give me a well-marked test of its presence, but not of its quantity—I believe I said before the Magistrate that I found a trace of strychnine; anything that we do not weigh we are accustomed, in chemical language, to call a trace—whether I should expect to find more than a trace in the case of a fatal dose would depend very much upon the time it had been in the body, and whether the person vomited or not—no change in the body after death affects the presence of strychnine—if vomiting took place there would not be time for it to be absorbed; if there was no vomiting, and no letting out of the contents of the stomach by accident, I should expect to find more than a trace—I could not succeed in isolating a fatal dose—I could not give any opinion as to there being a</p>

               <p>fatal dose in the vomit; I did not find sufficient to be a fatal dose—in poisoning by strychnine you would have to take the symptoms before death in connection with the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> alone is not sufficient—I don't say that the symptoms alone are not sufficient; I think the symptoms are very well marked, but I never saw a person die from strychnine—my knowledge is derived from reading, and from seeing animals die—I believe the symptoms are much the same; there are certain marked symptoms peculiar to strychnine—I heard Dr. Harris' evidence—I do not think the appearances described by him are consistent with death from natural decay aecelerated by insufficient nutrition—I am conversant with the action of sulphate of zinc—it does not cause pain in the abdomen; it is rejected the moment it is taken, when taken as an emetic—I should say two doses might have a tendency to cause pain in the abdomen; if takes in small doses it is an irritant—pain in the abdomen is a well-known symptom of poisoning by sulphate of zinc—I do not think it would account for characteristic convulsions.</p>

                  </hi>. On Thursday evening, 3d March, I went to my till and found a bad shilling—it was a very bright-looking one—next evening, as I was in the parlour, Smart handed me a half-crown—I came into the shop and asked the prisoner if she had brought that half-crown—she said "Yes"—I said I thought it my duty to have her locked up—she said she was a respectable, hard-working woman, and lived at 6, Warwick-street—I said, "Well, I should be sorry to lock you up if I find you respectable; I will go with you to 6, Warwick-street"—when we got to Warwick-street she crossed over to Denbigh-street—I said "That is not the way"—she said, "I shall go this way"—I saw, a constable and gave her into custody and handed the half-crown and shilling to him—she then gave her address as 6, Regent-street, and when asked again, she said, "Find out."</p>

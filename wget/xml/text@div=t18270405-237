            . I live in London-house-yard. Saunders is my apprentice; on the 17th of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I accused him of having property not his own; he denied it - I said, "Walk up stairs with me, and what you have which is not your own, give me." I went up, and found a book, a shawl, and two silk handkerchiefs - I said, "Give them to me to carry to Mr. Atkinson." I went there, but he was gone to bed - I took them to the night constable, and had Saunders secured: he then said George, who lived at Mr. Atkinson's, had given them to him to dispose of as well as he could. Mr. Atkinson afterwards saw them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Chaplin and Home, and live in Corn<lb></lb>bury-street, Old Kent-road. On the 3rd of May, about a quarter-past six o'clock in the morning, I saw two men walking backwards and forwards in the Dover-road, close to Mr. Clarke's shop—one of them took off his top coat, hung it before his legs, and close by the area grating—the other one came behind him, lifted up the grating, and somebody from below put out a large sack—the one who lifted it up put it on his shoulder, and walked towards Napier-street—the prisoner was not one of those men—he was about fifteen yards from the place with a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he saw the men coming with the bag, opened the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-door, and the person who had it put it into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I informed the police—I had seen the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> standing there for about five minutes—the prisoner could see what they were doing, if he was looking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You stated before the Magistrate that I was half-way down Napier-street. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said your <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was a little way down the street—I do not know the length of Napier-street—I believe you were fifteen yards off Napier-street—I was about 11 yards from the shop, and you were about two yards down the street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the morning of the 15th April I received information, went towards Napier-street, and saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> which the prisoner was driving towards Kent-street—I saw a man running alongside the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I called to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man to stop—I was in my police dress—he was near enough to hear me, but drove on—the man by the side of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went off in another direction—I followed the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, stopped it in Long-lane, and asked the prisoner what he had got—he said he did not know—I asked where he had got it from—he said it was put into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in Napier-street—I asked by whom—he said by two men who employed him in Aldersgate-street—I took him to the station, and found the property stated, in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I produce it—Napier-street is about twenty yards from Mr. Clark's shop—there are four houses in Napier-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to Charles Clarke, a draper, in the Dover-road. On Thursday morning I went to the station and found these goods, I know them to be my employer's—I had locked the premises the night before, about half-past nine o'clock, and went away—I did not sleep there—next morning I was called up by one of the young men, and found the shop had been entered by the grating window, through the area, the silk all taken off the rollers, and the shawl drawer open—the maid-servant had been in the shop before me—she lives in the house—she is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Two gentlemen ordered me over the water, and told me to wait in Napier-street till they came to me; they brought a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and told me to drive over to Bermondsey Church, and took my number at the same time; I drove off, and when the policeman called me I stopped—a per<lb></lb>son two yards off cannot see the house.</p>

            ; on the 21st of October, between four and five in the afternoon, I was employed in serving two ladies with sprigged muslin at the end of the counter, near the street door, the prisoner came in and enquired for some clear lawn.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner? - I am positive of it; one of our young men waited upon her close to me, and shewed her the clear lawn, I saw him, and she bought either an eighth of a yard, or a quarter, and gave him a shilling in change, and he was rather suspicious of the shilling not being good, and he left her and went to the window facing the street.</p>
               <p>And was this young man and the prisoner further in the shop than you were? - They were, the prisoner passed me when she came in; he came close to me while he went to look at the shilling; I was busily employed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200131"></xptr> in serving a customer, and I thought, I had a kind of a side view of her, and I thought she caught up something, I could not tell what.</p>
               <p>Could not you distinguish at all what it was, whether it was black or white? - No, I absolutely could not, nor whether it belonged to her or us, I could see her catch at something quite quick, but I could not discern the colour of it at all.</p>
               <p>But you had very little doubt at that time, but she must have taken up something? - Why really I thought she must have taken up something belonging to us, or else she would not have taken it in that manner; and she immediately walked forwards towards the door, at this door there was a chair fixed to keep it open, she stood there just against the chair expecting to have the change; I did not know how to proceed, not knowing whether she had anything belonging to us or not, but I stared her pretty full in the face, at which she seemed to be much confounded, and she began to work something that appeared like a bundle under her cloak, to work it, to drop it down behind, and I immediately stepped round to her, and the piece of muslin dropped down behind her.</p>
               <p>Did you see that it dropped from her? - I saw it drop from her.</p>
               <p>Had she a cloak on? - She had a black mode cloak.</p>
               <p>Where did it seem to drop from? - From under her cloak, I saw it when it fell.</p>
               <p>Was there any other woman near her when it dropped? - There was a Lady that my brother was serving.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that it dropped from her? - Positive, I had hold of her by the arm, I could positively swear to her, I knew it to be my muslin.</p>
               <p>By what marks do you swear to it? - By the private marks, and the quantity, and the letter mark, which was nine yards seven-eights, 6. F. a stroke and a B.</p>
               <p>Were these marks in your hand writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you measured it yourself before? - Yes, I saw it about five minutes before the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>She was not out of your shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott, Prisoner's Council. Have you been here before this sessions, in any prosecution of this kind? - Not any.</p>
               <p>Is this woman a stranger at your shop? - I cannot swear positively that I ever saw her before.</p>
               <p>Had she a capuchin on? - She had a cloak on.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive she had any thing under her arm, at the time she came into your shop? - She had a bundle.</p>
               <p>You have said when she got further into the shop, you had a kind of side view of her, and you thought you saw her take something up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Pray if you thought you saw her take something up, how came it you did not think proper to speak to her at that time? I spoke to her two minutes after.</p>
               <p>It is a little extraordinary to me, you did not charge her directly? - I was willing to go upon sure ground, there were other customers in our shop.</p>
               <p>Then you saw her take it? - I could not be positive.</p>
               <p>You believed so? - I thought so.</p>
               <p>You presumed so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I cannot get over one particular of your evidence, that at the time you saw her take something which you now call muslin; it is a little extraordinary to me, that you should not in the first instance have told the woman of it? - I could not well speak sooner to her, for she had to walk round to the chair at the door, by my staring at her she was much confounded.</p>
               <p>I am not much surprized at an innocent poor woman being a little confounded at the manner you have described, I fancy it is enough to bring a blush in an honest woman's countenance; you have thought proper to lay this indictment capitally, therefore I would have you a little cautious as to the manner of your giving your evidence? - I shall give it true.</p>
               <p>Had she a bundle? - She had.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200132"></xptr>What was the contents of this bundle that the woman had? - I declare I forget now, it was a jacket or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Was there several articles? - No, there was not, there were two, the bundle was opened at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Jury. There was no muslin in that? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my council.</p>
               <p>(The muslin produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. When this dropped from her, how was it, was it loose? - It was open.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is a large bundle to lay open, therefore I wish to look at the muslin, to see whether it was so easily opened.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not your boy come? - He is at home, he did not see her take it.</p>

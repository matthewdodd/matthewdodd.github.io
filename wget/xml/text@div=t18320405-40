            . I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner, and told her it was for robbing her brother's lodger; I took a man of the name of Badger - the prisoner followed us, and asked if her brother had given me in charge; I said No - she said, "If he has given me seven years, I will give him fourteen;" I then said I had got Badger - she said, "Poor George, but he is innocent, I did it all myself;" I had mentioned what the things were, and Mr. Sadler's name - Badger was afterwards discharged; I found none of the lodger's things, but some of her brother's things were found - she had been living with Badger in a court near the Seven-dials; I took her on Thursday, the 8th of March - I believe Badger had been in the habit of coming to the house to see her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave myself up to the Policeman - I am innocent of these things; I pawned two or three of my brother's things - I went to the watch-house, thinking they were my brother's clothes; I have cautioned Mr. Sadler not to leave his door open.</p>
               <p>MR. SADLER. She never did - we have left the key when we were gone out, for her to make the beds.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS. She was partially intoxicated, but I asked her if she alluded to the stolen property; she said,"Yes, it was me, poor George is innocent;" it appeared to be a tacit admission of her guilt, but I think she might not have said this under other circumstances.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective</hi>). I took the prisoner on 22nd May—I told him I had a warrant for his apprehension, for conspiring with another man in obtaining goods by fraud from Mr. Dujardin, to the value of 214<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "Yes; who was the other man?"—I said "Rausenthal, who is dead"—he said "I was never associated with Rausenthal. I did not receive the goods. I had the ticket from Rausenthal, and I gave it to Nadaud to sell."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Brydges Street, Covent Garden—I have known the prisoner about six years, as a newspaper dealer and publisher, in Frith Street—I knew him as dealing in paper at Frith Street—I know a party going by the name of Growe—he had a partner named Briar—I knew him by sight—they went by the name of Growe &amp; Co.—they appeared to be carrying on very little business—I never knew of the prisoner having any<lb></lb>thing to do with the business of Growe &amp; Co.—as far as I know, the prisoner has been an honest, respectable man.</p>

Q.</hi> You have known him for six years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he has been in London about that time—I know nothing about his career in France—I lodged at his house for a month or so—I was manager to the Oxford Music Hall—I did not know a gentleman named Le Chapelier—I never heard a person of that name called Growe—Le Chapelier was a hatter—I never saw him at Stamford Street—I did not hear him pass there as Growe—I have been there with Growe—I knew Growe as Le Chapelier, which means a hatter—I never heard the prisoner addressed as Growe—I bought fourteen yards of cloth for my children at Stamford Street, from Growe—I paid him the money—I did not know Rausenthal.</p>

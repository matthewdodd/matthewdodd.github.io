                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in Brick-lane, Spitalfields—the prisoner was in my service. I had sixteen flush door-bolts—nine of them were taken away—a piece of mahogany, one flush-bolt, and a screw-driver were found on the prisoner's premises, on the 12th and on the 17th of May—they belong to me—the prisoner had no business with them.</p>

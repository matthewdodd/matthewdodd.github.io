I was with another young man; as we were coming along we saw a gang, apparently a great number together, fifty or sixty, as near as I can tell. They were coming through the wood, and we were going through; when about twenty of them had passed us, then they attacked both of us at once. I was struck over the head with a stick, and knocked down in the pathway. The other person who was along with me was thrown into the ditch, at the same time. I got up, and was immediately knocked down again. Then as many of them as could well get at me with their hands turned my pockets inside out. I had five shillings and sixpence in silver, and a metal watch about me. The five shillings and sixpence was taken from me, and they took my watch out of my fob; and as they were taking it, I caught hold of it, and they pulled and the chain broke. I then got up, and when they found I would not give up my watch, they knocked me down again. Then I was knocked down the third time; they kicked me on my sides and neck; when I got up, they cried ditch the b-gg-r, ditch him, and I was immediately thrown into the ditch. I got up again, and threw myself among them in the wood. When they found I fought so very hard, a very big one of them called out for a knife, and said, stand aside, and I will do for the b-gg-r. Immediately about half a dozen of them threw themselves upon me, and I caught hold of the prisoner Imber, who was one of them, and struggled with him, and he got away from me and ran into the fields, and I got away from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290011"></xptr>others had got the watch, but I had it, in my hand. I had not observed the prisoner until I had got hold of him; he was one of the five or six who were upon me at last. I saw Vaughan and Jefferson when it was all over; I saw them coming down through the wood; Vaughan, Jefferson, Dickinson, and Rice; we told them what had been done to us. We afterwards went to the Sluice House; when we went there I went up stairs, and the officers went with me; I should think there were near an hundred or two hundred persons in the room up stairs; I picked the prisoner Imber out from amongst the persons in that room; I knew him; he was taken into custody by one of the officers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. This was on a Sunday. I did not see them fighting; I had no scuffle nor fight with any body there, nor went there to see any fighting. I carried away the watch from the place; I deceived them, because I had it in my hand, and they thought some of the others had it. They called it a tickler, and said if I did not give it to them they would do for me.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. The persons we met, were men and boys; I do not know how far the Sluice House is from the place where I was robbed.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to the public office Bow-street. I happened to be in Hornsey Wood, and saw Dickins, Maidment, and Rice there; we were going through the Wood about six o'clock in the morning, and met a great many men, the greater part of whom I knew myself, and amongst the rest was the prisoner Imber; they seemed as if they were hastening from a field at the farther end of the Wood. I knew Imber by sight before. In consequence of some conversation that took place between me and the other officers, we went towards this field at the farther end of the Wood. We saw two men, the prosecutor, and another, just recovering themselves, and they got up, and ran away; I hallooed out to them that we were officers, and produced my staff. and then they came up to us. In consequence of what they communicated to us, I took them to Sluice House, which is about a quarter of a mile from the place where I met them. In consequence of information which I received from Jefferson, who was below stairs, I found that the gang had gone up stairs; I went up stairs with Morgan and his companion, and the whole of the officers; when we were in the room, the prosecutor pointed out Imber, and I immediately took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out to go a palming that morning, and I met some men who had been palming too; there was a great many people behind us, and they all turned back into this mob of people, and as I came amongst them, they pushed me down; I hallooed out murder, and they pushed me down again, and took two shillings and five-pence from me, and I thought my life would be taken away from me every minute.</p>

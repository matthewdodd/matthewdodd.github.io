(<hi rend="italic">The following letters referred to were here read.</hi>)</p>
               <p>June 13, Cannon-street, City. "Sir,—I am given to understand by Mr. Dawson, that you are in want of a light porter or messenger. I have not been in the grocery line before. I believe I was to state my age, and what wages I wished for. My age is 23, have lived in the wholesale druggist line ten months, can have an unexceptionable reference, and security if required; wages not so much an object as the obtaining a situation, having been out some length of time. I know town well, and the above is my handwriting. No objection to make myself generally useful. Left my last situation on account of there being no further employment for me in the establishment. My character is with Mr. Weldon, 6, Notting-hill square, Kensington. I am, your most humble and obedient servant, C. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALDWIN</hi>, 65 1/2, Cannon-street, City. To Messrs. Goodwin &amp; Co., Grocers, Tottenham-Court-road."</p>

               <p>"Tottenham-court-road, June 14. Sir,—On consideration of your note, we do not think you competent of filling the present vacancy in our establishment, therefore you need not trouble yourself more about it. Yours, &amp;c., Goodwin and Co."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> When I read it the prisoner asked if I had any luck?—I said, "No, they do not think me competent, but I will try it on yet—I will make a personal application, perhaps they may take me"—he said, very well—I endeavoured to find them that night for three hours and a half or nearly four hours—I could not find them—I inquired at almost every other house in the street—I went home that night and went to Mr. Dawson's the next day—when I entered I asked if there was any thing for me—he said if I would sit down I might look over his books—I looked over them, and was looking for some waste paper to copy something out, and found the letter which I had written, sealed as I had left it—I made some extracts from his books, and some of the places I went to, and could find no such persons, and others I found were public advertisements—nothing more passed—I went on taking extracts and trying to find people from a fortnight to three weeks, but I never could succeed in any—I either could not find the people, or they were copied from advertisements—he sent me to one place, No. 71, King William-street, he said that was certainly private information and I should certainly get a situation—I went and found nearly a hundred at the place, and it was an advertisement—he said he knew Goodwin and Co. well, and had supplied them with porters before, if he could have gone with me he could have found it, but he could not describe it—I requested to have the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back, but he said he never heard such a thing, I had not a receipt even to show that I had paid it, and there he should gain ground of me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was living in Worcester, till the 16th of June last, when I came up in consequence of seeing an advertisement—I went to Cannon-street, on the 16th of June, and saw the Defendant—I told him I was come up from the country to look for a situation, and asked him if he had one—he said he had a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> good one—he described it, and said it was in a hop and seed merchant's warehouse, in the Borough, and a person from the country would be preferred; that no one but him knew of it, and be would send no one but me for it, and therefore he could warrant I should have it—he said the salary was 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and there would be a security wanted to the amount of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I could give that, or more if required—he said I was to apply for it by letter, and if I would write a letter and leave it with him, he would send one of his clerks with it—nothing had been said then about money—he said before he could give me the address, I must give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said some gave him a sovereign, and some 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but his fee was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then wrote a letter and left it with him, addressed to Henry Yeoll, Esq., Borough, London—he said, probably there would be an answer by to-morrow, if I would call, if there was I should have it—I copied the address before I parted with it—I called the next day, Saturday, and there was no answer—I called on three successive days, and there was no answer—I saw the Defendant every time, and he informed me there was no answer—he said he dare say I was not thought competent for the situation—I told him I would apply in person—he told me it was not worth my while, as he had plenty of others then on his book—I wrote to several places, to six I should think, and endeavoured to find one or two whose names were on his book—I found one or two who had advertised and suited themselves—I afterwards endeavoured to find Mr. Yeoll—I went to the post-office, and they referred to their reference book, and I inquired at at least twenty places, but I was not able to find any thing about it.</p>

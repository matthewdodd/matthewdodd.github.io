                  </hi>, I manage the business of John Smith, No. 75, Strand. The prisoners came there one day in the middle of Feb.—I do not know the day—Earnshaw wanted to see some of the watches in the tray in the win<lb></lb>dow—I took it out—they looked at the tray, and asked the price of a great number of watches—the lowest-priced watch in that tray was ten guineas—they said they were all too expensive—both of them spoke—Earnshaw said they were too expensive, had I not anything at about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I turned my head to open the window to get some at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at that time I lost sight of the tray—I showed them some at that price—they bought nothing—they did not like what I showed them—Wells said they would write to the lady in the country, who had commissioned them to buy a watch—they were standing both together—I did not miss the watch till the policeman brought it about ten days after.</p>

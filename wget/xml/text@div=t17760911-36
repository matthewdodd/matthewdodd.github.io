               <p>On Sunday the 14th of July, I carried a leg of mutton in that dish to bake; I took a round jack towel with it, which I left with the prosecutor's wife; a young woman gave it me when I went to fetch my meat; he took it out and asked me if it was mine, I said, yes, I believe so; the boy said, there it is: I took it up stairs, set it down upon the compter, paid the woman for it, and went home with it.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Did you take any thing in to bake for her that day? - No; and my wife declared she did not take in any thing.</p>

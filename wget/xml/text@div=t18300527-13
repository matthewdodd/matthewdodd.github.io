On the 4th of February we went to bed together, about nine o'clock or half-past - the door of the back kitchen was not in a good state, as the hard frost had so altered it I could hardly bolt it - I latched and bolted it as well as I could; but by lifting the latch, and giving it a push, I believe it would open - there was a chest in the back kitchen, which was locked; I got up about seven or eight o'clock in the morning - the back kitchen door was wide open, and I missed from the chest five gowns, two cloaks, a petticoat, two pairs of sheets, a table-cloth, bed furniture, two gold rings, a thimble, and a copper teakettle - I have since seen one ring and a piece of a gown; the motto on the ring was, "When this you see, remember me."</p>

I am a constable of Chipping Barnet.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270015"></xptr>In the early part of February, (but I cannot name the day) I was taking two prisoners to Barnet; the night before that, about nine or ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner Field going in the road towards Potter's-bar - he lives on Barnet-common; there were two others with him - he was not going towards his own house; two or three mornings after that I was going with the two prisoners, and saw him going towards London, about ten o'clock, with a bundle under his arm, and asked what he had got - he told me to ask his; he was about three quarters of a mile from his own house; I had two prisoners, and could not take him. On the 25th of April I went to his house with Alder and Langley, constabless, about seven o'clock in the evening, and found his wife at home - I found a ring on her finger, which I have had ever since - I found in the house a black gown and a silk stuff gown, which the prosector identifies; one gown was cut up - I have had part of it ever since; it was picked to pieces; Langley took the rest - I found another ring, which Langley has; I went to Field's mother's house, and saw her beckon over her shoulder on seeing me - she knew me well; I searched for the prisoner there, and found him in a shed behind the house under some bundles of hay - I told him he was my prisoner; he asked if I had got a pistol - I said Yes; his mother lives about a quarter of a mile from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I under the hay, or sitting on two trusses? A. You were under the hay: I could not see you till I pulled the hay off - I pulled my pistol out before he asked if I had one; I should have taken him when I met him, if I had not got two other prisoners - he did not give me any gin.</p>

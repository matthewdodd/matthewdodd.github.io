                  </hi> I reside at 14, Stamford-street, Blackfriars-road—I am in no business now—on Saturday afternoon, 24th August, about half-past 8 o'clock, I was on Blackfriars-bridge—my attention was called to a number of persons looking over the parapet of the bridge, and out of curiosity I cast my eyes over the parapet—at the time I was doing so, I felt a tug at my right waistcoat pocket; I had a watch there, attached to a guard chain round my neck—I immediately turned sharp round, and saw the prisoner at my right-side, and his hand was falling from my right side where the watch was—I immediately said to him, "You scoundrel, you have robbed me?" the words were no sooner out of my mouth than he started off—I followed, and raised a cry of stop thief—he had got a very few paces when I dis<lb></lb>tinctly saw him drop the watch—I stopped and picked it up—I then lost sight of him—some of the bye standers told me something, and I found he had got on the other side of the bridge, and was stopped by a gentleman who had him by the collar—it was all the work of a few seconds; I am satisfied the prisoner is the man, for as I turned sharp round upon him I saw him full in the face—when I came up to him I accused him of taking my watch; he looked me full in the face, and said, "I have not got it," with all the <hi rend="italic">sang froid</hi> possible—I said, "No, I know you have not got it; you had it, and I picked it up"—he then said, "I hope you are not going to lock me up?" an officer came up and took him to the station—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch.</p>

I am a compositor, living at 37, Stamford-street—on 24th August I was on Blackfriars-bridge, leaning over the bridge—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I turned round and saw the prosecutor running after the prisoner; I joined in the pursuit—I saw the prisoner throw the watch from him; a gentleman picked it up—I followed the prisoner, caught him, and held him; he was never out of my sight.</p>

            . I am building a terrace of houses, and Harber was employed, as a <rs id="t18290115-207-deflabel1110" type="occupation">plaster</rs>, by me; I was to find all materials - I never gave him authority to take away any plaster of Paris ornaments.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. When did he leave your employ? A.Two or three days before the 16th of December; on that day I saw him and Lee on my premises, from nine o'clock till twelve in the forenoon - there were a number of men on my premises: I had some plaster of Paris ornaments in the casting-room, one of which was locked up for safety; the prisoners went in at the window - I had heard that they had said they insisted upon having some things from the premises: that was on the morning of the 16th; they did not say certain models- they said certain articles manufactured from wood; they then went off the premises, and took some articles - I threatened that if they came back I would give them in charge.</p>
               <p>- SKINNER. On the 16th of December I saw the prisoners take some ornaments from the casting-room -Harber told me not to say any thing about it; it was in open day, and all the men were about.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. LAING. Q. What did they allude to in the things they threatened to take away? A. Some rules and laths which they had to do their work, not ornaments; they said certain trestels belonged to them - I said, "Whatever belongs to you you shall have hereafter, but I am not aware that they do, as I have been charged in my surveyor's account for many things made by my materials;" there was no allusion to any ornaments.</p>

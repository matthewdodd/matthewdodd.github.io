                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, T</hi> 19). On Wednesday night, 8th Oct., about 8 o'clock, I met police-constable Bailey, at East Acton, in Mid<lb></lb>dlesex. In consequence of information that I received of a highway robbery, I was on the look out for the parties that evening—I proceeded with Bailey down a lane, which leads into the Uxbridge-road, from East Acton—when we had got down the lane about two hundred yards, I saw two men standing under the shade of the trees; I went towards them—as I drew near, I could see from the light of the moon that their faces were covered with something black—I instantly seized one of them, which proved to be the prisoner, Round, by the collar with my left hand, and with my right hand I stripped the mask from his face—I said, "Halloo! what are you doing here, with your facet covered?"—at that instant a shot was fired, and I fell down—I could not swear which of the two fired the shot; I supposed it to be the prisoner, Round.</p>

On Wednesday, 8th Oct. about eight o'clock in the evening—I met Earthy, at East Acton—I went with him down the lane, leading to the Uxbridge-road—it is called East Acton-lane—I had received information of a highway robbery, which induced me to watch—when we had got about 200 yards down the lane, I saw the two prisoners standing by the side of the road, on the pathway, with their faces covered with something black—I saw Earthy go to one of them—he laid hold of him by the collar, and pulled the mask from his face, and said, "What are you doing here, with your faces covered?"—I then observed the flash, and heard the report of a pistol—I am not able to say which of the men fired the pistol—one of them decidedly did—I immediately sprang upon Harris, and threw him to the ground—I was struggling with him on the ground, and sergeant Earthy called to me to mind the pistol; at that very instant, I noticed a pistol in Harris's hand—he had it close to my belly, he pulled the trigger, it flashed, but missed fire—I saw the flash—Earthy then caught hold of the barrel end of the pistol—I drew my staff, and hit Harris across the wrist—and Earthy, wrested the pistol from him—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>ducing it</hi>)—I was not able to see the other roan at all during the struggle, he got away—I am only able to speak to Round from his general height and appearance—Harris was never out of my hands, I took him to the station, we got more assistance at the end of the lane—Earthy went home—when we got Harris to the station at Acton, I searched him, and found on him three new silk handkerchiefs, three bullets, a piece of rough lead, a knife, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, and a canister containing some gunpowder, which I produce—the bullets are not regularly cast, they are pieces of rough lead cut with a knife, and then chewed—these are the bullets which were in the pistol, and these were found in Harris's pocket—they are all made in the same way—I examined the pistol that Earthy wrenched from Harris, it was loaded with powder, and the two bullets I have produced—on the Saturday following, from information I received, I got a bundle from a person of the name of Squires, a barber of New-street, Houndsditch.</p>

               <p>left the King of Prussia on the Monday night as this happened on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday—I did not see them till they were in custody—I was taking the beer out one day, and saw Round shooting birds in the lane with a pistol—I saw the pistol in his hand—I did not have it in my hand at all—I have seen tap pistols in the possession of Round—I could speak to them again (<hi rend="italic">looking at the pistols produced</hi>)—if these are not the pistols they are just the same, and the same shape.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Harefield, Middlesex. On Wednesday, 8th Oct., I was at the King's Arms, Acton Bottom, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the two prisoners there—I had known them before; they came in and had a glass of gin and water between them—I was in the same room—they were there about half an hour—I am sure they are the two men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Acton. On Wednesday night, 8th Oct., I was called on to attend sergeant Earthy—I found he was wounded in the left thigh—the wound passed from the front of the thigh inwards—it crossed the large vessels, but did not go deep enough to injure them—had they been injured it would most likely have been fatal; had the main artery been injured he would probably have bled to death before assistance could be pro<lb></lb>cured—the bullet passed through the trowsers of the right leg, grazing the right thigh in its posterior part—about ten days afterwards I extracted from the wound a piece of cloth which was a portion of the trowsers that bad been forced in by the ball—he has been under my care from that time to the pre<lb></lb>sent—I should hope he would ultimately perfectly recover from the injury—at present he is suffering from various pains, the result of that injury, and he is likely to do so for some little time.</p>

            . Q. Was the prisoner at the bar your lodger. - A. Yes, she took possession of the lodgings on the 15th of June for herself, two rooms on the first floor, at half a guinea a week. On the 23d,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010049"></xptr> not approving of her conduct, I gave her a week's warning, that she was to quit on the 29th. On Saturday she went out loaded with two bundles; which gave me reason to suspect that she had got more than her own. I followed her and overtook her.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell me where your dwelling is. - A. Kingsland-road, near the turnpike. I followed her near a mile, the went to Islington; I observed a bundle that looked like sheets; I then told an officer the circumstance; he stopped her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to wash the linen. - A. My wife; when the constable stopped her, we found both the sheets and a great many other things. The sheets were not dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she had them. - A. A week.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were not over and above clean. - A. She said she was taking the sheets to be washed</p>
               <p>Q. And she had dirty sheets with her. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She had paid you for her lodgings. - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Court. You did not wait to see if me got them washed.</p>

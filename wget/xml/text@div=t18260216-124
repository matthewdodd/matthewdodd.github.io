            . I am the wife of George Lovemore. I know the prisoner. Last Thursday night three weeks she came to my house, about nine o'clock, and left a bonnet and a box, and said "Will you give me leave to leave this box till the morning?" I said I would, and asked her whose it was - she said it belonged to a young woman out of a situation, and she would call for it in the morning.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the night of the 26th of January, the prosecutrix applied to me - I went and took the prisoner at her own house - I put her into the watch-house - she was very tipsy in the morning; I sent the prosecutrix to find the things, which she did - I said to the prisoner "It is a hard thing that the poor girl should be robbed;" she said "She is a wretch;" I said I had found the things, and she said she had not taken them.</p>

             re-examined. Q. What did you say to the prisoner that night? A. I asked her what she had done with the bonnet and box - she said she had not taken them - I told her to go to bed as she was intoxicated - she said she was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the things because I could not lock my door - I took them there for safety.</p>

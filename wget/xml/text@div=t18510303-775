I have a smiths' shop and engineers' shop, in Green Dragon-yard, Whitechapel—I know these articles; they are mine—I saw them on my premises, in Green Dragon-yard, on 29th Dec., and I missed them on 18th Jan.—I found there had been an entrance made in the roof of my premises and through the party-wall—I was walking by Mr. Hyam's shop, and saw a lot of these taps in the window; I went in, and saw twenty-three taps—I identified twenty-two of them—I found this force-pump at Mr. Jones's shop, in Slater-street; I then went to the prisoner's shop—I asked him if he had purchased any taps; he denied it—I asked if he had sold any lately; he denied having done so—I asked if he had any half-round bits; he denied that also—I then asked him if he bad bought a force-pump; he denied that he had bought any; but while we were talking, Mr. Jones came in, the person he had sold the pump to, and then he acknowledged having bought the brasswork of the pump, as old metal; and he had sold it to Mr. Jones for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then asked if he had bought the ironwork; he said, "Yes, for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I then asked if he had any objection to our searching his premises; he said he had no objection, but I must have an authority for it—I told him the only authority I should give him would be to take him into custody if he refused me—(I had an officer with me)—he then said we might search—I asked for his book; he produced it, and referred to two entries of old brass—this is the book—he told me this was the only book he kept—I found one entry, "32lbs. of old brass, at 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound"—I remarked that it did not weigh 32lbs."—he said, "No, but I bought other metal with it, some new cocks"—I said, "Where are they?"—he said, "There is one, in the window"—I said, "Yes, I can see that, but where are the others?"—he said he had sold the others—I asked him, "To whom?" and he said he did not know the name—I asked if he knew Sheldrick; he said he had seen him twice"—I</p>

I went with Mr. Jury to Mr. Hyam's, in Well-street, Mile-end New<lb></lb>town—there were twenty-three taps; Mr. Jury identified twenty-two of them—I afterwards went to Mr. Jones's, and this pump laid in his window—we went into the shop, and shortly afterwards Mr. Jones came in, and he and Mr. Jury had some conversation—Mr. Jury pointed to these sixteen half-round bits that were hanging up in the shop—we then went to the prisoner's—it was about one o'clock—as we were going into the shop, Mr. Jury pointed out this brass cock—we went inside—the prisoner was behind the counter—Mr. Jury asked him if he had bought any taps; he said, "No"—he asked if he had got any; he said, "No"—he asked if he had sold any; he said, "No"—he asked if he had sold any cast-steel half-round bits; be said, "No"—he asked if he had bought the brass of a force-pump; he said, "No"—at that moment Mr. Jones came into the prisoner's shop—(we had told him to come in after we had been in a few minutes)—the prisoner then said he recol<lb></lb>lected selling the brass and iron of a pump to Mr. Jones—I then asked him if he had sold any taps to a Jew; he said, "Yes," he did on Saturday night last—I asked how many; and to the best of my belief, he said "Fifty or sixty"—I asked if he had got an account in his book of purchasing these things; he said, "Yes" he had, and he produced his book, with two entries in it—here is "Mr. Sheldrick, 6, Chicksand-street; 32lbs. of pot-metal, at 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Jan. the 6th;" and on 14th Jan., "Mr. Sheldrick, No. 18, Chicksand-street, 21lbs. of pot-metal, at 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound"—I</p>

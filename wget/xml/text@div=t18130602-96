             was with me. The prisoner came up to me, and asked me whether I would not get some sorrel. I said, yes, and asked her whether it was far. She said, no. Then I said I would go, if it was not far; then I went up to that field; it was a good way. I said, Billy. She heard me say, Billy. She then said, let me have Billy. I said, no, I must not let him go. Then she said she would buy him a lollypop; she would be back in a minute. She left me in the fields, and went round a corner by some houses. She said she would come back. She did not. I saw no more of her nor of Billy until I saw her at the magistrate's.</p>
               <p>MRS. FOSTER. I am the mother of this child. On the 27th of May I lost my little boy; I went every where to find him; I could not find him. A gentleman came to my house on Friday night, and let me know. I went to Wanstead. My little boy was taken away from a little girl in Bethnal-green. My child was lost in Bethnal-green. I found him at Ilford. I never saw the prisoner until I saw her at Ilford.</p>
               <p>MR. WISEMAN. I was going through the village of Wanstead; I saw the prisoner with this little boy. She was dressed very wretched, without shoes and stockings. I asked her if the child was hers. She said, yes. I thought it could not be hers. She said, it was. I thought the child was certainly stolen. I told her, I should take the child. I detained her for an hour, and sent for a constable; the constable came; I gave him charge of her. and kept the little boy in my house. The child said he lived at Bethnal-green. At Laytonstone a woman informed me she was in London, and heard a child cried. This was about nine o'clock in the evening. I ordered my horse to be put to. I came to London, and after about two hours searching I found out where the parents lived.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the little boy - A. Three years old. When I saw the prisoner with the child what attracted my notice was, she had taken the flannel petticoat off, and tied it over a good frock. I saw a good frock underneath, that made me more positive in my opinion; I found she had torn the sleeves of the frock. I had her before the magistrate at Ilford. She had offered the flannel petticoat for sixpence. She said she took the child to go a begging with.</p>

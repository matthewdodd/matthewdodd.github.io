               <p>Q. How? - A. She got her hand at my pocket, under my petticoats; I resisted, and called out; somebody came to my assistance; she pulled the pocket from my side.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know her before? - A. I have seen her before; I found her beating Mrs. Warner about the head; I took hold of her by the shoulder, and asked her what she was doing that for; she made me no answer, an answer was returned by another person that she had robbed Mrs. Warner of a piece of meat, and four one-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that said loud enough for the prisoner to hear? - A. Yes; I said, I knew the weight of the meat, for I had weighed it for her in the course of the afternoon; I turned round and took the meat from the prisoner Dealy, she gave it to me immediately, she did not appear as if she had stolen it; they were then taken up to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Quinland take any thing at all? - A. No; the pocket had been taken before I came up; they were then taken to Bow-street.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Are you an officer? - A. No, a harness-maker: I was in at the sign of the Green-man, on Saturday evening, adjoining Mrs. Gurney's shop; hearing a disturbance in the market I went out, the prisoners were then at Mrs. Gurney's shop-door; they were taken to Bow-street, and I went with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched? - A. Not at Mrs. Gurney's house, they were at the Office; when I went out, the prisoner Dealy was shifting her hands under her apron, and upon moving from the position in which she stood, the pocket was laying on the ground, before Mrs. Gurney's shop-door.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was she then to Quinland? - A. They were close together.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the pocket did not drop from Quinland, but Dealy? - A. Dealy.</p>
               <p>Q. From which hand? - A. I am not positive which hand, her hands were both under her apron; I picked it up and looked into it, and found nothing but a memorandum-book; an officer then came from Bow-street, and they were taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners searched? - A. Yes: upon one of them the officer found two one-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What officer? - A. Mumford.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which of them? - A. Dealy. (Produces the pocket.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Warner.) Look at that pocket? - A. It is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the tape appear to be broke? - A. Yes, it is broke.</p>
               <p>Q. By the force of pulling it from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the memorandum book? - A. It is mine; it is the same that I had in my pocket when it was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Dealy from you? - A. About a couple of yards.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came up to you, they came together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that Quinland struck you, how near was Dealy to you? - A. A yard, or it might be a couple of yards; they were within a little distance of each other.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time Quinland ran away, did Dealy run away too? - A. I was so confused I cannot say.</p>

As to character, Sir, they are humble, but honest, unable to employ Counsel, and pay the fees of Court, and humbly solicit your Lordship's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180311300023"></xptr>humanity and interference in behalf of the unfortunate prisoners.</p>
               <p>Dealey's defence. I had been in Covent-garden on the Saturday evening, and this woman and the prosecutrix were both fighting; while the fight was on I stooped down, and picked up the two notes; that is all I know of it; I had four pounds of potatoes with me at the time, and my basket upon my shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Warner.) Are the prisoners basket-women? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Dealey a basket upon her shoulder? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. They say you were intoxicated, were you intoxicated? - A. No, not but what I knew what I was doing.</p>
               <p>Q. You were then fresh in liquor? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so fresh with liquor as to make it doubtful as to the person who struck you? - A. Yes, I am sure of the person who struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been drinking? - A. I had drank a little brandy and water and a little gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Quinland intoxicated? - A. Yes, I believe she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she very drunk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been fighting with her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you struck the prisoner at all? - A. I never struck her.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she intoxicated that afternoon? - A. Yes, very much, more than I have known her for a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. She is a married woman? - A. Yes, her husband is at sea.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see Dealy and Quinland together that afternoon? - A. No, and the other woman, Dealy, had no acquaintance with her that I know.</p>

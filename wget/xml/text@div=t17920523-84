            ; the prisoner has been in our employ between three and four months; on the 6th of April we were informed that these goods were at his lodgings; on which information I went and examined, and found them to be our property; there were twenty waistcoats and two pair of breeches, a pair of lasting breeches; one pair of nankeen, nine flannel waistcoats, one linnen ditto, one muslinet ditto, one quilted ditto, one jeannet, one India stripe, one kerseymere, one cloth, one boy's sattinet, one boy's saggity. The value of them is 1 l. 19 s.; they are in possession of the constable.</p>
               <p>Court. did you ever find any decrease in your stock? - It is too numerous.</p>
               <p>- PRATT sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner lodged with me; I went into his room on the 6th of April without any design; I saw some waistcoats lying carelessly; two or three I observed had been worn; it struck me that he had not come by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230069"></xptr>them honestly, as he worked for one of those shops; on looking about I saw a bag, and observed a number of articles of that sort; I went (considering it my duty) to Mr. Lloyd, and desired him to come and examine those things; he did so, and found they were his: I went to Messrs. Lloyds house, where the prisoner was at work, they gave charge of him, and I took him to the Compter, there he confessed it: he was not promised any thing to induce him to confess.</p>
               <p>It appeared on the examination, that the evidence has been a constable seven years, and that he had not been compelled, but did it for the sake of the profits of situation attendant upon general constables.</p>
               <p>Called two witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

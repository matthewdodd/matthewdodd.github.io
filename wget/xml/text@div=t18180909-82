On Monday, the 10th of August, at eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop, and bought a pair of Wellington boots of me, which came to 1l. 12s., and gave me a two-guinea Grantham bank note, payable at No.56, Lombard-street. I asked him to favour me with his address; he said his name was Smith. I gave him a pen to write it on the note - He said his name was on it. I asked him where he lived? he said, in Paul-street, which is not far from my house. I saw the name was on the back of the note. While the boy was gone home with the boots I forgot the number of the house, and omitted writing the address till he returned to tell me the number. I gave the note to Amelia Lownds, whom I saw write "Smith, T.A." on it. I had no other two-guinea note at that time or before. I sent my boy with the boots, and to bring back a pair of shoes, which the prisoner said he had, to sole and heel. This is the note-(looking at it).</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go next day to Lombard-street - A. Yes, and found the note was bad. I went to Paul-street that morning, inquired for Smith at two or three houses, and was informed that if I had not got the number it was useless searching, as there might be many Smiths.</p>
               <p>Q. From information which you received, was your attention called to Crown-street - A. Yes. On Tuesday, the 11th of August, which was the same night, I watched a house there belonging to Mrs. Gracey, and waited there till almost twelve o'clock, I then saw the prisoner in Crown-street, coming towards the house. I went up to him, saw he was the person I wanted by the light of the lamp, collared him, and said, "How do you do, Mr. Smith? I have been looking for you sometime." He said,"My name is not Smith, but Gracey, and what do you collar me for? I bought a pair of boots of you, and paid you. - (I had said nothing about the boots, nor told him who I was, or where I lived). I said, "Yes, you paid me, but you know in what manner." - He made no reply. I took him to the watch-house - He resisted. When he came to his own door he said his name was Gracey, and he would go no further, as he could be found there at any time. I succeeded in getting him to the watch-house, and gave him in charge to Walton. He said there that he took the note of a friend in the shop, and he knew who it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. He was a stranger to me. I had no particular reason for attending to his conversation at the time he bought the boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he did not say that the person's name who endorsed the note was on it - A. No; he said my name is Smith, the name is on the back; Paul-street, is a few yards from Crown-street. I asked him the name of the street twice, and could not mistake him-my attention was called to what passed when my boy came back.</p>
               <p>CHARLES FARQUHAR. I am servant to Mr. Archer, I remember the prisoner buying the boots - I was to take them home with him, and bring a pair of shoes back to sole and heel. We went across Moorfields, just as far as Lackington's; he walked first, and looked back three or four times. When we got to Lackington's, he said,"My lad, I will not take you any farther." He felt in his pocket for some halfpence, and said he had none; but he would bring the shoes next morning, and give me some - He did not call next morning. I had seen him before at his father's in Crown-street, Finsbury-square-his father was alive when I knew him. I did not recollect him when he first came, but I knew him better when he spoke to me at Lockington's. When his father was living my mother lived close by, and used to go charing for his mother - I knew all the family; I used to see him working. I often told my master that I knew him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I had spoken to him before, we knew one another - He did not call me by name.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How long ago have you known him - A.Between three and four years ago. I have no reason to suppose he knew me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear him give your master the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090037"></xptr>name of Smith - A. Yes. When I saw him at Lackington's I thought it was Gracey.</p>

            . On the 10th of August the prisoner moved from the house in the Kent-road. He lived there with his brother, the last prisoner - They left it about five o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You mean you saw him often at his brother's house - A. Yes; I do not know that he lived with his mother. I saw him in Kent-road as often as I saw his brother. I saw him there at five o'clock in the morning when they moved. I do not know that he slept there.</p>
               <p>(The note was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received the note from my mother. I gave the man the name of Gracey, and told him I believed it was on the back of the note. I asked him to let the lad go with me. When I got to Finsbury-square, I recollected I had to call on a person. I took the boots from the lad, and told him that if I came that way in the morning I would call and leave the shoes. I had to go another way, and did not leave them. It is very unlikely that I should have gone into a neighbourhood where I had been known for fourteen years, if I knew the note to be forged. I entered into conversation with the prosecutor at his house, about the neighbours who knew me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ARCHER re-examined. Q. Are you sure he did not say his name was Gracey, and that he believed it was on the back of the note - A. I am sure he did not. The boy went with the prisoner by my desire, as I wished to know where he lived. He did not ask me to let the boy go. I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left you did he go in the way to Crown-street - A. Yes, and in the way of Paul-street also. He talked about the neighbourhood, and said he knew Donaldson, Scott, and Williams.</p>
               <p>CHARLES FARQUHAR. I was within hearing at the time, and am certain he did not mention the name of Gracey.</p>

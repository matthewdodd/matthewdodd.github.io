               <p>Court. Is the lady here? - No, she is not; the prisoner went out the back way, I went after her, and detected her in the street, and found the cloak upon her; I told her Mr. Barlow wanted to speak to her, she said she had picked up a cloak in the shop, and she gave it me, she told me it lay behind the lady in the shop.</p>
               <p>How long was it between the time she left your shop, and the time you was sent after her? - It might be the course of an hour; I cannot tell exactly.</p>

               <p>I went to buy a cloak and a petticoat with a gentlewoman, and we could not agree, and coming out I met the master, he advised us to go back, and we bought a bit of mode; I said it was damaged, he shewed me another piece, and he asked three shillings and nine-pence, I said it was too dear, he directly cut me off four yards, and I paid him twelve shillings; I asked him to cut it out for me, which he did, and I picked up a cloak, I did not know whether it was this cloak or not; I was above an hour gone, and I came back again, and if I had had any thing of the gentleman's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300045"></xptr> under my arm, I would not have come back, and the gentleman said to me, says he, I want to speak to you, I understand you have picked up a cloak.</p>
               <p>Court. But that cloak is ready made? - I did not know but it was the same.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Were there any ready made cloaks on the compter, or any ways exposed in your shop, during the time the prisoner was there? - A great many.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

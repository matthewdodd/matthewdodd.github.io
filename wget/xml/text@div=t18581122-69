                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) I live at 35, Francis-street, Woolwich—last Sunday evening I was at the King's Arms, Woolwich, in company with Mr. Taylor—my wife and my brother's son were also with me, and my brother's wife—we took tea there—I drank a glass of grog—at half-past 10 we went to another public-house—I do not know the name of it—I had two glasses of grog there, and then a glass was broken on the table by a woman, and as she had no money to pay for it she said to the interpreter Fisk, "You must pay for it"—I paid for the glass, and left the house about 11 o'clock—when I got into the street, Fisk the interpreter disappeared from me—several persons came round me, and among them Drake and Brown—Brown took me by the throat, jumped at me, and I seized him by the throat—there were several others who attacked me but I could not find them—I received a blow on my head first with a stick, and fell—it was then that Brown jumped at me—it was a marine who struck me—he is not here—while I was lying on the ground they all attacked me—Drake put his hand inside my coat and I lost my pocket-book containing documents and letters from government, certificates from the hospitals of Paris, and other letters and correspondence—the pocket-book was in my inside pocket, which was torn as you now see in the struggle, because I could not defend myself—while I was on the ground the marine was feeling in my pockets, and the others continued giving me blows—I should not know the others if I saw them—I saw all three of the prisoners there—I endeavoured to get away—the marine ran away, and I do not know where he went to—after he came back they all pushed on me, and I said, "I want to go into the house to get some help," and I told Drake that he ought to give me my pocket-book or else I would call a policeman—I said that while the other men were holding me by the collar—I said it in French because I cannot speak English well—it was Evans that held me by the collar, because I wanted to get into a house for help—besides the papers my pocket-book had in it an English 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note which I had received in the morning—I have not seen any of my property since—when I paid for the glass in the public-house I took out my pocket-book as I had my money in it, and they saw it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the military train at Woolwich—last Sunday week I was at the Crown Masons' Arms, at Woolwich, at a few minutes past 11 o'clock, in the tap room—some civilians were present—the prose<lb></lb>cutor came in with his interpreter, who is a soldier, and they had some drink—there were some females in the room at that time, and the interpreter invited one of them to have a glass and he asked me also—the girl that was speaking to him broke a glass, and asked him if he would pay for it—he said he had not money to pay for it—I saw the two civilian prisoners there—the room was not half the size of this Court—everybody could hear what was said—the glass was not paid for at that time—I saw the interpreter speak to the prosecutor, but, previous to that, the prosecutor pulled out his pocket-book to pay for the drink he had had—Evans and Brown were there then, and had the same opportunity of seeing him that I had—I saw the interpreter and the prosecutor leave the house—I went with them, us three, and a young woman—we went to a private house, two doors higher up, a brothel—we went in and remained there five or ten minutes in a back room on the ground floor all together, when Brown came in with his coat partly off—he began to abuse the Frenchman, who laid hold of him, and pushed him into the passage—I took the candle and went into the passage, and then the door of the room was locked behind me—a scuffle commenced between the Frenchman and Brown, and in a short time Evans came in, but I could not see whether he came from the street or from one of the rooms—I saw a marine in the passage—that passage goes to the street, and at the other end the door was closed behind me—I was at the far end of the passage from the street—there is not a room on each side of the passage—there is one front room and a back room—the marine who came in was Drake—the Frenchman was knocked down, I could not see by whom—several were engaged in the struggle whom I could not name; but I saw the three</p>

               <p>prisoners all struggling with him—I cannot say that they were assaulting him—he was on the ground—he got up, put his hand to his breast, and pulled out his pocket-book to see that it was all right, as I understand, and then put the book into his breast, and when he got half way down the passage the men attacked him again—the three prisoners were there all the time—he was knocked down a second time, and when he got up he pointed to his breast and made signs to me that his book was gone—he called out something and pointed to his breast—the three prisoners were then at the end of the passage—I missed the marine for five or ten minutes—Brown and Evans got into the street, and then the Frenchman rushed at Drake, took him by the neck, and said that he was the man that had his pocket-book—he called "Police," and whistled as loud as he could—he let Drake go before the police came up, but did not let him go away—he gave him in charge at some distance from there, nearly opposite the George and Dragon—Drake said that he was willing to be searched, he had not got the pocket-book—I cannot tell by whom the door was locked—the interpreter was locked inside the room—I was sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known the prosecutor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three or four months—he is a veterinary surgeon—there were from sixteen to twenty people in the public-house—it was very quiet when he came, but there were afterwards some few words about a dog which he had with him—those words did not lead to a quarrel or a fight—he had about two glasses of spirits, and I had one—the women had one or two glasses—it was the woman who was with the interpreter that broke the glass—she did not come in with him—she was in before him—he knew her—she lives at the brothel close by—she is the one who went there with him—I did not see any of the women searched—it was the same woman that was locked into the room with Fisk—she went through the passage into the room—she was in the passage during the time that it took her to walk along it—I was in the passage about twenty mimutes after the struggle commenced—the French<lb></lb>man was there all that time—I was there more than half-an-hour altogether—there were other women in the house; there was one standing at the front room door, but she did not interfere—the Frenchman was a little angry about the dog from what I could understand, but I do not understand French at all—I cannot say who struck the first blow in the passage or who the Frenchman was knocked down by—I had a light in my hand and was three or four yards from them—I had not my back to them—I swear deliberately that I could not see who struck the first blow—the Frenchman struck with his fists—he did not kick that I saw—he had nothing in his hands that I saw—he did not stand up and let himself be thrashed—I did not help him as regards fighting—I held the candle to see that there was nothing done more than really was done—if I had not held the candle very likely it would have been worse—it was after he had been knocked down that he pulled out his pocket-book—the prisoners were all in the passage then—they all went out in the street in fifteen or twenty minutes after the struggle commenced—it lasted nearly fifteen minutes to the best of my knowledge—the passage is about four feet wide and twenty feet long—there is a front door and two side doors, I think—I have not been into the house before—it was not the woman who broke the glass that came into the passage—she was locked in the room with Fisk—Evans did not run away when the Frenchman called "Police"—he stayed with him until we got nearly opposite the George and Dragon; and when the policeman came up the Frenchman gave Drake into custody, but not Evans.</p>

I was with the prosecutor on Sunday week—he is a veterinary sur<lb></lb>geon, but not attached to the train—he has been living at Woolwich some time, and I have been acting as interpreter to him for the last three months—he is trying experiments upon glandered horses—we went to the Crown Masons' Arms on this night between 11 and 12 o'clock—we went into the taproom—no one accompanied us when we entered—a sergeant of the train was there and two civilians—I saw Brown sitting on the right of the door as we entered, and Evans standing in the centre of the room—I stayed in the taproom upwards of twenty minutes, and went out with the prosecutor and a female, leaving Brown and Evans in the house—I went to a private house some two doors off, and into a room on the ground floor—while I was there Brown came in, and the sergeant was there, and the prosecutor and the female—Brown pulled off his coat and tried to fight the Frenchman, who had said or done nothing to him—the Frenchman put him into the passage, and the sergeant took a candle and showed him a light—I believe he was pushed out of the house—I and the female were locked in the room for twenty minutes, and I heard a scuffling outside—the Frenchman called out my name, and said, "I am being robbed"—he called out to me in French, and said that they were trying to take his pocket-book from him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 439). On Sunday night, 14th November, I was on duty in High-street, Woolwich, and heard cries of "Police" about half-past 12 o'clock—I proceeded to the spot, and in the lower part of High-street, by the George and Dragon, I saw Drake and fifteen or twenty persons—the prosecutor said he wished to give Drake into custody for assaulting him and robbing him of his pocket-book and letters—Drake said that he was innocent; he saw the Frenchman in a difficulty, went across to assist him, and was given in custody—on the way to the station, he said, "I hope they will not take the few shillings I have from me"—I said, "What money have you?"—he said, "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I searched him at the station, and found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but no pocket-book—I know the brothel two doors from the Crown Masons' Tavern—that is three minutes' walk from where I took Drake, in the same street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Brown's Defence.</hi> I was drinking with him, and asked him to take a walk with me; I came to this house where the soldiers were, and directly I entered the room the Frenchman asked me what I wanted. I said that I had as much right there as he had; he caught me by my neck in the pas<lb></lb>sage, and I took off my coat to fight him; we struggled in the passage a little while, and then went into the street. I was going home with my friend, and saw the soldiers fighting him; next day I went to see this young woman, as the landlady said she was going to turn her out. I saw the Frenchman there, with the sergeant outside, and he never offered to give me in charge. On the Tuesday morning I said that I would tell the policeman all I knew,</p>

               <p>and that is what I was going to tell him. I was never in the public-house, and the potman says that he shut up the house at ten minutes to 11.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber and glazier at 5, Ordnance-road, Lewisham-road—the prisoner was in my service about ten days—on Tuesday, 7th November, I missed a diamond from a drawer in my shop—it was a glazier's diamond, in a handle—I applied at a neighbouring pawnbroker's, MR. Nash's, and there found it—in consequence of what he said to me I brought the prisoner to him—MR. Nash said, in his presence and hearing, "This is the lad that pawned the diamond"—the prisoner said he was innocent, he did not know anything about it—I then gave him into custody—this is my diamond (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is worth one guinea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Nash identify him at once without any hesitation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have bad a lad named Dawson in my employment—I saw the diamond safe after he left, I am sure of that—in the drawer I have three other diamonds—one has a white handle; the other is a smaller one than this—it is the same coloured handle—I remarked that it was this particular diamond—I am sure of that—I saw it in the morning of the day that Dawson was dismissed, at twenty minutes to ten I should think—I was standing at the door—I dismissed him for not coming earlier; he ought to have been there at half-past 8, and he did not come till twenty minutes to 10—he did not enter the shop at all.</p>

I took the prisoner—I told him he was charged with stealing a diamond from Mr. Miller—he said he knew nothing at all about it; he had never seen the diamond—on the 15th Dawson came to me at the police-station—he is here to-day—he came with the prisoner's mother, and said, "I have come to give myself up for stealing the diamond from Mr. Miller's shop"—I said, "Are you quite sure of that," and he said "Yes"—I asked him what he had done with it, and he said, "I pawned it at Mr. Nosh's shop"—the sergeant sent me down to Mr. Nash's shop with Dawson—he still persisted in saying he took the diamond and pawned it.

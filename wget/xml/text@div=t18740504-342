                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, at 97, Jermyn Street—on the 27th March, I was at the Alhambra Theatre, and after the performance I came out by the back way into Castle Street—while I was walking down Castle Street, the prisoner Prescott ran up to me, put right hand round my neck, and with the left she took my scarf pin—I got hold of her by the shawl and said "You have taken my pin"—she said she had not—I said "Give me my pin back, and I will let you go"—she said "I will, if you will let me go"—I then found that my watch chain was hanging down—I said "You have taken my watch," and a man came behind me and said "You let that woman alone"—I caught hold of him and held them both—he saw the chain hanging and ho got hold of it with both his hands and pulled it till he got it away, then he began to kick mo to try and get away, and the woman struck me in the face several times—we all three fell on the pavement—I held them till the police came and I gave them in charge—I looked round for my umbrella and my hat, I could not find them and I followed to the station and I saw the man escape—at the station, the woman Prescott said "I know where the pin and the watch are"—I said "I have no doubt you do"—the chain was afterwards brought to the station and also my hat—my watch and chain, and pin were worth about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am quite sure the woman was the person, but I am not so sure of the man—to the best of my belief, Fitzpatrick is the man.</p>

               <p>evening of 27th March, I was in Bear Street, standing with my baked potatoes machine—I saw the prosecutor as he was leaving the stage door from the Alhambra pass up Castle Street into Bear Street—the female prisoner got hold of him by the neck—he pushed her away and she came to him again—she put her arm round his neck and took his pin—he caught hold of her and said "Give me back my pin"—she said "Go on, you good-for-nothing fellow, don't talk to me like that"—he said "You have taken my pin, give it me and I will lot you go"—he got her by the throat up against the shutters, and she said "If you will let me go I will give you your pin"—he said "No, you give me my pin and then I will let you go"—immediately after, the male prisoner rushed round the corner and got hold of the prosecutor and tried to rescue the woman—he said "Don't knock the woman about, let her go"—the prosecutor caught hold of him—two soldiers came along belonging to the Scotch Fusiliers, and somehow the man got away—I saw the male prisoner strike the prosecutor—I saw them fall, and the prosecutor gut up and said "I have lost my watch and chain"—the woman struck him two or three times very violently in the face—I picked up the chain afterwards and sent it to the police station by a publican as I could not leave my oven—I went to the police station afterwards to identify the male prisoner—I was shown several persons, and I picked out the wrong man first—there were eighteen or twenty, and I picked out another man, but when he came into the Police Court—I knew him better by his curly hair at the back—I recognised him then as the man—this is the chain I picked up.</p>

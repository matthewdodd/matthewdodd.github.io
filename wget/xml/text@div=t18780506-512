I live at 73, Southampton Street, Camberwell, and am a timber merchant—a man named Mitchell brought me this bill of ex<lb></lb>change. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "14th September, 1877.

It was marked "Not within, no orders left," not as a forgery—I do not know any of those handwritings on the bill, except that of George "Mitchell," which I saw him endorse—I do not know the prisoner's handwriting—my clerk presented it—he is not here—it was sent through a notary as well—finding that it was not taken up it was sent to a public notary—it was presented at Mogford's premises.

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Gladstone Terrace, and am an accountant—I took a bill to John Smith, but whether this is the one I do not know—I had two—one I received from the prisoner and the other from a man named Trimm—I know the prisoner by sight and have had business with him—I believe both the bills were for the same amount—I have no memorandum—I did not receive them both the same day—the first bill was given me by Trimm—I think it was September or October last year that I received the bill from the prisoner outside a public-house, opposite Aldridge's Horse Repository, St. Martin's Lane—I took it to Mr. Smith the next day, I think—the prisoner told me he was in some difficulty about some rates he had to pay and he wanted 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I think—he said he had received the bill from Mog<lb></lb>ford, Cecil Court, St. Martin's Lane—there had been a previous bill, and he said that Mogford offered to pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if the first bill could be retired and a fresh one given—I left the bill with Mr. Smith as collateral secu<lb></lb>rity, not endorsed by me—he then paid me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I think it was, by cheque, to enable the prisoner to pay his taxes, and he let me have a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque for myself upon my giving him a written undertaking to obtain, free of cost to him, a certain deed or bond in the hands of a person named Cooper—I gave him this memorandum when he gave me the two cheques on the 20th October—Frederick Trimm brought me the former bill—I gave the prisoner the first bill again, besides this—I en<lb></lb>dorsed</p>

               <p>the bill after Mr. Smith called and said it was said to be a forgery, and that the acceptor denied the hand writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I did not go to Cecil Court to make inquiries after the prisoner gave me the bill in front of the public-house—I took it on the faith of what the prisoner said, having seen Mogford previously on the first bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I can form no opinion as to whether this is the bill I received from the prisoner or Trimm—I had had very little business with the prisoner before—I bought a few plants of him once—I had had no bill or cheque transaction with him before—Smith advanced me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd for the prisoner and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Mogford said if Johnston took him another bill he would accept it—I went to Johnston and told him that if he drew another bill Mogford would accept it, and if he brought it to me I would go and see Mr. Smith—I do not think I said "Go to Smith," but I would see if I could get the money for him—I had lent him some money previously—I cannot fix the date of the first bill—I think it would be about June—I am certain it was before 14th July—it was in precisely the same state when I took it to Smith, with the exception of my name on it—I never saw Mogford in my life that I know of until I went to ask him about the sig<lb></lb>nature on this bill—the prisoner never said he had sued Mogford.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Fountain Court, Strand—I did not accept and put my endorsement on this bill—this is not my writing—I never accepted any bill for the prisoner or authorised any one to do it for me—Mr. Mitchell brought a bill into my father's shop, 19, Cecil Court, some time in September—I cannot say whether it was this bill or another—I never saw it on more than one occasion—I told Mitchell in reply to his inquiry that I knew nothing of the acceptance on the bill, and he had better bring the prisoner there to prove it—I believe the name "Mogford" on the bill is the prisoner's writing—I cannot swear to it—this is his handwriting, I believe (<hi rend="italic">producing an envelope</hi>).</p>

I live at 22, Cottal Street, Poplar—on the morning of 14th October I was crossing from Guildford Road—I did not see the deceased—I saw the prisoner and his van coming down from the bridge right against the kerb, skidding the kerb, I am sure of that—I should I say he was coming as fast as he well could—I don't understand galloping, I have not been brought up with horses—I saw the wheel leaving the woman, and the second wheel going over her—I heard no cries till I saw I the wheel over the woman—I could not say whether the prisoner called out—he stopped at the other corner.</p>

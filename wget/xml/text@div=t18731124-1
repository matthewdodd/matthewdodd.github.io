                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, in the employment of Julius Quitman, a dealer in silk, of 19, Castle Street, Falcon Square—I hate been in the service seven or eight years—the prisoner came into the service some time in January, this year, as town traveller—it was his duty to obtain orders for goods and to wait on the customers of the firm—he was entrusted with sample pieces of silk—before taking them out, a memorandum would be made in the books of the firm of what he received—if I was in he would tell me what he took away; if not, he usually wrote it on a slip of paper before a new customer could be supplied, he had to submit the name to Mr. Quitman, and inquiries were then made—he was not allowed to buy silk—Mre. Ellis, of 46, New North Road, was not a customer of the firm somewhere about the latter part of March I missed a piece of silk 32 yards in length, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I spoke to the prisoner about it; that must have been after the 31st—I told him I had missed it, and asked if he had sold it—he said he had taken it away as be went home one evening, and had left it with a party, but that he had not agreed to keep it yet—I asked him about when that was, he named a day, and I put it down then as the 18th—there had been no entry made of it in our books—he has never paid for it, nor has Mrs. Ellis—Mr. Jardine is a customer of ours—on 22nd April there is an entry of three pieces of silk to him, No. 10,087, 84 yards, at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; No. 10,054, 101 1/4 yards, and No. 10,059, 98 3/4 yards, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 15th May we sent Mr. Jardine a memorandum order to return those three pieces by bearer—we reoeived the two last with a message—I saw the prisoner afterwards the same morning, and said to him "I have sent in for those three pieces to Mr. Jardine, he has sent back two, and says that you had the other one"—the prisoner said "Oh, that is all right;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187311240004"></xptr>
               <p>he wants to keep it a bit longer, he thinks he can do with it; don't send in for it again, yet"—he left our service somewhere about 24th May—up to that time I had not seen the silk, or been paid for it—this receipt (<hi rend="italic">pro duced</hi>) I believe to be the prisoner's writing; it is dated the 13th May; it refers to the 84 yards sent in on 16th March.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not enter the 32 yards to the prisoner to charge him with it, I merely put it down in this rough scrap-book—I did not ask him with whom he had left it on approbation; I know now that it was left with Mrs. Ellis—the prisoner was entitled to take out goods if he stated where they were going—we had a porter of the name of James Hunt, to whom he could communicate that, when I was not there; Hunt has left us—I believe he was there at that time; he had nothing to do with making entries—if the prisoner took out goods and received the money it was his duty to hand it to the cashier—the entries with regard to the three pieces left with Jardine are correct—I did not give him goods to take out; he used to take them from the fixtures, stating where they were going; he gene rally did that before he went out—he had no trap; he walked—I did not make any note of the conversation on 15th May—I did not doubt what the prisoner said at the time—Mr. Jardine is still debited with the missing piece—we do not know where it is.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 44, New North Road—I have known the prisoner five or six years—some time in March he was showing me some patterns, and I asked him if he could get me a piece of silk—he said he could—I told him I could not pay till June—he brought it me three or four days afterwards—I asked him the price—I am not certain whether he said 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he said I could have it at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I was to pay him on 20th June—he did not leave any memorandum with it—I knew he had obtained the silk from his employer, Mr. Quitman, he told me so; he said he was traveller, or salesman for the firm—I gave 32 yards of it to my dressmaker to make up; one dress was made for my sister, and one partly made, which I gave up to Mr. Brett—it was to be made for the boat race, but unfortunately I had a little trouble, and she was told not to go on with it, and I asked the prisoner if it would make any difference to Mr. Quitman if I paid on 29th September; he said be dared say that would do—that was about the end of June—I asked him for the invoice, and he said when I paid Mr. Quitman I could have the bill and receipt, it mattered not who I paid, Mr. Quitman or himself—I did not tell him not to give my name to the firm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not carry on any business, I am independent—he told me at the time he sold it that I could pay either him or the firm—he told me so in June; I can't recollect his telling me that at the time he sold it; he might have said that he was getting it for me at the cost price.</p>

I am a cloak manufacturer, of 22, Castle Street, Falcon Square—I have dealt with Mr. Quitman for silk—in March or April the prisoner called on me, and showed me some samples of silk—towards the end of April or the beginning of May, a piece of 84 yds., at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, was delivered to me, and subsequently two other lengths of 101 1/4 yds. and 98 3/4 yds. at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw the prisoner on 13th May, the date of this receipt—I wrote it and he signed it—he signed for one piece, the 84 yds. at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the other two pieces were subsequently returned to Mr. Quitman, and I have never seen the 84 yrds. since the prisoner took it away—I have not had it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk merchant, of 19, Castle Street, Falcon Square—in January, this year, I engaged the prisoner as town traveller at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I knew nothing of Mrs. Ellis until after he left my service, which was about 20th of May, nor did I know of the 84 yds. of silk being returned to him by Mr. Jardine—I found it oat afterwards—I have never seen that piece of silk since—I made some inquiries of him about it in June, and he said he had sold it to a party at Kingston, but he never gave me the name, and I never could find out—I have no customer at Kingston.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I wrote to him in June asking him for an explanation, and he came on—I wanted to know where the piece of silk was—I don't know whether I wanted the silk or the money—I did not ask him for either the silk or the money—I asked him what had become of the two pieces of silk, and he said one piece he had sold at Kingston and the other piece he had sold to a Mrs. Ellis—I don't recollect asking him the name of the person at Kingston—I don't recollect saying anything about the money—it is the course of business to have either the goods or the money, but he had no business to sell goods without our sanction, without their being in voiced from our counting-house.</p>

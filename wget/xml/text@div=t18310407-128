On Sunday, the 6th of March, I was in a coffee-shop - the prisoner's sister came in there; I went with her home to the prisoner's lodgings, in <placeName id="t18310407-128-crimeloc711">Chequer-alley, Bunhill-row</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give me half a crown, about eleven o'clock, to fetch some breakfast things? A. You fetched some half-and-half and steaks.</p>
               <p>EDWARD GRIMSDALE. I was at the coffee-shop with the prosecutor; the prisoner's sister was there - we went home with her, and had some half-and-half and some gin- we were there from eleven o'clock till about three; we had not been in bed the night before - we had been the worse for liquor open night, but we sad got sober in the morning - I did not make the sister any compliment, or take any liberty with her; she asked as to go and have breakfast, and we went - we had only been in one public-house the night before; we staid there till eleven o'clock- we then stopped - a bit about the street, and at four o'clock we went to the coffee-shop. I saw the prosecutor had a sovereign in the purse about ten or half-past ten on the Saturday night - I was sitting by the fire when he accused the prisoner of stealing in purse; he took her by the thrown - I saw no sovereign, but assisted in taking the crown and two sixpences out of her hand.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner; I found 7l. 6d. on her, a men was given back, as the prosecutor said he had got his silver, and he had nothing to alledge against the prisoner but the sovereign.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor gave me half a crown to fetch some breakfast things, and then 8s. - I fetched some porter, liquor, tea, &amp;c.; he did not give me any money - the 7s. 6d. was my own; in the evening he said he had lost a sovereign - I had not seen one, but I took off the bed-clothes and said it would be found in the room - I took up the 5s. and the other silver, and gave him; he had been at a public-house in Whitecross-street, and had two quartern of gin, and treated people.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner - A. Only by seeing him bring work to the shop. The prisoner worked for Mr. Tilbury, of South-street, a coach-maker, and he used to bring work to the deceased from Mr. Tilbury. On Thursday, the <rs id="t18130407-90-cd459" type="crimeDate">11th of March</rs>
                  <join result="offenceCrimeDate" targOrder="Y" targets="t18130407-90-off457 t18130407-90-cd459"></join>, at four in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop where the deceased was at work. He brought a lamp socket with him, a socket of a gig, that was for the prisoner to make a pair like it. The prisoner and the deceased had high words about some screw bolts. They each gave one another the lie. The deceased said he would not do anything for the prisoner, and desired him to go out of the shop. Very high words passed. The prisoner refused to go out of the shop, for which the deceased said he would give him a good hiding if he would not take the law of him. The prisoner replied that he would not take the law of him. They had still higher words. The deceased said he would give him a good punch of the head if he would not take the law of him. The prisoner replied again that he would not take the law. The deceased had the tongs, with hot iron in it, on the anvil. He put the hammer down, and reached over the anvil, making a sort of a push in a defensive way, to turn the prisoner out of the shop. At that time the prisoner was too far from him to receive any assault. At that moment the prisoner struck the deceased on the left temple with the iron lamp socket. The deceased staggered back senseless for some seconds. He came to, and followed the prisoner across the shop with the tongs, which he let fall by being struck, and when the deceased was going up to attack the prisoner a second time he fell. The prisoner only struck the deceased but once. I lifted the deceased up, and set him on a block. I took a pair of scissars, and clipped away the hair from the wound. The wound was just above the left temple; I washed it with a sponge. It appeared a sort of a confusion, not a cut, about an inch and a quarter in length. I was going to dress it; I thought it was something serious; I did not. I then tied it up with clean linen, and directed him to go to the surgeon. He did not go direct to a surgeon, but went directly to Marlborough-street office. He returned back within half an hour I should suppose; I asked him what the surgeon said. He said he had not been. I understood he had been to the office. I desired him to go immediately, and sent a boy with him to shew him the doctor's house. I followed after him. The surgeon was not at home. They immediately sent for Dr. Lee, the doctor of Mount-street work house, and Dr. Lee sent the deceased to St. George's hospital.</p>
               <p>MR. STOCKWELL. I am the surgeon of St. George's hospital. On the 11th of March, the deceased was brought into the hospital about five o'clock in the afternoon. I discovered a small incissed wound on the left temple, as if given by some sharp instrument, about three quarters of an inch in length. I did not probe it. There was no appearance that indicated a fracture. I simply dressed the wound. About a quarter of an hour after his admission he had a strong convulsive fit, from which he was shortly relieved.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to account for that convulsive fit - A. Yes. I conceive the brain sustained a deal of injury from the blow. He had no return of any injury in the head during the remainder of his life. About a week after he was brought in he was attacked with an inflammation of the lungs, and notwithstanding every means that was employed it increased, and his death took place on the 25th of March. After his death I opened his body. On examining the chest I found evident marks of inflammation of the lungs on the right side.</p>
               <p>Q. What, in your opinion, was the cause of his death - A. From the inflammation of his lungs I should suppose, and in my judgment that inflammation could not proceed from that wound in the head.</p>

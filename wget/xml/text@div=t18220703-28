I was on the staircase watching her from a window, as I bad lost goods the day before; she was in the cutting room. I lost three dozen pair of stays at one time, but not on this day. I was looking through a window, and saw her open a drawer from which two pair of stays had been taken the preceding week; she shut it again without taking anything; I immediately went up to my husband, and afterwards resumed my place on the staircase, and while she left the room to go down stairs for her pail, I went and looked in the drawer, and at the top of it was a large pasteboard, which nearly covered it, and at the top of that was a few rules and the shears; I observed that there was nothing about the room. I went back to the staircase, and she returned with her pail. I missed her for some time; I could not see her for five minutes. I heard a rustling like jeans being unfolded; I went down to the back room door, and saw her at the first drawer in the foreman's room; I went in as she was shutting the drawer - I asked what she was doing; she said merely putting in some pieces of jean which laid about. I said there were none laying about a few minutes before, for I had been down there, and that she had no business at the drawer. I asked her what she had taken from it the preceding Sunday; she said nothing. I said I was satisfied of her being the thief who had taken all we had lost, it being within the time she had worked for us; she said she had touched nothing. I said there was an officer down stairs ready to take her, and left her (there was no officer) - she finished her work, and in the intermediate time Mr. Gould sent for our foreman to examine the drawers. I, Mr. Gould, and the foreman, went in to examine them. I found two pieces of jean in the drawer I saw her at; they measured four yards and a half each; I do not know where they were before. She came into my service on the 28th of February.</p>

About 1 o'clock on the morning of Christmas-day I went out with my wife, I believe I left my room door locked, and I took the key with me—the outer door opens with a string—I returned about 3 the same morning, knocked at the door, and it was opened by one of the landlord's children—I went to my room, and missed all this property now produced—it is worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was safe when I left at 1—my room door was open, and the lock had been loosened.</p>

I am a looking-glass frame maker, and rent 4, Mini-street—I was disturbed by the policeman about 3 o'clock on Christmas morning, went down, and found the policeman and the prisoner there, and this bundle of clothes—the policeman asked me, in the prisoner's presence, if that bundle belonged to our place—I looked at it, and said it belonged to the person Who occupied the front-room, and I found the room door open, and the lock appeared to have been loosened, but I cannot say whether it was so before or not—the bolt of the lock was shot, but I cannot say whether it had caught or not—my house is in St. George's parish.</p>

I was on duty in Mint-street, and at about 20 minutes before 3 o'clock I saw the prisoner coming down Mint-street with a bundle under his arm—when I first saw him he was two or three yards from Willis's house—I stopped him, and asked him what he had under his arm—he said, "Nothing but my own clothes"—I looked at them, saw a woman's dress, and said to him, "You do not wear a woman's dress, therefore I shall take you to the station-house and see what you have got"—he said, "Do you think I am a thief?"—I said, "I have strong suspicion of you at present"—on the way to the station he said, "A woman gave me this bundle out of one of these houses"—I said, "Show me the house"—he did so—I knocked at the door, and Mr. Willis came down—I asked him if this man was allowed to bring these things out—he said no, and identified them as belonging to his lodger.</p>

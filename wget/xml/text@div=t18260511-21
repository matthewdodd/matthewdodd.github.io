On the 8th of May, just before eleven o'clock at night, I was coming along St. Giles's, and went with a female to some house in a court in St. Giles's; after I got into the room I gave her a shilling - she went out and did not return. The prisoner came up into the room, two or three minutes after she went down - he asked what I was doing there - I said I was brought up there by a female; he said "This is my place and my property in it;" I said I was very sorry but hoped I had done no harm; I was going out, and he caught hold of me by the waistcoat, and took four shillings out of my trousers pocket; he merely caught hold of me and took it - he did not speak when he put his hand into my pocket; I saw another man in the room at the time, and another coming up stairs; I never mentioned a word to them but went down and told the watchman; he forced his hand into my pocket - I made no resistance, because I was afraid of my life - I got a watchman, who came with me; we went to look for the number of the house; I looked over the window of the next house, and saw him standing by the fire - I said "There is the man that drew my money from my pocket;" the watchman knocked at the door - two men came and asked what was wanted; I went in and saw four or five men in the room - the prisoner was sitting at the end of the table - I said I was quite sure he was the man, and the watchman took him - I was sober.</p>

I am a cabinet maker—the prisoner is my nephew, and he is in the same trade—I live in Worship-street—I work for Mr. Udall, No. 37, Skinner-street—the prisoner worked under me for six months—during that time I have lost a hand screw, a scraper, a guage, skate irons, and other things—I have seen them since in possession of the officer—I do not know when they were taken—the last time I saw them was on the 4th or 5th Sept—I saw the tools at Mr. Humphries', in Gee's-court—the prisoner worked with me till lately; till within the last three weeks—he left without notice—he lived in the same house with me, and Mr. Udall came and searched my house—I afterwards met the prisoner in Worship—street, and in consequence of what had been said to me, I asked him how he came to report that I had got the men's tools—he said I had got them in my room—I said he had token his box away; I wished to search his box—he first said he had no box, and then he said it was at his aunt's—I took him with me, and he then said he had got nothing there, what he had got was down at his brother's, at the back of Shoreditch-church—there is a person named Eaton there; he is one of the owners of the tools that were lost, and he promised him if he told where the tools were he should not be hurt—I afterwards went to Mr. Humphries; I there found the box and my tools—I was present when the prisoner was searched; six pencils belonging to me were found on him, and a needle book belonging to my wife.</p>

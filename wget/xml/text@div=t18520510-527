                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Lambton-mews, Notting<lb></lb>hill. On 12th April, about 6 o'clock, I went to a beer shop, 49, Marylebone-lane, and had half a pint of beer—I saw the prisoner there talking to other men—Mr. Barley, the landlord, was in the bar—he said, "I will turn that man out; open the door, Foxall"—I opened it, and the prisoner was turned out—in about twelve minutes or a quarter of an hour he returned; there was another man with him—he came up to me, and said, "I hope I have not offended you?"—I said, "No, my good man, you have not"—the moment he spoke to me, the prisoner sprang on me with this hammer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), struck me on the head, and cut it open—it bled, and I saw nothing more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the beer shop, 49, Marylebone-lane. The prisoner came there with another man, and they had some beer together—the prisoner was very violent, and said he would have beer if he thought proper to pay for it—I refused to draw him beer as he was a little <hi rend="italic">gone</hi>—the floor was taken up for some beer to be sent down, and one of these men pushed a man through the trap—he went in up to his waist, and I put my hand and prevented his falling any further—it was not the prisoner who pushed him in, it was another man in his company; there were two besides the prisoner—there was no quarrel—the man that was pushed down gave the prisoner a pot of beer for assisting in removing some scaffold poles across the street, and when the prisoner had partaken of it he demanded two pots more, and the man said he would give him no more—after that, Foxall opened the door at my request, and I turned the prisoner out—in about ten minutes he returned with another man—one of them had a spade in his hand and some iron chisels in his waistcoat pocket—the prisoner had his hands secreted in his waistcoat—the man who had the spade went up to Foxall, and said, "Have I offended you in any way?"—Foxall said, "No, my good man, you have not offended me"—the prisoner came in with his hand concealed in his waistcoat, went up to Foxall while he was talking to the other roan, raised his hand with the hammer in it, and struck him violently on the top of the head without uttering a word—a more diabolical deed I never saw—I am perfectly sure it was the prisoner that did it, and not the other man—this is the hammer—Foxall did not fall, as a man sitting next him caught him in his arms—the prisoner then made for the door that he came in at, taking the hammer in his hand—he went out, I pursued, kept him in sight, and overtook him—I was afraid to touch him with the weapon in his hand—he ran against a truck in the road, which gave him a check—the hammer dropped from his hand, and then Allen and I closed on him and secured him—I saw Allen pick up the hammer—the prisoner said to me, "Oh, Mr. Barley! you know that I did not strike the blow?"—I said, "You villain! you know better than that; and I much question if the man is not dead"—I took him to the station—I did not hear the prisoner and Foxall speak to each other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a writer, and live at 17, Little Marylebone-street. On 12th April I was at Mr. Barley's, and saw the prisoner in company with some other men—I saw the prisoner push a man backwards; he would have gone into the cellar, but Mr. Barley caught him—two other men were near the prisoner at the time, but it was not them that pushed him but the prisoner—there was a dispute, and Foxall told the prisoner he was no man to knock another man down into the cellar—Foxall then held the door open while Mr. Barley pushed the whole three out—in about ten minutes the prisoner and the younger man who was with him returned together—the other man, who had a shovel in his hand, said to Foxall, "Have I offended you?"—Foxall answered, in perfect good temper, "No," and while he was just saying that, the prisoner stepped from behind the other man and struck him a knock on the head momentarily with the hammer—the prisoner then <hi rend="italic">shuffled</hi> out of the house as quick as he could, taking the hammer with him—I cried out, "Murder!"—I was present when he was stopped, and saw the hammer fall from under his jacket—Foxall's head bled very much.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What process did Mr. Barley use to turn them out; did he bow to them, and say, "I wish you to leave the room:" or what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Foxall held the door open, and Mr. Barley took them by the back of the collar and pushed them out—that was not <hi rend="italic">chucking</hi> them out—the prisoner was pushed out in that way.</p>

On the night of 12th April I saw Foxall in William-street bleeding very much from the head; a man on each side of him was supporting him—I afterwards went into Marylebone-lane, and saw the prisoner in custody of Mr. Barley and Allen—he was drunk—I laid hold of him—he turned round, and said, "You b—r, have you got hold of me?"—I said, "Yes, and I will take good care of you; you cow<lb></lb>ardly fellow, to hit a man on the head with a hammer"—he said, "So help me God! I am sorry for it; I hope he is not hurt"—I said, "That I cannot account for"—he said, "It is all owing to the b—y drink"—I took the hammer from Allen, examined it, and found blood on the end of it—it weighs nearly three pounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 14, Henrietta-street, Cavendish-square. On 12th April, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, Foxall was brought to me bleeding profusely, from a contused wound on the head, produced by a blunt instrument, such as a common hammer—it was a contused wound, not a cut—it had bled very profusely—the skin was divided and torn—a blow from such a hammer as this would be very likely to produce concussion of the brain—the wound did not heal kindly—it was not healed at the examina<lb></lb>tion, before the Magistrate—I have not examined it to-day—concussion will frequently come on three, four, five, or even six weeks afterwards—that would be very dangerous, and very often fatal, but I think the profuse bleeding relieved him—it was a wound of a very dangerous description—he was quite</p>

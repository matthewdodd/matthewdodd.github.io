               <p>When was that? - In February last, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Court. The only evidence that applies to this at all is his declaration in the month of February, that he had had no dealings with the prisoner, and never knew her.</p>

I gave him a guinea for the stolen gown, and his wife gave me three shillings out of it; and I bought another gown for 35 s. for which I had likewise paid him.</p>

               <p>Whether you did not borrow five guineas of Mrs. Gabriel to convey you to Holland? - I did not; she was as poor as I was.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect in what year you came from Holland? - Last Whitsuntide was four years.</p>
               <p>Did you go into service? - Directly.</p>

               <p>You positively deny that there was any debt due from you to Mrs. Gabriel, I do not speak as to the husband? - Never any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Do you deny that there was a private account between you and Mrs. Gabriel? - Yes, I never had any thing to do with Mrs. Gabriel and Mr. Gabriel, besides what I bought as I mentioned before.</p>
               <p>Then you deny all that? - Yes, I am sure so, because I am innocent about it.</p>

             he answered no; (Govin is ordered to withdraw) the alderman asked him again whether she had not bought a silk gown of him, he said, no; he asked him again whether he had ever had any dealings with her, No, was his answer.</p>

               <p>Did you ask him any thing at any other time? - When the girl (the prosecutrix) was arrested, I bailed her, I thought her ill used in the affair, I thought it would be a piece of justice to bail her.</p>
               <p>Court. What action did you bail her in? - The first action upon which she was taken to Wood-street Compter, and the second action too; I did not upon the third action.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you bail for her in the second action in the king's bench? - No, the second action in the Sheriff's Court.</p>
               <p>What is become of that action? - I never enquired.</p>

               <p>Whether at any time you have heard any declarations from Gabriel? - No, I never had any conversation with him, I never liked his company in any respect.</p>
               <p>Court. When you heard him say he never had any dealings with Mrs. Levi, was that declaration made before the sitting alderman when the defendant was brought there upon a charge of felony of which he was afterwards acquitted? - It was.</p>

               <p>Court. When did the conversation you are now going to speak of pass? - That was just after he was indicted; I was at Mr. Gabriel's when an execution came into the house on account of the nonpros; it was just after he was indicted the first time.</p>

               <p>Did he say what money he wanted back again, whether it was what she owed him before, or money she had put him to the expence of? - Money that she had put him to the experience of by putting him to his trial here.</p>
               <p>And what way did he propose to make out this charge? - He asked my advice which way was best to do.</p>
               <p>What did you advise him to? - I told him I did not understand making out such bills as that; I did not choose to do any thing in it; they both said to me at several different times, which do you think it will be best doing? - they asked me to make the bill, they said, Why we shall be too late, or shall we put it up in chalk against the door, or make it out in writing or what?</p>
               <p>What did the defendant want made out? - An account that she had such a day, such goods, and such a day, such goods; to make out an account of goods sold and delivered to her.</p>
               <p>He did not pretend at that time, did he is his wife, that any goods were really sold to Mrs. Levi? - No, they did not pretend any such thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080044"></xptr>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Are you perfect in your memory now as to the time you are swearing to? - Very perfect, I did not swear to any exact time, but I know it was after Gabriel was indicted.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect exactly what that time was? - I know it was after the nonpros of the writ, that an execution came into his house.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the conversation that you speak of after the nonpros in the first action? - Yes, after the nonpros in the both actions.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it clearly has nothing to do with this indictment; the evidence of the witness is this, that in a conversation which he had with him, which now proves to be after a nonpros in the first action, for that is the subject of this indictment, he wanted to make out a charge against this woman for goods sold and delivered on account of an expence that he had been put to on his indictment which he says was soon after; and which was after the time of this first action. Then this indictment is for a false affidavit made before that indictment was preferred; and therefore this conversation cannot refer to that affidavit, it may refer to a subsequent affidavit.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. My Lord, this was a conversation that had passed between the prisoner and this man, after the indictment for perjury was preferred, he knowing what he had sworn was false, was preparing that defence to meet that accusation.</p>
               <p>Court. This would be the very reverse of a defence to that indictment because his defence there was that he never had sold her any thing.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. He applied to this witness to make out a Bill by way of proving that there did exist such an account, and therefore he wanted this man to prepare that kind of defence for him.</p>

               <p>Court. This was clearly after the trial of the indictment, for it was for the expence he had been put to upon his trial.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Was not this after the indictment for the perjury? - It was.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. There was first of all an indictment against this man for stealing those goods.</p>
               <p>Court. What indictment do you speak of? - The indictment that was found against him for the perjury.</p>
               <p>Court. That is quite a different thing, now you must fix the time when it was.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Defendant. He now swears it was after the indictment for the perjury, and that Gabriel and his wife advised with him how to make out a bill, in truth, they had actually sworn to the debt long before that.</p>
               <p>Court. I see that, but this evidence is certainly admissible. Now endeavour to fix as near as you can how long ago it was.</p>
               <p>It was the very session after the nonpros came, I cannot be upon my oath as to the exact time when it was.</p>
               <p>Was it a twelvemonth ago? - No.</p>
               <p>A month ago? - I look upon it according to the best of my memory, it was about three or four months ago, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Court. Which are you most inclined to believe, that it was three or four? - I cannot be positive in the affair, I know it was the session after the nonpros; that I am clear in.</p>
               <p>Was it in the summer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What part of the summer? - It was somewhere about August.</p>
               <p>Court. Fix as near as you can the time when you think this conversation passed? - I cannot fix it better than this, I was in the house when an execution came for the nonpros; the attorney came in and said, I have an execution, and if you do not pay the money I will bring officers into the house.</p>
               <p>How long after that happened was it? - About a month.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure it was as much as three weeks after the judgement of nonpros? - I cannot say whether three weeks, four weeks, or five weeks; I think it was there away.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was it after they threatened to take an execution out against him? - I cannot recollect the days nor weeks, I think to the best of my recollection it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080045"></xptr>four or five weeks, or three weeks. I know it was the very session afterwards, because the attorney desired him to settle it with this Cook or he would be indicted; he took no notice of it, and therefore the next session, Gabriel was indicted.</p>
               <p>Defendant. When he says that nonpros came home I was cast at Guildhall, and was confined in prison.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did this conversation pass? - After he came out of prison at his own house.</p>
               <p>Court. What had he been in prison for? - About striking the constables, he was confined for three months.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Defendant. Do you know any thing of a Mr. Bowers an attorney? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect waiting upon him at any time relative to Gabriel's business? - Yes, I was, along with Gabriel.</p>
               <p>What did you tell Mr. Bowers; - Mrs. Gabriel told me that Mr. Bowers had sent her a line that they were going to file common bail; Mrs. Gabriel said, this woman is going to Holland.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is, what you said to Mr. Bowers? - The very words which Mrs. Gabriel told me, I should tell Mr. Bowers, that I said -</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Defendant. What did you say to Bowers? - The words Mrs. Gabriel told me, that this woman would go abroad, and if she was put upon common bail, she should loose all her money.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Mr. Bowers that he need not proceed in that second action; that it would be of no kind of use for him to do it? - Those were the words I said to Mr. Bowers as I said before.</p>
               <p>Then you deny telling Mr. Bowers to discontinue the action? - I cannot recollect that I said any thing about having him discontinue the action, though I know I went afterwards to Mr. Bowers and asked him the reason why he had superseded it; I said I understood that this woman was going away and that it would be of no service to go on.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect making any application to Gabriel for money at any time? - I never did make any application to him.</p>
               <p>That you deny? - I do deny that.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect your being in custody at any time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not a messenger sent to him then? - I was bail for Mr. Cavernor; I was taken in execution; Mrs. Cavernor desired me to send to Gabriel, that she would give

             a pledge, to send as much money as I was taken in execution for.</p>
               <p>Did not you send to him for money? - Not for myself, it was for Mrs. Cavernor.</p>
               <p>Gabriel did not send you that money? - I never had any answer, because Mrs. Cavernor came to town and paid it herself.</p>
               <p>Did you send any threats to Gabriel, that if he did not send you that money, of something you would do? - I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect sending word that if Gabriel did not send you the fifteen guineas you would make it four for him? - I beg your pardon, you are mistaken.</p>
               <p>Court. The money you sent for was for a Mr. Cavernor? - Yes, I was bail for him.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to send for that money for him? - Because I was taken in execution for him, being his bail.</p>
               <p>Court. The money was to discharge you out of execution was it not? - Yes, but it was for him, because Cavernor would give him a security for it.</p>
               <p>Court. And it was refused? - He never sent any answer.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Defendant. And you deny making use of any threats respecting the defendant? - I do.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to tell Mr. Bowers that it was hard this woman should be put upon common bail, and so on, when Mrs. Gabriel was there herself? - Because she desired me.</p>
               <p>Court. Though she was present herself? - Yes, because she thought she could not speak it plain and proper to Mr. Bowers, as she cannot talk English so well.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she desire you in the presence of Mr. Bowers, or had she told you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080046"></xptr>before to say it? - I went along with her at her request to Mr. Bowers.</p>
               <p>Was this after they had desired you to make out this false bill? - No, it was before.</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. Gabriel, before you went to Bowers, did say this woman owed her some money? - She did not say she owed her money, but that she was under an arrest.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not she say it was very hard she should loose all her money if Mrs. Levi went to Holland? - She meant the expences that would attend a trial; she would not let the attorney go on with further expence upon that account.</p>

             the witness came to my chambers, and went with me to Lord Mansfield's.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any instructions from either of them at your chambers? - I went to Mr. Plat; the affidavits were produced; I told Mrs. Gabriel she wanted to be discharged upon common bail. When I was coming out of the chambers Levi said, if that was the case it did not signify proceeding against her, for she would loose both debt and costs, as the defendant was going abroad, and she bid me not proceed.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that said in Mrs. Gabriel's presence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mrs. Gabriel afterwards? - I do not know that I ever did; I did not discontinue the action; the consequence was they signed a nonpros.</p>

               <p>Can you tell the month that you took this bill down from the wall? - It is not a year and an half ago. I know it was much about that month; this affair you asked me about before happened about last October was a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>What have you to bring it back to your recollection that you took it down on the 12th of last October? - It was just after we came back from the country; as he had been at a great loss in the affair of Mr. Kitchen, he wanted to recover money due to him.</p>
               <p>You was in custody just after you came back? - I was in custody for my foolishness. I had sufficient bail there, but went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080049"></xptr>to drink with my friends. I return 2000 l. a year, and am a man of property.</p>
               <p>Yes; I know you swear that often in the King's Bench? - I never justified bail in my life in that court. I bailed this affair of Barew and Gabriel because I knew it was a spiteful affair.</p>
               <p>So Gabriel asked you, a man of property, that returns 2000 l. a year, to come to his house and take this down? - I keep his Excise-book, as he cannot write or read.</p>
               <p>Who keeps the other books? - They keep no other books; it is all upon the wall; they do not do any great deal of business.</p>
               <p>She cannot write can she? - Yes, in Dutch; I took it all off by our little almanacks.</p>
               <p>What kind of wall is this; a white plaister wall? - No; it is not a plaister wall; it is much about the colour of the wainscoting of this court. There is chalk there.</p>
               <p>Counsel. No doubt of that; was it the whole side of the room that was chalked? - A little more than the size of that book, (about twelve inches by six) may be not more than that.</p>
               <p>And the articles were at full length, just as you have taken them down here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you took it down exactly as it was upon the wall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you wrote the debts down from the chalking upon the wall, fairly as it is here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you have got a copy of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not keep the copy? - No; I made it, and gave it Mrs. Gabriel.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know that it is the exact copy? - Yes; because I have it in my pocket now, you may see here that it is not a fresh made one.</p>
               <p>You have kept one copy? - No; I did not keep it. Mrs. Gabriel gave it me now upon the trial; it was given to me to prove the original.</p>

               <p>GEORGE FOBS. I saw the prisoner take the boots; they were hanging up outside of the window. I was in a shop opposite; I saw him take them from the window. I pursued him, and overtook him in the next buildings. He told me he had not got the boots. He begged me to let him go. I told him I would take him back to Mr. Wright's house; he said, as I thought proper. A boy picked up the boots, and brought them. I saw the prisoner take them; I did not see him drop them.</p>

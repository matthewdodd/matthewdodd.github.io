            . On the 25th of July the prisoner brought these upper leathers to me to sell - I asked him what he wanted for them; he said 2s.; I said that was more than they were worth - he said they were his father's; he gave me his name and address - I bought them of him for 1s. 9d.; in the course of the day I went to look for his father, and could not find him by the direction which he had given me - on the following Saturday I was going to the leather-cutter's, I met the prisoner, and gave him in charge.</p>

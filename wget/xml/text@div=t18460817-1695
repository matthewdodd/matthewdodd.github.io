                  </hi>. I carry on no business. I live at Ramsgate—on the 22nd June, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I went to No. 4, Francis-street, Vinegar-ground, Old-street, and inquired for the prisoner Pink, who I had known before—I had seen her twice before in that house—I was told she was not at home, but was over the way—she came to roe shortly after, partly undressed—when I went into the house I had nine 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes wrapped up in brown paper, in my right band breeches pocket—I had seen them a quarter of hour before I entered the house, and am quite sure they were in my pocket—I had a gold watch ana chain, and some gold and silver in a purse in my left hand trowsers pocket—I wasshown into the parlour, which is a bed-room—the prisoner Carroll who is the landlady, was there—I went up stairs to a bed-room, as Carroll said she had another woman, and saw Lloyd in bed—I came down again directly I afterwards went to bed with Pink in the parlour—I folded my trowsers up and put them behind the pillow, and slept nearly three hours—when I awoke</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184608170187"></xptr>
               <p>I found my trowsers upon a chair on the other side of the bed, and the pri<lb></lb>soners were all in the room drinking wine—I got out of bed, searched my trowsers, and missed six of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank notes—the brown paper was there, containing only three notes—I have not recovered any of them—one has been paid into the Bank since—Pink gave me back my watch and chain, which was also gone, and also my purse—the notes had not been in the purse nor in the same pocket—I had been up all night before, and had met some philanthropic friends—I swear I had the notes, because I unfolded the paper in the street about a quarter of an hour before—I did not count them, but am quite satisfied I had my whole number—I am satisfied I had more than three—in the course of the afternoon, Lloyd and Pink were taken into custody—I stopped the notes at the Bank the same morning—I hart received them from the Bank.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Bradbee, of No. 115, Newgate-street. On Sunday morning, the 8th of February, I was awoke by a noise at the bed-room window, and thought I heard somebody open it—it is on the second floor, and has no shutters—I looked, and thought I saw some<lb></lb>body</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183503020057"></xptr>
               <p>coming in—I got out of bed, left the room, and alarmed Mr. Bradbee—he returned with me to the room, and there we saw the prisoner sitting in a chair—Mr. Bradbee then fired a pistol, which he had with him—he meant to fire it at the man, but I do not think he fairly saw him—Mrs. Bradbee was with us—we then left the room, went into the back room, and gave an alarm at the back of the house—the watchman broke open the street door, and came up stairs, and took the man in the front room—I did not look out of the window to see how he had got in—the house was under repair, and I suppose he got up the scaffolding—I had never seen him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Newgate-street—it is my dwelling-house, and was under repair—I was called up on this morning by the witness, who is my assistant, about five, or a quarter after five o'clock—it was quite dark—she came to my bed-room—I went with her and my wife into the room—I loaded my pistol before I left my bed-room—that took me about five minutes—I did not hear any noise in the mean time—I went into Mrs. Sweetlove's room with my wife—immediately on entering the room they ran away, and left me in the dark—I saw something move, and instantly fired, intending to fire at the thief, but did not bit him—I retreated into the back-room shortly afterwards—the watchman came very shortly after, and myself and the watchman took the prisoner into custody—his face was blackened; and he was dressed very differently to what he is now—the scaffolding before my house was very easy of access—there was a ladder—he might have got up very easily—there was a board on the ladder; but he could easily get up behind the ladder.</p>

On the 8th of February I was sent for at the watch-house, stating that there was a report of a gun or pistol at Mr. Bradbee's house—I went and assisted the watchman in forcing the street-door open—I was not long about it—I went up stairs with the watchman, who went into the second floor room, and brought the prisoner down on the stairs—I took him into custody and brought him down stairs—I was on the first floor stairs—I did not go up the second flight of stain—I took him to the watch-house—about two hours before that there was a fire at the King's Head, in Newgate-street, and I turned the prisoner out of the coffee-room there—he said he had come merely to assist the fireman—his face was blackened—I understand he is a smith by trade—I am sure he is the same man—he seemed to be sober, but we could get nothing out him—he said nothing, nor before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police at Scotland-yard—on the 8th of August last I met the prisoner in the Gray's-inn-road, about ten o'clock at night—I asked him if his name was Ancenay, be said it was—I told him I was an inspector of police, and that I had been to Southley-lodge, Datchet, near Windsor, that I had there opened two cases and seen certain plates which I believed were used for the purpose of Russian notes—he said, "I do not exactly understand you, please tell me in French if you can"—I did so; he then said, "I will tell you all about it; I am one of the oldest lithographers in Fiance; some years ago two men came to me and engaged me to make notes for the Government of Hungary—I came to London and worked for a Mr. Day, and we made notes to the extent of 290,000,000, we were then stopped by the Government and I returned to Paris; about two and-a-half years ago the same gentlemen again came to me and said they wanted me to go to London and make more notes for them, I consented, and from that time to the present I have been engaged with them; on the 1st of June I went to Southley-lodge, at Datchet, and there saw a gentle-man who gave the name of Mascaras, be told me to engrave plates and I did so, he said they were not good enough, and he would try photography, and he photographed some fifty Russian rouble notes; about a month ago he went away, and as he had not paid me I returned to London, having pre<lb></lb>viously packed up the plates; it was my intention to have gone to the Russian Ambassador, and have given myself up because I knew we were doing wrong"—I then asked the prisoner if he had any plates in London—he replied, "I am living with a woman, and she has some in her room"—I then went with the prisoner to No. 127, Gray's-inn-road, to a back room on the second floor, the prisoner went into the room first, looked under the bed and produced this box (marked B)—I asked him if he had any more plates—he replied, "There are two cases in the hands of one of our com<lb></lb>rades "—I asked him where he lived, and he said, "No. 4, Berwick-street, Soho"—he said, "It is no use your going there as he will not give them up to any one but me"—I then went to Berwick street with him, and in a front room I saw a man named Nichola with his wife and children—the prisoner said, "Adrian, I have come for those boxes; it is important I should send them to Paris to-night"—Nichola said, "Are you going to give these things</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186509180074"></xptr>
               <p>up?"—Nichola and the prisoner looked under the bed and they took from it a large wooden box—the box is not here but the contents are—I asked if there was anything else, and Nichola then took the small box (marked C from a shelf—I then told Nichola that I was an officer, and should take him into custody as these boxes contained plates for the fabrication of Russian notes—Nichola said that the boxes had been entrusted to him by the pri<lb></lb>soner, and that he was not aware of the contents—I found this engraved metal plate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) tied to one of the boxes—the prisoners were removed to the station, where I opened the box (marked" C) and found it to contain ten photographs of fifty-rouble Russian notes—I then returned to the pri<lb></lb>soner's lodgings, and there found a photographic copying frame, a printer's roller, and a quantity of paper, the same that I had found at Datchet, and also another sheet of paper, bearing an impression from one of the plates that I found at Datchet—I cautioned the prisoner at the commencement of his statement—on the morning of the same day I had been to Datchet and searched Southley-lodge, in a back room up stairs I found two portions of a printing press; the room smelt strongly of acids, and there were stains upon the floor—in a room down stairs I found two boxes, and opened them—one contained six large stones, upon one of which there was a preparation for engraving—the smaller box contained eight stones, one of which was prepared the same as the large one—I then opened a hamper, and found it contained several bottles of different kinds of acids—these bottles were wrapped up in paper, upon which there was a kind of watermark, as if taken from the plates referred to—I opened another box, and found it con<lb></lb>tained pumice stone, a sponge, and printing inks of various colours; in the garden I found a large case—I opened it and found it to contain a complete printing press, with the exception of the two parts I found up stairs—the conversation I have given took place in the presence of one of my sergeants.</p>

I am attached to the Russian Consulate—these two plates are photographed impressions of a Russian rouble bank note, of the value of fifty roubles—Russian rouble notes are part of the imperial currency of Russia—this plate is a pattern of the water-mark of a fifty-rouble note of the year 1855.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I have been ill two years and a half; while I was at work in Paris, two gentlemen came to me, and asked me if I had been working at Mr. Day's, in London, and if I had made any Hungarian bank notes; I said I had. They said they had a similar work to do, but not so important; would I go to London with them? I declined then. At the end of April, or beginning of May, they called again and made the same proposal; they offered me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week. I agreed to go. They gave me some money in advance, and I started for London. It was agreed that he should pay my mother, out of my wages, twenty francs a week, but from the time I arrived here, on the 1st of June, he has only paid her once; he owes me 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I have not a penny in the world, and my poor mother is nearly turned out in the streets.

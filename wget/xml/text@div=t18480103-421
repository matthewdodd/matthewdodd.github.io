                  </hi>. I am a watchman in the service of the St. Katharine Dock Company. A little after seven o'clock, in the morning of the 17th Dec., I was on duty on the quay of the F warehouse—I saw a chest of tea which had been landed on the 15th or 16th—it was broken—I covered it with a Gunney bag—there was a hole in it big enough for any one of the put their hand in—a little time afterwards I saw the prisoner run away from the chest—I ran round to follow him, and my partner came up and caught him in his arms—I had to pass the tea-chest before I took the prisoner, and the Gunney bag was thrown off the chest on to the stones—I saw my mate stop the prisoner—he begged of him to let him go, for he was a ruined man, or something to that effect—while he was in the hands of me and Hutchinson, as we were takin him to the Dock-house, he rubbed me against the iron staun<lb></lb>cheon in passing the bridge, and I was obliged to draw back—he got his left hand at liberty, and shoved up his hat and a quantity of tea fell out, and was thrown in the dock and on the bridge—he then said we might do what we pleased with him, he had got what he wanted.</p>

               <p>went with him to look at it—there was a hole broken in it that I could put my hand in—as I was afterwards going towards the chest, the prisoner ran away—I caught him by the collar—he said, "For God's sake say nothing about it; I am a ruined man"—I asked what he was doing there—he said he was at work on board the <hi rend="italic">John Laird</hi>—we passed on the bridge, and as he got his left hand at liberty, he turned up his hat and the tea fell from it into the dock—there was a little dust of it on the bridge—when we got a little further, he got his left hand at liberty again and emptied his jacket pocket of some tea—I picked up this quarter of a pound of tea from the ground—I then took him on to the Dock-house, searched him, and found in his right hand jacket pocket this other quarter of a pound of green tea—I have a sample from the chest which corresponds with it—I asked him where he got it from—he said, "From the deck of the <hi rend="italic">John Laird</hi> "—I went to the deck of the <hi rend="italic">John Laird</hi> and there was none there—there had been five or six pounds of tea lost from the chest<lb></lb>there was a very large hole in it.</p>

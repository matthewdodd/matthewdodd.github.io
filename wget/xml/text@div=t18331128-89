             (police-constable G 183). I was going my round, past the prosecutor's shop, at two o'clock in the morning, and saw a hackney-coach start from the rank, and go down the City-road - I saw three men follow the coach from the same side as Mr. Hill's shop; they did not seem to have shining buttons on their cloths; I went round my beat, and found Mr. Hill's shop-door open, and gave the alarm - I had seen the prisoners Pott and Langham at one o'clock, in Red-lion-court or passage, which is four doors from the prosecutor's shop - I asked them what they wanted there; they said, something to drink, and they tapped at the door of the public-house; they then went out of the court, and I followed them; they went to the front-door of the public-house, in St. John's-street-road; they stood there, and I went down my beat, and they went down before me and endeavoured to conceal their faces; I told them it was of no use; (I think I had seen them before) they crossed, and went down Pentonville-road - Pott had a dark great coat on, and a shawl-handkerchief muffled round his neck; it was a white ground with dark spots on it - some time after that I met him again between Goswell-road and St. John-street-road, nearly opposite the Angel; he was there without the handkerchief, but he had the great coat on, open to the two lower buttons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What were you before you were an officer? A. A shoemaker; I left that about four years ago, and entered the police - I think I had seen Pott before, in or about the neighbourhood of Saffron-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I warn you that I have several witnesses here to contradict you; when had you seen him? A. Within six months; I cannot tell what month; I did not pay that attention to take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon the oath you have taken, did you, when you were first before the magistrate, say one word about seeing Pott in Red-lion-passage? A. I did not think of it; I did not see them properly; I only saw one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a word about it? A. I knew they would be remanded, and that was my reason for not saying it - I did not hear it stated before the magistrate that Pott and his friends could prove he was in another place.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, do you mean to confine yourself to the answer you have just given, that the reason why you did not state that you saw Pott in Red-lion-passage was, because you knew he would be remanded, or that you did not think of it? A. I did not recollect it; I did not say I did not know Pott; I said, I did not know his name.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you ever in Coppin's house? A. No; it is a lodging-house - I never was at Leeds in my life - I was not born in the country, and never was there but for a little pleasure; I was born in London, and have lived here for seventeen years.</p>

At a quarter before three o'clock that morning, I was coming down Saffron-hill, and saw a man going up West-street, till he came to Coppin's house, and went in; I went down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280080"></xptr>to the City-bounds, and returned and went up West-street; I saw Coppin at his door in his shirt sleeves; as I passed he drew his head in and said, "Whist, whist, there is a policeman coming;" I passed on till I came to the City-watchman, I stood talking with him a few minutes, and a man came out of Coppin's door in dark clothes; he went up Black-boy Alley; I informed my sergeant; he returned in about two hours with another sergeant; he said as there was no order to break the door open they could not do it; but they knocked at the door about five o'clock and no entrance was allowed; I went to No. 12, and asked to go over the houses; I found three umbrellas on the roof of No. 12 and No. 9; I afterwards got into Coppin's and found Coppin, Langham, and Hopkins there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say there were no other persons in the house? A. There was a little child there; I know the house is a common brothel - I have spoken of it, but have not given notice to Colonel

            . I was a police-constable at that time. I went to Coppin's house and knocked at the door, about five o'clock in the morning; I did not get admission - I looked through the key-hole and saw a man in his shirt run through the passage with a candle in his hand - I got admission through No. 7, and got to the back of the house - I saw a person look over the wall in the yard, who, I believe, was Pott; I saw Pott again in the custody of Beadle, about half-past ten, and I believed him to be the same man, I had seen look over the wall - I have known him ever since the beginning of May, and have scarcely been two nights on my beat without seeing him - he said he had come from Deptford on the night of the robbery at half-past ten o'clock; and he denied having been at Coppin's at all - nothing was found on him - when I entered Coppin's house I asked him why he did not admit me when I knocked at the door, but I did not stop to hear his answer - I went into the yard and found this skeleton key, this drop latch key, this dark lantern, and this memorandum book; in the front room I found this crow bar; and in attending on the nightmen, to empty the privy, I found this pick-lock, this piece of pewter, this halfpenny, and two sixpences - I did not find these umbrellas, but assisted Beadle to take care of them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Will you swear that Pott was the man you saw in the yard? A.

               <p>Q. Now I have four persons here to contradict you, will you swear it was him? A. Yes; I am a bricklayer by trade; I left the police on the 16th of this month - I left to suit myself - there was no complaint against me for neglect of duty.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, was there not a complaint against you? A. Not when I left; there had been complaints against me before, the same as other men - they were various; I believe there were five reports against me, but not for being drunk nor neglecting my duty; I was twice reported by the A division - one was for being in a public-house, when called to do my duty - the next was for standing talking to a fellow-policeman that was dismissed; the next report was when I was in the M division; I and the sergeant had a few words, but that was dismissed; I was again reported for being absent from duty, from nine till twelve o'clock - it was not for neglect of duty - I was fined 1s. for that; I believe there was not another report against me - I will swear there were not many more - there were not two more; whether there was one I don't know; I have had two reports this year; one in the beginning of the year; I cannot tell when the second was - I believe it was in July or August; it was in the summer - I did not hear Pott state where he had been; I saw him searched, and this pocket book and this knife were found on him, and a watch and a brooch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this what you called a dark lantern? A. It is part of a dark lanthorn; there were four persons I believe lived in Coppin's house at that time; there were three women in the second-floor back room; there was no man there - there is no empty house adjoining Coppin's - there is a house next door to his which is not inhabited, but it belongs to a man who lives at the next house.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Lewis; Pott slept with me on the night of the 15th of October; I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock - I am not sure at what time Pott came to bed, but I got up about five minutes past seven o'clock, and he was then in bed; I took him a glass of water about ten minutes before eight o'clock - he left my master's between nine and ten o'clock; I attended twice before the magistrates, but they refused to hear me.</p>
               <p>MRS. LEWIS. I saw Pott at our house on the 15th of October, he left to go to Greenwich with my husband - he returned and staid all night, and left in the morning; I have known him eighteen months, he had a good character, he detected one of our young men in robbing us; we breakfasted between eight and nine o'clock.</p>

            . I am a postilion. On Wednesday, the 25th of February last, I was out with the two prisoners at the bar. They were in a post-chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they set out from?</p>
               <p>Pitt. From the George in Long Acre.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the court what happened.</p>
               <p>Pitt. We set out about three in the morning, and stopped at Islington turnpike, they got out of the chaise, and went into the turnpike-house, and staid there till a coach came up.</p>
               <p>Q What coach was it?</p>
               <p>Pitt. It was the Warrington coach. Then they told the coachman they were a guard for that coach, and they got into the chaise, and followed the coach behind. Going up from <placeName id="t17610401-28-crimeloc154">Holloway</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17610401-28-crimeloc154" type="placeName" value="Holloway"></interp>

               <p>Q. Did you stop?</p>
               <p>Pitt. I did. He said, You dog, if you don't stop immediately, I'll blow your brains out He turned from my horse's head, and drove his pistol thro' the wooden blind of the chaise; and said, Gentlemen, your money directly, or I'll blow your brains out. Directly they let fly a blunderbuss in the highwayman's face. He fell back and recovered himself again, and made off from the chaise towards London again.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he come, when he came to you?</p>
               <p>Pitt. He came from towards London, I believe; he turned his horse's head about, and fired a pistol. The ball came over the top of the chaise, and came against the side of my cap.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176104010031"></xptr> The coachman came and helped them to load their pistols again, and said to them, Gentlemen, you had better turn back again, and walk after him. I turned the chaise about accordingly, and walked my horses on in the road. They walked also. As we were coming a little below the hill, we met a machine.</p>
               <p>Q. What machine was it?</p>
               <p>Pitt. I do not know, it was a coach with a set of horses in it. Mr. Darwell and Pentelow were before; they called to me, and bid me ask the coachman whether they had been stopped by a highwayman; and accordingly I did, when I came up to them, and they past me some way.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way were they going?</p>
               <p>Pitt. They were going from London, and I was coming towards London. There was a man on horseback, which is the ostler, came past me, on the left-hand of the coach, to know what was the matter, and turned towards my horses heads; directly one of them let fly at him.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the coach, or machine, was the ostler then?</p>
               <p>Pitt. He was then behind it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far behind it?</p>
               <p>Pitt. Two or three rods. Then they left me and my horses, and I had enough to do to take care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who let fly at the man?</p>
               <p>Pitt. I cannot tell, I did not see who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a pistol, or not.</p>
               <p>Pitt. I cannot tell, I only heard the report of the thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the ostler?</p>
               <p>Pitt. I saw him go back to the coach, and heard him say to the coachman, Lord have mercy upon me, my arm is broke all to pieces. I went on, and overtook them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they walk or run?</p>
               <p>Pitt. That I do not know, I had enough to do to take care of my horses. When I came up to them, they asked me what the man said: I told them he says his arm was broke all to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say to that?</p>
               <p>Pitt. One of them said, The Lord have mercy upon me! Then they said, John, now you may go home to your master as fast as you can, and take no notice of any thing. Coming through Islington I found one of my horses went lame; I got down to see what was the matter, and found he had lost a shoe. I was obliged to have one set on at the White lion at Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was this that the firing was?</p>
               <p>Pitt. This was in the hollow of the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the morning?</p>
               <p>Pitt. It might be about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you stop at the turnpike?</p>
               <p>Pitt. That was about four.</p>
               <p>Q Was there any house near you?</p>
               <p>Pitt. There was one, I believe, within a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to distinguish what kind of a man it was that stopped you?</p>
               <p>Pitt. As high as I can guess, he was upon a little black horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What size man?</p>
               <p>Pitt. A middle size man, a thin man.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured cloaths?</p>
               <p>Pitt. I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear Darwell describe the person?</p>
               <p>Pitt. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you yourself described the highwayman's cloaths before justice Fielding?</p>
               <p>Pitt. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear Darwell declare before justice Fielding what kind of man it was?</p>
               <p>Pitt. No, I do not remember that.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the ostler dressed?</p>
               <p>Pitt. Upon my life I do not know, I took no notice about that.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words you made use of to the coachman?</p>
               <p>Pitt. I called out to him to know if they had been stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call to them to stop?</p>
               <p>Pitt. No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Counsel. You say the highwayman broke the blind?</p>
               <p>Pitt. Yes, then the highwayman said, Your money directly, or I'll blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened upon that?</p>
               <p>Pitt. Then Mr. Pentelow let fly directly in his face, and he turned for London.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then you say afterwards you met this machine.</p>
               <p>Pitt. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Mention what past as near as possibly you can recollect it?</p>
               <p>Pitt. The ostler turned round on my lefthand, and went past my horses heads, and turned towards Mr. Darwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what his design was in turning round?</p>
               <p>Pitt. That I cannot say, I imagine he turned round to ask what had passed.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was that man mounted on that came up to your chaise?</p>
               <p>Pitt. A black one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it like the ostler's horse?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176104010032"></xptr>Pitt. The same colour, as near as I can guess, and the same height.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the ostler any pistol in his hand?</p>
               <p>Pitt. Upon my life I saw none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Pitt. I did not hear him say a word; then it was the pistol went off,</p>
               <p>Q. How many reports did you hear at that time?</p>
               <p>Pitt. There was only one report; but I cannot tell what it was with, because the horses were frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. Were Mr. Darwell and Mr. Pentelow separate, or together?</p>
               <p>Pitt. They were both there; but I cannot say whether they were separate, or together.</p>

            . I was a guard to the Leeds machine. On the 25th of February last, I set out from London with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Between that and Highgate were you stopped?</p>
               <p>Richardson. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was your coach travelling on?</p>
               <p>Richardson. They were on a trot; I was on the right, along-side of the horses, as near as I can imagine, between the leaders and the wheel-horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing interrupt you?</p>
               <p>Richardson. Nothing hindered us till we came to Holloway.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first thing?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I saw a chaise standing in the road, and the boy on the horse; we were going a great trot by, somebody cried out, Stop. I cannot say whether it was the boy, or not. Stop was called by somebody. I turned my head round, and saw a flash.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the coachman stop?</p>
               <p>Richardson. He did a little time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing said to the coachman before the firing?</p>
               <p>Richardson. Not a syllable, not to me or him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said whether the coach had been robbed?</p>
               <p>Richardson. Not a syllable in the world of that; before any body asked any questions, they fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any wound?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I did, on the thick of my left-arm; and a passenger that was behind the coach, was shot through the body.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his name?</p>

               <p>Q. Upon this, did the person that shot come to know, or say any thing?</p>
               <p>Richardson. No, they went their way, I did not see any thing of them any more. After he had shot, and I received the wound, the man d - ed me, and bid me keep off. These were the very words.</p>

               <p>Richardson. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other of them make use of any expression about guarding of you?</p>
               <p>Richardson. No, I turned my horse about, and said, Gentlemen, what is the reason of all this? I am a guard to this coach.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mr. Lee was wounded, what became of him?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I saw the ball cut out of his side; he was carried to the Red Lion at Highgate.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live after this?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>Q. How was you dressed?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I had a great coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour?</p>
               <p>Richardson. A sort of lightish colour, and a fustian waistcoat; and also this red waistcoat that I have on now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any arms?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I had a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you carry it?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I had it in my right-hand, with my coat drawn over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hold your pistol in such a manner that they could see it?</p>
               <p>Richardson. If they did see it, it was more than I knew; it was the contrary side to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you was along-side your horses when they fired?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I am sure I was; perhaps I might be nearer the wheel-horses. I will not say I was quite forward.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176104010033"></xptr>Q. What piece was it that was fired?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I cannot say whether it was a gun or a pistol, the hole in my coat may describe the size of the ball. I believe there were more balls than one, or there could not be that damage done. There was one grazed my side.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you set out in the morning?</p>
               <p>Richardson. We set out about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. From where?</p>
               <p>Richardson. From the Swan and Two Necks in Lad lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What coach was it?</p>
               <p>Richardson. It was the Leeds coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear when you went through Islington, that the Warrington coach was gone by?</p>
               <p>Richardson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear there was any guard to the machine?</p>
               <p>Richardson. There was some talk, but I did not give any ear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any firing before you saw the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Richardson. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet any body after you got through Islington, returning towards London.</p>
               <p>Richardson. Yes, one man.</p>
               <p>Q What sort of a person was he?</p>
               <p>Richardson. We being so quick going by, I did not take any notice; but there was a man went by on the off side of the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go a pace?</p>
               <p>Richardson. He past me on a canter, pretty briskly, and we were on a sharp trot.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was he on?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I cannot justly say, it was in the dark of the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might it be?</p>
               <p>Richardson. It might be about five o'clock.</p>

            . I am the driver of the Leeds machine.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 25th of February last what happened?</p>
               <p>Ashbourn. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with any interruption between London and Holloway?</p>
               <p>Ashbourn. It was at Holloway we met with a post-chaise; it stood still in the road; and as I came up to it, he that drove it spoke. I understood him to say, Stop.</p>
               <p>Q. What pace were you going?</p>
               <p>Ashbourn. We were going a pretty good trot.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a guard to the coach?</p>
               <p>Ashbourn. The ostler was a guard to it, his name is Richardson.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when you heard that word?</p>
               <p>Ashbourn. He was a little way from the side of the coach, and but a very little way. When I heard the word I directly ordered my postilion to stop; and before I spoke to any-body, I heard a pistol, or something of a gun go off. Immediately the man cry'd out, Gentlemen, you use me ill, I am a guard to the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to discern the person?</p>
               <p>Ashbourn. I could not know any-body, it was a little moon-light, but I could not know the men.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the coach were they?</p>
               <p>Ashbourn. They could not be a hundred yards from it, they were not I believe fifty from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come up to you, and ask you if you had been stopt?</p>
               <p>Ashbourn. There came a young man riding by; when the ostler called out I got from my box, and asked him if he was shot; he said yes, his arm was broke, and the blood was running down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the men say any thing?</p>
               <p>Ashbourn. I never heard a word from them to my knowledge, only somebody said, Stop.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body else wounded?</p>
               <p>Ashbourn. Yes, a young man that was behind the coach was: there was a young woman by him, she called out to me to come and assist: I went and spoke to him, he did not answer; then I lifted him up, he spoke something which I did not understand; I helped him up, and he sat upright: the gentleman let us put him in the coach, and I ordered the postilion to drive to Highgate as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men did you see?</p>
               <p>Ashbourn. I am not certain whether I saw above one, but not to know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come up to seize the guard, as supposing him a highwayman?</p>
               <p>Ashbourn. No, they did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any accident happen?</p>
               <p>Ward. Yes, the guard was shot, and a gentleman's servant behind the coach was shot.</p>

He said, I did not shoot, it was one Darwell that shot; that was the reason I came to know who Darwell was: he said he was at Mr. Fielding's. Then I went there. I asked Darwell how he came to be so rash as to shoot at the man that was guard to the coach; he said he did shoot him, and was very sorry for it, for he thought him to be a highwayman.</p>

             at the Red Lion at Highgate. I was called up between five and six in the morning: he and the ostler were both wounded. In examining Lee I found blood on his shirt, on the left-side: putting his shirt up, I found an orifice, thro' which a leaden ball had past, a gunshot wound; the man was weak and low. I, thinking the ball had past quite thro', went to look on the right-side. Upon examining the right-side I found no orifice, but found the ball lodged under what we call the integuments; upon which I cut upon it, and extracted it. I ordered the man immediately to bed, and gave him such things as I thought necessary, and waited on him two or three times that day: the last time was about five in the afternoon. I found his pulse excessive low, quite oppressed, and, in short, dying. I left him, thinking to call upon him again in an hour's time, and at my return the man was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Cook. That bullet, that entered the cavity of the belly, and wounded some principal part there.</p>
               <p>For the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Justice Fielding. I had information made before me the 25th of February, of a highwayman that infested that road, and of a great many robberies committed on that road, and likewise of the Warrington coach being robbed the week before, and that it was extremely difficult to get a sight of the highwayman, and more especially when they take to rob stage-coaches. I have sent a person out with the coach to guard it. I desired Mr. Pentelow, who is a very worthy good man, to go with the other man, and to stop at the turnpike till the coach came up, and to see them safe to Barnet, as that road had been so infested. The information will discover the highwayman's horse to be exactly the same as the ostler rode, that is, as he has now been described.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send them there for any other purpose?</p>
               <p>J. Fielding. No, for no other purpose in the world. When informations are brought to me of a road being infested, it is my constant practice to send out four, or five, or more persons, to patroll those roads all night, and they are paid accordingly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it several highwaymen that you sent these men out after, or one particular one?</p>
               <p>J. Fielding. One in particular, the book will shew that, when it is read, better than I can from my memory.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any informations being given of any robberies being committed on the Barnet road.</p>
               <p>Marsden. I do, a number of them. I remember two or three committed the way as they were attacked. There was a gentleman of Rotherham in Yorkshire robbed near the same place, and also the schoolmaster of Barnet, they all describe the same man; and the Warrington stage had been robb'd, I believe, the same week.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176104010035"></xptr>Q. How do they describe the highwayman's horse?</p>
               <p>Marsden. They give an account of a little black or dark-brown horse, and a thin man; the schoolmaster of Barnet describes him as a thin man, that rides about ten stone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, after these informations were given to Mr. Fielding, that any directions were given to the prisoners concerning means to take the highwayman?</p>
               <p>Marsden. Mr. Fielding sent these two persons out in this manner on that morning to guard this coach; and in case they should be attacked, to fire at the highwayman's horse, and endeavour to take him.</p>

               <p>Marsden. Sometimes they are sent by letter, then I enter them in this book that I have in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any description in your book of the highwayman that they went after that day?</p>
               <p>Marsden. Yes, here is one from a person that keeps the Blue Bell in Market-street, who was robbed in a post-chaise, at the bottom of the first hill by Highgate, of a large old fashioned silver watch; he says the man was about thirty years of age, five feet, five or six inches, mounted on a black cut tailed horse.</p>
               <p>Q Whether you do not know that you advertised that the Leeds machine travelled with a guard?</p>
               <p>Marsden. No, I never heard it, nor I never knew any coach have a guard on horseback. I have known guards ride in the basket, but I never knew them to have pistols in their hands on horseback.</p>

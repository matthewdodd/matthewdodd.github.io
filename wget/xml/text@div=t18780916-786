                  </hi>. I live at 26, Alvington Crescent, Stoke Newington—I am fourteen years of age, and have been the office boy of Messrs. Miller and Sons, of 23, Leadenhall Street, solicitors, since last March—on 16th July the prisoner came to the office and asked to see Mr. Miller—I told him he was not in—he said "Could you let me see the books referring to Mrs. Depledge?"—I said "I know nothing about any books; but I can let you see the papers"—he had said he came from the country to pay a bill for Mrs. Depledge, and he was her brother—he said "Let me see them"—I got the papers out of Mr. Miller's basket and gave them to the prisoner; they consisted of a bill of exchange, an account, copy letters from Messrs. Miller and Son, and one letter from Mrs. Depledge to the Marquis D'Oliveres—these are some of the documents (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said "I must take these papers away to look over the account"—I said "You must not take the papers away; instructions have been given not to allow anything to go out of the office"—I gave him a pencil, and he wrote on an envelope "Received of Messrs. Miler and Son, 25, East India Chambers, the letters appertaining to Depledge. H. Ashley, 67, Hyde Park Gardens"—I said "How can your name be Ashley if your sister's, name is Depledge?"—he said "Oh, she is married," and asked me if I knew where the Marquis D'Oliverez lived—I said I did not—he said if he knew where he lived he would puneh his</p>
               <p>b—y head for him—I made no reply to that—he took the papers away—when Mr. Miller came the next morning I made a communication to him—I was in a cab when the prisoner was arrested in the Essex Road—he opened the door, and I said "That is the gentleman that took the papers"—we afterwards took the prisoner to the police-station—I stood apart when Mr. Miller and the prisoner talked.</p>

Mr. Lickfold defended Cox at the Mansion House—these papers have been returned to Mr. Miller—I heard Mr. Miller say that he saw Mra Depledge's letter at 12 o'clock upon the Tuesday, when Cox came at 3—I did not see Mr. Miller that evening; he came next morning about 10—he had gone to Croydon—he left the office between 12 and 12.30—I will swear he was there at 12—he did not say to me that he had to go to Plaistow that day—I do not think the marquis was with Mr. Miller on the Monday before the letter was stolen—he had the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at 23. East India Chambers, Leadenhall Street—I have known the Marquis D'Oliverez about ten years—he consulted me with reference to making Mr. and Mrs. Depledge bank<lb></lb>rupt, and entrusted to me a bill of exchange, an account for 282<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and the documents attached to the depositions and others—I left them in a basket on my desk with the instructions paper—there were also two copy letters from Miller and Son to Mr. Depledge, and an original letter from Mrs. Depledge to the Marquis of Oliverez, which are not here—I had no knowledge of the prisoner—I gave no authority to any one to take away those documents from my office—I remember the purport of the missing letter—Mrs. Depledge admitted the debt, and acknowledged the great kindness of the marquis to her and her husband—I saw the papers last on the 13th, when I referred to them to prepare a debtor's summons—they were all there—I left about two o'clock to go to Croydon—I returned the next morning, when Austin made a communication to me—I wanted to see if the prisoner would keep his appointment the next day—I put the matter in the hands of the police on the Thursday about 4 p.m—when the prisoner was apprehended he said he was very sorry, it was a rely stupid act on his part, but he had been put up to do it by Depledge, and that he had had a drop or else he Would not have done it—I received this receipt on this envelope from Austin—I went to Hyde Park Gardens—the highest number is 40—I could not find any Mr. Ashley.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I received these documents at the Mansion House—I believe all the documents are returned except Mrs. Depledge's letter and the two copy letters—I have received letters from the marquis since the commencement of these proceedings against Mr. Cox—those are privileged letters—I have only received one asking me to withdrew, not several—I will swear I have not received four—I cannot tell yon how the marquis's letters began—he wrote a great deal—he was my client, not my friend, simply an acquaintance—I might have received a letter with the sentence, "I beg you again to withdraw entirely, as I said to yon before"—I say most decidedly I saw Mrs. Depledge's letter on the Tuesday, and the marquis read several letters to me, but from Mrs. Depledge not one—my bey told me the marquis was there on the Monday—I do not remember seeing him then—I cannot say whether I did or not—the marquis did not read to me on the Monday the letter that I say was stolen—he handed me letters, but clients do not read letters, we read them ourselves—as far as I recollect the</p>

I thank you for your great kindness to me and to my husband, and I hope the day is not far off when I shall be able to repay mine and my husband's debt to you.") I think those are the words I gave you at the police-court—I cannot say if any of it was underlined—it did not begin, "Your letter to hand. You are the greatest fool I ever met with"—I should be sure to have recollected that—I do not recollect the date of it (<hi rend="italic">Reading coutinued</hi>: "I do not care for you or twenty solicitors. Do your best and do your worst, but take care what you do. Your late behaviour makes me forget your kindness to me and my husband, which I hope to repay, with all due respect to old age. Yours very truly, A. Depledge.") That was not the letter—I will swear it—the handwriting is similar—the bankruptcy proceed<lb></lb>ings are stopped because the documents are in Court—I do not know whether the marquis is here; I have not seen him this week.</p>

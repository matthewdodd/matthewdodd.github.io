               <p>JOHN LIPSON. On the 14th of July I was in <placeName id="t18260914-323-crimeloc1827">Gray's-inn-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not appear very drunk? A. No; he returned back to the place where I was; when his hat fell off one of the girls took it up and put it on his head.</p>

            . I was on duty on the 14th of July - the gentleman came to me and said, he had been robbed; he said there were two men, and one held him while the other took his cap from him - he described him as dressed like a sailor - we went down Gray's-inn-lane-road, where we saw them, and he said, "That is the one in the middle" - I took the prisoner, and he began fighting - his hat fell off, and the cap fell out of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not appear tipsy? A. I should not have supposed so; no doubt he had been drinking with the girls.(Cap produced and sworn to.)</p>

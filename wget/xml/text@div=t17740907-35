               <p>Marshall. I was, but almost senseless by the blows I received; when I came to myself they were gone out of the house; I went out at the door, there I saw Shaw; he stuck me behind the ear which brought me to the ground; when I went into the house I was so stunned with bruises, I do not know how long I might be before I came out again; I met a watchman, I told him I had been robbed of the things mentioned in the indictment; I went with the watchman in search of Shaw; first I found him in Russell-street with some women; before I could get the watchman to him, he got away; we met him afterwards coming out of King's Head court and secured him; I am certain it is the man that robbed me.</p>

            . The prosecutor came to me between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, and said he had been robbed, and that he would show me the man that robbed him; we went to Russel-street; we could not find him, and I left the prosecutor; soon after that he came to me again, and said the man was in King's Head court; I went with him to the Sun in King's Head court; I saw Shaw coming out of the house with a glass of gin; the prosecutor said that was the man; I took him to the round-house; the man who keeps the Sun came soon after and brought Liddyman and Wigley; they were both in liquor; Shaw said if we would let him out for half an hour he would find the man that had the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober or otherwise?</p>
               <p>Payne. I cannot say whether he was drunk or sober. I never saw him before that time; he seemed flustered; whether that was occasioned by the robbery and the blows I cannot say; I have no reason to say he was drunk from what I saw of him.</p>

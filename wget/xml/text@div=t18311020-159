            . I am a Policeman. On the 27th of September, about two o'clock in the morning, I observed Leanon following the prisoner; I joined in the pursuit, and saw Leanon secure him in Cannon-street, St. George in the East - the prosecutor, in the courst of the pursuit, said he had lost his watch, handkerchief, and pocket-book- the prisoner was searched in the street, but nothing found; I got into the cab, and among the straw at the bottom I found the watch - he denied robbing the prosecutor; I saw no woman.</p>
               <p>HENRY LEANON. I am a Policeman. On the morning of the 27th I saw the cab going down by Shadwell church; it crossed the street - the prosecutor came out intoxicated, and then the prisoner, who was in the cab; there was no woman - the prosecutor was very much intoxicated, and gave him 4d.; the prisoner said he had agreed to give him 1s. from the Minories - I stopped there; another cab-man came over, and said, "George, are you not coming back?" he said, "No, this man won't pay my fare;" the other said, "Give him in charge"- I said I dare say he would pay; I went round to take the number of the cab - the prisoner turned round to drive off, and in consequence of what the prosecutor said, I went and overtook the cab, and asked the prisoner to stop; I asked if he had sat down a seaman opposite Shadwell church - he said, Yes what was the matter; I said he said he had lost his property, and charged him with taking it - he said No, he had not, and told me to come into the cab and not make a noise; he got up in the cab two or three times, and sat down again - he then jumped out, and ran away; I found the handkerchief and pocket-book under the seat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were you listening to the altercation about the shilling? A. Yes - it might last four minutes; I had my uniform on - he saw me.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If the property was lost before he came into my cab. I should be placed in the same situation - I am quite innocent.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bawsey, in Suffolk. On Monday, the 26th of April, I was in town—I went to the Yorkshire Stingo, Blackfriars-road, that afternoon—I had a check for 197<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I parted with that check to John Jenner, the landlord of the house, and made an arrange<lb></lb>ment for him to meet me at the bank the following morning, to restore it to me—he did not meet me, and I went to his house—I ultimately gave him in charge on the 27th of April—we went before a Magistrate, and I charged him with robbing me of my check—the Magistrate heard my statement, and had Jenner remanded—having left the police-office, I went with the constable to search different houses after the person who had cashed the check—while we were going, I saw the two prisoners, (I had seen Leary at the Yorkshire Stingo the day before, but he was not in the room at the time I gave the check to Jenner)—Leary asked me how I was getting on; I said I hoped to transport the landlord and one or two others, if I could get them—he said, "I suppose you won't care about that, if you could get your money returned"—I said I should not like to let him off so—he said I should not get my money if I went on with it—he said, "I suppose you would rather have your money"—I said, "Yes; I should like to get my money back"—he said, "If you will go down in the country in the morning, you shall have your money returned, every shilling"—in order to get my money, I agreed to go down in the country in the morning, and I said I should detain one of them while the other fetched the money—Leary stopped with me, and Wyatt went and fetched the money—he was away half an hour, or three-quarters of an hour—when he came back he told me he had got a party waiting outside with the money; if I would write him out a receipt for the money, he would go and fetch it—I wrote out a receipt for the full amount of the check, and gave it him—this is the receipt I wrote for 197<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he went out and brought me in a bag which contained the money as I thought—I found in it 191<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. all in gold—the prisoners told me the sooner I went away the better, and advised me to go as soon as possible for fear I should lose my money again—I wanted to go as soon as I could, to carry my money home—Leary said if I was not in town the next day, Jenner would be liberated, and I did not know any better—I suppose, that was why I was to go in the country, that he might be liberated—I did not make any remark—I went into the country on the following morning—I did not go before the Magistrate—it was in consequence of my receiving this money that I did not go before the Magistrate—on the 1st of May, Wyatt came down to my house at Bawsey; he said he had come down on behalf of Jenner and his wife and family, and I should be doing them a great favour if I did not attend at the Court to go on with the prosecution—he said that Jenner's attorney had told him that if the letter the summons was in, was not rightly directed, I might seal it up and send it back, and they would not know it, and I was not obliged to open it if it were not rightly directed—I said I intended to go on with the prosecution—I intended to come up the following morning, as I had received the summons—I have not</p>

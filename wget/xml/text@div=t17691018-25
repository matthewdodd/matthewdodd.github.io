On the 15th of September, about three in the morning, the watchman called me up, and said there were thieves breaking into my house. I came down with a poker in my hand. I found the sash wide open, but cannot tell whether it was fast over night, tho' I am positive sure the door was shut when we went to bed. I stood sentinel till he got assistance. After the prisoners were secured, I went down into the area. I found they had forced the sash of the door in the wash-house that looks into the area. I found a two-inch chissel lying about three feet within the wash-house. I went round to the fore-part of the area, and there I found the hinges of the outside shutter wrenched off, but the window-shutter on the inside they had not got open.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was going my rounds, about a quarter after two that night, and saw a fire. I went to alarm the turncock. I also saw these four men that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180027"></xptr> are at the bar. I past them, and went up Wells-street. I saw them all look at me. I then went to my watch-box. After that I went again, to see if I could see them. I perceived two of them. I laid my head down against the kerb of some rails, and saw two go down the prosecutor's area. I saw Wood, but not down, for he seeing me when I was coming, he went round, and returned back again. I went, and took hold of him. He asked me what I wanted with him. He said he was going to see the fire. I asked him where his companions were. I brought him towards Mr. Cockran's, and there came

             to my assistance. I gave Wood into his charge, while I went for other assistance. But I was afraid he would get away, for then the rest might get away also. Then I went back, and put him down among the rest in the area. I then went and rung my rattle, and more assistance came. Then I alarmed with my staff at Mr. Cockran's window-shutters, he came down, and we took the four prisoners, one at a time, as they came up. I saw none of them any farther than the area. There was a window I found open, which was not open when the servants went to bed. We could see fresh feet marks in the wash-house, but know not by whom made, and there was a door betwixt the wash-house and the house, so that they could get no farther; then they made to the right side of the house, and had drawn out the nails of the hinges of the shutter.</p>

               <p>Vaughan. He gave me nothing at all for that; for my care he gave me 2 s. that night, and has given me a guinea since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cockran. I have got two or three more guineas for him, and he shall have them for his diligence.</p>

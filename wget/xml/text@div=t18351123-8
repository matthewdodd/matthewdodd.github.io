               <p>then, I will say nothing more about it, because I have refused eighty guineas"—I saw Hughes on the Exchange, a few days after, and he said he had a particular wish to have the clothes, if I would take four pipes of wine and a butt, which he stated to be worth 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Bowditch was with me, and he, Hughes, and Peel, went down to taste the wine—Bowditch's opinion was, that it was preety good wine—I said I must decline it, for I did not understand any thing about the nature of wine—I forget what name by they called it—I declined the wine—a few days after, I Peel, Hughes, and Bowditch, had been to 'Change together, and they had a wish for me to take the wine, as they had a ship ready to go to Van Diemen's land, and it was the only opportunity I had of disposing of the clothes, as the season was going over—I said I knew nothing about the wine, and if I should be disposed to take it, I would not take one step in it, and have nothing to do with it unless the duty was paid—they then said they would pay the duty and discharge every thing—both of them said the duty and every thing should be dis<lb></lb>charged, and I should only have to remove them from the Custom House Quay—Simpson was not then present—after the wine was stated by Bowditch, he said it was very good—as I came from tasting the wine with them I had a conversation with Peel, Hughes, and Bowditch, in the minories; and it was agreed, if I would give them 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they would strike the bargain immediately—the value of the clothes had been men<lb></lb>tioned—I wanted nearly 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Hughes had been three different times and examined them; and he counted them at little more than half the price, 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and he has got it in his boom—Hughes had out all the goods that were cut, which was three times more than the clothes that were made—there was silks and velvets—a valuation was made, but they were taken away; and some of the velvets cost three guineas a yard—they were gold and Genoa velvets—Hughes said he would take the clothes for 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Peel was present at the time, I believe; and he had been three or four times about them—the 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid by the wine—Hughes had said, a few days after, that they had sold the first wine, and had how got some excellent wine—I was to take the wine for which he counted to be worth 270., and that was the value he had pat on my goods-there were four pipes and a butt, he stated to me to be worth seel., if bottled-if I sold it by the bottle—I agreed to take the wine for the clothes—I went to taste the second wine—Bowditch, Peel, and Hughes were present—Bowditch is a friend of mine, and went to taste it on my behalf—they stated that the duties should all the paid on the second wine—I refused to take it, but three or four days after they wished me to take this wine, and I said the duty must be paid—I would not take it without that—nothing was said about the duty till the last trasaction—I ulti<lb></lb>mately agreed on this assurances to let Hughes have the goods—I wish to say that Hughes, mentioned if I would give them 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the agreements should be struck, the duty and all things paid on the wine—I said, "We will reverse the matter; if you will give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the agreements shall be struck"—they would not agree to that—they agreed to give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received 1. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of it—no paper was written at that time-after my receiving this money, Hughes and Peel came and counted every article over to see that it was correct—they counted a great quantity more than I gave an invoice for, which I have witnesses to prove—they wanted more, which I suppose they were going to take to prevent my saying about the duty being paid—when they counted them all over the night before,</p>

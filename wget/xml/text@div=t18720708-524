                  </hi>. I am a foreman in the employ of the Great Western Railway, at Smithfield—on 2nd July, about 3.40, I was walking down the yard, between the trucks at the goods station, under Smithfield Market, and saw the prisoner pulling some parcels about on the platform—I watched him for a minute or two, and then went on with some tools which I had and placed them in the lobby—I returned in a minute or two and the prisoner was still there; I saw him pick up the parcel and throw it under the trucks at the platform, then he got down under the waggons, caught hold of it, drew it 40 or 50 ft., and placed it under the platform—I told Rutherford.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How many trucks are there loaded, between the place where I brought it from and the wharf? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two trucks, 24 ft. long—I will swear that the place where Rutherford caught you with the parcel was not the proper place for its transit—it was a Reading truck, I believe, which was loading at that place—I do not know where the parcel was for—the dock is 14 or 15 ft. wide or more.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">G. W. R. Detective</hi>). On 2nd July, Daniels made a communication to mo, and I went underground at the station—the prisoner has been a police-constable there a very short time, but he was a porter before—I saw him come in at the Farringdon Street end of the station, and go on the line opposite to where the parcel was concealed—he stooped two or three times against the platform and then went on his duty, and I concealed myself under the platform where I could see the parcel lying, and in about half an hour he came and took the parcel, brought it up to the light as near as he could without being detected, put his hand in his pocket and brought out what I supposed to be a packing-needle and some twine, and commenced sewing the parcel up—he left it lying very handy so that he could take it up again—he was going to lift it on to the platform, and as he was doing so I jumped out and took him, and the parcel too—I took him to the station and charged him—I returned to the place and was groping about to find the needle, and found these two pieces of muslin concealed under the platform.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When Daniels came to you, did you go to see if the parcel was there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and it was open at one end—I could have touched you with my foot, but I did not take you because I was going to see what you were going to do with it—that was not the proper place for it—it should have been on the platform—it was 40 or 50 ft. from its proper place—I could only see 5 or 6 yds. under the bank, because it was so dark—it was your duty to be all over the station, and if you saw a package lying down to pick it up—it was sewn up when I arrested you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Henry Cox, a shoemaker. About one o'clock in the afternoon, of the 28th of Nov., the prisoner came for a strong pair of boots—while I fitted the boots on, I felt her hand in my pocket—I was kneeling on ray right knee, and her foot was on my left knee—she said the boots did not fit her—I got up to get another pair, and while doing to I put my hand into my pocket, and found my silver, which was loose In my pocket, was all safe—I did not think of my purse at that time—I got her another pair of boots, which she said she would take, and I must put some brads into them, and send them to No. 11, Banner-street, at five o'clock—when she was gone I missed my purse from my pocket—it contained some memorandums—I then went to No. 11, Banner-street, and no such person was known there—I went home, and the young man at the next house gave gave me information—I went to his shop, and the prisoner was then fitting on some boots or shoes—I waited till she came out, and said to her, "The boots you ordered at my shop are now ready, will you come in and take them?"—she seemed very much confused—as soon as I got her to my shop, I said, "You have taken my purse"—she immediately threw her shawl off, and with it threw the purse—she said I might search her, and said, "There is your purse," pointing on the floor to where it was—I gave it to the police<lb></lb>man—it had not been on the floor before I took her back to my shop, I am certain, as we had searched the floor—this is my purse.</p>

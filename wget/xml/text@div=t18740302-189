I live at 2, Hoxton Square, and am an upholsterer—on 8th February I was coming home with my wife—we lodge in the lower part of the house, and there are workshops up stairs—my wife opened the street door with a latch-key—I was outside—the prisoner ran out and I ran after him, and never lost sight of him till I met a gentleman and he gave chase, and he went and took him out of a public-house—the detective went in and fetched him out—we took him back to the house—I went into my room and missed a little box—it was lying just inside the street door—it had been removed.</p>

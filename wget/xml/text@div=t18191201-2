On the night of the 12th of November I was the last person up, and made every thing secure between one and two o'clock; the tap is part of the dwelling-house - it joins it, but is not under the same roof - you can go from the house to it without going into the street; there is an inner communication, I left the doors fast. I got up first about half-past seven o'clock next morning - it was then daylight.</p>

I went to my master, and he got the Exciseman.</p>

            . I am in partnership with my sister, Elizabeth; we keep the Swan tavern. Mayor alarmed me, and I got up, found the folding doors a little way open, and the cellar-window wide open; the doors are fastened by a bolt, and in one of the doors there is a little wicket; they must have turned the button of that wicket, then put their hands in, and opened the bolts. I found that I had lost nine gallons of brandy and six gallons of rum, worth about 13 l. or 14 l. together, also a cask out of the yard. They could get the cask without coming through the tap, but they must have got over the gates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go any where with Snowsell - A. Yes, on the 16th of November, about a quarter after seven o'clock in the morning, we went to No. 13, Exeter-street, Sloane-street, into a back room on the ground floor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010007"></xptr>and found the prisoners there; two of them were abed, and the other up. We found the cask under the bed, which had been taken from my yard; it had contained beer when I lost it, but I then found it smelt strong of brandy; we also found an iron crow. We saw one stone in the kitchen, which was very loose, and upon being lifted up, we found two large and one small stone bottles under a sack - they contained brandy, which agreed in strength and flavour with mine; I have every reason to believe that it was mine. I saw the cask the day before the robbery; the bottles are not mine.</p>

            . I am a patrol. In consequence of information I accompanied Forrest to this place, about seven o'clock in the morning, and found all the prisoners in the stone kitchen - I knew them before, and told them I wanted them about some brandy, which had been lost from the Swan, in Sloane-street; they said they knew nothing about it. I asked them if any thing was under the bed? They said No. I turned it up, and found the cask which I had seen in the prosecutor's yard before, and said</p>
               <p>"This is the cask - where is the liquor?" They said they knew nothing of it, I took them to the watch-house, returned to the room, and found an iron crow near the fireplace, almost under the grate. I sounded the stones of the floor, and found a large one, about two feet wide, which sounded very hollow. I pulled it up, and found under a sack, three stone bottles full of brandy, and a pail with a little jug in it, which also had brandy. I found about five gallons of brandy in all - there was a little in the cask.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MILES. Q. Do you not know that my father uses the crow in his business - A. I know his father; he is a stone mason, but they do not use such crows as this; it is too large.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Hughes, who lives in Queen's-buildings, Knightsbridge, about fourteen doors from Sloane-street. On a Saturday morning, about six o'clock, three men passed my mistress's house; two were dressed in light jackets, and one in a brown coat. They went towards the prosecutor's, and as they passed me they whispered, which made me suspect them; I followed them past my mistress's shop door, they had nothing with them at that time, and then returned. They came back in about ten minutes, and the man in a brown coat had a cask on his shoulder; the other two said,</p>
               <p>"Come down here." They then went down a court - they were the same men that passed me before. The cask was the size of that produced.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoners in custody - A. On the Tuesday following; their dress and size corresponded with the men I saw. I did not see their faces - it was a very dark morning; I had given information to Snowsell.</p>
               <p>(Cask produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MILES'S Defence. On Saturday morning, about ten minutes after six o'clock, I was going to Covent-garden to buy apples, and saw the cask laying down at Knights-bridge. I and this young man went over, and took it to his lodgings; it was half full of brandy. I kept it three days, then borrowed two bottles, emptied it and put it under the stones for safety. The other prisoner happened to be in our room when we were taken.</p>
               <p>PHILLIPS'S Defence. I have nothing more to say - we two were together.</p>
               <p>TOWN'S Defence. I went to call them up, and laid down on the bed until they were ready; Snowsell said I was not wanted. I carried the barrel to the watch-house, and they took me.</p>

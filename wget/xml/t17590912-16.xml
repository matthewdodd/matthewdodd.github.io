The prisoner came on him to my house in Wandsworth on the 17th or 18th of July; he said, he bought this horse at Chichester; he said, he cost 6 l. You have got some grass; and said, if I would let him be with me, and could sell him for 7 l. what I made above that I should have for myself. I kept him about three weeks. Mr. Rice told me, that Mr. Brookes, at the Red-Lion at Hounslow, wanted to buy a horse, and desired to take him there; I did; there was the prisoner; and Mr Brookes and we could not agree; so I delivered him to the prisoner there in his gate-way.</p>

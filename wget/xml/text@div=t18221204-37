I sold the prisoner some wheat, he ground it at Waltham Abbey. He owed me 28 l. 3 s. 2 d. I received a bill of exchange on the 17th of June - it came sealed up in a letter which I produced. My wife gave it me. I have frequently seen the prisoner write, and know his handwriting - the signature to the bill is his - I don't know who wrote the body of it. It was not endorsed when I received it, but there was an acceptance on it. It was addressed to

About a week after I received it the prisoner called for the balance; I refused to pay it until I enquired who the acceptor was; he said he was a very good man, that he was a flour factor, in Mark-lane. I saw him about a week after at Waltham Abbey; he said he was distressed for cash, and wanted the balance of the bill. I said it was not endorsed; he said it was - I told him it was not, and shewed it to him; he said,</p>
               <p>"How could I be so foolish as to send you this bill without its being endorsed;" he went into the White-horse, and there took a pen and endorsed it in my presence. I said I should not give him the balance, for I had made enquiry, and could find no such man as he mentioned. I enquired in Mark-lane, and Pope's Head-alley, and could find no such person. I kept the bill till it was nearly due, and then gave it to my son-in-law,

I believe the letter was in his hand-writing, but I don't recollect. He repeatedly called for the balance, but never after it became due. He was taken up more than two months after, as he frequently promised he would find the money, and said first that Mead lived at one place and then at another.</p>

I have no mark on it - every time that I saw the prisoner, he said Mead lived in a different place. I went to him a week after it was due, and told him it was not paid, and I could not find Mead; he always said it was on a good man, and would be paid. I was told that no such person lived in Pope's Head-alley. I don't know whether the upper part of the house is let out.</p>

             ELLEN. I am clerk to Mr. Guillonneau and have been so seven years, at No. 2, Pope's Head-alley. The whole house belongs to him - his business is carried on on the ground floor - there is a stair-case leading to the rooms above - no person named Mead lived there in June last. I remember Mr. Palmer coming with the bill - I handed it to Mr. Guillonneau. Palmer said he would have it noted, and Mr. Guillonneau then in a formal manner asked the housekeeper if any such person lived up-stairs, though he knew there was no such person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mr. Guillonneau does not live in the house - A. No, the housekeeper has to let the offices - we are furnished with the names.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose one person takes a set of chambers, and two live in them, you don't enquire about that - A. Certainly not; I know every person in the house - I receive the rents from them.</p>

            , I am a stationer, and live in Bishopsgate-street; the body of this bill is my writing. I have drawn several for the prisoner, but don't recollect this particular circumstance, there were sometimes two persons present, and at times only one. Some of those I drew for him have been accepted in my presence, but whether this was or not I cannot say.</p>

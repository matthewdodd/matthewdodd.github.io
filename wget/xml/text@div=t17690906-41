He used to go to breakfast into King's Head Court, where a butcher's boy found some iron, new and old, in a hole as he went thorough the court, and carried it to a smith in Tower Street for sale. He was stopped, and then told where he got it. The smith, whose name is Wells, came and told me of it. I then took a piece of the iron, and went into a shop opposite to the hole which was in the court; where I staid till dinner time: then the prisoner came and put his arm into the hole, to feel for the iron. I went over to him with the iron in my hand, and said, Here, sir, this is the iron you are looking for. He fell into a great passion, and said he never put any iron there. I took him by the collar, and brought him to my shop; he wanted to go into the cellar to ease himself, but I refused him. We had then a struggle, and he got out of my hands. I discovered some iron he had upon him, about four pounds and a half. He was but a very poor workman, but I was obliged to keep him, on account of his being a freeman, as he would not let me take another, and I had never an apprentice. (The iron produced in two parcels, that found in the hole, and that upon him.) This found upon him, I took from him; it was stuck in his breeches, with his apron over it. The prisoner begged for mercy, and confessed he took all that iron out of my shop. I can swear to the greatest part of the iron.</p>

            . I am a journeyman to the prosecutor. When the prisoner was gone to dinner, a little after one o'clock, on the 20th of July, I saw him return, and my master with him, holding him by the flap of his coat. My master said, Fetch a constable. My master then asked him how he could be such a villain as to rob him of that iron; he said he had not robbed him of any more; he wanted to go down into the cellar to ease himself, but my master would not let him. I saw my master take two pieces of iron; they were tied together, and put down in his breeches; about four pounds and a half of it. He confessed he had taken eleven pounds in the whole, and begged for mercy.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060026"></xptr> The prisoner said he took it to do a job for himself.</p>

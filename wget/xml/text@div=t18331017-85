               <p>10 OTHERS COUNTS, varying the manner of laying the charge.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOK. I am a silver spoon polisher, and have been employed by the prisoner a little; he lived and carried on business at No. 3, <placeName id="t18331017-85-crimeloc477">Essex-street, Battle-bridge</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did he assign any reason for not going himself? A. I being known there; I pawned them with Mr. Wood, I gave the money to the prisoner - I do not recollect pawning any thing else at Wood's about that time; I do not think I pawned any thing in May - I pawned other things for the prisoner afterwards; I think it was in August - I do not recollect pawning any other spoons in May - I believe I have only pawned plate for the prisoner twice; I have pawned things for Hawkins - Hawkins went away the beginning of May, or in April, I do not know when exactly - I do not pawn for him after he went away - if I pledged any plate at Wood's in May, it was for Treen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any knowledge, one way or other, whether you did? A. I do not recollect; I think it was in May that Hawkins left the house.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Pray have you a son? A. Yes; he went with Hawkins - I do not know the date at which he left; it was in the beginning of May, I think - I never pawned any plate at Wood's, but for Hawkins and the prisoner - I do not know whether my son is in this kingdom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The prisoner was a spoon polisher in Hawkins' employ, like yourself was he not? A. Yes; Hawkins was a manufacturer - he supplied Mr. Savory; the prisoner and I used to polish the spoons - I cannot say at what time in May Hawkins left - he absconded in consequence of something which happened.</p>
               <p>Q. And you men were left behind to do as you could? A. Yes; I have heard that Hawkins and my son are gone to New York together - the variable letter on plate, to denote the present year, is "S" - "R" was the letter for the year before; "Q" and "P" for the two previous years.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from "A" down to "S" the letters have run on? A. There was some letters left out - a person forging a mark twelve months ago might have good reason to believe the letter would be "S" this year, as the last was "R" - the prisoner gave me the spoons to pawn at Wood's because I was known there - knew him as well, I believe.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Do not you know that the form and shape of the letter, and the size depends on the order of the Commissioners? A. I have not noticed that.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been asked whether the prisoner was not a polisher; was not he a manufacturer as well as a polisher? A. He could make; I have seen him help Hawkins to make.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. After Hawkins went away, to your knowledge, has the prisoner carried on the business of making plate? A. A little; his name is not over the door as a manufacturer - I had been about twelve months in Hawkins' service, on and off; I went to work, at intervals, when he wanted any body - I do not recollect any plate being made with the letter "S" on it, while Hawkins lived in the house; I think there was - I do not exactly recollect - while Hawkins was in the house I do not think there were any spoons of that description; there might be some, but I do not think I have seen any - Hawkins could put what he pleased on them, without my knowing any thing of it.</p>

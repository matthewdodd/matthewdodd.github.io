               <p>Simon Fuller's defence. I had been at work all that day at the water-side, and when I went home, I found the door open, and the light out; I got a candle, and looked round the room, thinking my wife was in bed; I saw a strange man asleep on the bed; I shook him, but could not move him; he appeared to be very much in liquor; immediately I sell into such consusion, that I packed up every thing belonging to my wife and myself that I could see on the table; those things were laying on the table, and I picked them up, being mixed with my own things, saying I would not live any longer with my wife, if that was the way she followed; I went away, looking for work, to Maidstone; next day I got lodgings there, and examined the things; when I found what I had got, I was rather afraid of coming back, but did intend to return them, and met with that man who apprehended me. That is all I have to say. My wife had no hand in it; I did not see here for three or four days, till I wrote to her. I have been nineteen years in the service, and was wounded in Egypt, on the landing the troops, and in the East Indies; being so long abroad, I have no witnesses, for my regiment and officers are now at Gibraltar.</p>

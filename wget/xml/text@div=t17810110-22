               <p>I live at Iver in Buckinghamshire. Last Monday night about three quarters after six o'clock I lost a box out of the Iver waggon, by the <placeName id="t17810110-22-crimeloc126">Saracen's Head gate-way</placeName>

               <p>What part of the waggon was the box in? - About the middle; I saw the prisoner get into the tail of the waggon at the corner of the Old Bailey, and pull the box to the tail of the waggon. I lost him till I came to the Inn; then I saw him get in and take the box. I went after him and took him with it on his shoulder. My waggon was robbed before; but detecting them in the waggon, I could do nothing with them. Therefore I did not interrupt him while he was in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the man that removed the box in the Old Bailey, is the same man who took the box out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that man is the prisoner? - Yes. He looked into the waggon several times as I came down Fleet-street; at the end of the Old Bailey he got into it, and

             this box to the tail of the waggon; when we came to the Saracen's Head he got into the waggon again and took the box out. I went after him and laid hold of him, he knocked me down, and said he was not the man; that the man with the box had ran up a court. I took him with it on his shoulder.</p>

               <p>I was in my master's shop opposite the Saracen's Head. I heard the cry of murder! I opened the door and went out immediately; I saw Parker on his back in the kennel, and the prisoner upon him beating him; I asked what what was the matter? Parker said he was robbed. I took the prisoner by the collar and secured him.</p>

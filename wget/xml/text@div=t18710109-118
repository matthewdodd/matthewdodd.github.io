                  </hi>. I am a carman in the employment of Alfred Harris &amp; Co., carriers, Nag's Head Court, Borough—on 23rd December, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, I was in New Bridge Street, Black<lb></lb>friars—I saw three men standing at the corner of Tudor Street—the prisoner was one of them—I saw one of the men leave the other two, and run along<lb></lb>side of my van, and take a half chest of tea off the van—I pulled up as soon as possible, and jumped down—the was dropped the chest, and the prisoner picked it up, and went into No. 18, New Bridge Street—I took him with his hand on the cord—I took him by the collar—he asked me to let him go, as he was a <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> of mine and came from the Kent Road—I had been him before—I held him till a constable came up—he said the box was</p>

               <p>dropped off between two cab horses, and laid by the kerb—I took him about twelve yards from the place where he picked the chest up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been round to see his wife since this—I knew where to go to because the policeman gave information where he lived—I went to see whether he was right or wrong, and to see whether he lived there or not—I have seen his wife before—I was not on terms of friendship with the prisoner and his wife—I had never spoken to them, that I am aware of—I knew his wife when I was a boy, on the railway, as guard behind a van—I did not know the man more than seeing him—I went twice to see his wife—I have no ill feeling against the man, and I merely went down to see if he was her husband—I had not had anything to drink on this evening—I had had a pint of beer for dinner—nothing after that—when I first saw the three men at the corner of Tudor Street, they were standing together—I saw one of them come alongside of my van—I turned round, and saw the chest of tea taken off—it was on the rail of the van—there was a <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> in front of me, and a cab behind, trying to pass—the cab did not run against my van, that I am aware of—the van was three or four doors beyond the place where the chest was found—I was obliged to pull up as soon as possible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am messenger, at 18, New Bridge Street—I was coming out of that office on the night in question, and saw the prisoner on the step, struggling with the last witness—there was a chest of tea on the step—the last witness said to the prisoner "If you dare to attempt to get away I will murder you," and the prisoner stood perfectly still after that—he said he would be quiet if he did not try and throttle him, which he was very near doing—I went for a constable.</p>

On 23rd December, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I was coming along Tudor Street, towards New Bridge Street, and I saw a scuffle at the comer—as I turned the corner I saw the carman and the prisoner in the doorway of No. 18, and a chest of tea at their feet—the carman had got the prisoner by the collar—he said "This man has stole the chest of tea from my van, I shall charge him with that"—the prisoner said he did not steal it, his hand might have been on it—at the station he positively denied having anything to do with the chest of tea—I found this bag sown up with twine, and a knife on him.</p>

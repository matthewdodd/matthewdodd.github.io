                  </hi>. I am a carman. I was in the London Docks on the 18th of December, between twelve and one o'clock, loading hemp from the warehouses on the south side, which run on to the Wapping-basin—I saw Gann and Dalton rolling a quarter cask which I supposed to be brandy, from towards the brandy quay to the western entrance—they rolled it in between two casks of tallow, then rolled a barrel before if, and threw a handful of straw on the top of it—Dalton then went towards the western entrance—Gann remained near where the brandy was—(it would take a man about ten minutes to go from where the brandy was to the western entrance)—Dalton returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and at the same time one of Mr. Eyres' wagons which was</p>

               <p>loaded, came in, and Scalp was driving it—Dalton was a few yards behind the wagon—they passed by where I was, and where the brandy was, and went on towards the Wapping-basin—Dalton still kept behind the wagon till it had backed to where it was going—Gann remained where the cask was till after the wagon had backed in to unload, and then he went to<lb></lb>wards the tail of the wagon—he went in the same direction that the other bad gone—I saw the unloading of the fore-part of the wagon—I could not see the whole of it from where I was—Dalton then put a handful of straw into the wagon—I did not see Gann or Scalp at that time—the wagon had a tail-board that would let down—it is usual to load and un<lb></lb>load the wagons at the tail—I did not see Scalp again till he drew the wagon round, when it was unloaded, which was in about twenty minutes—he drew his horse round to come out, and came towards the western entrance—he stopped nearly opposite to where the cask was lying—he then left his wagon and went towards the eastern entrance and the spirit-quay—he was gone about half an hour, and while he was gone, Gann and Dalton lifted the cask of brandy into the wagon—Dalton got into the wagon, rolled the cask to the fore-part of the wagon, and covered the straw over it—Gann then wanted to borrow my tilt, which I refused to lend him—he and Dalton then looked round about them, and then went away in the same direction that Scalp had gone—in five or ten minutes I saw Scalp come up—he got in at the tail of the wagon, and placed his hands on the straw on the fore-part of the wagon—I cannot say that his hands went to the bottom—he then got out and drove on in the direction of the western entrance, the same way that he came in—as soon as the wagon started, I saw my employer, and told him.</p>

I shall be very much obliged to you"—I said, "You know them both"—he said, "Do I, who is it?"—I said, "One is Peter Gann, who was in your employ, and the other is Barber, which is a nick-name for Dalton"—Mr. Eyres then said, "Has my man Scalp any thing to do with it?"</p>

               <p>away, that he was not aware that he was going to bring the cask out, or else he would have been better prepared for so doing—I did not tell him he was innocent—I did not tell Mr. Eyres he was an innocent man—I told him I did not think he was exactly innocent, as he was away when the cask was put in, but he got into the van after it was in—I did not say that Scalp was an innocent man to any body—I was at the Red Lion with Edward Williams—he asked me whether Scalp really had any thing to do with it, and I told him Scalp was not there when the cask was put in, but he got in afterwards—I did not say, "He is as innocent as you are"—the place where I saw the two men roll the brandy between the two casks of tallow, may be half a quarter of a mile from the spirit-quay.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, of Dove Court, Holborn—on 25th April at midnight I was in Wharf Road, St. Luke's, and saw the prisoners and a woman—the two women spoke to me, but I would have nothing to do with them—I felt a blow at the back of my neck, turned round, and saw Robin<lb></lb>son and another man—Robinson seized my watch and chain, and struck me a second blow—I seized him; a struggle ensued, and they got me down—the men and women all began kicking me, and bit my right hand and knocked me about—while I was on the ground my purse with 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it was taken from me, and my watch was torn off by King when she was on me; she was on me several times—Robinson kicked me on all parts of my body; my shoulder and left knee were injured, and King kicked me in the groin just before I became insensible—I held the prisoners, and never released them till a constable came—I then became insensible, and knew nothing more till I got to the hospital—I afterwards went to the station and charged the prisoners, and recognised my hat in Robinson's possession in the dock.</p>

I am a widow, and live at 32, Wharf Road—on 25th April, about 1.20 a.m., I was looking out at my window and heard cries of "Police" and "Murder," and saw the prisoners struggling with a man on the ground; four or five people were near—I heard a voice say, "Have you been robbed?"—he said, "Yes, I have," and then a blow came and they went to the ground—I did not see what King did—I was too frightened to go down—a constable came, and I had a conversation with him.</p>

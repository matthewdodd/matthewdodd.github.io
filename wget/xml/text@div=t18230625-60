I went out often to the pump for water, and as I returned met her going out; she said she was going to sell some caps which she had made. I said she should not go out without me, as I had lent her the muslin to make them; she pushed me back, and in the struggle, I saw the sheet rolled up under her gown. I am sure it is mine by the colour, it was half bleached - she got down stairs and was apprehended next night. I have not found it. I missed it immediately she was gone.</p>

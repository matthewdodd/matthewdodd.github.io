                  </hi>. I am clerk to Robert Eason Henderson, a hosier, of 61, Alderman bury—the prisoner came into my master's service on 5th November, this year; not exactly as an errand boy, but to make himself generally useful—my master had a cash-box, which I locked up in an iron chest in the cellar, when the business of the day was over—the prisoner might have Been me lock it up there, I do not know whether he has—on 29th November, Mr. Henderson locked the cash-box, and gave it to me—I put it in the safe, which I locked, and hid the key between some goods in the cellar—I did not positively know what was in it—I did not see the prisoner there then—a night or so before that, I had locked the safe up as usual, and the next morning I was busy, and told the prisoner to bring up the books and cash-box, and I told him where he would find the key—on the 29th, I had put the key in the same place as when I had told him before—he comes to work at 9 o'clock—I was there on the morning of the 30th—when the prisoner came to work that morning, he did not remain above five minutes—the moment we entered the building, he walked down into the cellar—at</p>

               <p>that moment I was signing a sheet for the delivery of some goods, and did not hear him come up stairs—all that I beard was something rush by me quickly, and go out at the door—the prisoner had nothing that he has on now, but the great coat—I did not notice whether he had anything with him—I can swear it was the prisoner that went by me—I saw him—I saw no more of him till the evening—about five minutes to 11, I went down into the cellar to bring up the books and cash-box—I first tunied towards whew I had put the key on the previous night—it was missing—I ran to the safe and saw the door slightly open, about two inches—I pulled it open, felt for the cash-box, and it was gone, and the key of the safe was gone also, and has never been seen since—the prisoner did not return that day—I saw bio again, with the officer—we apprehended him in the pit of the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton—I did not call after him when he was leaving the shop; he was gone too quick.</p>

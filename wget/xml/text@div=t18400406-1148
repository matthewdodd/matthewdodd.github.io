In August last I lodged at No. 31, Grafton-street—I remember the prisoner being brought to bed—I washed the child, and saw it daily for about three weeks, and two or three days—the last time I saw it she was taking it down stairs—there was a person named Mary Christenson with her, who had the pri<lb></lb>soner's elder child with her—I did not see the face of the infant at that time—it had been in very good health up to that time—I saw them on the staircase—I did not see them go out, but when the prisoner returned the came to my door, and said she had been very lucky, that she had got a purse for her child—I asked her where—she said she had taken it to Wal<lb></lb>worth—(she had told me before she must take it out to nurse, as having two children she could not do her work—she took in needle-work)—I saw her next morning—she said she was going to buy flannel and other things for the child, as the clothes it had were not good enough for the respectable place it was at—a day or two afterwards she went, as I thought, to visit the child—I inquired after it, she said it was doing very nicely, and she was much pleased that it had so good a nurse, and so respectable a place</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Masons' Arms, Horsemonger-lane, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington; it is my dwelling-house. On 29th Oct. I was the last person up—I saw the prisoner there at twelve o'clock, and ordered him to leave the premises—the staircase window was then closed—at a quarter before five in the morning I was alarmed by the policeman's rattle. I got up and came down, and saw the staircase window up—I never saw it up before—the side door was open—it had been shut the night before—I went into the street and saw the policeman—he came in with me and asked for a light—I went to the bar-parlour and found the till had been forced open—I missed a carpet-bag and a blue—bag, containing a barrister's gown—the cigar-box was emptied, and about thirty pounds weight of cigars gone, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I missed a pair of gravy spoons, two pairs of German spoons, a pair of ladles, a dessert-spoon, two large table-cloths, and other things—they had attempted to set fire to the house—I kicked against a hat, about four feet off the side-door, between my bar and the side-door—I had seen that hat on the prisoner's head scores of times, and knew it to be his—this is it—the policeman took charge of it—the prisoner was dressed the night before as he is now, and to the best of my belief he had this hat on, but I would not positively swear that—I saw it tried on his head at the police-court, and instantly swore it was his—I have not any doubt about it—I have not found any of the property—on the Saturday morning I saw the prisoner he had a different hat on then—I think he said something, but I did not take notice of it—I was taken ill about that time and did not see him any more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Monk—I have known the prisoner about nine months—he has been in the habit of coming to the Masons' Arms, and sometimes assisting me in my work—on Friday night, 29th Oct., I saw him there a little after eleven o'clock—we had a conversation about a pot of beer, either on that day or the day before, I will not be sure which—he was</p>

               <p>taking some beer in the skittle-ground, and somebody had gone away and not paid for it, and it was his duty to pay for it as he took it in the ground—he had not the money—he came into the tap-room and told me some one had gone from the skittle-ground that owed him for a pot of beer—I do not know whether he paid for it at last—I have seen a hat which he wore very much like this—I have seen one like this about the tap-room—I saw him on the Saturday, again on the Sunday, and again on the Tuesday, at our house—on the Wednesday he was absent—he had the same hat on those occasions that he was in the habit of wearing, as far as I could perceive—he was then absent till the Sunday, when he came to out house—he told me he had been in the country, and on the Tuesday following he told me he had laid out about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for stationery, and he was going hawking—there is a back-window of out house, when I came down on the Saturday I found it a little way open—there was scarcely room for a man to get in; but if it were raised higher there would have been—it was closed when I went to bed.</p>

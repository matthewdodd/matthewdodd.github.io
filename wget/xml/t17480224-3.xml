            . Andre . On the 23d of last month I lost ten perriwigs.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>

               <p>Q. Whose were these perriwigs ?</p>
               <p>St. Andre. They belonged to several customers.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you answerable for them?</p>
               <p>St. Andre. Yes, I have made two or three already for my customers in the room of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think the Prisoner was concerned in taking them ?</p>
               <p>St. Andre. I had this boy upon trial, and I suspected my Journeymen and apprentices, but I did not suspect this <rs id="t17480224-3-deflabel17" type="occupation">boy</rs>

I advertised the perriwigs in the Advertiser, and found the boy out by this means. I charged Mr. Winter, a constable, with the boy, and he told me he had sold seven of my wigs to an old clothes man, and three to another: I have a paper of the boy's writing, where he wrote it down.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he tell you so?</p>
               <p>St. Andre. He told me so several times, and before my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say he sold them for?</p>
               <p>St. Andre. He said he sold some for a shilling, some for 9 d. and some for 6 d. they were all sold for seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they worth?</p>
               <p>St. Andre. At least twenty-five pounds; there were three of them worth four pounds a piece.</p>

            . I have seen the Prisoner frequently coming in and out of Mr. St. Andre's shop; and on the twenty-third of January, in the morning, I saw him in Austin-friars, under a gateway, with an old clothes man; I asked him what he had been doing with the man; he said he had been selling a wig to him for sixpence that he had bought of another boy for three pence, and I saw the old clothes man give him six pence. I asked him whether he had shewed that wig to any of his own people at home; he said no, what signified shewing such an old wig to any body.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner did not deny the fact, but said the old clothes man told him he might as well bring two or three as one.</p>

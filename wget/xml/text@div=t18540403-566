                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Premier-villas, Perry-vale. I went to the Horse Repository, in St. George's-road, to sell some harness—I got a bidding of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but would not take it—as I came out of the yard, I met the prisoner—he asked me how much I wanted for the lot; I said 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said it was too much—I said, "I cannot take less"—he went away, came back, and said, "Very well; I will give you 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Very well"—he said, "I must try them first"—I asked his name; he said, "Savage"—I said, "The livery stable keeper in Blackfriars-road?" he said, "Yes; near Stam<lb></lb>ford-street"—I knew that to be a respectable place, and I drove up to Mr. Savage's yard, with the horse, cart, and harness, as Kelly had promised to meet me just by the yard—he said that business was bad, and he could not get his accounts in, but he paid me a sovereign in part—I still believed him to be Mr. Savage—I asked him, next time I met him, if his name was Savage, and he said, "No"—he wrote me out an I. O. U. for the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance, which, I believe, was signed Savage, but he kept it; I have asked him for it several times—I saw him two or three times afterwards, and pressed for my money.</p>

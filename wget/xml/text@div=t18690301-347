About 7 o'clock on the evening of 19th February, I was in Cannon Street, and met Daniel Kelly carrying a Back, and Costello carrying two—I followed them to the cab rank opposite Red Lion Court, where they put the sacks on a cab—I told Daniel Kelly I was a police-officer, and asked what he had in the sacks—he said, "Brushes"—I asked him where he got them—he said he bought them somewhere in the City, he did not know where—I said his tale was unsatisfactory, and I should take him to the station—we drove there in the cab, and I found in the sacks nearly 400 brushes, four pairs of gloves, five sponges, three drink<lb></lb>ing flasks, and four wooden salad forks and spoons—Kelly said that he had paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—from the marks on the brushes, I went to Messrs. Taylor &amp; Black's, 107, Cannon Street, and found the door ajar—I watched the place, with another constable, and saw John Kelly come out at about 9.45—I followed him as far as Bow Lane, stopped him, and told him I was a police-officer, and had seen him leave No. 107 rather late, and asked him to give an account of it—he said that he was in possession—we said that his tale was unsatisfactory, and we should take him to the station—we told him that Daniel Kelly and Costello had been stopped—he said, "If it is those sacks, I have sent them to Mr. Eiloart's, in Chancery Lane, to be sampled off"—I charged him with stealing the goods—he gave his address 267, High Holborn—I found that to be an untenanted house—Costello said that he was hired in Cannon Street to carry the sacks, and that he never saw Kelly before.</p>

I went with Baldwin to the prisoner's house—his wife pointed out a box to me, in which I found two scrubbing brushes, a black-lead brush, a new hair brush and comb, and a nail brush—one brush appeared new, and the others as if they had been dipped in water—there was no name on them—I afterwards went to 10, Plough Court, Fetter Lane, the address given by Daniel Kelly, and in a box there I found two new hair brushes, a drinking flask, two clothes brushes, and two hand looking-glasses, all new—there were no names on them, but they were ticketed with the price.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Taylor &amp; Black, 111, Cannon Street, brush manufacturers—they are bankrupt—some of these brushes are their manufacture, and others are such as they kept in stock at the time of their bankruptcy—they would not have our labels on them, but we label them if we send them out.</p>

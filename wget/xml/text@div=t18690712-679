I keep the Providence public-house, Woolwich Common on the 11th June, about 9 o'clock, I served the prisoner and another man with a pot of half-and-half—the prisoner paid with one shilling—I put it in the till and gave him change; he then called for a pint of ale and a bottle of ginger beer, and gave me a bad shilling—I then examined the till and found two other bad shillings—I accused him of passing bad money—he said that he must have taken it in change—I sent for a constable, and the pri<lb></lb>soner ran across the road and got over a garden wall—I followed him and heard something jingle—he walked back with me to the house, and I gave him in charge—I afterwards went to the wall and picked up two shillings, and the constable picked up seven shillings wrapped in paper—I handed all the shillings to the constable.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, in Bow-street, Bloomsbury. On the 20th of August last, the prisoner came to my shop to redeem a gown that had been pledged for half-a-crown; she said that she wanted change a note that she hand in her had, I told her I could not give her change; she said give me change I'll take five or six shillings in half-pence. I took the one pound note and looked at it, I then asked her name and were she lived; she said Nowland, No. 2, George-street. I wrote on the note No. 2, George-street; I then asked her where she had it from; she said she had it from her father, a bricklayer's labourer. I told her then that it was a bad one, that she must go along with me, and she walked down to Bow-street with me. In our way to the office I asked her particulary who she had it of, and likewise; where she lived; she then told me that she lived at No. 2, New Street. There is a New-street Saint Giles in that neighbourhood. She said that she had it of a bricklayer's labourer, whom she would not tell, he was a relation of her's.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note and see whether your writing is on that note - A. Yes, that is my writiting, I am sure this is the note she offered me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. She gave her true name - A. Yes, and the further account that she gave of her residence is right.</p>

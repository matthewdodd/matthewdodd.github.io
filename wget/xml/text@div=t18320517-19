Between nine and half-past nine o'clock in the evening of the 14th of May, I accidentally saw the prisoner and Pearce at the door of my father-in-law's house; I watched them, and saw the prisoner enter the shop - Pearce was just going in; I saw the bell of the door muffled by Pearce's hand - I went over, and saw the prisoner getting into the bin; I desired them to come out several times; I did not strike or offer to strike either of them, but told them to go away, or I should send for a Police-officer - after that a blow was made at me; I did not see either of them make a blow at my father, but I saw my father take up a piece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170034"></xptr>of iron after they had struck at me; my father had not struck them at all, but he had warded off a blow which had been made at me; I remember my mother coming down, and she said to me, "Come in, Henry, do," and laid hold of my collar, to drag me in; she then laid her hand on the hatch, and the prisoner made a cut at her right arm with a knife, and said, "Now, you b-rs, we will serve you?" she had not done any thing to them; the prisoner took the knife from his waistcoat pocket - I saw him take it out, open it, and make the blow; I believe this is the knife, but I cannot swear to it - the prisoner was as sober as I am at this moment; I only interfored because there was an attempt to commit felony.</p>

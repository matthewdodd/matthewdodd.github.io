                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 32). On Friday, the 29th of April, I was on duty at Turnham-green, and saw the prisoner—I called out to him by his name, Manning—he said hit name was not Manning, but Fearce—I told him I was sure that was his wrong name—I knew him personally, and had a warrant out against him for stealing plants—I told him I should take him into custody on the warrant—be said he would not go with me—I took hold of him by the collar of his coat, and he flung me down and got upon me—I got up again and he ran away—I took up my staff and struck him with it—he then told roe he would come with me quietly—he came about twenty yards, and then went into a garden, which he had come out of, and where he was at work—he then took up a stick and struck me in the forehead with it—I used my staff as well as I could—he then hit me on the body, legs, and arms, with the stick, and told me he would kill me—he then struck me on the head, cut my head, knocked me down, and ran away—I got up and followed him across the garden, over the wall to the water side, where he was stopped by Wakeman, and taken to the station—Mr. Pickering, the surgeon, attended me—the warrant against the prisoner is in the hands of the constable—he is not here—I had had it in my hand, and read it—I also had verbal directions to take him, from the inspector—it was not in my possession when this occurred.</p>

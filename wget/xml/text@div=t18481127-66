                  </hi>. I live in Bishopsgate-street. Some time before the 12th Nov. I was barman at the King's Arms, it is sometimes called the <hi rend="italic">Cat</hi>, in Beech-street—I have seen the prisoners there frequently—I was there on Sunday night, 12th Nov., in the wholesale-department—the prisoners were then in the retail-department, which is separate from the wholesale—whilst there Carter used a blackguard expression to me, and they said how they would serve me if they could get at me—he attempted to get at me, but could not—after a short time I went out—the prisoners followed me out together—I hud got about half-a-dozen yards, and then Carter struck me a severe blow on the jaw and knocked me down—Hurren was close to him—Carter made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at my scarf, in which I had a pin—I saw it safe immediately before coming out of the house—he then ran away—the scarf was partly pulled out of my waistcoat—immediately I got up I missed my pin—I immediately ran round the corner, called "Police!" and the prisoners were taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a music-seller, of 27, Featherstone-street, St. Luke's. On Sunday night, 12th Nov., about a quarter-past twelve o'clock, I was passing the Cat, and saw Carter strike Taylor a blow which knocked him down—he came against me, and then fell—I heard Carter say, "I have been waiting for you," and I heard Hurren say to Carter, <hi rend="italic">"Hook it, "</hi> and they both went away together—they walked for a few yards, increasing gradually to a run.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pastry-cook, at Beech-street, Barbican. On Sunday night, 12th Nov., about twelve o'clock or a quarter-past, I was in the bar of the King's Arms, and saw the prisoners in company—I tried to shun their company—Carter asked me if I knew the prosecutor when he lived at Mr. Gamble's—I said I had no recollection of him—he said that on one occasion, when he lived there, he had called him a <hi rend="italic">smasher</hi>, or something of that sort, for which he would break his head—the prosecutor was then in a separate place from the prisoners—about five minutes after the prosecutor came out, and the prisoners followed directly—Carter knocked him down—I expected a disturbance—lfurren said to Carter, "Come on, you b——; they are after you'—they ran away—Hurren was close by when the blow was struck—they walked till they got opposite the next house, and then they ran</p>

On Sunday was se'nnight, the 15th, about half after two o'clock, I was coming up from Ratcliff-highway; I turned up by St. George's church in the East; I missed the road, and went forward as far as <placeName id="t17810425-41-crimeloc203">Wellclose-square</placeName>

I said I was wrong, and asked him where was St. George's church; he said I had passed it: I talked with the man; I stood considering which way I should take; then I heard something shuffling behind me; I looked about, and saw the prisoner and another; I spoke to them twice; they gave me no answer; at last I asked of them the best road to the London Hospital, Whitechapel; the other put his hand to his mouth, and said, Go in at the gate-way, the turnpike; I put my stick over my shoulder, and came away. I came to a cross road, which leads into Church-lane: I am a little dull of hearing; I saw nothing, but I heard people shuffling behind me; I looked about, and saw the two men that I had seen coming up to the turnpike, which were the prisoner and another man, coming up to me: the first man had a pistol in his hand; he poked it to my head, and cut my eye with it; the prisoner was on the other side; he had a pistol in his left hand; he poked it on the other side of my head; then there came up to me two men; I believe they were two others; one hit me with a stick on the nose; then one of them put a cloth or something round my neck; I thought he would choak me; then one of them went down on his knees to take my money out of my pocket; I pressed my belly down, that he could not get my watch out, and he struck me in the belly with his fist; and one of the others struck me over the head with a hanger, as I suppose it was, because it cut the loop off my hat, and my cockade; and the tall man I saw in Ratcliff-highway, was the last that came up; he said, D - n the bougre, why don't you shut his eyes? Then they put an handkerchief over my eyes; I went down on my backside, upon which they fastened my head down to the ground, and then took my money, which was upwards of 25 l. and a watch; they took a bundle of papers out of my pocket, that were the accounts of the regiment: none of my things were ever found again: then they let my breeches down, and walked behind me with their pistols in their hands; they made me walk with my breeches down, and said, If I looked back, they would blow my brains out; then they left me: I met with a watchman, who conducted me to Whitechapel turnpike. On Monday I made an information before the justice's at Whitechapel. On the Sunday I was unable to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250046"></xptr> get out of bed. The prisoner was taken up last Wednesday was week; I knew him again as soon as ever I saw him.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before the night you was robbed? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>How did you describe him? - I said there was a little man with a cut wig and dark clothes; and another with his own hair, a round hat, and dark clothes; I am certain the prisoner is the same person.</p>
               <p>Was it moon-light? - The moon did not shine, but it was star-light.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>This happened about half after two o'clock on Easter Sunday morning? - Yes; when I got up on my backside, I said, You have taken all I have; why don't you take my life also? upon that they gave me two or three blows. I bought that fairly, for I might have held my tongue.</p>

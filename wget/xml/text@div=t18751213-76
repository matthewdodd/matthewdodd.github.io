                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 727). On 29th November the pri<lb></lb>soner was given into my custody—I told him he was charged with obtain<lb></lb>ing money by false pretences—he said "All right, constable, it is only a mistake, I am a <hi rend="italic">bona-fide</hi> collector of the society; the office is 6, John. Street, Adelphi"—he also said that it was a mistake about their not sending a receipt for the money, that he lived at 16, Parsonage Walk, Newington Butts, and that 32, Hugh Street, Pimlico, was Mr. Payne's residence, where we should find him, as he was ill, and not at his office.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. I am secretary to the Anti-Adulteration Society, Limited—from 1871 to July, 1875, the offices were at John Street, Adelphi—they were subsequently removed to 28, Leicester Square—the prisoner collected from October, last year, to June this year—he then left of his own accord, as he found something which suited him better—he had no right from that time to collect any money for the Society—he visited me several times when I was confined to my bed, but he was not engaged by me—he never accounted to me for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Cole—it was under<lb></lb>stood that he was to return about Christmas, and resume his services with me, and he did not deliver up his collecting books in June, and I applied for them several times, but could not obtain them, and I did not press the matter, as it was understood that he was going on again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I always found you truthful and faithful—I incurred a debt to you of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was a business transaction between</p>

               <p>us, and an arrangement was made that a certain quantity of goods were to be sold for me, which I was to pay for by instalments of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week—I was ill in bed at the time, and they were to be put into a store room—I paid you the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week up to a certain time, but the goods were never delivered—I never told you that as I could not pay your debt you might collect sub<lb></lb>scriptions for me—I told you it could not be entertained at all—I never told you that you might collect money to pay yourself—I know that the name of Child &amp; Co., the bankers, is on the list—I do not know that that money was kept by you—I do not remember receiving money from you from Friston &amp; Co., of Austin Friars—I do not remember you receiving a subscription from Baring Brothers, and detaining part of it—I told you it could not be tolerated.</p>

He stuck to the guineas—the money was brought to me by my wife when I was ill in bed, with a little memorandum from the prisoner stating that he had kept 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I immediately sat up in bed and wrote a letter, telling him that it could not be tolerated, and that any pri<lb></lb>vate matter he had with me I would see him about.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the Prisoner.</hi> I do not remember your receiving a subscription of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Angel Court—I have not got the book here—I never allowed you to stop any money—when you called on me I paid you—you did not call at my residence and give me the names of some subscriptions which you had received—you refused to call for some reason, and I was unable to get the book, but I did manage to get downstairs to see you, and you did say that you should receive some money.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. The association was formed in 1871, for the purchase of samples of food throughout London, to obtain analyses—the seven names on this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), constitute the association—Mr. Roberts resigned in 1872, and there is no other member in his place—the association being formed under a certain clause does not require capital or shares, because there is no profit, in fact I think it was not necessarily incorporated at all—we have obtained a very large amount of signatures to petitions to Par<lb></lb>liament by way of amending the laws against adulteration—immediately after the passing of the Act of 1872 attempts were' made to proceed against parties who wilfully adulterate food—I made application to Mr. Lancaster, at Lambeth, and he decided that the association had no power to lay an information, and that the only party who could do so under the Act, as he read it, was the inspector of the district; therefore we immediately had a large number of analyses made, and sent them to the various inspectors of the districts, of persons who were in the habit of selling adult<lb></lb>erated articles, and the officers appointed to do so have carried out the prosecutions—I am also an electric telegraph agent, for which I get 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the directors do not get a farthing.</p>

            . I am apprenticed to a hatter, and live at Charles-street, Blackfriars. I was on the bridge, and saw the prisoner running; there was a cry of Stop thief! he appeared to be the person pursued - I stopped him. Mr. Cook came up in about three minutes, and said he had lost his handkerchief; the prisoner denied taking it. Mr. Cook produced it, and charged him with it - he denied it, and said we might search him, for he had nothing about him.</p>

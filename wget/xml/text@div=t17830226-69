               <p>Court. That cellar, I suppose, was open to any body in the house? - Yes, I looked, and I could find no halfpence, when he came in, I taxed him with the robbery, he denied it at first, and at last owned it,</p>
               <p>When you taxed him with it, did not you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - No, in consequence of his owning it, I fetched a constable, but before he was apprehended, he went and took the money from that place.</p>
               <p>You told him where it was? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What did you say? - Only that there was some hid in a cellar, and that we knew what it was.</p>
               <p>Did not you say it was hid in a hole? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Did neither you or Mr. Feathers shew him where that money was? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor say where it was? - No, the boy at last pointed to where it was, and said, it was there; I asked him, how he came by that silver; he said, he had changed some of the halfpence for silver with a woman that is now an evidence upon this trial; I asked him, what he had done with the other part of the property, he said, he had bought a handkerchief and a pair of shoes and stockings, and had spent the other part: when he was detected, he went into the necessary, and threw something down, which by the found was money.</p>

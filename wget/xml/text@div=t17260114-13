Bob went up first, and asked if Moll was at home, and Will answered no. The Deceas'd follow'd, asked the same Question and receiv'd the like Answer, with the Addition of D - ye for a Son of a Bitch, what business have you here? Do ye come to Rob me? Bob left 'em together, and went over the way to the Black-Lion-Ale-House. Presently after which a little bustle and a trampling of Feet was heard in the Room, and by and by, in comes Moll and goes up Stairs, but she and Will quickly came down again to light a Candle, and told the Company, in Mother Ostler's Room that Patrick was in a Fit, and desir'd 'em to come up to help him, but they were so engaged with their Quartern-pots, that they took but little notice of it. Moll goes up again and cries out Murder, which so alarm'd 'em that they follow'd her, and found Patrick lying dead upon the Bed without his Shoes: They searched him themselves, and then sent for a Surgeon, but no Bruise or any sign of hurt could be found upon him. Another Surgeon was called into Court, and was asked if a blow on the Breast might kill a Man, by beating the Breath out of his Body, without leaving any visible Mark of Contusion, or breaking any of the Vessels within, and thereby causing the Patient to Vomit Blood: He answered that tho' great allowance must be made for the weakness of a Mans Constitution, or his being disorder'd with Drink, which might render him more obnoxious to Suffocation, ye on the whole he thought it not likely and indeed hardly possible. The Prisoners in their Defence said that Patrick died in a Fit, and as for Mary's crying out Murder, She said she did it only to bring Company to assist her, and to get some body to run for a Surgeon, which none of 'em would do before, because they were afraid that whoever call'd the Surgeon would be obliged to pay him if she or William were not able: She added that it was well known that she loved her Husband too well to hurt him, tho' he had been none of the best of Men to her, and had kept company with Doll Burrows, who had been the utter rain of him.

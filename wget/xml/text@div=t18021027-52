             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Police Office, Queen's-square; On the 8th of October I met the prisoner in Darkhouse-street, Westminster, between nine and ten at night, with a bag on his back; my brother officers stopped him; I laid hold of the bag, and said, what have you got here? he seemed very frightened, and said"nothing;" I said you have soap here, and asked him where he was going with it, and whether he did not live in York-street; he said he did; I thought I knew him, but did not; I asked him how he came by the soap; he was very unwilling to tell; upon which I said he must go to the watchhouse to account for it; going along I asked him where he worked; he said in the City; I said you have robbed your master of this; at first he said no, he had not; he said afterwards he had taken it a bit at a time as he was carrying it to the customers, and begged hard not to be taken to the watch-house, for he had a wife and family; he said he lived in the gallery over St. James's Market; in the morning he was taken to the Magistrate, and I was sent to search his room, and bring down his wife; I searched his room, but found nothing of the fort.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you promise that it would be better for him, or threaten him? - A. No; I neither did so, or heard my brother officers do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now residing temporarily at the British Hotel, Cockspur Street—I did reside at 8, Melina Place, Grove End Road, N.W., up to a recent period—I had a 21 years'lease of the house; the furniture was mine—I came into negotiation with the defendant as to taking my house and furniture—I was on the point of going abroad—I received one or more letters from him, and I have seen him write—I recognise his handwriting in this declaration—I believe the signature to be his, also the signature in the register.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He signed his name at my house when he was in nego<lb></lb>tiation with me; that was the only time I ever saw him write—I had never seen him before that negotiation—he proposed to take a lease of my house, with the option of purchasing the furniture in 18 months for 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I agreed to that on the faith of the representations he made to me—I have been called to the Bar—I practised for a short time; I have never had the good fortune to put questions—the agreement was put into a formal shape by my solicitor, duly executed, sealed, and delivered—the rent was to be 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, paid in advance—7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid for coal and other things—the defendant went into possession of the house on the lease and agreement—he did not pay the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the day he went in; he did within a day or two—the March rent was paid, and the April and May rent was tendered—I never wanted to get the money for the furniture paid down—on March 20th I wrote to him requesting him to give up possession and pay the costs of the lease before the Thursday—that was after I had seen him and asked whether he was a minor—I got information on that subject about a week after he went into the house—on 23rd I wrote, stating, "I am willing to make an</p>

               <p>effort to settle the question at issue between us;" that was, that he should turn out of the house and give me back possession; that was the only ques<lb></lb>tion between us—I also said, "If you think you are able and are also willing to promise to pay me the amount of the purchase-money, 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 10th of next month, and will undertake to come to an arrangement with Messrs. Todd and Dennis for the costs in the course of to-morrow, I, on my part, am willing to hand you over the lease and place confidence in your <hi rend="italic">bond fides</hi> in the whole transaction"—I had ascertained about his minority 10 days before that—if he had done what I asked he would have remained my tenant, I don't know about not hearing of this prosecution—I told my solicitors if he did not give up possession they were to issue a writ in Chancery to set aside the lease—I wrote to him on March 29th that it he would pay the 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the costs I would accept him as tenant—I had had a personal interview with him then—he told me he was coming into 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from his trustees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He told me that he was under age—I presented a cheque to him, which was not honoured—I told him I had come to speak to him about a complaint that his neighbours had made to me, that they were an<lb></lb>noyed by himself and his wife calling "Murder?" and using bad language in the garden, and the smashing of crockery—I showed him the cheque and said I hoped he would go and settle the matter with my solicitors, it was very unpleasant not to have the costs paid as he had stipulated—he had given this cheque for them—he said, "It will be all right, I will go and see my solicitor, and it will be settled at once"—I then asked him whether he was of age—he looked confused and said he was not—he said, "I know you cannot bind me, but I can hold you"—before he went into possession I saw the certificate of marriage—if I had known he was a year and ten months under age I would not have allowed him to go into the place—he told me had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and his wife had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week from her father—I subsequently heard him swear that he was a person of no means whatever—that was at the Marylebone Police-court.</p>

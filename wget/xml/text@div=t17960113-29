               <p>Jury. Q. You saw the muslin drop from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after she took the muslin before she dropped it? - A. About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What did this woman lay out with you? - A. About thirty-two, or thirty-three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a pretty good customer, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate this to your master before you brought her back? - A. No; my master was not in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. She staid a good while after this for her change, and afterwards to buy a gown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the muslin found after she came in? - A. She dropped it on the floor; I put my foot upon it to keep it separate; I did not see the other muslins fall.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Were there any muslins on the ground when she went out? - A. No.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday the 9th of December, early in the afternoon, I was engaged with a customer; the young man came and told me his customer had robbed him; I bid him take care she did not take away the property; she went out, he followed her, and she came in immediately; when they entered the shop, she ran to the top of the shop, where he had been serving her, and the muslins were lying in disorder; I kept pace with her on the other side of the counter, at the top of which there is a slap falls down; this being open, gave me an opportunity of seeing the prisoner drop a piece of muslin from under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she drop it? - A. Near the counter; the young man was tussling with her, to keep her from the counter; she was endeavouring to draw the other muslins upon it; he put his foot upon the muslin to prevent the muslin she drew off the counter falling upon it; she drew off two or three pieces.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Were there any other pieces of muslin on the ground when she let that fall? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe clearly, that there were no other pieces on the ground? - A. Yes; very visibly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You desired the other young man not to let her go out of the shop? - A. I told him not to let her go off with the property.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the Jury there were none on the ground, that you saw; you don't know that there were none on the ground? - A. I am well assured there were none on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you then to give that answer? - A. It did not strike me at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. She was close to the counter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the young man was keeping her from the counter; was she half a yard from the counter? - A. More than that.</p>
               <p>Q. When the boy afterwards gave an account to his master, don't you remember his saying, he was so confused he did not know what to say? - A. No; I do not remember that.</p>
               <p>Q. He did give an account to his master? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were by? - A. Yes; I saw the muslin on the ground before the boy reached the counter.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see any more pieces on the ground besides that? - A. No; I did see some others afterwards.</p>

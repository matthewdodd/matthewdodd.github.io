                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe maker, of 88, Lower Marsh, Lambeth—the prisoner is a greengrocer, living in the New Cut In Sep<lb></lb>tember last I deposited some boots and shoes with him, to the amount of about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were in seven hampers, marked—I agreed to pay him half-a-crown a week—in about three weeks, I made application for their return, and the prisoner told me he had let the upper part of his house to his cabman, and he had removed the boots for safety to his wife's sister's, at Hoxton, and he would give them back to-morrow—when I called two days afterwards, he told me he was unable to get them, as Mr. Scott, his brother-in-law, did not know they were deposited there, and he had to give a few days' notice before he could get them—I sent my wife to him, and I saw him again about two days before he left the New Cut, about 8th November—I understood that he had let his business for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the first deposit had been paid—I was uneasy about my goods, and I went and demanded them—when I went to the shop, his wife said he was not in—I waited in the shop—I would not leave until I saw him—he came down stairs, and said, "As soon as I have settled with these gentlemen for the first deposit for my business, I will come down and see you about those goods"—I waited an hour, or an hour and a half, and he came down and took me out of the shop, and said, "It is no use disguising the matter; I have made away with a hamper of your goods, and with this deposit I have received to-day I will redeem them, and return the whole to-morrow morning, at 9 o'clock"—the goods were not returned the next day, and I saw him again on the Monday following, I believe about 8th November—I said, "Mr. Bell, I want my goods"—he said, "I have disposed of them, and I cannot get them back, unless you give me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I could not—he then said, "You must give me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "The last 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit you received, you must put towards it, and I will try to get another 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "I cannot do so; the lowest I can possibly say is 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "I cannot raise 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on 30th November—I told him it was for stealing boots and shoes from Mr. Stanton who was present—I told him I should go to his house; he said that he would not go—I insisted on his going, and I said I would get whatever force was necessary to compel him—I did go to his house and searched the premises—I found three pairs of shoes, and three pairs of boots—I produce the duplicates which I received from Mr. Stanton—on the way to the station some conversation took place about the boots and shoes—he said that was all right—I said there was not much doubt a quantity of them had been pawned—he said yes, his wife pawned them, and he should make a purse by it—I said he had obtained 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said, it was all right—I said, "What have you done with the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—He said, "I have spent it."</p>

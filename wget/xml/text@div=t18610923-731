                  </hi>. I reside at the Gate-house tavern, at High gate—the prisoner was in my service as ostler, and had been so for eleven months; it was his duty to receive money from customers during the day, for baiting horses and things of that kind, and to hand over at night the money he had received during the day—he used to account to me regularly every night, not the following morning—on Saturday night, 7th September, about twenty minutes to 12, he came to me to account for the money he had received during that day; I heard him tell the barmaid that he had taken 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the stable—I immediately went to him and told him that was not all the money he had taken—he said it was—I asked how he could make that out, enumerating to him at the same time the number of vehicles that had been in the stables on that day to my knowledge, which was a carriage and pair, and a gig belonging to the drill sergeant, which would be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then gave me another sixpence—I asked him if that was all the money he had received; he distinctly said yes—I then told him that his conduct had been so bad upon previous occasions in embezzling money from me, or trying to do so, that I would not put up with it any longer, and I gave him a month's notice to leave—I had seen him about 8 or 9 o'clock on the Saturday evening, he was then perfectly sober, and so he was when I had the conversation with him—in consequence of what Mrs. Chapman said to me that night, I asked the prisoner what he had done with the money that he had received for one particular horse and gig, with two gentlemen in it—he said there had been no horse and gig in the stables—he declared he had not received any money for it, and had never seen it—next morning I sent for a policeman, and asked the prisoner for the money he had received for the horse and gig; he would not acknowledge having received it until he saw the policeman coming round the corner—he than tendered me a shilling, and said, "Well, I did take it last night; take 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. sir"—I said, "You received a shilling, why tender me 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; even in the face of a policeman you want to swindle me three times in one night"—and I told him to be off at once—I asked why he did not give it me last night—he said he was keeping it for me last night—I sent for the police<lb></lb>man and gave him into custody in the afternoon.</p>

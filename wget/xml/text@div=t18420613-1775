                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Bull-yard, Fann-street, Goswell-street. I am employed on the premises of Mr. Richard Beard, the photogenic plate manufacturer—his premises are No. 70, Wharf-road, City-road—part of the premises are in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, and part in St. Luke's—the part this property was deposited in, I believe, is in St. Leonard's, Shoreditch—I always considered so—on Saturday evening, the 7th of May, I left the premises about a quarter to eight o'clock—nobody slept on the premises at that time—I left them all safe and locked up—I went there again on Sunday morning, between ten and eleven o'clock—I entered by the keys which I locked the gates up with—I unlocked the gates, entered the premises, unlocked the second gate, and got in through a door, which I unlocked—I found the doors as I had left them the night before—I went up stairs, and found the door forced open, two boxes and a desk forced open, and property taken out—there had been large sheets of plate metal there the night before—the metal is prepared on purpose for the photogenic likenesses—nobody, to my knowledge, prepares it in London but Mr. Beard—they are copper plates, covered with silver—I had left the room locked the night before—I went down stairs afterwards, and discovered another portion of plate metal, about twenty or twenty-one</p>

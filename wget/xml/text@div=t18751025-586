                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Laurel Villas, Edmonton, I am 15 years of age—on the night of 19th September, I and my sister Jessie were at home alone; my father and the rest of the family were out of town there was nobody in the house, but ourselves—I went to bed that night at 7 o'clock, as soon as it was dark; that was my practice; I slept in the back bedroom, second floor; my sister slept in the same room—before going to bed I made the house secure; it was dark at that time—I locked the area door which leads into the breakfast room, and the breakfast room door was fastened, but not locked; I got into bed quickly—my sister was after me—about ten minutes after I had been in bed she called my attention to some<lb></lb>thing, upon which I got out of bed and went to the window—I could see into the garden at the back of the house from the window; the garden is twice as long as this Court—I saw two men looking over the garden wall—I saw them leave the wall and go round to the front of the house; it is a semi-detached house—a minute or so after I heard a noise, as if the area door was being broken open—I then heard the breakfast room door open—I heard somebody coming up the stairs—I looked out at the door and saw a man coming up the stairs—I shut the door, opened the window, and called out for help and I threw a brush at the door of the next house No. 2, where Mr. Hurd lives—I heard somebody try to open the staircase window, and I heard a pane of glass broken, and somebody running down the stairs—I then unlocked my door and went down and opened the front door—there was a crowd round the gate, and Mr. Hurd came up; I saw nothing more of the man—afterwards when the detective came I examined the area door, it had been forced open, and I saw marks of a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on it, and the lock was gone—a bag of school books and a coat which had been in the break<lb></lb>fast room the night before had been removed to the staircase window, a work-box had been forced open, and a needle-case, and purse taken, which were left in the hall, a writing-desk had been tried to be forced, and that was on the cheffonier in the breakfast room, and the cheffonier drawers were all open.</p>

I am eleven years old—on the night of 19th September I was keeping house for my brother—I went to bed about 7 o'clock—at that time the house was safe—my brother went to bed; I remained up doing my hair—while doing it I saw two men standing on some drain pipes looking over the garden wall—I spoke to my brother, and he got up and went to the window—I did not see anything more of the men—a minute or two afterwards I heard the area door being burst open—my brother called cat of window to Mr. Hurd for assistance, and he threw a brush out—I heard the breakfast-room door open, and heard some one rushing up the stairs; I did not see anybody—I heard them trying to open the staircase window; I heard them shaking it, and then heard a pane of glass broken—we shut our room door and locked it—we afterwards opened it; we heard them run downstairs, and we went down to the front door, opened it, and found a crowd there.</p>

I live at 2, Laurel Villas, next door to Mr. Kittle—on the evening of 19th September, about 7.20, I was in my back parlour and heard the boy calling out for assistance—I had two friends with me, Alfred and Henry Bale—I went out through my conservatory and saw the lad at the window—he said "Mr. Hurd, there are thieves in the house"—I rushed through the passage, calling to my friends to come—we went to Mr. Kittle's front door and knocked, but could gain no admittance—I told my friends to stay there, and I went to the back—Alfred Bale stayed there, Henry Bale followed me—I heard the staircase window smashed, and some one attempting to get out that way—immediately afterwards Henry Bale cried out "Look out, Hurd, he is coming"—I jumped off the drain pipes which I had mounted, sprang between two trees, and caught the prisoner by the collar and brought him to the ground—he was about 25 feet from the garden wall; I did not see him till I caught him—he had rushed from the front of the house up a piece of waste ground at the side; I did not see him come out of the house—he was running—a struggle ensued—before he could rise from the ground my two friends came up and seized him—while we were struggling with him another man came up the waste ground from the front of the house and attacked me with this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I struck him four times in the eye—I retained my hold of the prisoner with my left hand and fought the other man with my right—all this time the prisoner was struggling to get on his feet, but we made it a point that he did not—we kept him—Air. Whitwell and a friend came up—the other man, hearing a cry of "Police!" left me and turned round to attack my friend on the other side of the prisoner, and he then ran off into the fields—we kept the prisoner and handed him over to the policeman—I got a deep gash in my arm; I have no use in my hand at present—I am afraid it will be Christmas before I can use it again.</p>

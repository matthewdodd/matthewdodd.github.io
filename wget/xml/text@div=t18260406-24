I went out on this evening between six and seven o'clock (nearer seven) - I went to the back part of the premises, and saw the prisoner and another man coming over the fence of the adjoining premises - it is a vacant piece of ground, attached to the bottom of the garden - they appeared to be coming from Deacon's premises; I called out Stop thief! they separated, and I took the prisoner after he had run about two hundred yards. I am positive he is one of the men who came over the paling; I never lost sight of him; his shoes were off; he had stockings on. I helped him put his shoes on - they were on the ground when I came up to him. I took him to the prosecutor's house.</p>

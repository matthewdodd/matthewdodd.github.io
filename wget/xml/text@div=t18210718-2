On Sunday, the 27th of May, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I examined a box which was in my bed-room, there were 100 l. in Bank of England notes, among which was one of 50 l., also eighteen sovereigns, a 7 s. piece, and some wearing apparel, and at half-past five o'clock on the Monday morning. I found the box had been broken open, and they were all gone; the prisoner had lived with me for about a month, and did so at this time. As soon as my husband came home I told him - The prisoner had been taken up about a disturbance; she was brought home, and my husband gave her in charge for this robbery, suspecting her; she was searched, in my presence, by Read, and accused a young man, a gentleman's servant, with it; he was taken up, but discharged. She said if any body knew where the money was, he did. I have found none of the property.</p>

            . On the 27th of May, I lived at the Cock, and remember the money being missed; I saw the prisoner in her mistress's room between three and four o'clock on the Sunday afternoon (she was servant to Mrs. Hobson, who was there for her health); I went in, she had the box lid open, and directly as I went in she shut it down, turned her back to it, and then picked up a basket, and put it on the top of the box; I asked her what she was looking for - she said for her white apron; I asked her what she had on her arm. (she had an apron there.) She said that was one, and she was looking for the other, to lend to me, as I had greased mine; I said the one she had on would do for me - she said she did not like to see girls without white aprons on of a Sunday afternoon. She went up stairs about ten minutes before I did. I came down again, and she came down after me, almost directly, and went into the bar. I afterwards went up stairs with her to clean herself. She said nothing to me.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden, and took charge of the prisoner. When we were at the office I asked her if she knew where the money was; she said she did not know any thing about it, but that a young man, a cousin of her's, who had visited her that afternoon, about four o'clock, asked her if she knew where her mistress's money was, and she told him; that he went up stairs into her mistress's room, with a crow-bar, which he brought with him, opened the box, and took the money out.

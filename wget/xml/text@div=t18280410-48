I went out at a few minutes before three o'clock in the afternoon, to go to Divine service - I left nobody in the house - the house was all properly secured, the window sash was fastened down with a catch and a screw, the glass was all whole, the doors all fastened, and the gate locked. I returned in about an hour, and as I came back was told my house was broken open - I had left every thing safe in it when I went to chapel - on returning I found the window sash thrown up which I had left secure - I found the flap of the bureau, which was in the parlour, turned down, the drawers all open, and the papers and memorandums in great confusion - I had left it locked - it appeared to have been forced with a chisel or something - I had left no money there; I went up into my bed-room on the first floor, and found a chest of drawers broken open - there was the mark of a chisel on them, a small bit of mahogany was cut out: I missed from there a small dark-coloured trunk, containing two purses; there were thirteen sovereigns and three half-sovereigns in one purse, and in the other I believe five sovereigns - I am certain there were sovereigns in both of them - I have a memorandum of my money which I made before this happened - I had spent none of it - there was in all nineteen sovereigns and a half together; the purse which had contained the most sovereigns was left behind in the house: I also lost four small silver tea spoons and one rather larger; they were in the drawer with the trunk - I had left the drawer locked: I found all my drawers open - I also missed two watches, one all silver, and the other an old silver one in a shagreen case. I lost three gold rings, two of them mourning rings, and one large gold ring with the name of Forrest on it, that had been my uncle's. I saw my property next day and knew it; the prisoner was then in custody. I lost some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100045"></xptr>silver coins, a crown piece, and several half-crowns, and one half-crown of the date of 1746, which was a keepsake from my father; I saw that half-crown next day at the Petty Sessions: I also lost a small bit of silver with a ribbon fastened to it: I saw that also at the Sessions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q. Have you any other Christian name? A. No. My house is in Fulham parish, in the hamlet of Hammersmith; I pay parish rates for it.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have enquired about the prisoner as to whether he was in distress at this time? A. He made a very poor figure the day he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told you do not wish to hurt him? A. I want Justice, and the law of God and the country to take place. I had not opened my trunk that day, but I swear it was locked up in the drawer. I cannot say whether I had been to the trunk that week, but the last time I went to it there were twenty sovereigns; I took half a sovereign, and crossed out the twenty on this paper, and put down nineteen and a half. I think that was less than a month before; the other things were in the drawer; I was at the drawer that morning and locked it.</p>

            . On Sunday, the 2d of March, I left my father's house with a young man, to take a walk, and as I went out I saw Mrs. Powell and her neice coming out of their gate: I parted with the young man afterwards, and was coming home alone in about an hour; I saw the sash up, and a pane of glass broken, which was not the case before; I went into my father's house; my father sat reading a book - I told him- we came out, and rang the bell at the prosecutrix's gate - it is a low wooden gate, but not very easy to get over; we rang a second time, and then the prisoner came out with his hat in his hand, and said, "The ladies are not at home this afternoon;" he came out, and came to the gate; my father said, "You are a thief, and a d - d thief!" and went to stop him, but he knocked my father down. Nobody lives in the house besides the prosecutrix and her neice. I never saw the prisoner before - he ran off, and I after him; he ran through the foundry - I kept him in sight, but lost sight of him for about a moment, and am quite sure I caught sight of the same person; my father followed him part of the way - there was nobody running but the prisoner and us two; he turned round the foundry, and went down a lane, and just before I got to him he threw down a watch and a purse, with some sovereigns in it - he flung them round, and I being so close to him he struck me on the nose with his arm, as he flung them away - I caught him within a few paces, leaving the watch and sovereigns on the ground; I secured him, and afterwards saw them picked up by Barton. I saw him searched, and some sovereigns, a crown-piece, some half-crowns, and a great quantity of picklock-keys found on him; a silver watch was also found on him; the prosecutrix claimed every thing but the picklock-keys; the prisoner gave no account of himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The blow on the nose did not hurt you? A. No: I cannot say that he meant to strike me - I lost sight of him just for a moment; I was not five minutes in pursuit of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person who went out with you see the state of the prosecutrix's house? A. Not to my knowledge; we disagreed on the road; I left him, and came home; that was before I had seen the house.</p>

In consequence of what my son said I came out, and saw the prosecutrix's sash up, and a pane of glass broken; I then rang at the bell twice, and the second time the prisoner came out to the door, which opened very gently; he put his hand to his hat, and said either the old lady, or, the ladies were not at home; only the prosecutrix and her neice live in the house. As he advanced to me I looked him very hard in the face, and said, "You are a thief!" and believe I said, "A d - d thief!" I had the gate in my hand - he was pulling the gate to come out, and as he came out I made a catch at him; he up with his fist, knocked me down, and ran away - as soon as I got up I followed him part of the way; I afterwards saw him in my son's custody, and am confident he is the man who knocked me down.</p>

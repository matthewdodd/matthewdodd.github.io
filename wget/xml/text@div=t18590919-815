On the morning I was taken I went to the Brighton terminus and got a job to carry a box and a carpet bag to the Post-office, for which the gentleman gave me what I supposed was a shilling; I went with it a few steps when I opened my hand and saw to my surprise it was a sovereign. I went to get a glass of ale and the prosecutor said it was bad; I asked him to give it me back and he refused, and called a policeman, and gave me in charge. I could have escaped but I did not; I waited till the policeman came, which did not look like guilty knowledge, and I had no other money in my possession.</p>

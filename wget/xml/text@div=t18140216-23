            , the prisoner, robbed us; I secreted myself in a part of the warehouse that day. I saw him put into his hat a quantity of tobacco, which he took from a cask; when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160013"></xptr>he had put it in his hat he went out with it. I sent John Evans after him to call him back. Instead of his coming back he turned into a court which is next door but one to us, and when he came in I challenged him with having the tobacco in his hat; he said, it was no such thing. I then told him he had emptied it in the court; he said he had done no such thing; I sent Evans back to the court, and there he found it.</p>
               <p>JOHN EVANS. I am a servant to Mr. Lloyd. After the prisoner went out of the shop I followed him, and told him to come back; instead of following me back to the shop he turned into the court. I saw him come out of the court; he came to the shop afterwards. I was sent back to the court afterwards for the tobacco, which I found, and brought to the shop. It was covered over with paper, and the lining of his hat was on it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WORRALL. I produce the tobacco. This tobacco was delivered to me by Mr. Roberts; after that, I searched the prisoner's lodgings; his wife delivered this tobacco to me; she said it was what he had brought in in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That tobacco never was in my hat. The back window of our manufactory comes in this court, and the lower panes of glass are out of the window; it is easy for any body to throw tobacco out into this court.</p>

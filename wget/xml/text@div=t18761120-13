                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). I have been in the service between seven and eight years—I was directed by my superiors to watch. Mr. Wicken's premises, in Glaucus Street, Bow Common, a glue and size dealer, and bone boiler, and on 6th October I was stationed with Sergeant Roots in the laboratory, where there was some green baize before the window—this sketch correctly describes the relative "positions of the window and the scale—I went there about 3.30 a.m. and remained till 10.30 p.m.—the window is 12 or 13 ft. from the ground, and the upright of the, scale is 9 or 10 ft. from the wall—business commenced about 6 a.m.—I received a signal when Seaborn and Sambridge came to the scale, and made these notes at the time—at about 6.5 Sambridge and Seaborn came to the scale together, bones were brought in, Seaborn weighed them, and they called out the weights, and Sambridge and Garlick made notes—two baskets were weighed at a time, and sometimes three—there were twelve weighings that day—Mr. Wickens was there, he left directly Sambridge and Seaborn came with their loads—he gave us the information, and then left the pre<lb></lb>mises by my direction before the weighing took place—on 13th October I placed myself in the same room with Manton—we went about 3.30 a.m. and remained there till the close of the afternoon—they commenced weigh<lb></lb>ing at 6 a.m.—Seaborn, Sambridge and Garlick were present—there were twenty-five weighings, which were called out by Seaborn—I could not distinctly hear the" weights as the laboratory window was shut; I could see everything, but could not bear—we made a report of the number of weigh-. ings before we saw Seaborn's book—on the Saturday Roots and I went to the Tenterden Arms to watch Eddington, that is opposite Glaucus Street, and we saw Seaborn and Eddington in Glaucus Street, walking from the factory towards the public-house, and as they entered Seaborn said "It is all right now, it is level this time," or "it is. eleven this time," I do not know which, as he speakes in a peculiar way—they had some drink, which Eddington paid for—Seaborn said "When it was put on the scale he was up and down all the time," and he made a motion with hishand—another</p>

               <p>man then joined them, and they went outside, where they stopped talkin under Eddington's umbrella for five or six minutes, and then parted—befor leaving, Eddington gave the landlady money for a glass of ale for somebody—they went into the Widow's Son public-house for about three minutes, then to the Bank in the Bow Road, and then to the railway station, and I lost sight of them for about half an hour—on Friday, the 20th I was in the counting-house, but not all day; Garlick and Sambridge came in, I had seen that they were unloading bones—Sinclair said to Garlick "Harry, what do you make yours?"—he said "27-2-4 marrows," and I think he said "15 cwt. of waste "—he then called to Sambridge and said "What do you make your weights?"—he called out his weights but I do not remember what they all were—Sinclair called to Seaborne who had brought his weighing book with him, and Sinclair compared the weights and the weighing book and then wrote them each out, these two tickets, one is "27-2-4 marrow," and the other "15 waste"—warrants were afterwards delivered to me against the four prisoners and on 26th October I took Seaborne and read the warrant to him, which was for conspiring to obtain 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Samuel Wickens by false pretences—he said "You seem to know more about it than I do, I have never robbed Mr. Wickens, I have always acted fairly by him, and I think he must say so "—I then took Garlick and Sambridge, who were there, and read the warrant to them; they both said "I know nothing at all about it"—Garlick said to me "How can this have been done then?"—I said "You have been charging for more bones than came in, by increasing the number of weighings "—he said "I know nothing about it, I never had a pound off Seaborne and I never robbed Wickens, only when I put a bit of meat in the basket"—four or five hours afterwards I went to Eddington's house—he opened the door—I said "Can I see Mr. Eddington?"—he said "I am he, what have you got my two men for?"—I told him they were in custody for robbing Mr. Wickens and that I had a warrant for his arrest—he said "Good God! you don't say so, who can have done this; Mr. Wickens?"—I said "Yes"—I read the warrant to him—he said "Well, I cannot be responsible for what my men do, I thought I had two of the most honest fellows in the trade "—I asked if he kept any books—he said "No "—I asked him if he supplied the carmen with books to go on their rounds—he said "No, I give them so much money in the morning, they go round and collect the bones and stuff and take it to Mr. Wickens. and bring me back a ticket of the total weight and give me the change, if there is any, that is the only record I have "—I said "Don't you reckon up with your men in, the morning or the change they give you?"—he said "No, I make up my, account every night and I trust to my men as to the amount—I searched his place and found these books and memoranda (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are entries in the books of the transactions of the 6th, 13th, and 20th October—on the 6th here is <hi rend="italic">"Harry</hi>, 24-1-7, 21-1-0, and cash 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; also <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, 17-2-4 marrows, 6-2-10 waste, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—on 13th October here is <hi rend="italic">"Harry</hi>, 34-0-2 and 26-2-4,15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., total 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, 19-10-25 and 10-3-15, total 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—on 20th here is <hi rend="italic">"Harry</hi> 27-2-4 and 15-0-0, carried out, total 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,"and <hi rend="italic">Torn</hi>, 20-0-24 and 10 cwt, carried out 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—those are the only entries referring to those dates—there is no entry of money by Eddington to the men, but here are entries of balances which I donot understand—there is no entry with regard to Wickens—there is an entry on Wednesday, 10th October, "Seaborne &amp; Sons," as if he was doing</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. The tickets would be rightly in his possession, there was no harm in that, supposing the weighings were correct—this is where Eddington's load commences and it goes on at the back—I do not remember seeing three baskets in one weighing, the baskets came in generally two by two—I have noted where there are two and where there are three—I have not counted the number of baskets, but there were a good many, more than 12—when I thought I understood the weight* I put it down, but I could not hear distinctly—Seaborn, who was weighing, took a note of each weighing and called out to Garlick and Sambridge, who made entries in their books—at some of the weighings, they both made notes and at others only one of them did—two baskets were weighed together, but the weight was only called once—I have no notion why <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Torn</hi>, both entered them—the green baize over the window was very thick, but I had two holes made through it as big as a sixpence, or larger, one for me, and one for Roots—I told the Magistrate that there was nothing between me and the window, we were looking from the dark into the light—I could not bring both eyes to bear, one eye relieved guard with the other—we were there from 3.30 a.m., we had something to eat and drink—the copper was in use on the 13th, but not on the 6th; when it is boiling a great deal of effluvia and vapour rises when the lid is up and it was up many times, in a day; the vapour then came up pretty freely and I could not see at all; there was no vapour while the load on the 13th was being weighed; I made arrangements for that—Wickens' men brought the baskets in, I know them by sight, but not their names—if it had struck me to get them in afterwards to tally the baskets from the cart I should not have done it—this is my note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this "3-3 "means 3 cwt. 3 qrs., which was the weight I understood to be called out by Seaborn—I have never added up the weights to. see how far they agreed with the tickets, we took them down to make ourselves more positive as to the weighings—I think the two glasses of ale at the public-house would only come to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I will not swear that Eddington did not put down 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—Seaborn did not take out a sixpence, nor did Eddington say. "Put your money back, this makes it even "—he stutters.</p>

The ticket ought to correspond with Seaborne's book, and it does—I complain that more are charged than were weighed, they charged me with too many bones—my counting-house is by the side of the scale, with a glass window towards the scale; it is on the ground floor in the general counting-house—I could see them and they me, they came in and out close to the scale, and I was noticing what they did—I came out of my little room into the warehouse, and I could see the baskets pass by carried by my own men, but they are sometimes carried by the car<lb></lb>men—I have not got the memorandum I made at the time—I made a tick for each weighing, and there were seven—I kept the marrows and the waste on different sides—I made one mark for two baskets which is one weighing, sometimes" there were three baskets in one weighing, but never four—no dif<lb></lb>ference would be made whether there were three or two—the two baskets would be brought from one cart—I cannot tell you of any instance where it would be necessary for <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> both to make an entry—if <hi rend="italic">Tom's</hi> load was: finished and <hi rend="italic">Harry's</hi> begun he would not weigh the two and the one together—it never could be that <hi rend="italic">Tom's</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Harry's</hi> baskets were in the scale at the same time—on 26th September and 9th October I was in the counting-house, going backwards and forwards to the warehouse—I have small customers as well as large, and it might happen, though it very seldom did, that a small customer came with a small lot which was weighed interme<lb></lb>diately with a large lot—Seaborn has been a long time in the business—I. had not been in the bone trade before I took it, I kept the St. John's Gate, Clerkenwell—I kept on all the men—Seaborn's brother carries on business in the same trade.</p>

We give our men money to go out and buy bones and pay for them and they hand us back the balance in cash, and no doubt Eddington's course of business with his men was the same, hut his men would bring the bones straight to me and take him back the tickets and account to him for the balance—my transactions with Eddington were large, about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is due to him now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi>). On 6th October I was watching in the laboratory with Andrews—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my notes—the first weigh<lb></lb>ing was two baskets of bones—Seaborn called out 3 1/2 for the first, for the second I have no weight, for the third I have 3-2-22—there were twelve weighings, not twenty-one—I was also there on 20th October, and these are my notes—there were twenty-six weighings, I am sure there were not twenty-seven—Robson was with me—Mr. Wickens, in my presence, compared the weighings of other bone dealers and Seaborn's book and they were correct—on Saturday, 14th, I went with Andrews to the Ten-terden Arms, and saw Seaborn and Eddington—on coming in Seaborn said "Well, that is all right now, it is level this time," or "eleven," I think it was eleven—they had some drink and Seaborn said that while it was on the scale he was up and down all the time—Eddington then left 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a glass of beer for another of the men, and they left.</p>

I cannot say whether it was a sixpence that Eddington put down, I could see plainly, but I was listening rather than looking—two glasses of ale were drunk, I am sure it was ale—the words "That will make it level," or "even," were said before they had the beer, as they were coming in—they came in at the same door as we did, but we went into another compartment—we went in just before them, we saw them coming—I could not see Eddington where he stood at the bar—Andrews cut the holes in the baize and we both looked through and saw the weighing—he said "There is two more," and I put down two more—the time between the weighings gave us time to do that—I consulted him about everything—I put down and read it as I wrote it—the whole of this is my writing, but it has nothing to do with those weighings—there is something in this memorandum in Andrews' writing, but the generality of it is mine, the whole of it as far as October 6th is concerned—Sergeant Robson was my companion on 20th October—we went to the same chinks then and I wrote the whole of this, calling out to him "There are two more baskets "in the same way.

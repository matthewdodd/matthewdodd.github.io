               <p>Q. I suppose you can hardly swear to it? - A. It was common tobacco, and that sort that he alone was the manufacturer of; it was the same sort that we found upon him afterwards; many were manufacturing in the same place, but not the same tobacco.</p>

               <p>I am a constable: On Tuesday the 11th of October, I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner, and I took this tobacco from him out of his breeches, (producing it); I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Haines, Junior. This is the same kind of tobacco that the prisoner was at work upon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This tobacco is the service that was given me and my wife; I had saved it up to send down to my brother, a young man that was going that morning to Lincolnshire; I have no other convenience that they should not search me to take it from me; and this man that is swearing against me, is to have five guineas from my master if he can cast me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Haines.) Did you promise that man any money? - A. Never; but there is a paper stuck up in my warehouse, and has been stuck up these seven years, that whoever should detect another in stealing tobacco out of the warehouse should receive five guineas reward; I have made no promise to any body excepting that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived with you? - A. Five or six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any character with him? - A. Yes; we never take any man in without a character;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260028"></xptr>but I really cannot say from whom we had him; we did not minute it down in a book.</p>

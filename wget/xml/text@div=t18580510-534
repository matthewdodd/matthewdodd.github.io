                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 200). On 21st Feb., I was on duty in Dorset Square. About 10 o'clock that evening, I was called by Mrs. Southern—she was bleeding very much from the nose and mouth, and her dress was all over blood—I went with her and Adams, 158, to No. 3, Little Park Street—we went down into the back kitchen—I saw both the prisoners there, and several others—Mrs. Southern said she would give Har<lb></lb>ragan into custody for an assault upon her—I and Adams tried to persuade Harragan to come to the station; he would not—he said, "What for?" I said, when he got to the station he would be told—I put my hand upon him and told him he must go—the prisoners were not both drunk—I did not per<lb></lb>ceive that any of them were drunk; they knew very well what they were about—when we were taking Harragan into custody, Lynch came up and swore he should not be taken—he had got something, but in the confusion, I could not perceive what it was, and he struck Adams about the hand; and when I had got Harragan against the door, he dropped himself down, and clung round my legs, and threw me down on the edge of the bed—they forced me and Adams outside the door.</p>

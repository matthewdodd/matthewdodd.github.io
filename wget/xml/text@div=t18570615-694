                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Harris, a linendraper, in Bishopsgate Street. On Saturday evening, 30th May, the prisoner came to my master's shop, about 8 o'clock at night—she asked for a cap front—I had not one to suit her, and she purchased two yards of printed cotton—it came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>—she offered me a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I took it to Mr. Harris—he gave it back to me—I gave it back to him, and saw him give it to the officer—I am sure it was the one I had from the prisoner—on 22nd May, the Friday week before, the prisoner had come to the shop at night, and purchased a cap front—it came to 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and I gave her the change—I did not notice that it was bad—I took it to my master, and in a few minutes he came to me and showed me a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I took it to a public house, and left it with Amelia knight—shortly afterwards she came to me, and brought me a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I took it, and showed it to my master—I thought it was bad—I gave it back to Amelia Knight—shortly afterwards Mr. Shepherd, her master, came back with it—he laid it on the counter, and my master took it up, and gave it to me—I broke it, and kept the pieces, and gave them to an officer—I have not the least doubt that the prisoner is the person who came on the two occasions—I did not say any<lb></lb>thing to her about it—I cannot tell that it was the same that I gave Knight that she brought back, but I can tell that that was the same that was brought back by Shepherd—I never saw the prisoner before 22nd May—I am sure she is the same person that was there on the 22nd—we have many customers in the course of a week, but they are regular customers, not many chance customers—the crown passed on the 30th I gave to Mr. Harris, and he gave it to me, and I gave it directly to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brakesman on the Victoria Railway—five weeks ago I lived at 5, St. George's-terrace, Pimlico—my solicitor purchased for me, at an auction, the house No. 81, York-street, Lambeth; but I could not get possession, and brought an action of ejectment—I succeeding in getting a verdict—on Friday, 15th June, I went there expecting to find a servant of</p>

               <p>mine, or a policeman in the place—the shop was shut—I walked on the other side of the street first, and Mr. Bird told me that the premises were locked up—I borrowed a crow bar and went to the shop door and en<lb></lb>deavoured to get in with it—before that I saw the defendant on the side wall, flourishing a stick—he said the first man that went into the house he would break his head with that stick—I said, "I must chance it," and got the bar partly in the door—he then threw part of a brick at me off a fan light above the door—it just touched me and that was all—a second was then thrown, and I do not believe that touched me; but a third did, and struck me very heavily on the eye, and cut my face, and laid my cheek open—the blood flowed—it hurt me, and I was obliged to leave the front door in consequence—I cannot say that I saw the defendant at the fan light—I was close under the door—I was not able to get into the premises—it was about half a brick.</p>

On Friday, 15th June, I was at this house, 81, Vauxhall-street, Lambeth, and saw the prisoner standing on the wall at the rear of the house flourishing a stick in his hand, and saying that any one who attempted to come in he would beat their brains out—I saw Mr. Edens afterwards at the door trying to get in—the defendant was over the door at the fan-light and asked him what he was doing there—he said he was coming in—the defendant said, "If you do not leave off, I will drop this on your head"—that was part of a brick or a stone—Mr. Edens still continued trying to get in, and he dropped it—it hit him on the hat—he then dropped a second which did not hit him, and a third which hit him on the face and caused a wound which bled, and his eye became black—I advised him to come away from the door, and he did so.</p>

On 15th June I met Mr. Edens by appointment—I have heard his examination—I did not make use of the expression, "Do not quite kill him, but nearly"—he was going towards the door, and there were twenty or thirty people there—some woman said, "The first person who goes into that house he will kill them;" and I said, "Nonsense about killing, you must protect yourself; but whatever you do, do not kill him at all eveats;" but as to saying I would do for the b—, I consider it hateful to make use of such a word—what I said was in joke, because it was so absurd—I do not think Edens heard me—he did not say a word—I heard the ex<lb></lb>pressions that the defendant used on the wall.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>with me for two or three purposes; first to knock at the door, there being no knocker—I have carried that whip stock two or three days—I have not got it to-day—it is the handle of a hunting whip—I went with him to borrow the sledge hammer—I really do not recollect from which of us the suggestion came—the woman said, "Heath is at the door, and he will kill the first person who attempts to enter"—I turned round and laughed at the idea, and said, "Whatever you do protect yourself, but do not kill him"—it was a sort of joke—the man was excited—he stood on the wall with a very ugly jagged stick like a Turkish thorn—there were two policemen there.</p>

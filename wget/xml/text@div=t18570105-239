                  </hi>., I live at Morton's coffee house, Blackman-street, and am a carpenter. On Sunday morning, 22nd Dec., at half past 4 o'clock, I was in Blackman-street, Borough—I there met Crosby—I asked her where I could get something to eat—she took me home and took me up stairs—she then went out of the room to get a candle, and she returned with Taylor and a man—Crosby blew out the candle, and the man attacked me on my neck, and the two together robbed me of the money I had got it was two half crowns—I know I had them in my pocket before I went up stairs, I had my hand in my pocket—they then ran out of the room to<lb></lb>gether—I stopped a little, for I could not find the door—Taylor then came and opened the door, and I went out into the street and went and got a policeman—when Taylor opened the door she said, "What do you want there?"—I said, "You know very well what I want"—while I was speaking to the policeman, the two prisoners came out and went to the other side of the street with a light, and looked as if for something—the policeman spoke to them, and took them into custody—I am sure the prisoners are the two women—I was in the room about five minutes—I was two or three minutes with them before the candle was blown out—there was a small light in the room before Crosby went out for a candle.</p>

The prosecutor came to me in the Waterloo—road, on Sunday morning, and told me he had been robbed—whilst he was telling me, the two prisoners came along with a candle—the prose—cutor said, "Wait a bit, I think these are the two coming"—he went towards them and said, "They are the two girls that robbed me"—the prisoners denied having seen him before—the prosecutor pointed out the room to me—I know that the prisoners lived there—the prosecutor was sober.</p>

On Monday evening last, I received information and looked into the shop from my parlour, I saw a person in the act of stooping, with a cap on, and going out; I ran out and missed a cheese - I directed my young men to go different ways, and I went out also; when I came back I found the prisoner in custody, and this cheese; but whether he is the person I saw going out, I cannot tell, his cap resembled that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Was it not rather dark? A. The gas was lighted; I was at some distance from the person, he had a cloth cap on, not a glazed cap; the cheese was taken from the pile at the door.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutor; I went down Oxenden-street - I saw two young men cross, and the prisoner who was one of them, had a cheese under his arm; they were both walking; I followed them to near the bottom of Oxenden-street, when our other young man came and met them - I ran and took the prisoner back with the cheese; this is the cheese that was under the prisoner's arm - I can swear to it by a mark on it - I was not absent from the shop, and know it was not sold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean that during that evening you were not absent at all? A. No; I had seen this cheese ten minutes before it was stolen; the prisoner said at Marlborough-street, that he had been engaged by the other man to carry it, but he did not say so before; he said in the street, that he did not take it; and then he said he did it for hunger.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that a man had given him the cheese to carry.</p>

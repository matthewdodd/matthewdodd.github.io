                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at North Woolwich. On Tuesday afternoon, 13th September, I was at the Victoria tavern, Barton-road, between 4 and 5 o'clock—the prisoner was there at the time—there were a good many people in the room—I could not tell whether they were in his company—I had half a pint of beer there—I took out my purse to pay for it—there was a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, 2 half-crowns, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my purse at that time—while I had it in my hand, it was knocked down on the front of the bar by the prisoner—he meddled and pushed me about, and picked up some money and gave it to me—I don't know how much he picked up—when the purse was knocked out of my hand the money fell out—he picked some of the money up, and ran away with it—I had a watch with me at the time this happened—it was in my watch-pocket—the prisoner cut the ribbon off, and took the watch away with him—it was tied round my neck and the watch in my pocket—I did not see him out it off—some one spoke to me about the watch—I gave information to the police—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was another person taken into custody, but he knew nothing about it.</p>

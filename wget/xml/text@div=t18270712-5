            . I am the wife of Francis Harvey. we live in the parish of St. Luke. On the 15th of June I was in the back parlour, and heard something fall down in the front room; I went in, and missed this desk, which I had seen on the table just before; I directly went into the street, and saw the prisoner with it under his arm; I hallooed Stop thief! and he let it fall, but was taken within three minutes, without my losing sight of him - I am sure he is the man; I picked the desk up, took it back to the parlour, and delivered it to the officer.</p>

            . I live next door to Harvey. I saw the prisoner come down the path of the garden in front of the house, with a bundle of wood under each arm; he returned with a writing-desk; he never entered the house, but took it through the parlour window, I suppose, as the door was shut; I only saw him come from the house with it- he went into the road; I saw no more of him till he was brought back - he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A. In my parlour; I have no curtain to my window. I did not see him take the desk; I saw him go with the wood, and come back with the desk; I lost sight of him for about three minutes. I was sitting within the room.</p>

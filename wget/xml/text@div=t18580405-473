                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Knight, of No. 17, Church Street, Deptford; he is a shoemaker. About the end of May, 1856; I had a blue dress in my possession—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I missed it from a clothes horse in my bed room, early on Monday morning—I had worn it on the Sunday—my house is about 200 yards from the house of Mrs. Cox—on the 16th March last I saw Mrs. Cox coming down the street, and she had my dress on—I made some inquiries—I know it is my dress by the make of it, and also by the pattern—the sleeves are joined in a peculiar way, and the dressmaker pointed them out to me when she brought the dress home—I am certain it is my dress—it was quite new when I lost it—I bought it at a linen draper's, in Deptford—Mrs. Griffiths made it—she lives at Deptford—she is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, living at No. 87, New Church Street, Bermondsey. About the month of May or June, 1856, I lived within 200 yards of Mrs. Knight—at that time the prisoner rented some stable be<lb></lb>longing to me—I remember about that time his leaving a bundle, to be taken care of, there were one or two sacks and a dress rolled up—the dress was not put into the sack, but the back had been put down, and the dress rolled in it; the sack was empty, and formed a wrapper—I do not think the dress could be seen from the outside—I took care of the things—from something my little girl told me, I looked at the sack, and I then saw the dress—I spoke to Charlotte Parker about it, she saw it, and she went at my request to the prisoner—she brought me back a message; in consequence of that I gave her 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to give to the prisoner.</p>

About the month of May, 1856, I was living with Mrs. Cox—I was present when the prisoner left a bundle; the bundle was tied round in a sack and a handkerchief—I looked, and saw a blue dress, I can only speak to the dress by the colour—this is the dress my mistress wore continually—I afterwards saw my mistress give some money to Charlotte Parker.</p>

I remember, about the time in question, seeing Mrs. Cox at the door of her house; she showed me a dress—that is it—I knew the prisoner before this—in consequence of what Mrs. Cox said, I went to him; I asked him whether he wanted to sell the drees—he said, "No," he was going to make it a present to some one; he then said if I wanted it, I might have it for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the bargain was ultimately struck for that sum—the dress was for Mrs. Cox—she afterwards gave me the money, and I took it to the prisoner, and paid him for it.</p>

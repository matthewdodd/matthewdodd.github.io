               <p>carried on business by myself—I had an acquaintance named Leriche, a clerk to a solicitor—in 1865 or 1866 Leriche introduced to me a man named Leon, a German—I had a business transaction with him in July, 1866—I had twenty-five hogsheads of claret lying at Fenning's Wharf, which I had brought from Bordeaux—on the 25th July Leon called on me with the prisoner—he introduced him to me as Mr. Cadman—he said the prisoner was in want of twenty-five casks of wine—that Cadman was living in Great Carter Lane, City, and was a merchant—we all three went down to Fenning's Wharf, and they tasted the wine—he agreed to take it, and the delivery of the goods was to be effected on the Friday—they did not come on the Friday, they came on the Saturday—I then received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the expenses of having the goods cleared—they went away to fetch the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was brought, we all three went to the wharf—I paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and got the warrants at 3.30—we then returned to my office, and I made an invoice for the twenty-five casks of wine, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., deducting the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which had been paid—the prisoner then took a blank cheque from his pocket, filled it up, and signed his name "H.

Cadman"—I was still carrying on business as Coutts, Dobell &amp; Co.—he handed the cheque to me—I objected to take it, it was 4.15; after banking hours—Mr. Leon said all would be right, he had known the prisoner seven years—he said he was sure there was money in the bank—I eventually took the cheque, and gave him the warrant to clear the wine—I presented the cheque on the Monday morning, and it was returned to me, marked "No account," and the name was not known at all—I then went to Great Carter Lane, and made inquiries—I could not find the prisoner there carrying on business as Air. Cadman—I saw a gentleman of the name of Cadman, in Newgate Street, and then went to the Southwark Police Court and obtained a warrant—I gave instructions to have it executed on the prisoner—shortly after that I left this country and returned to France—I came back again in January, 1867—in June or July, 1867, I met the prisoner talking to a man named Mouillet—I went up and spoke to Mouillet, and the prisoner went away—I went to a public-house with Mouillet, and saw the prisoner at the bar; he said he had nothing for the transaction—I said that if he got nothing, it must be Mouillet that got some, and Mouillet said, "I received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for giving the cheque to Cadman"—I went down to the Police Court to obtain a warrant, as the other had run out—I met the prisoner a few weeks after, in Upper Thames Street—we did not speak about this matter then—I then lost sight of him for about nine months—I found out his address in the beginning of June, and then applied for another warrant—I heard him addressed by the name of Fiddes.</p>

            . I lost a great coat on Easter Monday; I went out with a friend, and did not miss it till the Tuesday morning, when I went to put my clothes in the box - I had left it on my bed; the prisoner had been a lodger - I went in quest of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He took me out to drink with him, and we drank till one o'clock in the day. Witness. Yes, a friend took us out, and treated us both.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SMITH. I am a pawnbroker. On the 20th of April, about one o'clock, this coat was pawned with me by the prisoner; I asked if it was his own; he said Yes, that his name was John Mooney, and he lived in Cow-cross- I asked him how he came to Islington to pawn it; he said he worked in the Pied Bull fields.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CLARK. I took the prisoner. He was in liquor - he said he had pawned the coat.</p>

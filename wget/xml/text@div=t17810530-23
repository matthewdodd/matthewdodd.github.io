My house was broke open on the 12th of January: I was out at the time; I did not return till between eleven and twelve o'clock. I left only a maid servant in the house when I went out. I went to bed as soon as I came home, and heard nothing of it, though I since find the maid then knew of it. There was a Roman sword, with a carved wooden handle, and a pistol, lost out of my parlour: there were two pistols hung in the parlour, but one dropped upon the floor, which I found next morning. The windows of the parlour look towards the street.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Wilson; he went out on the 12th of January, in the afternoon, before dark; I was left at home.</p>
               <p>Were the doors shut up when he went out? - The door was upon the spring lock; I heard a kind of noise, like the motion of the sash; the sashes of the parlour were down; I was below in the kitchen; I immediately ran up stairs. This was the front parlour, and I was in the back kitchen, under the back parlour. When I heard the noise, I did not know where it was; I ran up stairs, and found the sash in the front parlour thrown open; I went down, and got a light. This was between five and six o'clock; it was quite dark. I found a sword and pistol taken away from the parlour, and one pistol was dropped in the parlour. A gentleman dined with my master, and my master went out with him.</p>
               <p>Had you been in the parlour any time that afternoon? - I had.</p>

               <p>Was any person in the house besides you? - A young woman called upon me, but she did not go into that room. I never left the house.</p>
               <p>I suppose you was frightened? - I was not much frightened; I put the sash down, and then shut the shutters. My master went to bed immediately as he came home; I did not tell him of it till he saw it, because I thought somebody in the neighbourhood had done it to frighten me, and that I might hear something of it the next morning.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing of value in the parlour, besides this sword and pistol? - Yes, there were some silver spoons, but they were in a cupboard; it was not locked, but the doors were shut. It was a very dark night.</p>
               <p>Was any of the glass of the sash broke? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the sash pinned down? - No, not that I know of.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 7th of May, in what they call the New Cut, a new road that is made from the sign of the Happy Man to Battle Bridge, a little after ten at night, in company with another person; they were on one side the road, we on the other; they crossed over to us; we went to see if we could find any body who had been concerned in a footpad robbery, committed the night before.</p>
               <p>They did not know you, I suppose? - If they had, they would not have come to us, I believe. I passed the first, and laid hold of the prisoner at the bar; I clapped my hand against his left breast, and said, Holloa! young fellow, what have you got here? I shifted my hands, to secure him; and he dropped this sword immediately, naked; afterwards he dropped the sheath: he dropped the sheath before I had well secured his hand; when he dropped the sword, I put my foot upon it immediately. He had no arms but that; it has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>(The sword was produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my sword; it belonged to General Melvin; he left it with me to make one for Lord Dunglass, as I have been in the army contract way; and I was to make one, at the same time, for General Melvin: he left it with me some time about the beginning of December; I had it as a pattern for Lord Dunglass; as this was a soft metal, not tempered, he wanted one that was tempered of good steel. I understood this was to be mine; I kept it as a curiosity: I suppose there is not such another in all England.</p>
               <p>Was the pistol yours? - It was. I have never seen my pistol since.</p>

On the 15th of April I left my shop in care of the prisoner - her father lodged in my second-floor. I returned, measured my goods, and found eight yards and a half of cotton cut off a piece, only three yards were left - I had sold none of it. I accused her of it, she strongly denied it. A friend of mine came, I told her I had been robbed, and it must be the prisoner, she made no reply, but ran up stairs. I called her father down. Her father and I went to Rich's in consequence of what she said, but found nothing there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go there with an officer - A. Yes, in the evening, and found a quantity of patent cord and fustians of different qualities, which appeared like my goods. I had lost such goods. Next day I went again with the officer, and found a great deal of pocketing, and the black glazed cotton - it was cut up in different quantities - I could not swear to it. I found some velveteen, which I knew to be my husband's. I am positive of part of it.</p>

Fifteen years; her father and my husband were acquainted, they are both tailors. The prisoner was not my servant, she attended the shop as a friend. I remember my husband making a charge against her.</p>
               <p>Q. And you said she was an innocent virtuous girl, and that he was drunk - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not your husband's creditors charged him and you with wasting their property in eating and drinking - A. Never. My husband was not addicted to drink, nor I, except in the medium way.</p>
               <p>Q. What do call the medium way - A. Taking a little porter at dinner, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the habit of pawning goods - A. Sometimes we pledged them until we could redeem them. We have pledged at Hill's, and at Lucock and Fryet's - I do not know Drakes's or Acton's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send the prisoner to pledge things for you - A. Yes. We have been in business nine or ten months. We have paid one creditor something.</p>
               <p>Q. Have any of your husband's creditors given him notice that they intend to oppose his getting out under the Insolvent Act - A. No.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Cloth-fair. On the 14th of April Barry came with the constable to my house, and took some property which I bought of the prisoner, who said she came from Mrs. Barry. I told them there was more, they came again next day, and took more things, all of which I got from the prisoner. I had sent my son several times to watch her when she brought things, and he watched her into Barry's shop, which is about twenty doors from my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Barry was in distress, and you thought they came from him - A. Yes. Ireland said to me,</p>
               <p>"I am more a man of the world than you are; I would have made away with the goods if I had been you." I told him I would not for my life.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. You was very ready to give up the goods - A. Yes. Ireland stopped with me on the Thursday - I asked him how the business was to be done? he said he took fees from both parties.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a great many things given me not to tell that I ever sold any goods out of the shop. She told me, if I confessed that I had sold any thing for them, she would tear my liver out, and I said I sold them, as I was afraid of her threats. Last Tuesday week I sold Rich eight yards of cotton for 6 s. - his son saw me give Mrs.

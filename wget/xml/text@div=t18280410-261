On the 28th of February, I went there about seven o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner in the court-yard with some lead lying at his feet; I caught hold of him, and he said "It is not me, a boy behind me has taken it;" I looked and saw another boy in his shirt sleeves; I secured the prisoner and the other got away - the prisoner then said there was another boy in the house, but in order to secure the prisoner, I took him to the next house; I then went back to the house - I found the bottom window open, but there was no one there; I went to the top of the house and found the attic window open: I afterwards went out and matched the lead which I had found in the court-yard, and it fitted exactly; there was about 20 lbs. weight of it - one boy could have carried it - the court-yard had been enclosed but the padlock had been forced off the gate; I had seen it only a night or two before.</p>

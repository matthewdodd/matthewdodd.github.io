               <p>Q. Where had you left those six guineas? - A. They were in a small box that was in a large one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked? - A. No; the other box was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them? - A. About the middle of the week before.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the key of the box? - A. Myself.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your box locked? - A. I had been out for four or five days; I never suffered any body in the room but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home did you find your room locked? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your box? - A. Locked the same as I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon missing your money? - A. I called in an officer of the parish, and had the prisoner apprehended; she was locked up all night; I told her I had missed my money, and she said she had never had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any alteration in her dress? - A. Yes, that was what I went by; she had a very mean dress before.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find her dressed when you came back? - A. She was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't know any thing about it? - A. No.</p>

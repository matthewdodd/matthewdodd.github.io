               <p>Court. Did he touch you? - He took hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>But not with violence? - I cannot say he did.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - About half after six, or a little better, when he first came up.</p>
               <p>He walked a great way with you? - From Old-street to Smithfield.</p>
               <p>A good many people were in the street at the time? - There was no watch.</p>
               <p>Where did he first meet with you? - In Moorfields, and from thence to Old-street, then to Smithfield.</p>
               <p>He kept close to you? - He swore he would not leave me without it; he offered no violence, farther than taking hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>What is Crank? - He is the person that took him.</p>
               <p>He committed no violence in Smithfield? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Council for the Prisoner. Where was the place you first met this man? - In Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, was not it in Bishopsgate-street? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>You did not go through Austin-friars together? - No, not to my knowledge, I was no ways in his company, nor knew any thing about it.</p>
               <p>There is a print-shop, where he stood behind the</p>
               <p>'Change, now recollect yourself? - I recollect very clearly he did not, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Then from Moorfields you walked into Old-street-road, behind St. Luke's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which way did you go to Smithfield? - We came back through Aldersgate-street, and then he would follow me into Bull and Mouth Street till we turned off, and we turned into Smithfield through one part of Little Britain; I was very much confused.</p>
               <p>How many hundred people did you meet in your way? - I met several, no doubt, and I thought making an alarm might be of consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080195"></xptr>What was you afraid of? - I was afraid of my person, he was a more active man than I.</p>
               <p>The shops were not shut? - I was afraid he would have done me some injury.</p>
               <p>What injury could he have done to you by calling people to your assistance? - I thought it was more prudent to let him go to where I was known, I did not apply to any person to take him into custody.</p>
               <p>When he told you his clothes were in pawn, did he tell you his name and where he lived? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>When you went into Smithfield, he waited for you? - Yes, and he came into the door after I had spoke to the man to assist me.</p>
               <p>What was it that he said; was you given charge of that night? - I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Did he give charge of you? - I believe he might after he was in custody, he charged me with nothing, not a word of any thing that night, the charge he made against me was before the sitting Alderman, after he was going to be committed.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it very strange, that a man should follow you through all these populous streets, and that he never once pulled out a pistol, or any one single thing to intimidate you? - So it was.</p>
               <p>When he was taken into custody, was he searched? - Yes, there were no arms.</p>
               <p>Then you did not tell him after he told you his situation, that you would relieve him? - I told him at last, being very much intimidated, that if I could borrow a guinea, I would relieve him? - I was going to Helmet-row, to Mr. Dobson, the Parish Clerk of St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>What part of Moorfields was you in when he stopped you? - The part next the Artillery-ground next the rails.</p>
               <p>Then you was not affraid to walk in a lonesome street? - I was obliged to walk, I could not lay down.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by laying down? - When he demanded this money, I was a good deal of this side Chiswell-street.</p>
               <p>Now sir, that night when you charged him with the watch; upon your oath, did not he charge the watch with you? - Never sir, till after the constable had come and got him in custody, and was taking him out of the door, he then said I charge you with that gentleman.</p>
               <p>How came you not five minutes ago, to say that he did not charge you at all? - That is a matter that did not strike me, I meant a charge against me for any crime, he said nothing about any crime.</p>
               <p>What did he tell the constable to take you into custody for, did not he charge you with a crime, or an attempt to commit a crime? - That I attempted to commit an unnatural crime upon him.</p>
               <p>And did not he that very night Mr. Swift, when you was taken into custody? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Take care what you say? - He did not, no sir, I bless God, I pay some regard to my word, and my oath, it certainly was not said for what the charge was made.</p>
               <p>Then you never heard for what the charge was made, till you came before the Magistrate? - Never.</p>
               <p>Court. You came from the Borough? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was going to a friend of yours in Old-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did you get into Moorfields? - It is the road I generally go, through Austin Friars, I went to spend two or three hours with my friend, he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go home again? - I intended to go round to Smithfield, as this man was with me, and intended to follow me.</p>
               <p>What carried you into Smithfield? - This man said he would follow me, and persisted in it, and I thought I would let him follow me.</p>
               <p>All London lay between Old-street, and the Borough, in the direct road home again? - I thought I would take him to where I was known.</p>
               <p>Smithfield was very much out of your way? - I often call there.</p>
               <p>Had you any intention of calling there that night? - I believe I had, I often call there of an evening.</p>
               <p>That is no answer to my question? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080196"></xptr> My particular view certainly was in taking the man there, as he was determined to follow me, I knew nobody between there and Old-street.</p>
               <p>Between six and seven at night, in the evening, all the houses were open, why did not you call for assistance? - I was fearful of the consequences.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, would you have this case go any further.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolton, one of the Jury. My Lord, we are all astonished the prosecutor did not call for assistance.</p>

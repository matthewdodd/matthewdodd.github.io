             was with him - the officers were at that time in the Green Man parlour, about sixty yards off, and they could see me; the prisoner said he had brought me three half-crowns - he had before asked what I should want, and I said three half-crowns; I gave him the same three shillings I had received of Gollocker - I had no other counterfeit money, or any money whatever, about me at the time; I returned to the officer in a very few minutes - I marked the half-crowns which I got from the prisoner, and gave them to Gollocker.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you first met the officer, on the 8th of January, had you any money about you? A. No, not any - I had only the three shillings which the officer gave me when I purchased, and when I returned I had only the three half-crowns; I did not see any other person on that day, till after I had bought the three half-crowns of the prisoner - I did afterwards, but I bought of this prisoner first; I had bought money of the prisoner before that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had you any more bad half-crowns in your pocket? A. No - I bought three of you, and three of Smith, but I did not have the whole six in my possession when I went back.</p>

            . I am a tobacconist, and was a constable for about ten years in Surrey, but I am not in office now; I have known Birt about two years and a half - he is a carpenter and joiner; I applied to him to assist me in detecting persons selling counterfeit coin - he agreed to act under my direction; he is a respectable man, as far as I know - I met him on the 8th of January; Gollocker was with me - I had heard there was to be a meeting with him and the prisoner; I searched Birt before he went to the prisoner, and gave Gollocker three shillings to give him, which he did in my presence - they were not marked, because it was not our intention to take him at that time; soon afterwards I saw the prisoner come with another man, and lean against a post by the burial-ground, opposite the Sessions'-house - Birt went out, and I saw the prisoner give him something in his hand I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170077"></xptr>kept my eye on him all the time - I then saw Birt return something to him; Birt then returned to us at the Green Man, and produced three half-crowns, which he marked, and gave to Gollocker, who gave them to me - I produce them; I then went out of the house - Birt followed me; he joined the prisoner, and as I went by I heard the prisoner say to him, "They are the same as the last, they are very good ones;" we did not take the prisoner then, as we had others to take, and we should have lost them if we had taken him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you searched Birt, he had no money, good nor bad? A. No, and when he came back he brought these three half-crowns, which he marked, and gave to Gollocker, who gave them to me; we had appointed Saturday, the 15th of January, to apprehend the prisoner, and I went with Hall and Gollocker to a house in the Almonry, at Westminster - the prisoner and another man were standing before the fire, and there was a woman on each side of them; the prisoner and the other man leaned forward over the fire - Hall seized the other man; the prisoner put his left hand over the fire, and put something in; I put in my hand, and took out eight base half-crowns - the prisoner made a little resistance, but I told him it was of no use, for if he did I would take his arm off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was any thing found on Birt? A. No, nothing but these three half-crowns - he dealt with Smith after he dealt with you, and then he came to us.</p>

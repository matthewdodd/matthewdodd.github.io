I said No; two came behind me, and caught me round the shoulders, and were going to take my rod and basket away; one of them pulled at it as hard as he could - they were all strangers. I called for the watchman, and one of them hit me three or four times on the right ear, and knocked me down, and as I was falling one of them knocked my hat off - my handkerchief was in it; they saw the watchman coming, and ran away; the watchman came up in five minutes; I do not know what became of my hat and handkerchief - I have not seen them since; it did not fall off my head - it was taken off by one of them, I am certain; I received a severe blow, which knocked me down, and I had three blows under my right car - I could not see who was of the party, for one of them got my head under his arm, and I received some blows then. I cannot say whether the prisoner was one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure the blows did not knock your hat off? A. No; it was taken off as I was falling; I received the blow before I lost my hat. Tuck and Cam were with me.</p>

            . I work with my father, at Mr. Adams' tile-kiln, Bagnigge-wells. I was with Singleton - seven or eight young men came up to him; they asked us, as we were going along, if we had any victuals; they were on the other side of the road - three or four came over at first, and then more followed; he said he had no victuals: two or three of them then said, "Let us go and see what the b-rs have got;" two or three got up, and crossed the road; one of them laid hold of Singleton's rod, and tried to get it from him, but he held it so tight they could not; they then began hitting him, and got his head twisted under one of their arms; one went behind him, and began hitting him in the forehead; he called for the watchman, and so did I; one of them, with a violent blow, knocked him down, and as he fell they took the hat off his head, I saw that done; as the watchman came along they all ran away. I swear that the prisoner is one of them; I cannot say whether he struck him, but he is the one who ran away with his hat - I cannot say who knocked him down, but one of them did. I saw the prisoner in custody about three weeks afterwards, and am sure he is the man who took the hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it dusk? A. It was rather darkish; there were ten or fifteen of them altogether; there might be more than fifteen - I swore to the prisoner directly I saw him; I cannot say whether he struck him; I could see him by the gas-light; they were all sitting by the side of the lamp; I could see them plainly.</p>

            . I live in Tysoe-street, Spa-fields, with my father, who is a cooper. I was going on this Sunday morning to fish, with Singleton; there were nine or twelve young men on the right hand side of Hare-street, opposite the second gas-lamp; one of them came out in the road, and asked if we had any victuals; Singleton said No, but he did not know how soon we might have some; he then asked if we had any tobacco - we said No: he said, "Let us go and see what they have got;" the prisoner then followed us, and caught hold of Singleton's basket and rod, and tried to pull it away; three or four more followed very quick, got his head under their arms, and hit him; we called Watch! and as the watchman was coming, one of them struck him, took his hat off, and ran away. I will not say who took off the hat, but the prisoner is the man who first spoke to him; I saw him three weeks afterwards, and swore to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe who run away with the hat? A. I cannot swear it was him who ran away with it; I should not know the man who ran away with it: the prisoner is the one who first spoke to us - I can swear it was not him who took the hat away; if any body has said so, he must be mistaken.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Sunday morning, the 5th of August, I was on duty in the neighbourhood; there was a cry of Watch! I was coming towards Hare-street, and ran towards the cry; when I came up I saw Singleton and the two witnesses, who complained of being robbed - I did not examine whether Singleton had a blow in the forehead - he did not complain of it; he was without his hat - I looked for it, but could find it no where - he complained of being robbed of it. I have often seen the prisoner in the neighbourhood; he has been about that beat for two years; I cannot say whether he lived in the neighbourhood, but have often seen him about Hare-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you looking after him at all? A. No; I did not look for the persons. I had not met several young men about that night; the prosecutor said they had ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen him about that night? A. No, I had not; it was rather darkish when I looked for the hat; my beat is in Hare-street, Fuller-street, and Church-row; I had been round my beat every hour.</p>

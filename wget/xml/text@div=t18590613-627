                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Sharpe, a pawnbroker of Deptford Broadway, immediately opposite the prosecutor's—on the evening of 19th May, I saw the prisoners loitering about—I was then called to take my tea in the front room first-floor, the window of which is exactly opposite the prosecutor's—I looked out and saw the prisoners together nearly 20 minutes before they attempted the robbery—Horton then took a piece of print from the door of Mr. Kennard's shop, and secreted it under her clothes—Jefferies was close by her side and I saw her distinctly screening her—Horton went away with the print, and Jefferies remained, but not two moments; she then turned towards High-street, Deptford, and I informed the police.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, in the Match-walk; my husband is in Greenwich-college. I saw the prosecutor in the prisoner's place about a fortnight ago; I saw him give her a parrot, some rupees, and some beads - he was very much intoxicated, and he told her that whatever she wished to have she might have, and that on the day he was paid, he would make her a handsome present; she was quite sober - she thanked him for what he gave her; he had two parrots, and I think this is the one he gave her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him make her a present of his trousers? A. No - his two boxes were brought in, but they were not locked; he did not tell her to take care of the parrot and the rupees - he gave them to her; I was not surprised at it, a gift is a gift - there was another person present; it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - her husband was not there at the time.</p>

            . My husband is a butcher, and lives in Middlesex-street, Whitechapel.

               <p>COURT. Q. Did not he tell her to take care of the beads and the silver pieces for him? A. No, Sir, he gave them to her when she said she was the mistress; he said,"Here is something I have got the give you," and he pulled them out and gave them to her - they were silver foreign money, and I think the beads were red, but I was in a hurry to get home.</p>

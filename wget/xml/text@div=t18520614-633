W. Richards")—our clerk, Sandeman, has the delivery of the lead—I gave him directions, and I know it was delivered to the carman, on account of Richards—I allowed it to go, because I believed the statements of Richards and Jones respecting the building Richards was carrying on; notwithstanding that, if the references had been unsatisfactory, I should not have allowed him to have the lead—if I had known the lead was going to be sold to some one else the same day, I would not have allowed him to have it—on 21st Feb. another order was sent amounting to about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 24th another order, on 3rd March another, and on 6th another; all dated from 182, High Holborn (<hi rend="italic">all produced</hi>)—on 8th March the account for the first lot became due, and I went with the account to 182, High Holborn; I did not see the prisoner, but he called the next day, the 9th, and stated that he understood from his man that there was three months' credit; and he took the letter, which I had written him, out of his pocket, for the purpose of proving that it was sold on three months' credit; and after he had read it, he said there must be some mistake about the terms, and that it did not make much difference to him whether he paid cash or not, and he would call the next day, at the same time, and pay for it—he did not call, and I did not see him again till he was apprehended—I received this letter from him on 11th (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. Home. Sir,—I shall not be able to reach you to-day, and shall feel obliged by your calling to-morrow morning at 11 o'clock, and bringing the accounts with you for the other two parcels. Wm.

                  </hi>. I am a lead merchant in the Hackney-road, and also in the Dover-road. The prisoner called on me on 6th March, and I bargained with him for some lead—I bargained first with a Mr. Milner I had known some years, and afterwards Richards called for the cash, and I paid him—the lead had then been delivered a few minutes—Milner carried on a business for me once, but I only know him by his coming at various times lately—when I paid the prisoner, he signed this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I paid bim 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account on 6th March; 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 11th March; and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 19th; and a stamped receipt for 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was to have been sent—the signature appears to have been altered.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner—on 14th Feb. he signed a document, "Charles James Richards," in my presence—these "Newmarket handicap" cards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), signed Charles James Richards, are in his writ<lb></lb>ing—he is not an ale and stout dealer at Westminster-bridge; the house belongs to me—he came to me and engaged a room to carry on a belting list in horses:—he was there five or six races, and paid <hi rend="italic">over</hi> several, everybody</p>

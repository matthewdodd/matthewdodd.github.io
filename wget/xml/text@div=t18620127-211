                  </hi>. I keep the Light Horse public-house, at Hounslow—on Thursday, 16th January, I returned home about twenty minutes before 2 in the morning—before going to bed I looked round the house and saw that all was safe—I was called up a little after 4, and discovered that the parlour window was open, and the back door—I lighted the gas, and found the bar open, and missed some rum and whiskey, a quantity of pickwicks, and a box of cigars—a quarter of a pint of gin and a pint of rum was put all ready to be taken away—I can't say how much spirits was taken—there had been about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the till; that was all taken—amongst the copper I lost there was a penny and a halfpenny that I had put in that night after I came home, and there was also a fourpenny piece with a hole in it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some money produced by the policeman</hi>) here is the penny and halfpenny that I put in my till at 3 o'clock that morning—the fourpenny-piece is not here—these cigars (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are similar to those I missed—these two sticks were in the bar when I came down.</p>

I live at Mr. Britnell's, and assist in the business—on the night previous to the robbery I was serving in the bar, and saw the three prisoners there together—they were there at 12 o'clock—they left at that time, and came in two or three minutes after 12, and they left together at that time—they were the last persons in the house—they did not purchase any cigars there, or have any spirits to drink—they drank beer—Notley and Perry had sticks with them like these—this is the stick Notley had, and this is the one Perry had twisting round his finger in the room—when they left at 12 o'clock they took their sticks away with them—I am sure they did not leave them behind.</p>

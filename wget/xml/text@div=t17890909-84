               <p>I am a pawn-broker's servant, in Berwick-street; the prisoner pawned the articles in the indictment; I knew her before; Mrs. Brodie claimed them as hers; I have kept them ever since; three of the articles I took in of the prisoner; a set of flowered cotton furniture, a cotton counterpane, three cotton window curtains, a bed, one pillow, and a blanket; I am certain it was the prisoner; I have known her several years; I gave her duplicates; the cotton furniture and counterpane, was the 22d of June; the three cotton window curtains some time in March; the bed, pillow, and blanket, the 2d of July.</p>

               <p>The agreement read, being for one year certain, without reserving any room to the Prosecutrix.</p>

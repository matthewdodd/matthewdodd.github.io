                  </hi>. I am barman at the Barley Mow, in Drury-lane On Wednesday, 24th Jan., the prisoner came between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening—I served him some gin—he paid me for several half quarterns—he then had half a pint, and threw down a bad half crown—I took it, and broke it; it was broken by several other persons, and thrown in the fire—I saw the pieces melt—I think the prisoner paid for the gin with a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—he ran out of the door—I sent two men to follow him—I did not see him again that night.</p>

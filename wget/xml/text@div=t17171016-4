William Thompson confirmed what the other said, adding that he being upon the Wall they threw Bricks at him; cut at him with the Hanger, and endeavoured with a Bar to knock him off, and he heard them cry, Damn him, cut him to pieces, shoot him; that he slipping down from the Wall, they took him rising and met him in the Breast; that the Slugs were still in his Body; that he could not swear directly that it was Murth, but that it was the least of the two; which Description answer'd to Murth's Stature. Several of these Circumstances were confirmed by other Evidences. They added likewise, that Wood did endeavour to fire, but his Pistol would not go off. Wood confessed the same at his Apprehension and before the Justice, affirming that Murth shot Thompson. The Constable that apprehended, Murth deposed, that when he took him in Shoreditch, Murth did not, deny the Fact, but he telling him he  the Man who was shot was dead, Murth rep had a good Friend that had assured him  before that he was not. Two other Evidences that assisted in carrying him to Newgate, deposed, that he owned he shot Thompson, and said he was very sorry that he had done it, but confessed that he had three loaden Pistols besides what he had fired and that he would have discharg'd them all before he would have been taken.

The Court reply'd, that it was indeed a very allowable Action to borrow a Bible, and a good one to read in so good a Book, but it was a bad Action to steal it.

                  </hi>. I live at Prospect-place, Islington. On the night of the 8th of Nov. I was at the Rainbow public-house, Islington, taking bread and cheese with a friend—the prisoner came and talked with us—I said we were a private party, and we did not want him—he said he was a policeman—I said I did not believe it—I called for more to drink—the pri<lb></lb>soner called the landlord round, and said something to him—I said, "I don't believe he is a policeman"—he seized me, and pretended to get a staff out—he said he would get me to the station if I did not mind—I thought I would stay till the others were gone—he came and ordered me out—he took me out—I got from his grasp—he loosened my waistcoat, and tore the two top buttons off; then he said, "You shall go to the station"—the policeman came up, and said he would take us all to the station—the prisoner got away—I went to get my things up, and my watch had been cut from the guard, and the watch gone—I went up John-street, and the prisoner met us—I said, "This is the man"—he denied having been in our company—the policeman took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the house—there was a struggle—the prisoner represented himself as a policeman, and offered to bet me half-a-crown that he was one—I found the watch in the prisoner's hand, but still the guard was round, the prosecutor's neck, and the watch was attached to it.</p>

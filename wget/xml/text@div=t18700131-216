                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Evans, of 21, Litch field Street, Soho—on 7th January, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, I was in a street down City Road way, alone—I had been out all day, taking home work, and had had nothing, and went into a public-house for a glass of ale—I was alone—I saw the prisoner there, with another man, and asked them if they would show me the way into Oxford Street, as I was a stranger in London—they said, "Yes," and we came out—they showed me the way, and I went on, and did not know anybody was behind me, till I was thrown down on my face, and one man held me down, while the other pulled my waterproof cloak off—I caught the prisoner round the neck; but he undid his scarf, and got away, leaving it in my hand—I screamed as loud as I could—it must have been the prisoner who struck me on the back of my head, and knocked me down, because I caught bold of the coat of the person who struck me, and turned round as soon as I could and caught him by the throat—a witness saw him running, and put out his foot and knocked him over, and a policeman took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and was in Goswell Street, and heard cries of "Police!" and "Help!"—I ran up, and saw the prisoner struggling with Mrs. Evans—he managed to get away, and a young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> put his leg out and threw him—I caught him, and detained him till the police came.</p>

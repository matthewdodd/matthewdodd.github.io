               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Bloomfeild. On Thursday the 18th of April about nine o'clock at night, this woman came in and asked Mr. Bloomfeild to shew her some muslin. Mr. Bloomfeild asked her to step backward, I being there asked her what kind of muslin she would have? she said the same as she had before; I immediately turned round to get it and I heard a kind of rustling noise, and I got the print and put it on the counter, and I then saw this muslin under her arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this muslin in a wrapper? - No, it was quite a different muslin to what I reached down; I immediately took hold of her arm, and laid hold of the muslin that was under her arm, and Mr. Bloomfeild saw me talking to her and he came up, the constable has got the muslin now, before I delivered it to the constable I put our private mark on it besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say where it was laying before she took it up? - I cannot say where it was laying.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say what time she took it up? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shopmen had you at home that day? - There was another besides my master and me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bloomfeild. It is mine, it has my private mark on the corner, I am not able to say it is my hand writing, but it is one of my mens.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the hand writing? - It is my mark, I had been shewing the same piece not half an hour before to a customer, and it was all unfolded when she took it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to the shop in the morning to purchase some muslin for which I paid ten shillings; I went back in the evening for some of the same sort, but before that I had been drinking, and not being accustomed to drink, I did not know what I did, I was not sensible of whatever I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bloomfeild. I believe my lord she was in liquor a good deal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was so much in liquor I did not know the shop.</p>
               <p>Court to Porter. When you took it from her did she say any thing? - She denied it, I took it from her and I jumped over the counter and set her down in the middle of the shop, and she denied taking it immediately when I took it from her.</p>
               <p>Q. It was under her cloak you say and under her arm? - It was.</p>
               <p>Court to Bloomfeild. What is the muslin worth? - Thirty-five shillings at prime cost.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave her a good character.</p>

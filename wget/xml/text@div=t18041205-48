               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner? - A. Asleep in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had all your money safe when you went to bed; were you sober? - A. I was sober enough to see what I had in my pocket, and the watchman saw it too; I had a seven-shilling piece, a dollar, a half-crown, four shillings, and two sixpences; when I went to bed it was in my waistcoat pocket; I awoke about a quarter past six in the morning; I felt in my pocket and it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Any other man slept in the bed with you? - A. Yes, one; and two other men slept in the other bed; my pocket-book was searched all over; there was a pound note in my pocket-book; it was gone; I could not swear to the number of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Any mark on your money so as you should know it again? - A. No; the prisoner came in there on Saturday about half an hour after I was there; the mistress of the house charged him with taking it; he denied it; he denied it at Shadwell Office, and it was found on him when he was searched.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BURTON sworn. - I am a seaman; I was bed-fellow to this man that lost the money; my landlord waked me, and asked me if I would let this man lay down by the side of me; the prisoner came along side of my bed, feeling about; I said, who is that; he said, Peter; I asked him two or three times, before he gave me any answer.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050056"></xptr>Q. When did you hear that the prosecutor had lost any money? - A. At twelve o'clock in the day, on Saturday; then I told my landlady what I had heard in the night he was there; he said he had no money at all about him; he was taken up and carried to the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person besides you, the prosecutor, and the prisoner, that slept in the room that night? - A. Yes, one; he is not here; he is a seaman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lodging-room locked that night? - A. It was not.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman; the prosecutor came to me between one and two in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see when he went to bed whether he was sober? - A. He was rather fresh; when I met with him first the parish watchman was with me, and he offered us something to drink; he turned his money from one hand to another; we counted it, 19 s. 6 d. I led him home to my own door; I am very positive he did not lose his money by the way; I lighted him up stairs, and saw him into bed; when I called him up in the morning, between six and seven o'clock, he told me he had lost his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner gone? - A. Yes; the prisoner came in the afternoon of the 10th; I was in bed; I got up when I heard he was there; he said he had none of the man's money; I went with him to the Office; he still persisted in having none of the man's money; I saw him searched; there were 26 s. and odd money found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there a seven-shilling piece, a dollar, and half-crown, found upon the prisoner? - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there were no marks on those pieces? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am an Officer of Shadwell: On Saturday, the 10th of November, I took the prisoner into custody to the Office; I asked him at the Office if he had any money about him; he said, no, only a few halfpence; I searched him, and in his waistcoat pocket, under a Dantzick waistcoat, I found three halfpence and a penny piece in copper; in his breeches pocket I found, wrapped up in a piece of paper, one seven-shilling piece, a dollar, and two shillings; I searched farther, and found in a small red pocket-book a discharge and a pension-ticket, 3 s. in silver, and two sixpences, in a parcel; I asked him how he came by them; he said he was a lumper, and he got them all from Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Scott lives by you? - A. Yes, I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The man that I lodge with is a watchman; after I had a drink of beer, I went home and went to bed, and after I was in bed he brought up this captain's mate of a West Indiaman, and put him into bed along with the sailor; there was neither lock nor key on the door; the captain's mate, the sailor, and likewise a waggoner, slept together; when I awoke, I wanted to make water; I felt about my bed, and there was no chamber-pot there; so I went to the sailor's bed, and felt all about for it; who's that? said the sailor; I said, it is Peter; he said, what do you want? I said, I want to make water; after that, I returned to my bed again; in a little while after that the sailor came out of his bed, Peter, said he, the captain's mate has p - d all over me, I will thank you to let me lay alongside of you till morning, and in the morning, when I awoke, the sailor was gone away from me; the time came for me to go to work on board the ship; I got up, and told my landlady she was much to blame to take a strange man in liquor into her house; I went on board my own ship, and on Saturday I was taken up for the robbery; the mistress of the house said, you had better own to the robbery; I said, I cannot own to it, I did not do it; they took me to the Justice and overhauled me; they took my discharge from a man of war and my pension-ticket; my friends are all on board his Majesty's ships of war up the Mediterranean.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Wood-street, and am a warehouseman. On the afternoon of the 22nd of April, I was at the door of my house, opposite Mr. Roberts's—I saw the male prisoner, who was in his service, come down the warehouse stairs into the street, and cross the street with two parcels of ribbon under his arm—I suspected him, and followed him into Bull's Head-passage, about twelve yards from the door—at the top of that court is a bend which comes into St. Alban's-court; in that bend I saw him give the goods to the female prisoner, who put them under her shawl, and instantly said, "I shall see you to-night"—he said "Yes;" and away he went—I followed her through Falcon-square, down Hart-street, to London-wall—she then ran—I believe she saw me, as she turned round—I followed, and took her in Milton-street, with the goods on her—I put her into a baker's shop, and sent the baker for a constable, who took her into custody—the place where Wiles gave her the goods was not in sight of the warehouse at all—she could not see it where she was—I had not seen her before.</p>

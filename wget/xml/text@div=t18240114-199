On the 15th of December, I was in the back parlour; two officers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140069"></xptr>brought the prisoners into my shop, and asked if I had any thing; I looked and thought I missed a handkerchief; they said they saw them take them out of the window; I do not know when I put it there; a pane of glass was broken, the handkerchief is not here.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoners about this shop a little before nine o'clock in the evening, on the 15th of December, standing together - Wells's arm was in the window, through a hole. I walked a few paces, then saw him take the handkerchief from the window and give it to Davis. I took Wells, and took him into the shop. Phillips said she had lost a handkerchief, and produced the piece it was cut from. Davis ran away with it. Gook brought him into the shop soon after, but the handkerchief was not found.</p>

            . On the night in question I observed the prisoners close against this window - we watched them, and saw Buckland try to take hold of one of them. Davis ran about three hundred yards - I attempted to pursue, and was knocked down in the road. I saw him throw something away at the corner of Moore-street. I was knocked down, and Ewer took him.</p>

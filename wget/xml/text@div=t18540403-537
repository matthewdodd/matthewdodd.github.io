                  </hi>. I am a farmer, of Hayes. Shepherd was my servant, and had access to the stable in which the oats were kept, but not to where the beans were kept—on Saturday, 1st March, I missed about a bushel and a half of beans, and the same quantity of oats; they were worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. without the sack—I have seen the oats produced, and have every reason to believe they are mine, they are of the same description—there are Poland oats mixed with them, and it is very uncommon to mix Poland oats—here is a sample of my oats which contains black oats—this sack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one I bought some oats in a fortnight or three weeks ago; it is not mine, but I know it by a mark on it—it was in my possession a short time before this took place—I know Redworth by sight, he is ostler at the White Hart, which is thirty yards or rather more from my place—these beans (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are exactly similar to others I have, they are Suffolk ticks—the sample and the bulk agree; I have several sacks left—I believe them to be mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of Mr. Worsley's servants, I know both the prisoners. On Saturday, 1st April, I and Shepherd were going by the White Hart Inn, at Hayes, with two dung carts; Shepherd was driving, and Red-worth, who is ostler at the White Hart, took a sack with something in it out of the end of Shepherd's cart and carried it into the stable of the White Hart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it a sack your master had had some oats in a fortnight before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say, I did not take notice of the name on it—I was not nigh it—I do not know whether this produced is it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, be careful; on your solemn oath did not you sell the beans to the ostler, and have 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I never spoke two words to him, I am quite a stranger to him—I have been in Mr. Worsley's service about a fortnight—I lived in Buckinghamshire before that.</p>

               <p>here if I had a mind"—I did not get into the barn—I did not take a bushel of beans out of one sack and half a bushel from another, I could not see any—I did not follow you behind, I went first—I was not fifty yards behind—I did not go to the White Hart door—the ostler did not come out to me; I never spoke to him—I did not sell him the corn or shoot the sacks—I did not put the sacks out of the cart; you have said what you did your<lb></lb>self—I did not sell him the corn—he did not give me a halfpenny.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you see the sack of beans first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When they were taken out of the hind part of the dung cart, at the White Hart—there was nothing in the dung cart except that—both the sacks were empty; we were going to master's house for a load of dung—we had been up at the field and unloaded—I had not seen the beans till we came to the White Hart—he had his cart and I had mine—we took a load of dung to the field, and were returning—I saw his cart before we got from the field, but I was not near it—I saw the outside of it when we unloaded, but not the inside—I swear I never saw it in his cart—I was riding on my foremost horse when I first saw it—I am thirty-two years old, I think.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statements before the Magistrate were here read, as follows:</hi> "Redworth says, 'William Butler and Shepherd came together to the White Hart, and asked me if I would buy any beans or oats; I gave Butler 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the beans, and I gave Shepherd 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the oats; I was not aware that the oats were stolen; they told me that the coachman gave them to them.'

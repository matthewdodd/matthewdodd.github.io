            . Q. What are you - A. I do not follow any business particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose this pocket book - A. On the 17th of May; I went to the Swan in Rosemary lane for a cart to take a load of goods to my house; I was directed to Mr. Bolton's in Whitechapel; I met the prisoner Wheeler near the end of Essex street, Whitechapel; we went up Essex street together.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and her - A. She said would I give her something to drink; I went into her apartment in <placeName id="t18080601-62-crimeloc353">Essex street</placeName>

               <p>Q. I do not understand you - you felt a hustling that is with a number of persons, here was only one - what time of the day was this - A. Soon after one o'clock; coming by Aldgate I took out my pocket book to look for a direction, I returned it into my pocket again; I do not know whether I felt it after that or no.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up in the room, you staid some time there I suppose - A. A very short time; when I missed my pocket book I asked her for it; she said she had not got it, and called out murder, when the prisoner White and a number of other persons rushed into the room; I thought myself in danger, I let the prisoner Wheeler go; White said if you give me a shilling I will tell you were she is gone, and I will endeavour to procure the book for you; I gave her a shilling, and then a second, and then a third, and a fourth, and then I found it was a trick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. You live at Barking in Essex - How many does your family consist of -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010049"></xptr>A. No one but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You were quite sober - A. I think I was, I had drank a pint of ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober, or as they call sober in Barking - A. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go to her apartment to look for a cart - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The last time you saw your pocket book was at Aldgate - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from Aldgate to Essex street - A. About a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. You passed a great many of his Majesty's subjects from Aldgate to Essex street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether any of them took it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it never found - A. No.</p>

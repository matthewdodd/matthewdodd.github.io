            . I am an old clothesman; about the seventh of December the prisoner over-took me coming down Ludgate-hill, and asked me if I would buy a coat and waistcoat that he had to sell; he said they were in pawn, and belonged to an acquaintance of his lying sick, and he could not redeem them, and if I would go with him and give more than they lay for, I should have them; I went with him to a pawnbroker's in Fleet-market; he desired the pawnbroker to let me see the clothes, the pawnbroker would not let me have fight of them till I paid for them; we could not agree for them; we walked out, and towards Holbourn-hill he said there was an acquaintance in Monmouth-street would give me the value for them; I bought them for 18 s. I put down a guinea on the counter, he gave me a 5 s. 3 d. piece; we went to a public-house and I changed it, and gave him his change; then I went to a pawnbroker in Fleet-street, and pawned them for 14 s. when I went to take them out, he said they belonged to the prosecutor, and told me where he lived; I went to him, he took me to Tothill-fields Bridewell; there I picked the prisoner out, and swore to him that I bought them of him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner has been out of bread, and had nothing valuable in his chest; I have chiefly supported him lately; I think it was poverty, rather than a bad wicked heart that drove him to it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

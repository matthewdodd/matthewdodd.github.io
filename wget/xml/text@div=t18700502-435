                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Cooper, one of the messengers of the Court of Bankruptcy—on 18th July, last year, by Mr. Cooper's direction, I went to the bankrupt's premises, in Kennington Road, and took possession of them, and remained there until the 28th August—I slept on the premises—I remained after the adjudication, I was de<lb></lb>puted by the official assignee to keep possession on behalf of the trade assignee—I remained there till after the sale, which took place, I think, on Thursday, 26th August, and on the Saturday, two days after that, I left—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187005020084"></xptr>
               <p>Homewood, who is in the employment of Mr. Cutten, the auctioneer, lotted the goods—one of his clerks had previously made out the inventory—during the time I was there, I saw the bankrupt most days on the premises—his son was there as often, they generally came together in the morning, most days—the goods were to be delivered to the purchasers at the sale, on the Friday and Saturday—they were not all removed—I left the premises on the Satur<lb></lb>day, about 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening; every person who was on the premises left with me, we all left together, Homewood was one of them—I locked the door and had the key, no one was left on the premises to my knowledge—a short time after I left, I remembered that I had left a coat behind me, I went back in about fifteen or twenty minutes; Mr. Barker, the prisoner's clerk, went bock with me; I unlocked the door and he went in with me—I found my coat there, and I found the bankrupt there with two men, who I did not know—I said I was very much surprised to find them on the pre<lb></lb>mises, but it was so suddenly done; in opening the door seven or eight other men came in within a minute or so, and that may account for my not recognizing the faces of each, but Mr. Weston had certainly two men with him; I know most of them, Homewood was one, and three others of Mr. Cutten's men—they were persons who had been engaged previously in con<lb></lb>nexion with the sale—some conversation took place with regard to these persons Inung there, Homewood ordered me, according to my instructions, to lock them out—Mr. Weston would not go, he said "No.! I have got pos<lb></lb>session here, and I will not go out"—I said I thought it would be prudent for him to do so—he said "No; I shall not"—I said "Do you object to leave the premises?"—he said "I do; I will not go out"—I said "As you will not go out, as I am in duty bound I must look you in, according to my instructions," and I did, and we all came out with the exception of the bank<lb></lb>rupt and hid two or three men—I locked the door and left them in—those men were none of our party—I went there again on the Monday but could not get in—I tried to unlock the door, Homewood was with me and Mr. Cutten's men—I unlocked the door, but it was bolted inside, and therefore we could not get admission—I did not see or hear anybody inside—I re<lb></lb>mained there till 6 o'clock in the afternoon, and just before I left I again tried to got in—I reported the circumstances, and on the Tuesday gave up the keys to Mr. Cutten—I did not go there afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who sent you in possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Cooper, the messenger of the Bankruptcy Court—I did not see Mr. Philip, the trade assignee; I never saw him till he was pointed out to mo in Court this morning—I do not know Mr. Evans, the solicitor to the assignee—I do not know Israel Cohen—according to the subpesna I have received, I should presume Messrs. Evans &amp; Laing are the prosecutors in this case; they are the attorneys; I don't know for whom they are attorneys—I went in on the day of the adjudication—I did not take an inventory, Tindal, Mr. Cutton's clerk, did; I don't know on what day, I think it was about ten days after the abdication—I allowed things to be removed while I was there, because we were carrying on the trade for a few days, and the things that were purchased were delivered; I allowed nothing else to be taken away—Mr. Weston carried on the business, sanctioned by the official assignee—I slept there the whole of the time—Mr. Homewood prepared the catalogue—on the 28th, when I locked the door and went away, it was about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before I came back—we had boon to the Tankard public house, to have a glass of ale, with the bankrupt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187005020085"></xptr>
               <p>and others—when I opened the door, the others came in—I had been to the Tankard before—very likely I was there with young Weston on the morning of the sale—I have no doubt Homewood was there—I did not say to young Weston there "Now, if you want to do yourself and good, you must make it all right with Homewood, for he can put a good deal in your way;" I never made any such remark, nothing of the kind—I did not hear Homewood say "Yes, youngster, there are a lot of goods not down in the catalogue, and if you will make two or three of us right for about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., we will put about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into your pocket"—I have heard that there were things not in the catalogue, but I did not know it—young Weston did not say to me, or in my presence, "I should not like to do any such thing"—I don't recollect having any conversation with young Weston at the public-house—I did not afterwards go up to the defendant, on his own premises, and say "I can't talk to your son, he does not know enough of the world," nothing of the kind; nor did I add "Look here, if you want to do yourself any good, it is no use being obstinate, you shall have about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in stuff for a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I never knew there was any stuff at all, beyond that which was in the inventory—I did not say "There was not time to get it in the catalogue, so there is a chance for you"—I was told, about a week after I had left the premises, by Messrs. Cutten's people, that they had broken in and found about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property—the prisoner did not say to me "Don't speak to me like that, sir, I will not have one pennyworth;" nor did I say "You are a great fool"—a man named Curtis was in possession on behalf of the mortgagees—I don't know when he came into possession, I think about two or throe days before the sale—he was one of the persons that I locked out, and who I locked in afterwards; I was instructed to lock him out, and I acted upon those instructions; he walked out, like the rest, to get a glass of ale—I did not invite him to do so; I don't know who did, no doubt somebody did, because he had no money himself to drink with—I did not, before that, get Curtis to help me down stairs with a box and place it under the stairs; I had nothing to do with putting a box under the stairs; I did not give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for helping me to do so—Homewood had two black bags there; I don't know the contents of them—I saw those bags, on the Saturday, in a small recess in the store-room, a sort of pigeon-hole—I did not see inside them, they were locked—I did not see Home<lb></lb>wood put anything into them—I had not the least idea they contained glass drops, or prisms, or anything of that sort—I do not always act with Homewood—I have been in the Court twenty years, and never met him above three times in any possession where I have been.</p>

I live at 8, Cross Street, Islington—I am occasion<lb></lb>ally employed by Mr. Cutten—he has auction rooms at 8, Cross Street, and the second sale took place there—I was instructed by Mr. Cutten to lot the goods—the first day I went to the premises, 113, Kennington Road, was on 23rd August, I found Newman there—I had to prepare the stock for sale; I did so; it took me two days and part of the next; I lotted the goods—amongst other things that I lotted for the first sale, there were glass chandeliers, some were perfect and some imperfect, some had no burners,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187005020086"></xptr>
               <p>and some had only part drops on them, some had not half the quantity—some of those that were afterwards found concealed on the premises were of the same description as those on the imperfect chandeliers; there were so many chandeliers, some might have been of the same description, and some not; they would be used for the same purpose—I saw the bankrupt there every day, and sometimes two or three times a day—my attention was not called to the trough; of course I lotted it, it was named in the cata<lb></lb>logue—I did not notice the furnace baths, they were not in the catalogue, they were fixtures—I included in the catalogue all the stock that was drawn to my notice, it included some of the goods that I afterwards found con<lb></lb>cealed—the sale took place on the 26th, I was there every day from 23rd to 28th—after the sale the lots were delivered to the purchasers, according to the catalogue—some of the lots were unclaimed by the Saturday night, Mr. Cutten gave an extra day on account of the Jews, it being their Sabbath—I found out in the delivery that in some instances there were larger quantities of goods in the lots than were specified in the catalogue—in those cases I delivered according to catalogue, and kept the others back—I left about 7 o'clock, or 7.30, on the Saturday evening—I saw the messenger leave, he locked the premises and held the keys—I went back in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and found the messenger there, Mr. Weston, his son, and two or three other men—I asked them how they came in; they said they had been let in by the messenger—I said it was false, they must have got in the back way—they said they held possession, and we had no right there—I persuaded the messenger to obey his orders, and lock up the premises, and that was done—I went back on the Monday and found the premises all locked up, I could get no admittance; and again on Tuesday; I did not go again till I got authority from the trade assignee on 6th September; I then took four men with me, and directed them to break down one of the shutters, and so effected an entry—I found the iron bed of a lathe laid across the two inner doors, and a heavy upright of wood about 4 in. square stood against the bolts of the door to prevent their being forced—I then went on delivering the goods to the pur<lb></lb>chasers under the sale; that same morning one of my men drew my attention to some brass work in the trough; that was the first intimation I had that there was any property that had not been put in the catalogue; I went to the trough, and saw twenty-one ingots of brass, weighing 116lbs., covered over with sand; a large copper pan was found in the same place, full of brass work and glass work; the brass was finished work, about from 14lbs., to 19lbs.—there were glass drops loose in the sand, enough to make up five or six parcels—on finding these things, I gave orders for a general search; and on the Tuesday my attention was drawn to some solution found in the carpenter's shop, in the dung; I did not see it found, the men dug out three bottles of it, one they broke in digging it out—on the Wednesday my attention was drawn to a floor board being loose in the casting shop, one of the men trod on it and it flew up with him, we got a candle and found some parcels, of which I made a memorandum at the time—(<hi rend="italic">referring</hi>) I see this was on the same day that I found the solution, not on the Wednesday—this memorandum contains the particulars of all—on Monday I found under the sand fifty parcels of glass drops, and cut knobs—on the 7th, in the ash hole, I found eleven parcels of drops, chains, and cut knobs, nine ditto in furnace hole, and thirty-nine under the foundry floor; and on Wednesday the 8th I found in an iron stove four iron standards with brass</p>

               <p>tops—I saw one of Weston's glass cutters taking something away from the premises, I followed him, and found him in a milk shop, concealing four glass cut under dishes, which I had previously seen in the glass-cutting shop; they had been included in the first sale, and not cleared—whilst this search was going on I saw the bankrupt on the premises two or three times, he was rather excitable now and then, that was all; he threatened to knock my brains out once; the goods I have described were afterwards removed to Cross Street, and I prepared a second catalogue for sale, including the con<lb></lb>cealed and uncleared goods, they are included in lots 33, 34, 35, 40, 41, 46, 47, 49, 54, 55, and 73—I have my tool bags here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) these are the bags I always carry my tools in, with my apron, cap, and so on—when I left the premises on Saturday, 28th August, I had my tools in them, and some loose drops that had fallen out of the packages in the different holes, I swept them into one of the bags.</p>

               <p>Street, Bedford Row—I was employed in this bankruptcy—Mr. Philps, the creditor's assignee, is not a creditor—it was the desire of the creditors, at the choice of assignees, that some person should be employed who would give attention to this particular case—the largest creditors were Messrs. Cohen, clients of mine, and the elder of the firm being very unwell, could not give his attention to it; they were creditors for a judgment of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the costs of a Chancery suit—there were other creditors as well, and Mr. Philps was selected, being known as a respectable man, and living in the neighbourhood; and it is not necessary under the Act of Parliament that an assignee should be a creditor—I have been attending to the matter from that time up to the present—the only assets that have come to the estate have been received from Mr. Cutten, the sales that have been given in evi<lb></lb>dence to-day, roundly, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know all about the lease, the prisoner's son has it—at the very time the bankrupt filed the account, returning it as an asset at 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the son had bought it at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the mortgagees—it is on the proceedings, in the account filed under the Act of Parliament for the ten days' account—we have never had the chance of accepting the lease, became the son had purchased it by auction long before I had seen the accounts disclosing it—I was present when Blanchard was examined in the Bank<lb></lb>ruptcy Court, and when his examination was concluded the bankrupt said everything was perfectly true, and he afterwards added he should have to implicate six or seven other persons besides himself—Mr. Doyle, his counsel, advised him to hold his tongue—no questions were put to him after that—I know nothing of Curtis, except that he distrained for rent, and, by my advice, he was paid out instantly, as we could not clear the lots until the landlord was paid—I never heard of any demand of a right to go into the premises on 28th August—I got an order from the Court to enter them—it was under the original order which we obtained in July.</p>

I hare lived either at my father's or at my own home all my life; that is true—I have lived in a school, not the British School at Lambeth, at the other side of Batter<lb></lb>sea—I am twenty-seven years of age—I am my father's eldest son, he is a gasfitter; when I was a lad about eleven or twelve I got into trouble once, and was convicted summarily before a Magistrate for stealing, only once—I know that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Capt. Layland</hi>) he is the governor of the Reforma<lb></lb>tory—I could not say how long I was in the Reformatory, I was in gaol three months before I went there; I was convicted at Lambeth—I dare say I might have been something like twelve months in the Reformatory—I may have told Captain Layland that I had been a very bad boy, and had stolen many things, such as apples from greengrocers' shops; I have arrived at manhood now, and have forgotten all those frivolous things—I can satisfy you of my respectability since; I have never been in trouble since I left the Reformatory.</p>

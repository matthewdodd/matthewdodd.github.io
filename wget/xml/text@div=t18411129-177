                  </hi>. I am toll-collector at the Duncan-street bar, Islington, and live in White Lion-street—I have known the prisoner about five years. On the night of the 2nd of November, about seven o'clock, he went into the bar-house with me—I was rather sleepy—when I awoke I missed two sovereigns and a half from my pocket—it was in a tobacco<lb></lb>box—I found the box in my left-hand breast-pocket, which was a different pocket, and the money gone—it was in a leather bag, and a piece of paper as well—I am sure it was safe in my pocket between six and seven—the prisoner sat by my side while I was dosing—I had no light there when I missed it—he said, "I think you had better wait four or five days, and then you will see the boy with a new suit of clothes"—meaning a boy who was with me about five—but my money was safe after that boy was gone—the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184111290147"></xptr>
               <p>went away soon after, and returned in about a quarter of an hour, then went away, and I did not see him again—I left the bar at nine, met a constable I about eleven, and went with him to the prisoner—I did not see him hand any thing to his sister—the constable showed me a handkerchief—I did not see him give it to any body—if I have said so, it is not true—if I have said I saw the constable take the handkerchief from her hand, it is not true—I saw it after he took it away from the sister, and he put it into his pocket—I did not see the prisoner give it to his sister—the prisoner was taken to the station—the handkerchief being opened, two sovereigns and a half were found in it, such coin as I had lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. About half-past six o'clock I was coming by, and a boy who was often about there, said, "You can come and sit with me, as I have nobody here;" in a short time he said I had better go away for fear the master of the toll-box should come and find me there; I left, and when I came back he said he had lost his money, and suspected two boys who had been there; I said, "You had better look about and see if you have got it, and you had better search me." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He went away while I was asleep, and when he came back, I felt about his clothes, but could not find it, but he had been away before that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He told me to pull off my boots to see if it was there—he said, "Don't tell any body that I have lost it, for nobody knows I have got it," and when at night he came and took me out of bed, the constable had the money in his hand, but I never saw It at all.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 101.) The prosecutor spoke to me, and I went with him and took the prisoner—he denied the charge—while I was coming down stairs I saw a female, who I believe was his sister, on the stairs—I was first, the prisoner next, and the sister behind him—I saw him at the bottom of the stairs, put his hand behind him, and the sister was behind him—I saw her take something from his hand—I seized her hand, and took a handkerchief from her with two sovereigns and a half in it, rolled up in paper—when he saw me find it, he denied having had it—I am quite certain be banded it to his sister—I seized her hand imme<lb></lb>diately before it got out of my sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was putting on my clothes, and was in my drawers and shirt; I could not have had it, for I dressed in his presence; he caught hold of me directly I opened the door, and would not leave go of me. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He sleeps in his clothes—he was lying on shavings—his clothes were on when I went, except his jacket.</p>

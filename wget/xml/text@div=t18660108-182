                  </hi>. I am ledger-keeper in the Imperial Bank, Limited—John David Parry opened an account there in July, 1862—he had an account before that—I am looking at a book in my own writing—the account is headed John David Parry—it commences with 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. being charged for fifty cheques in a book on, 12th July, 1862—they were consecutive numbers from B. O. 31, 001 to 31, 050—eleven of the cheques were presented cashed, and afterwards returned to him, and after that cash was paid on these eleven other checks which I have in my hand, but they were not given up to him—there was no money of Parry's in the bank at the end of 1862, he had overdrawn 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, which was paid to us on 29th January, 1863—that closed the account, and was the last transaction between us, no other cheques have been paid since that time, and there has been nothing to his credit since—in the course of keeping the accounts I became acquainted with Parry's writing—I should not like to say that this cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in his writing, nor to say that it is not—I doubt the signature as well as the body—these two cheques for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are two of those supplied to Parry—I believe the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque to be Parry's writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a looking-lass manufacturer of Elliott-road, Broad-wall, Southwark—about four months ago Friend obtained some goods from my premises, but I was not there—I had made application to him several times for the payment of money, and on 11th November be came to my workshop with this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—he said that he had come to pay 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off my account if I would change the cheque—I put my name on the back of it, and sent it out to get it changed, but I could not, and returned it to him—he called on me on Monday, 13th, paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said he would pay me the rest on Saturday—he said he had cashed the cheque, but did not mention Mr. White's name—Mr. White lives five or six doors off in the same street—on 1st December I went with Mr. White and Friend to Parry's—we went from Mr. White's house—Friend was in a public-house—I think it was the Cock and Castle—he said that the gentleman who drew the cheque lived a long way off, and it would take about two hours to go to him—Mr. White asked him for the money for the cheque—he said, "I have not got any money for it, and I want it," but he did not show Friend the cheque—Friend said, "I am very sorry, I will see Mr. Parry at ten to<lb></lb>morrow morning and bring him to you"—Mr. White said that would not do, it had been a long time in hand, and he wanted it settled—when we pressed him for the money he said it was a long way off—we proposed to take a cab, but he said he had to do some business, and it would be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of his pocket, but when Mr. White said that he would lock him up, he consented to go and took us to Bethnal Green-road, which took about five minutes—we found Parry there—Friend went into the house and had a conversation with him—they both came out and walked up the street sharply—Mr. White and I followed them—he asked Parry about the cheque, who said he did not know anything about it—Friend said, "Yes, you do, you know all about it"—Parry said, "The fact is, it is a <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, I did it when I was half-drunk to oblige Friend, and we had the money between us"—Parry showed fight, and said he would knock Mr. White down; and that we had got a security for the money—we got into a cab, went to Norris-street, Haymarket, Parry having said, "I will take you where you can get security"—when we got into the cab be said that we had better let it be till next morning, as he did not expect we should find the gentleman, but we drove to Norris-street—the name of Whiteman was on the door where he knocked—a servant came who said that Mr. Whiteman would not be seen—we went three times to know if he would come down—Mr. White said it would be a pity to lose them now as they were such slippery customers, and gave them in charge, and they were taken to Vine-street, but they were not locked up—we were told that we ought to take a warrant out against them, so the charge was not taken—I saw Friend next night in a public-house in the Hackney-road, and pointed him out to a policeman, who followed him—he went to a dark turning which led very near to where he lives, and was taken into custody—I saw Parry on Tuesday morning, when he was brought up to the police-court.</p>

D. that is the plantation mark, in the West-Indies, No. 2, No. 4, and No. 10. and G. H.

             sworn. - I am a copper, No. 36, Cable-street, St. George's; I bought four hogsheads of the prisoner, in Church-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. What, in the street? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew him to be Mr. Dames's servant? - A. Yes; the prisoner told me he had got some hogsheads, which he had purchased at the Court end of the town; I asked him whether they were grocer's hogsheads, he answered me, yes; he asked me if I would buy them of him, if he brought them to me; I told him, yes, if they were grocer's hogsheads, I would buy them of him; I saw no more of the prisoner till the third of this month, he came to the cooperage in Cable-street, and told me he had got the four hogsheads that he had informed me of; I asked him where they were, and he told me, in Church-lane, Whitechapel, that was on the Friday; he asked me if I would let the lad go with the truck to fetch them; if they were good, I was to give him five and sixpence for each cask; the lad went with him, and brought three hogsheads on the truck, and one was rolled by another lad that we employed for carrying out casks; when they came, I thought they were not grocer's hogsheads, and I saw no more of the prisoner after; I bought them for my brother, I am in his employ.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you apply to Mr. Dames? - A. I meant to go to Mr. Dames, but he came to our cooperage.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after the hogsheads were left there? - A. I believe, about an hour; Mr. Dames saw the hogsheads, and had them back the next day.</p>

               <p>Q.The hogsheads that Mr. Dames had away - were they the same that you had received from the prisoner? - A. They were.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the difference between a grocer's hogsheads, and your's? - A. In grocer's hogsheads, when sugar is turned out, there is some left in, but the refiners steam them, which makes them quite clean inside.</p>

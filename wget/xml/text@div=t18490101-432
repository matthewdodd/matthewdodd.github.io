                  </hi>. I live in Charles-street, Horsleydown, and am a gold-beater. Shaw was in my service—I missed a piece of gold, about 6th Nov., from an open box in the back-parlour—I had seen it the day I put it in, which I believe was on the 6th—I afterwards lost a sovereign from the cash-box, which I am in the habit of keeping locked—I keep the key generally myself, but when I am going out I give it to my wife—I missed the key, and thought I had lost it in the street—I got a new one made, and afterwards put some more sovereigns into the box—I believe it was on 14th Dec.—there were five sovereigns in it, and I locked it with the new key, and kept it in my pocket—in consequence of some conversation I had with Shaw I went with her and her father and mother to the prisoner Brown, who is her aunt, and lives at Greenwich—I induced Brown to come to town with me—I called in a policeman, when she was at our house, to hear what Shaw said before her—Shaw said, in her presence, that she had given the gold to her aunt down at Greenwich, and she had expressed a wish to have more—Brown denied it.</p>

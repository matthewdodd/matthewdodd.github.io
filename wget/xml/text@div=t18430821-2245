                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 77.) I was on duty near Grafton-court on the morning of the 20th of July—I heard a policeman's rattle, and went into the court—I met two women crying "Murder"—it was about two o'clock—I saw Owden at No. 7 in the court—I went into the house, and saw the prisoner standing inside the front parlour with a knife in his left hand—I believe he was in liquor—he said be would rip up any bl—y policeman that came into the room—there were two children in the room, but no women there—I have known the prisoner some years—I said to him, <hi rend="italic">"Jem</hi>, you know me very well, be quiet, we don't want to hurt you"—he immediately caught up the poker, and struck Owden across the cheek with it—I saw the blood flow—Owden immediately fell back—he struck at him again, but did not hit him, as sergeant Bennett warded off the blow—it hit Bennett on the knuckles—he struck with the knob end of the poker I am certain—he then struck me across my arm with the poker in the same way—he had his left hand hanging down, with the knife in it, and he immediately raised it at me—I immediately struck him across the arm with my staff, and he dropped the knife.</p>

               <p>struck him on his arm with his staff—I got up to him as quick as I could, and collared him—we took him into custody—I was not there half a minute before Owden's cheek was struck—the prisoner was not struck before he struck the blow, while I was there—there was an attempt to rescue him which we resisted, and took him to the station—as he went along he said it was in consequence of his coming home, and finding a man in bed with his wife—he appeared to be tipsy—he said he wished he had killed the b—, meaning the man—I saw him at the office the same day—he said nothing about the man being with his wife then, nor the knife—he was sober then.</p>

The prosecutor came to our house, on the 20th in the afternoon—I found the side of his face considerably swollen—there was a very severe external contused wound, and a correspond<lb></lb>ing wound inside his mouth—the skin was broken externally—it disabled him for nearly a week—it was certainly inflicted by a blunt instrument, and might be with this poker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How did it disable him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was dangerous to go out—it might have brought on severe inflammation—it prevented his opening his mouth to its natural extent, and I should think gave him considerable pain to eat—the wound might have been dangerous to life.</p>

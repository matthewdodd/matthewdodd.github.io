                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Tottenham-court-road. The prisoner had been three or four months in my service—on the 12th of November, I found a shilling behind the drawer of a table in my shop—I marked it and placed it there again—that was about eleven o'clock—I looked again, and it was gone—I then asked the prisoner to give me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I would give him half-a-sovereign, as I owed him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did so, and one of them was the shilling I had marked—I was talking to his father—the prisoner went away, and did not return to my service.</p>

PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not meet him outside his father's house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was then I asked him for the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—as I was going to give him the half-sovereign, he pulled out two half-crown—I said, "Give me two shillings, John"—I did not want a half-crown—I had no 'sixpence in my pocket—I did not give him the half-sovereign—I should have given it to him if he had not gone away—he said he had taken 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at market, and it was while he was gone to get that that I saw the shilling—he told me the shilling he gave me was out of the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not see his father afterwards, to my knowledge, to have any conversation with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say to him, "I could prosecute your son, but I will not for your sake, as I am myself a father?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect that I did—I might have said so—the prisoner did not come to me to demand his wages—a gentleman, named Jemmett, whom I supply with paunches, came to my shop on Saturday evening, and the prisoner came to ask me what was to be done about Mr. Jemmett, and in my shop he was taken.</p>

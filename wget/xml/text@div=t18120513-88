I gave him a dollar. I had not a shilling to pay for them. He beckoned over the prisoner to give change. When the prisoner came up I gave the five shillings and sixpenny dollar to the prisoner. It happened to drop out of his hand into the basket. Moses gave me four shillings and an eighteen-penny piece in change. The prisoner took a shilling out of my hand with a head upon it, and gave it Mordecai. The other three shillings and the eighteen-penny piece I kept in my hand. The officer has got them now. I gave them to the beadle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the three shillings - A. I did. I am no judge of silver. I was told in two minutes afterwards that they were all bad. I pursued Mordecai, and gave charge of him to the beadle of the parish. I believe it was a month after that I saw the prisoner.</p>

My sister and I keep a Berlin shop at 28, St. George's Place, Knightsbridge—on 15th January the prisoner came in and asked for a sixpenny fountain of scent—I gave it to him, and he gave me a bad half-crown, which I placed on a back shelf, gave him the change, and he left—I was present on the 23rd, and saw him there again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my sister—on 23rd January, about 4 o'clock, the prisoner came in—I had observed him outside for a quarter of an hour—five or six ladies were there, and he pushed himself among them—I knew him by sight, by his coming there before—he said "Give me another of those sixpenny fountains of scent"—he had bought one of my sister on the 15th—I said "If you will wait a minute or two I will find it," and I went out into the hall and sent for a policeman—I then served him—he took out a handful of silver and gold, and put down a bad half-crown on the counter—I took it up, and said "This is a bad half-crown"—he said "Is it? give it to me back"—I said "I will see"—I took it out, showed it to the prisoner, came back, and said "You have been here a fifth time and brought bad half-crowns"—he said "I do not believe I hare ever been into your shop before"—I said "You were here on the 11th and 15th; if you will give me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the bad money you have given me I will not give you in charge"—he said "I have not been in your shop before"—I said "You wait a minute, I have a policeman outside"—I went to the mantelpiece, took the half-crown, and gave it to the policeman—the prisoner said "I will give you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that half-crown"—I said "No; give me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he put his hand in his pocket, and said "So I will;" but the policeman took hold of him, and said, "No, you are my prisoner"—the coin taken on the 11th was given away to a lady in change.</p>

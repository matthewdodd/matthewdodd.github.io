On Saturday evening, the 18th of February, about eight o'clock, he brought this hide to me - he said he had a fine skin in his bag, which he wanted to sell me; he produced it, and on my examining it he said, "I will tell you where I got it - I got it at Mr. Southey's; I bought a bag of pieces there this morning, for which I gave a sovereign, and the hide was among them;" I said it evidently must be a mistake, and advised him to take it back, as it must be missed and suspicion would fall on him - he assured me he would take it back the next morning - I informed Mr. Southey on the Sunday.</p>

               <p>MR. SOUTHEY. He never brought it back; I do not think it possible for a hide to get among waste leather - he never bought any thing but pieces.</p>

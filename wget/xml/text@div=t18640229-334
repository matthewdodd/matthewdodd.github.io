                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the London Gas Light Company, and have been so nearly ton years—I know the defendants' premises, 1, Mark ham-street, Chelsea—they are smiths, bell-hangers, and gas-fitters—they were formerly in the Imperial Gas Company District, but since 1857 that district has been supplied exclusively by the London Gas Company—I walked past the premises twice to observe the gas burning, and on 18th January I went into the premises about 11 in the morning—this model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was made by ray directions—it accurately describes the premises—there is an iron railing running along the entire front, a portion of which is open for the entrance—there is a sort of shop here for the exhibition of goods, and on the right are the work shops—I was accompanied by Mr. Pearce, the inspector, and I had workmen waiting outside—there were two lights burning in the show shop, but turned down to a blue flame, as low as they could be without going out, and in the smith's shop three burners were full on—I did not see either of the defendants then—I saw a brother, Frederick, I believe his name to be—I afterwards saw Charles—I asked to see Mr. Dobbins, and Frederick said that he was not in—I then asked to see the meter, and ho showed it to us—I turned on one of the lights in the show shop full, and desired the inspector to go to the meter—Mr. Frederick stood between the inspector and me—I directed the gas to be turned off at the meter, which was done, and the two burners in the shop went out as they should, but the three in the work shop continued to burn—in order that there should be no mistake I bad the meter disconnected from the pipes and shifted some yards from its position, but the gas still continued burning in the workshop—there wore two small pipes from the motor, and a third pipe going to a light in the kitchen, with a larger pipe going apparently to supply the workshops, which we disconnected, but no gas escaped, though the gas was at that time burning in the work shop—I judged from that that there was some stoppage in that pipe, and in addition to that the lights in the show shop would not have gone out—there were seven lights in the show shop supplied from the meter—I went round to every light in the work<lb></lb>shop with the inspector and my assistant—we tried every light, and found we could got gas from fifteen lights, all of which had largo burners, some of which would consume seven or eight feet per hour—we got as much gas from them as we required—that was after the meter had been disconnected—when the workmen came in I directed them to dig up the ground inside the railings in the defendants' presence—while they were doing so I went away for a short time, und returned and found the ground laid open as far as it was possible, but they had not interfered with the private part—when I came I caused that to be opened, and found a three-quarter inch service pipe going into the premises, and up to the meter, and then a "T" piece—this model</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402290017"></xptr>
               <p>accurately shows the position of the pipe—I had it made from what I saw—I directed the workmen to sever the pipe, and it is in Court—the meter was a ten light one—the pipe would probably have been an inch and a quarter one for twenty-two burners—if twenty-two burners were supplied through a three-quarter inch pipe you would get a light, but not a proper one if they were all lighted at once—the pipe was four or five inches underground, and there were iron plates and pieces of paving over it—the ground had not been recently disturbed—one of the pieces of plate went over an old drain, and herbage was growing there, showing that it had not been disturbed for a long time—my opinion is that the "T" was put into the ground at the same time, or thereabouts—I saw Charles Dobbins, but did not address him because he did not make himself known to me, and no explanation was given to me—I told Frederick Dobbins, as I could see nobody else, that they would have no gas that night, and had better provide themselves with other means, and appeal to the Board—he attended at the Board, and they declined to see him—I was not aware that they were burning gas in any other way than by meter.</p>

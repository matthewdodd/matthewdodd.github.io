                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic"> police-sergeant, V</hi> 33). On 24th Sept., in consequence of information, I went with Walker to the back of Europa-place, and found Leggett there—I left Walker in charge of the bricks, and went to Coomer's house—he was not at home—I went to the wharf at Wandsworth, found Goddard there, and in consequence of a description I had had from Walker, I said to him, "What have you done with the bricks you took to Battersea, between six and seven o'clock this morning?"—he said, "I have not been to Battersea at all"—I said, "Do you mean to say you have not</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you known Brown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three years; he has lived in the neighbourhood that time, and at Putney before—he is a labouring man, and sometimes carries dung on the road—he has an old horse and a cart—I think he bought them of Dutton, and "Thomas Dutton" is on the cart—Dutton has brick-fields—I know Brown and his son have a piece of land at Garrett, which is near—I have seen Brown with tares, straw, greaves, and bricks in his cart—I believe he has absconded; we have not been able to find him—we have not charged any one but Coomer with receiving bricks stolen by Brown—I have found three persons besides him who have bricks of this nature, Mr. Booker, a beer-shop keeper at Battersea, Mr. Hunt, the butcher at Chelsea, and Hunt, a marine-store dealer—I have seen Coomer work for Mr. Hunt—at the police-court, Coomer said he was recommended by Hunt, the butcher, to Brown, as a person of whom he had bought bricks, and I saw both the Hunts' in consequence, and had some conversation with them—Coomer produced two pieces of paper at the police-court—I took possession of his ledger and other accounts.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you trace bricks of Locke and Nesham's to these other people? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the inquiries are not yet terminated—these are the two papers—they were produced by Taylor, who was called by Coomer as a witness (<hi rend="italic">produced—an account amounting to 5</hi>s<hi rend="italic">. 6</hi>d<hi rend="italic">. for cartage, and a receipt signed "R. Brown" for 2</hi>l<hi rend="italic">. on account for bricks delivered</hi>)—these other two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I found in Coomer's pocket-book, and one of them I find cor<lb></lb>responds with one of those Taylor produced, and forms part of the same sheet of paper—one is dated 24th Aug., and the other 26th July—they were produced in consequence of his saying he had papers for all transactions with Brown, and the Magistrate asking for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they produced in consequence of a communica<lb></lb>tion from Coomer to some one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Taylor said he had received a note from Mr. Coomer, in consequence of which he sent the papers—one he found on the file and the other in Mr. Coomer's ledger—I did not see the letter, but know that he wrote one—it has never been in my possession—it was not produced before the Magistrate—Mr. Hunt is a butcher in an extensive way of business.</p>

            . In consequence of a conversation with Mosher I went to Sowerby's and Castle's, the pawnbrokers, who promised to examine their stocks for my paper, and on the day Wayman was taken I said to him,"Henry, I have found a great deal of paper, which you have been robbing me of;" he at first denied it - I said,"I have seen some of it - don't deny it;" he then trembled, cried very much, and confessed he had taken a great deal, some of which he had taken to Jones, who had pawned it at the rate of 9s. for two reams, and gave him half of it; he said some was pawned at Sowerby's and some at Castle's; he was taken to Marlborough-street, and next day I went to Jones', with the officer, and asked if he knew Wayman - he declared he knew no such person, but, after pressing him some time, his wife said, in his presence, "It must be Henry Wayman," who had been there the night before; Jones then said he had; we took him in charge, and went to Castle's, who produced seven reams of paper, which I can swear to - I had two hundred reams, and have missed a large quantity; I knew it by the marks on the covers; it is a particular sort, used for colouring; six of the reams have the Excise mark on them, which answer to my bill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. You cannot swear to a sheet of paper? A. No. I told Wayman I was sorry I could not make him a witness - those were my words; I had only then talked about the roller.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you seen him since? A. Yes, once or twice; when he first brought it I inquired if it was his own - he said Yes, that he was a printer, and if I did not like to take it he would leave it while I went to any stationers', to make inquiry - he left it, but I did not inquire. I delivered the paper to the officer.</p>

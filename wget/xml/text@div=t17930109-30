             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am street keeper and patrole of Houndsditch; on Sunday evening the 6th of January, between six and seven I saw the prisoner Wall coming up the street, and I saw him turn round Gravel-lane, I observed he had got something under his waistcoat; this might be a quarter of a mile from the prosecutrix's, I stopped him and asked him what he had got? he said, he had got a quart pot, it was underneath his jacket, he told me his mother gave it him; with that I asked him where he was going to take it, he said, he was going to take it into Petticoat-lane to sell it, I let him go, and he took it to Mr. Crocker's house, he told me what house he was going to; I know the prisoner at the bar, because he is a ward constable, he keeps an old iron shop; the boy went in and sold the pot, the boy was in my custody when he sold it, I stood at the door, he sold it for 6 d. I did not see him sell it, because there was a bit of a screen; the boy came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090045"></xptr>to the threshold of the door, and I went in, and asked Mr. Crocker what he had done with the pot that the boy brought in, and he was very much alarmed with that, he was sitting near the fire, and between him and the fire place he put his hand round, and gave me the pot, the pot was between him and the fire place, in the same state it is now in, not melted or any thing; I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself; the boy told me he gave him 6 d. in his presence, and there was a woman there took the 6 d. from him; I don't know what the value of the pot may be.</p>
               <p>Q. This 6 d. may not be then very much below the mark for an old pot? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Crocker. I wish to ask him whether he did not keep the boy at the Nag's Head, in Houndsditch, and offered him money to tell him where he was going with the pot? - I offered no money, the boy told me voluntarily; I knew very well it was a suspicious character where he was a going to.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did the boy tell you he was going to sell the quart pot at one Crocker's? - He did not say he was going to one Crocker's first, but to one Freer's to the best of my knowledge, but I knew the house, and I knew it was Crocker's; I know every house in the ward; I told the boy to go where he was going to sell it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take him into the Nag's Head? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you detain him there? - Not above half a minute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Crocker. Did not you take him to another house? - I did to get Box, another officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the constable in bed or up? - I was not up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you detain him till Box got up, and then you all came together? - The boy went up first and I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take the pain that he should go with you then and not to bring him here now? - Because the alderman did not think it necessary, and besides, my Lord, there are back doors, and that was the reason; Petticoat-lane is not a very agreeable place; he was to have been sworn in the next day as ward constable, he is not sworn in now; I have kept the pot ever since. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. What is that pot worth? - We give 1 l. 2 s. a dozen, the maker said it was worth 1 s. 2 d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wall. I was playing in Little Moorfields, and I saw that pot stand by in the street among more pots in a string, the pots were taken away and this pot was left, and this man when I went to sell some old iron bars, said if I could get any quart pots, or any thing of that sort, he would buy it of me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Crocker. I have no interest in the shop, nor did I buy it, or pay for it, I have another employ to get my living.</p>
               <p>Court to Tipper. Did you examine the boy, and see that he had the sixpence? - The woman that is Mr. Croker's servant I believe, took the 6 d. from the boy as soon as he came in the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether you got that 6 d. of the boy? - I did not; while I went back to Crocker, the woman stopped the boy, and took the 6 d. out of his hand, the boy was in the shop all the while I went to Crocker, I did not see her do it, only what the boy told me; I would have apprehended the woman, but only he begged and prayed of me not to do it, and I thought it was enough to take him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Crocker. I had witnesses here this morning, but I was told the indictment was not found.</p>
               <p>Wall's mother was called, and she said, he lived at home, worked in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090046"></xptr>cotton way, and always had been a good boy.</p>

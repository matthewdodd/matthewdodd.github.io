I saw the prisoner some time before 13th March, at his home at Rushgrove-street, Woolwich—I told him I wanted him to go to a coffee shop to see if he could get some gin and tobacco—I said they were selling without a license—I took Sergeant Thompson to his house, I believe, on the Wednesday—I said to Thompson, "This is the man I was speaking to you about"—Thompson had some conversation with the prisoner about going to Rice's house—it was the same house I meant when I spoke to him first:—there was an arrangement made that the prisoner was to go to Rice's house on Sunday morning, the 13th March—the prisoner was to come to the station and meet Thompson on the Sunday morning—I saw the prisoner on Saturday night, 12th March, about 8 o'clock; I asked him if he intended to come—he said he did not know—I told him he was not forced to come, but he agreed with me that be would come the next morning—he said something about his mates hearing of it—I came with him to within about ten yards of the Marine Barrack gate—he there met his wife and went back with her—he came to the station on Sunday morning about half-past 7 o'clock—Sergeant Thompson and myself were there—I saw Thompson give him a small stone bottle in the station—he said something to him about his going down to Rice's coffee shop—he said that was the bottle to see if he could get some gin, and he gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was perfectly sober on the Saturday night and on the Sunday morning—I saw the prisoner and Thompson go out of the door of the station together—I saw the prisoner again, I believe, on the next Saturday night, either in Powis-street or Hare-street—he said he went to Rice's coffee shop, he asked for a cup of coffee, and they told him they had none, but they would give him something better—he said, "I had four glasses of gin which was drank there, and I had another glass, which I put into the bottle"—and he likewise had a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco, that he smoked a part of it there, and the other part he had brought away with him—he was quite sober—I saw him again on the Saturday afterwards, and he told me the same tale—this was on Saturday the 26th, the second Saturday after he had been to Rice's.</p>

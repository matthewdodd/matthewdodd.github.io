            ; that he was occasionally his porter, and used to carry goods home for him. He said he was to pledge the fire-irons for 3l., and was to redeem some clothes pledged before, and to give him the balance. I asked him where Smith gave him the irons? he said, at the Queen's-head, public-house, at the corner of Ormond-street. I asked him where his manufactory was? he, on the other side of Fleet-street. I told him to leave the fire-irons, and send Smith to me, as I did not like his story. In a few minutes the prisoner, Riley, came, whom I had known by the name of Smith. He appeared very much hurt at my detaining the fire-irons, and not sending the money by his porter as he desired. I asked him where he bought the goods, as I was not satisfied? he said he bought them of Mr. Livermore, an ironmonger, in Oxford-street, and he would bring me the bill and receipt on Monday morning, at twelve o'clock-this was on Saturday. He redeemed some clothes which he had pledged with me in the name of Smith. I kept the fire-irons. He did not come on Monday. I went to Mr. Livermore in consequence of what I heard - I went round to several shops, and among others to the prosecutor's, he claimed them.</p>

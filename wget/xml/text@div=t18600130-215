                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger—the prisoner was in my ser<lb></lb>vice at the time of this transaction, and had been for seven or eight months—it was part of his duty to obtain orders and receive money on my account—he was paid by commission—he was not allowed to deduct his commission from what he received; he was paid it—in September last he went what is called a west journey—he had to call, amongst other places, at Reading and at Great Marlow—in consequence of some matters that came to my notice I wrote to him to tell him to come home—he did so, and my brother asked him what monies he had received—he never paid me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Benjamin Laws; 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Henry Golding; or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., received at Great Marlow.</p>

                  </hi>. I went over an account with the prisoner about 11th or 12th December, in my brother's counting-house—(we were then in possession of the other receipts)—that account would include all that had been received by him up to 11th December—he did not give me at that time an account of either of these three sums—I asked him if he had not received some other accounts; he said he had not—I then told him that some of our customers had made an attempt to forge his name to accounts of his, and had done it; for we had receipts for accounts which he had not made a return of—he made no reply—I mentioned no names.</p>

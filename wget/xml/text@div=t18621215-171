                  </hi>. I am a coach painter, at 16, and 17, Ada-street, London-fields, Hackney—the prisoner is my brother—on Sunday afternoon, 30th November, while at dinner, I heard a knock at the street door—my son left the room to answer the knock, and returned bringing me this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the prisoner's writing—on the preceding Friday, the 28th, I was out, and when I came home I found the front of a dial smashed, and also the front of a glass case—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read:</hi>"30/11/62. James—You may be surprised at receiving this from me, after what happened on Friday night; but I consider you owe me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which Hester told you to pay me, and I am determined to have it, or I will have ten times the worth of it out of your property. If you had been in when I came on Friday night, I would have had the money, or I would have left you with sore bones. Now you know me pretty well; and if I say I will do a thing, I will do it. Now, if I do not receive part of the money tonight, I will pay you a visit when you least expect it; so you had better send it to-night to me, at a place I shall name, or I will make you keep your bed for a few days. You only pretend religion to suit your own avaricious nature, and I consider that you are nothing better than a swindler. You do not like to let me have the money, and you never intend to pay Hester—the same as you have swindled others. I am quite aware what you think of me, but I do not care one pin for that. I can't fall lower than I am at present; so if you know when you are safe, you had better send the money, or you will not do much work next week, and I will take care you do not derive much profit from your shop. P.S. You had better send the money to me, at No. 4, King's Head-court, Shoreditch, to-night, between 8 and half-past, as I shall be waiting for it, and I am resolved to have it.

                  </hi>. I live in Pear-street, Westminster. On the 27th of Jan., at half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at Mr. Clark's public-house, Horseferry-road, Westminster—we were drinking to<lb></lb>gether till half-past four or a quarter to five o'clock, and then had a few words—we were both drunk, and had a struggle two or three times outside the door—I heard somebody halloo out, "Mind the knife, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>"—I directly got out of his way, put my hand into my left-hand pocket, and drew it out full of blood—I had received a wound, but did not feel it inflicted—I instantly ran into the public-house, called out that I was stabbed, pulled down my clothes, and showed the barman where I was stabbed—I was instantly taken to the doc<lb></lb>tor's, then to the station-house, and then on a stretcher to the Westminster Hospital—I never quarrelled with the prisoner before—I have known him some time, and we were always on good terms.</p>

I was a stranger before this time that the apartment had been let. When I came there the prisoner told me that she had suffered by the robbery as well as me, for she had lost several things, particulary some of her husband's shirts; a gold ring that had been her mother's; and a silver spoon. I returned home to my place and on the Monday following the prisoner came to my mistress's and desired I would go with her to the justice's and get a search warrant, and that she would be at half the expence, having lost some of her property. I went with her to justice Wilmot's, there I was examined and made oath to my loss; and the prisoner took oath to her pretended loss of shirts and spoons which she said were stolen. In consequence of this oath a search warrant was granted and executed, but nothing was found; afterwards I received information that the prisoner had offered some of my things to sale; thereupon I took her up; this was about three weeks ago; when she was taken up she confessed that she had pawned several things, and directed us to the pawnbroker's; and in consequence of that information I went with the prisoner to the pawnbroker, and there found part of my property; the silk and stuff gown, the blue petticoat, a dimity and a flannel petticoat.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mrs. Davis. The evening the robbery was committed the prisoner came down stairs from her apartment, and desired she might leave a candle upon the dresser till she returned again; she was permitted to do that, and she afterwards came in between nine and ten at night together with her husband. They went up stairs; she made a noise; at that time the staple of the door was drawn; when she went out she locked the door it is to be supposed; for at the time when she went out, and put down this candle, between nine and ten at night, the staple could not have been drawn; for I should have discovered it then if it had; but she must want it to be understood to be between the time she went out, which was about three quarters of an hour, to her return, that it must be done; they made an outcry and came down and informed me the robbery had been committed and the staple drawn. I went up, there were two blankets against the window, and the prisoner said the persons that had committed the robbery must have made their escape through the window.</p>

She put it down on the dresser, and returned again in about three-quarters of an hour.</p>

I knew nothing of her, only I thought she was honest; she often got very drunk; she had come in that night I went out; and after the Monday morning I happened to see her. She came to this Mrs. Davis; she said I will make you acknowledge it. I said I have lost my good character that I have carried all my life. I have bore nine children. She was quite drunk; she said, if I would let her sleep, she would come on Monday night and tell me every things; and as she was coming up on Monday night, she was killed in Petticoat-lane by an accidence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mrs. Mary Ann Sackett; she lives in the Lee-road, leading to Kidbrook, in Kent. On Thursday, the 19th of June, the prisoner Setter came there between four and five o'clock—he said he came to see Mrs. Sackett—she was not at home—he asked my fellow-servant to have a drop of beer—we said we were not in the habit of drinking beer—he then said might he have a drop of water—my fellow<lb></lb>servant said she would fetch him a drink—he said never mind, he would fetch it—he went into the back room, and when he came back he said he must be gone—my fellow-servant said, if he would stop, her mistress would ask him to have tea—(he knew my mistress a great many years)—he declined it, and said he must go, and he went, after stopping three or four minutes—before he came I had laid some spoons on a table in the back kitchen about two o'clock—that was the room into which Setter went—I did not miss one of them till the officer brought it on Sa<lb></lb>turday—no one had an opportunity of taking it between the time that Setter called and the Saturday, for no stranger had come in—my fellow<lb></lb>servant had access to that part of the house, but she is not here—there had not been occasion for the spoon to be used between the time that Setter came and the Saturday—after Setter had been gone about a quarter of an hour, Reynolds came to our house—he brought a china ornament which he called a cottage—he asked if my mistress had ordered such a thing—we said not that we knew of—he said he was sure it was there—we said it was not there, perhaps it was next door—he said he had been next door—he never pot in at all, and had no access to our back kitchen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 84.) Between five and six o'clock on Thursday, the 19th of June, I saw Reynolds in the Lee-road, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's premises—I saw Setter join him in less than a minute—I watched them, and followed them about * quarter of a mile—they separated after I had followed them, for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I took Reynolds, and directed Eagles, who was with me, to take Setter—on taking Reynolds I said, "What is this you bave in your pocket?"—he said, "Nothing"—I took off his hat and found in it this china cottage—I saw his hand busy in his pocket—I took his trm and said, "What is that you are putting up your sleeve"—I took his arm and took out this spoon, which he was putting up his sleeve—I said, "Whose is this?"—he said, pointing to Setter, who was a hundred and fifty yards off, "It belongs to that young man"—I took Reynolds to the station, and there, in the presence of Setter, I said to Reynolds, "Whose is this, and where did you get it?"—he said, pointing to Setter, "He gave it me"—Setter said, "I know nothing about it."</p>

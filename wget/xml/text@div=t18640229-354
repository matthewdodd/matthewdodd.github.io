                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, and live at Harding's-lane, Woolwich—on 1st February, about half-past 11 at night, I met the prisoner, and asked him if he was coming home with me—he made no answer, but we went down Harding's-lane into my house—we sat on the side of my bed, and I said, "Well are you going to stop for the night?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What are you going to give me?"—he said, "Give</p>

               <p>you?"—I said, "Yes, of course, I want some money"—he said, "Get into bed"—I said, "No, not till you pay me"—he knocked one of the glasses off the mantel-piece, but I took no notice of that, because I saw he was drunk—I laid my head on my bed, and saw him put his hand in his pocket—he then came over and stabbed me on the left side of my back—Mrs. Price said, "Harriette, open the door"—I said, "I cannot"—the prisoner heard me speak to her—I said, "Do not let that man go, he has stabbed me"—she said, "Nonsense"—I said, "Perhaps you will feel"—I became insensible, and was attended by Dr. Stewart.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Price, and live in Harding's-lane, Woolwich—the last witness has been lodging at my house—I saw the prisoner coming out on this night between 11 and 12 o'clock, and heard the girl say that she was stabbed—I went to the door, and she opened it, and said, "I am stabbed"—I said, "I hope you are not"—she said, "I am"—she showed me where she was stabbed, and my hand was full of blood—she became insensible, and I gave her in charge to some people outside to put her indoors again—I sent for an officer.</p>

On Sunday night, 14th February, I was on duty in High-street, Woolwich, and about half-past 12 o'clock was called to Harding's-lane—I saw the prisoner in the hands of three or four persons who said that he had stabbed a woman in a house in Harding-lane—Mrs. Price came up, and said that he was the man—I took him back to the house—the prosecutrix identified him—I saw that she was stabbed in the back—I took him to the station—the knife was brought there by a man who I believe was Mr. Price—I showed it to the prisoner and asked him if it was his knife—he said, "Yes."</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I am in practice at Woolwich—on 14th February, about 12 o'clock, I examined the prosecutrix, and found a triangular superficial wound, about an inch in extent, on the left side of her back—it might be inflicted by this knife—it was not dangerous—I attended her that night and next day but not since, as divisional surgeon to the Police.</p>

            . I am foreman of the pot-ash manufactory. On the 10th of June as I was coming across the common near Bow, between two and three in the morning, Thomas Wright and another man came out of a field in the road, towards the end of a foot-path; they were crossing into a field from the foot-path. We passed them. I said, what have you been at that way; one of them made answer, we have just laid her in a ditch. We walked on about about twenty yards. I had a suspicion that they had been breaking a fence, or something of that sort; and then they returned, and went over the same railings as when we passed them. The prisoner was knocking of some wood, as I thought; I said, you are pretty fellows breaking a fence, and when we came to them, the prisoner was beating something; I found it was lead. The man that was with me, saw the other man burying some lead. The prisoner made off. I took up this heavy piece of lead that he was knocking together. I said, he shall not go off so, I would take him if possible. I pursued the prisoner, and Smith that was with me; we took Thomas Wright; we brought the prisoner back, and took him to the watchhouse, and afterwards we took all the lead to the watchhouse. I said, this lead must have come off Mr. Gillman's premises. The prisoner said he knew nothing of it. I saw where the lead came from</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was coming home at the time with Poulter. I saw them coming over the gate; I asked them what they had been at; they said, they had left her in the ditch. Then we went away about twenty yards; I came back, and looked over the bank of the field. The other man saw me looking over; he said, there is somebody looking over; he then ran away.

            . I am an officer. I received this lead at the watchhouse. I took the lead to Mr. Gillam's premises, and compared it. By the thickness of the the lead, and by the holdfasts on the shed, and by the marks on the lead of the holdfasts, I have no doubt it came off Mr. Gillam's shed.</p>

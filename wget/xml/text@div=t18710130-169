                  </hi>. I live at 1, Leigh Street, Burton Crescent, and am a surveyor and builder—the prisoner was a general servant in my house—she came a fortnight before Christmas—on Sunday night, the 15th January, about 8.30, or from that to 9, I was called by my daughter, and I went directly to the bedroom over an office which I had, and found the bedding on fire, and the room full of smoke, so much so, that I could scarcely get into the room—I began beating the flames out with my hand and smothered them over with the blankets, and in that way got it out, with the assistance of water—after that I got a light, and I closely inspected the place to make out the cause, if possible, and I saw that it had been evidently set on fire between the palliasse and above the rail of the bedstead, under the counterpane—there was a counterpane over the bed—I saw the flames extending each way, evidently starting from the top of the rail—the bed was made, and there was an extra quantity of things on—there was a sealskin mantle and a waterproof also there, amongst the bedding, and the prisoner afterwards said she had put it on—that was the fifth fire I had had in the house—one occurred on 5th January—they extended over ten days, from the 5th to the 15th—seeing that they must have been set on fire, I went to the police-constable to come to inspect it—I asked the prisoner if she had been up into the room and done anything in the way of fire there—she said, in my hearing, that Miss Sherritt was last in the room</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187101300029"></xptr>
               <p>—after the police-constable had been in and inspected it and made inquiries, she confessed that she did it—we were sitting in the dining room—I said "You had better confess and tell me whether you really hare done it or not, and we should be inclined to forgive you and look over it"—she was in a very excited condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was a good servant while she was with me, as far as abilities were concerned—she was well conducted—I understand her age is 15, on 24th of this month—I had no fault to find with her—she seemed to be willing—I keep the house myself—there are six of my own family in the house, and a young lady and three gentlemen occasionally, lodgers—I kept one servant, a charwoman, and a boy to do all the rough work—I thought the fire was accidental at first, because it did not occur to me that it had been anything else; I really did not investigate or think of it—I thought it was a spark or something.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer E</hi>). On 15th January, between 10 and 11 at night I went to the prosecutor's house—I went to the first floor front bedroom with Mr. Nash—I found the room full of smoke, and the bed and bedding completely destroyed—I also saw a sealskin mantle there, burnt—I then went down in the kitchen and saw the prisoner—Mr. Nash, junior, was with me—Mr. Nash might have been there, but he did not stay any length of time—I saw her before she saw Mr. Nash—I am sure of that—I told her I was a police-officer, and I was going to put some questions to her, and she must be Very careful how she answered them—I said "Do you know there has been a fire in the house to night"—she said "Yes, I do"—I said "This looks very suspicious, this is the fifth fire that has occurred here within ten days"—she said "I know nothing about it, I have not been up stairs to night"—I said "I have been informed that you have been up stairs, I was told so by young Miss Nash "—I then sent for Miss Nash and repeated the same again, and Miss Nash said "Ellen, how can you tell such falsehoods I"—she became very much excited and began to cry—she then said "Sir, I will tell you something"—no promise had been made to her at that time, in my presence, and no threat—she said "You said just now, sir, there has been five fires, I only lighted four; I went up stairs, and took some matches and put them to the gas and then threw them under the bed clothes, and placed over the bed clothes a sealskin mantle; I don't know what made me do it; I have a good master and mistress, and they have been very kind to me "—I told her I should take her to the station—she said "Oh dear! tell my mother"—I told her that should be done—before taking her to the station I took her into the dining-room, where Mr. Nash and the family were—she went and sat by Mrs. Nash's side, and made a confession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not hear Mr. Nash say he would forgive her, and tell her to tell the truth—after the prisoner had told me about it, I went with her into the dining-room, where the family were—she said she wanted to speak to her master, and she did not wish me to be present, and I went outside the door—I am quite sure that was after I had seen her in the kitchen—I put the questions to the girl, which I have told you—Mr. Nash might have been there, but I don't remember—I think he was there a short time—he did not tell the girl in the kitchen that she had better speak the truth—he did not say a word to her in the kitchen—Mr. Nash's son was not present when she made the statement—he had left the kitchen then,</p>

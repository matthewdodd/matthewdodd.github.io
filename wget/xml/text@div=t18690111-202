               <p>dated 16th September, 1868, and 42,592, dated August 19, 1868—that is, stamped "Provincial Bank Corporation, Cardiff"—I found these two docu<lb></lb>ments (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in a drawer at 54, Belgrave Road, Birmingham—I showed them to Ball, at Scotland Yard, and asked him if he knew anything about them—he said "While at the coffee house with McMichan and Sullivan, McMichan gave me these names from his book, and I wrote them down"—I found some forms of the Paymaster General's Office, at 160, Ockley, which I brought to London—on Wednesday last I was looking through the papers, and I found these blank receipt forms and a lot of parchment—Ball was detained in custody, and taken before the Magistrate—on the following Monday, the 14th, I went to Birmingham again—I went to a house at No. 1, Court Summers Street, Birmingham—it is a small house, with three rooms—I knocked at the door, and Rutter's wife let me in—Rutter was there—it was about 10 o'clock at night—I said that I was an officer of police from London, and that I was investigating a matter, and that I should put some questions to him with reference to the same, and that he could please himself whether he answered them or not—he said "Very well"—I said, "What is your name?"—he said "William Rutter"—I said, "Have you changed any bank notes in Birmingham?"—he said, "Yes, one, a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note"—I said, "What did you purchase?"—he said, "A watch"—he produced it; I have it here now—I said, "Have you passed any other notes"—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you not pass a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note, at a shoe-shop in Worcester Street, Birmingham, for the purchase of a pair of shoes, giving the name of James Thompson, 150, Pershore Road"—he said, "Oh yes, I forgot that"—I said, "Are those the only notes you have changed in Birmingham?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Did you not change one at Page, the linen draper's, for the purchase of a shawl?"—he said, "No, I did not, Ball passed that, and made my wife a present of the shawl"—I said, "If your name is Rutter, how is it that you gave the name of James Thompson?"—he said, "I don't know"—I produce the shoes I found at his house, and also the shawl—I said, "How long have you known Ball?"—he said, "I have known him some considerable time, and have been employed by him as a clerk"—I said, "Were you ever at the Paymaster-General's office?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you present a cheque at the Bank of England in October last, for between 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,"—he said, "No, I did not"—I also searched the house and found the pair of shoes, and shawl, and then I said I should take him to the station for being concerned with others in forging and uttering an order on the Paymaster General, for 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., odd—his wife was present, and begged of me not to take her husband—she said, "Oh, William, my dear, tell all you know about it, and don't get into trouble for other persons"—he said, "Well I will, I won't be in this mess for the sake of Ball, or any of the others, for I am an innocent agent, and I look upon Ball as my employer"—he then said, "On 19th October, I was with Ball, McMichan and Joe Sullivan, at the Shades public-house, between Craven Street and Hungerford Bridge; Ball handed me a red-letter form, requesting me to take it to the Pay-master-General's Office, and that I should receive a cheque on the Bank in exchange—previous to my taking this, Joe Sullivan was absent for a little time—I took it to the Paymaster-General's Office, and received a cheque for between 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I took it back to the Shades and gave it to Ball—myself and Ball walked along the Strand till we came to the church near Temple Bar, and we took a cab to the Bank of England—Ball remained out<lb></lb>side</p>

I went to Cardiff and received the money, by signing the name of Chester. I received 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., notes, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in gold; this I handed to Ball on my return to Birmingham the same evening. He paid my expenses, and gave me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for my trouble"—I mentioned McMichan's name to him, and he said "He was the ringleader of all this"—I asked him if he knew a Mr. Derry—he said" No, but I now remember that the name of F. Derry was on the red letter form which I took to the Paymaster-General's Office"—I said "Did you see Mr. Derry on that day?"—he said "No; I never saw him in my life"—he was then brought up to London, and taken before the Magistrate on the following day—I have had the charge of this case—I have tried to find McMichan; but can find neither him nor Sullivan—I have been to Croydon, and tried to find a Mr. James Aubrey there—the address given was "The Elms, Croydon, Surrey"—I have been to four places called the Elms; but cannot find him—I have communicated with the police and other persons; but they can find no such person there.</p>

Chester," and also the bank notes with Edward Giffard on the back—all the filling up on the red letter form, the forged order, I believe to be in the same handwriting as the other documents, without any doubt, except the figures—I am perfectly satisfied that the signature "F. Derry" is not in the same handwriting as the body—I have seen the genuine signature of F. Derry, and I do not believe it to be the same handwriting as the F. Derry to that order—the signature on the order is a forgery, and a very clumsy one.</p>

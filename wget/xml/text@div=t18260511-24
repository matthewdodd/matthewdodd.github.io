We went into the parlour altogether; there was nobody else there. I joined their company, and staid there till a little after eleven o'clock; we all drank together, and had three pots of porter; I paid for one pot; Child went out a few minutes before eleven o'clock; I went out soon after eleven; the two prisoners followed me out. I lodge about thirty yards from the public-house. Goodwin was on my left side, and the other on the right - I had not got seven or eight yards from the public-house, when I was suddenly knocked down by Goodwin, in Duke-street; Price took hold of both my arms, and forcibly kept them down, while Goodwin dragged my watch out of my fob; I called out: he put his hand into my right-hand pocket, and took out 9s. in silver. I called for assistance, and they both ran away. I got up - Child was coming towards his quarters, and I seized him by the collar, told him I had been robbed, and I suspected he had something to do with it. The patrol came up, and I gave him in charge. I had not seen Child about me, but I suspected he was concerned. I went to the watch-house, and described the two prisoners; the constable found them that night. I saw them in custody next morning, and knew them; I was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A <rs id="t18260511-24-viclabel156" type="occupation">gentleman's servant</rs>

I had been to the Rose and Crown public-house before that, and had a pint of beer - I went there alone; Child came in afterwards, and had a pint of beer; I do not recollect seeing the prisoners there, but there were a great number of soldiers there; I had a pint of beer when I first went in, and took it into the parlour with Child - it was put into somebody's pot; I drank two or three times out of it; but had not spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not drink two pots yourself? A. Certainly not; we drank two or three times round; I only paid for one pot: I could not have drank two pints. I went there about eight o'clock, and staid till half-past nine, then went to the Black Lion with Child, and there we had three pots among four of us, and half-a-pint of gin; I had nearly one glass: we staid there till a few minutes after eleven. I was knocked down seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110016"></xptr>or eight yards from the Black Lion; I was perfectly sober. The landlord was up - a watchman goes up the street; I do not know where his box is. I knew perfectly well who knocked me down, and who robbed me. I seized Child, as I thought he was concerned - only two persons robbed me. When I got up Child was just coming round the corner towards his quarters; he had not passed me. I could scareely get up, the fall was so great - he made no resistance; he was not at the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you invite either of the prisoners home to sleep with you at your lodging that night? A. Never. I did not ask Goodwin to take charge of my watch, because I was so drunk. I was at no other public-house that day; I dined at the Black Dog public-house; I took two pints of beer with my dinner, and had about three glasses of ale in the afternoon; I staid there till half-past four o'clock, then went home to tea, and about eight went to the Rose and Crown; Child had two eggs with me at dinner. We only had three pots of beer at the Black Lion. I have been out of town for a few days since the robbery, with my friends, in Essex.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of Essex? A. I went to inquire for a friend; I went to the Eagle and Child public-house, Epping-forest, and took a lodging in the village, just by - I was only gone two days; I slept there one night. I swear I was perfectly sober.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Giles's. On this night, Quarn had given information at the watch-house, I went round to different houses, and about one o'clock I was going through George-street, and by a lodging-house I turned my eye, looked through the curtain, and there saw Price sitting in the parlour, with a female; they seemed at very high words. I listened for about five minutes; she threatened to charge the watch with him for ill-using her, and for another thing. I beckoned the girl out, and in consequence of what passed I went in, and took him to the watch-house. I found a shilling, a halfpenny, and a penny piece on him; I left him in the watch-house, and found Goodwin in the upper part of the same house, about half an hour afterwards; we broke the door open; he was in bed with a woman: we desired him to get up and dress - he did so. I searched his pockets before he dressed; his clothes were on the floor, by the bed side, and in his left-hand jacket pocket I found the watch and a purse, with four shillings and four-pence in it- he put that jacket on when he dressed. I took him to the watch-house, and asked if he had got a watch - he said No. I said, "Have you got a purse;" he said, Yes, I have a metal purse, with two shillings in it;" I shewed him this watch and purse - he said he knew nothing of them - I do not think he had seen me take them from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell him you were an officer? A. No. I broke the door open, and told him I took him for ill-using a female. I thought him quite sober - he did not appear to have been drinking.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did McGregor shew you the watch? A.

            . I am a patrol. I was about thirty yards off when this was done. I saw Quarn down on the pavement in Duke-street, Bloomsbury, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and when I made towards him I saw two soldiers run from him - they were close to him, and ran off, evaded me, and got away. I made towards Quarn- he had then got up, and laid hold of another soldier, and gave him in charge. My attention was drawn to it by hearing a scuffle. I only saw two soldiers come from him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go before the Magistrate? A. Yes; I was sworn, and gave this account; my deposition was not taken down; I cannot say how the third soldier got there. Quarn accused him of being concerned in robbing him of his watch and money.</p>
               <p>PRICE's Defence. I have witnesses to prove I was not in the house for an hour and a half after Quarn came in. The landlord will prove he drew five pints of ale.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GOODWIN to THOMAS QUARN. Q. Did you never drink with me at the Two Brewers public-house, and gamble with me at the Queen's Head public-house? A. I never saw you before.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not frequently gamble with him at the Canteen? A. I have no recollection of him. I have been at different public-houses since I have been out of place; I do not gamble much, and have no recollection of gambling with him; I never played at dominoes with him. I have no recollection of playing with him on the 1st of this month, nor the night before the robbery. I have been at the Canteen in the King's-mews, but not with him, to my recollection. I do not think I played with any soldier on the 1st of May, at the Black Lion - I never recollect seeing him. I once went to the Black Lion with Child, and gave him 6d. to fetch something to eat, and they did get something.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by "They did get something?" A. Why, there were a great many soldiers there - I never paid for eggs and bacon for supper for the prisoner, that I know of - I know nothing about it. I do not recollect paying for any soldier's supper; I might have done so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GOODWIN. Q. Did you not come to me at the Rose and Crown, and drink beer and liquor, then go to the Black Lion, and give me the watch to go home with you to your lodging? A. No - on my oath I did not.</p>

Quarn left my house about five o'clock, and returned a little before ten; they went into the parlour - he, Child, and the prisoners, together, and drank three pots of beer; they came in as friends, and drank as friends, and as they went out had half-a-pint of gin; Quarn could not be sober - they had liquor enough to make them all drunk. After they had been out a quarter of an hour the four soldiers and him returned, and knocked at my door - I opened it with the chain; Child said, "Open the door, and let me and my friend in;" I said I would not unless it was for him to go to bed; he said he would not.</p>

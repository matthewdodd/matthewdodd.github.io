             thus depos'd. I was in company with the two Prisoners, at the breaking open this House: I cut the Groove, took down the Shutters and the Saines, crept in, opened the Door, and let them in, and we took away the Linnen and pawn'd some of it in Southwark, on the Day that Blewet and Burnworth were hang'd in Chains.</p>

             thus depos'd. Claridge and the Prisoner Cherry came together to my House, and pawn'd this Linnen to me for 15 s. but the Prisoner Claxton, was not with them. Cherry in his Defence said, that Claridge was his Brother in Law, and desir'd him to go with him to pawn that Linnen, which he did, but knew nothing of its being stoln. Claxton deny'd the Fact, and then they call'd their Witnesses.</p>

             thus depos'd. I am very positive sure that this Robbery was done by Claridge himself, for I saw him up and down thereabout, and I found the Woman Prisoner a Bed, after the House was broke open, and I had some Business that requir'd an earnest Concern, that I could not sleep, and I heard something of a Flusterating, and a great Laughing and a Talking, and therefore I knew that Claridge was all alone, and was about to Rob the House, for I saw him go up and down, and making preparation, and the Window Shutter was wrenched open with something of a Weapon: But as for the 2 Prisoners I have no Knowledge of them, nor never conversed with them in my Life, but I am sure that they are both very honest, and I believe that the Prisoner Cherry was perfectly call'd out to assist in the Robbery, after Claridge had made preparation for it.</p>

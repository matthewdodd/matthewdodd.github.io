                  </hi>. I am a traveller, and live in York-street, City-road. Between one and two o'clock in the night, on the 29th of May, I was at the Earl of Lettingham public-house—I went down stairs—a party came in behud' me, and pushed me, and at the same time another party extracted my watch from my right-hand waistcoat-pocket—the silk guard which was round my neck was cut with some instrument—I felt it go, and caught hold of an arm; and at the same time was thrown back against the stairs—I cannot say whit arm it was, but it was the arm which went to my pocket—the part of tiff guard</p>

               <p>attached to the watch, went with it—the other part remained round my neck—I saw somebody run out of the house—I followed, and caught him—he got from me twice, and got quite, away at last—he was dressed the same as the pri<lb></lb>soner, but I did not see his face—there were other persons coming down the stairs at the time—I believe the person I followed and caught, and who got away, was the person who took my watch, but cannot positively swear that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) About one o'clock in the morning of the 29th of May, I was in Whitechapel-road, heard a noise by the Earl of Let<lb></lb>tinghara, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!" I saw the prisoner running, and nobody else near him—there was a crowd further on—I did not see the pro<lb></lb>secutor at that time—I ran after the prisoner into five or six different streets—there was nobody running after him but a policeman—he got into a dark street, and hid by a heap of dust—I secured him, and asked what he ran away for—he said because he had struck two boys—he was shamming to be drunk, but he was sober—on the way towards the public-house he asked me whether there was a robbery—I had not said anything about a robbery, for I did not know what was the reason of the cry—I took him to the prosecutor, who identified him—the prisoner then complained of being struck by the boys, but I did not see any boys—there were two or three marks on hit face—he was bleeding at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner, Q.</hi> Did you see anybody running after me besides yourself! A, Yes, three policemen—I saw you run from the crowd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>, I ran away because a little boy hallooed after me, and said they would jump on me, and I went away to try to get home; I know nothing of the robbery; the prosecutor said at first be. could not swear to me at all, but the policeman got whispering to him.</p>

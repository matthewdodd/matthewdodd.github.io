I said, who are they? He mentioned two of their names to me; the next morning I took Binns, and another man took the other. I said to Binns you are my prisoner; he said for what? I said for a robbery done last night. Said he, robbery last night! I can prove I was at the Fourteen Stars in Rosemary-lane from nine in the morning till eight at night. I told him I must take him.

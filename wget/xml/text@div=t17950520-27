               <p>Mr. Fielding. I beg leave to read the promissory note before I put any questions to Mr. Courtoy.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the note which you supposed to be taken from you by this felony? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding hereupon objected to Mr. Courtoy's being examined, because on the face of the indictment there appeared to be a prospective interest in the person accused; and the person who has given rise to that prospective interest, cannot be suffered to be a witness to defeat that interest-The point was argued, and the court said they would go on with the other witnesses first of all, and see if they could do without Mr. Courtoy.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Courtoy? - I see him twice before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him if you was to see him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to your mistress the night before she was taken up? - Yes, he came about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing that passed between you and your mistress, whether she expected him? - Yes; she wondered to me why he did not come; she had wrote several letters to him. When he came he knocked at the door, and I let him in; he asked me if Mrs. Phipoe was at home? and I told him yes, and I asked him in, and shut to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she expect him that night? - No, I don't know that night particularly that she did expect him. After I had put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200079"></xptr>to the door and let him in, I went into the back parlour; I shewed him in the hall, while I went to my mistress; she was in the back parlour, I went to my mistress and told her that Mr. Courtoy was come, and would be glad to speak to her. My mistress then said, Mr. Courtoy! tell him I am very ill up stairs, and that I have got a fire in my room. and as soon as I have got my night cap on, I will come down stairs to him. So I immediately went and told Mr. Courtoy that my mistress was very ill up stairs, and as soon as she had got her night cap on she would come down to him. He was in the front parlour then, and he said, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did Mr. Courtoy go to? - He went into the front parlour; which my mistress went up stairs and down two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. What before she went to him? - Yes; and after she had gone up stairs and down two or three times she went into the parlour to Mr. Courtoy, and says, O, you are come; he says, yes, I am come to settle the business; mistress replied, very well, would he come up stairs, for she had got a fire in her room, she was very ill; which the gentleman replied could not the business be settled here? mistress replied no; could not he come up stairs, was he afraid? Mr. Courtoy said, no, he was not afraid. My mistress went up stairs then, and Mr. Courtoy followed her, and I followed with the candle. My mistress went up into the two pair of stairs front room, Mr. Courtoy followed after, and I with the candle. As soon as we had got into the front room in the two pair of stairs, my mistress seized hold of the gentleman's collar, as soon as mistress had hold of the gentleman's collar, she said to me, Mary, take hold of his back; which I did take hold of his back; and mistress and me pushed him into a two arm chair; which the gentleman called out for mercy; the gentleman says, have mercy. Theresa; my mistress replied, do you think a lady like me will be served so, by such an old rogue as you; which down by the side of the two arm chair there lay two pieces of cord.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the chair from the fire? - It was not a great way off; about the middle of the room With the two pieces of cord there lay a broad blue ribbon. My mistress put down his right hand to the arm of the chair, endeavouring to tie it down with the broad blue ribbon; which the gentleman resisted, he said he would do any thing that he could, but he would not be tied; he said, he would do what she desired him, if she would not tie him. Mr. Courtoy then got his right knee into the two arm chair, and with his left endeavoured to hold mistress off. My mistress had got a carving knife in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she get that? - From the table; there was another laid with it, it was a common size one, two of them we have in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else lay on the table besides this caraing knife? - Yes; the table was covered with black silk all over it; on the table were two brass candlesticks covered with black silk; there were two pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they were loaded or not? - No, I do not know. There was a wine glass had got some gunpowder in it, and on it some balls; that was all that laid on the table.</p>
               <p>Q.How were the knives, were they in their usual state? - No, they had black silk about the handles, both of them.</p>
               <p>Q.The gentleman still continued in the same posture with his right knee in the chair? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.For how long? - I cannot tell how long; but he was endeavouring to hold mistress off at his full length; at the same time my mistress held him by the collar, and had the carving knife in her hand;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200080"></xptr>my mistress was talking very much to him, and calling him a great many old rogues.</p>
               <p>Q.What did she say to him? - I don't know; but she was threatening him very much, and talked a language I did not understand, French, or some such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Conrtey reply in English, or in any other language? - No, in French, the same as my mistress. After that mistress was continuing the same language and Mr. Courtoy; I still had hold of the gentleman's back at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue in this posture? - I don't know exactly how long. After some time being in that way, mistress says, now I will tell you in English, it is not sit this girl should know what we are going to do, so she shall be sent out of the room; Courtoy replied, yes, yes; then I was sent out of the room, and left my mistress in the same posture as usual. After I had been down stairs about the value of a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, I don't rightly know which, my mistress then knocked with her foot; I was then in the kitchen, which the gentleman that was drinking coffee with my mistress in she back parlour, Mr. Caddle.</p>
               <p>Court. Had there been a gentleman drinking coffee with your mistress that afternoon? - Yes; he came there about four o'clock that afternoon. That gentleman heard my mistress knock with her foot, I being in the kitchen, he calls out, Mary, your mistress wants you; on which I came up stairs and went into the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistress was not there? - No, she was up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the back parlour? - Mr. Caddle. And I asked had for the candle, to be so good to lend me the candle, as my mistress had got mine; which the gentleman replied, yes, you may take it; or, by all means, or some such words. I went up stairs to my mistress; I found my mistress in the same posture as when I left oher, with the carving knife in her hand; Mr. Courtoy was in the same posture; my mistress said, is that gentleman still in the back parlour? - and I said, yes, ma'am; my mistress bid me desire him to walk up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire him? - Yes; by my mistress's order. After my mistress had bid me, I went out of the room where my mistress and Courtoy was, then I went down stairs into the back parlour, and I went to Mr. Caddle; and I told him that my mistress would be glad to speak to him; and he replied, very well; and went up stairs directly; and after he had been there sometime, he came down; he went up stairs by himself. After he had come down again, my mistress still remained with Mr. Courtoy, and I was in the kitchen, and the gentleman came down, and went into the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the back parlour? - As soon as you come into the house there is the front parlour, and then the back parlour. After Caddle had come down stairs, my mistress remained a quarter of an hour up stairs, and Mr. Courtoy too; and after a quarter of an hour or twenty mimy mistress knocked again with her foot very loud, which I heard in the kitchen; I went up stairs to her, and when I got into the two pair of stairs front room, she asked me if Mr. Caddle was staid in the house, in the back parlour? which I told her yes. My mistress was still in the same posture, with the knife in her hand; and Mr. Courtoy was still in the same posture as when I left him; she desired me to tell Mr. Caddle to come up stairs, she wanted him. I went down stairs and went into the back parlour to Mr. Caddle, and told him my mistress wanted him; which he replied, very well; and went up stairs directly. After a little time he came down, in the value of ten minutes or a quarter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200081"></xptr>of an hour, and staid down for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, it was not a great while. My mistress knocked her foot again, and I went up stairs, after I had got up the two pair of stairs I see the gentleman, Mr. Courtoy, sitting down in the two arm chair, with a table drawn before him, and writing on the table; my mistress gave me a pen, (she was still by the side of the table, with the knife still in her hand) she gave me a pen, and desired me to take it to Mr. Caddle that was in the back parlour; I took it down to Mr. Caddle, because my mistress said it wanted mending, and Mr. Caddle mended it; then my mistress knocked with her foot, and I took up the the pen and left it with my mistress and Mr. Courtoy both together.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Mr. Courtoy was sitting at the table, what was there on the table? - There was a pen, ink, and paper. I left the pen with my mistress and went down stairs again, and went into the kitchen then. After I went down stairs my mistress knocked again; after she had knocked, I went up stairs to her, and still found the gentleman writing, and she standing at the table; mistress had then got the carving knife in her hand, and which was covered with black silk; when I went into the room, she says, this man has spelt something wrong; which my mistress gave it to me, and desired me to take it down to Mr. Caddle.</p>
               <p>Q. What size paper was it? - A small piece of paper. (The bill shewn her) That is the piece I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read writing? - Yes, I can a little.(Reads.)</p>
               <p>"March 30, 1795. Two months date, I promise to pay Miss Mana Theresa Phipoe, the sum of two thousand pound, for the value received. John Courtoy, Oxendon-street."</p>
               <p>Q. You say that is the piece of paper. Did you look at it or no at the time? - I did; I looked at it to see which was spelt wrong of it; and I took it down to Mr. Caddle; he went into the back parlour, and he said it was spelt wrong, and he would copy it out how it was to be spelt; which he pulled out a pen and ink that he had got in his pocket, and after he had pulled it out, he wrote down on a piece of paper, and desired me to take it up stairs; which I took it up stairs to my mistress; my mistress looked at it and said, that would not do, she would have a fresh stamp; the gentleman that was sitting down in the two arm chair said, he could make that do; when he said he could make that do, I went down stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. What did your mistress say? - She did not say any thing. I went down stairs and stopped for some time down stairs; after about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour, mistress knocked with her foot again, she knocked so loud that I heard her while I was in the kitchen, when I heard her I went up stairs again; mistress asked me if Mr. Caddle was still in the back parlour? which I told her, yes; and she bid me tell him she wanted him; which I went down stairs, and told Mr. Caddle my mistress wanted him up stairs; which Mr. Caddle went up stairs directly; then he stopped up stairs a considerable time. I don't know rightly how long it was, he went into the room by himself. After he had been up stairs for a good while, then mistress knocked with her foot again; when mistress knocked with her foot, I went up stairs, and see the gentleman, Mr. Courtoy, in the two arm chair, sitting holding the pocket handkerchief to his fingers and his pocket handkerchief was very much bloody; my mistress desired me to go down stairs into the kitchen to the dresser drawers, and bring out a bit of white linen rag; she told me that Mr. Courtoy had cut his fingers and wanted a bit of rag to put about them. I went down stairs, and out of the dresser drawer in the front kitchen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200082"></xptr>I brought up a bit of white linen rag; I took it up stairs, and put it down on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. For Mr. Courtoy? - Yes; Mr. Courtoy was still in the two arm chair, and when I was there mistress gave me the key of the cellar, that she had, the wine cellar, and desired me to bring up a bottle of sherry; (Caddle was up stairs in the room with my mistress) I went down stairs, and went to the cellar, and brought up a bottle of red sherry, my mistress called it; and the cork screw, and two wine glasses; the bottle of wine Mr. Caddle took out of my hand, and he took the cork screw and pulled out the cork; I put down the two wine glasses on the table; my mistress took the bottle and and poured out the two glasses of wine; after she had poured out two glasses of wine, she offered Mr. Courtoy one to drink; Mr. Courtoy refused to drink it; my mistress said, do you think I want to poison you? no, I will drink one before you; I heard my mistress say she would drink one before him; I went down stairs, and they continued for some time, and after a while Mr. Courtoy came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards? - I don't know; not long first. My mistress followed after, and Caddle after; which my mistress had the two pistols in her hand when she came down stairs; my mistress and Mr. Caddle went into the back parlour, the same parlour where they had been drinking coffee; after they had got into the back parlour, Mr. Courtoy went into the front parlour, and when he got into the front parlour he took out his hat, and went out of the front parlour into the hall, and then went out of the door, when I got to the door with him, he said, good night, and God Bless you, and then shutting the door after him I came in, and went down stairs in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was that Courtoy left the house? - Past eleven o'clock. When I went down stairs my mistress and Mr. Caddle were still in the back parlour; after they had been there some time my mistress rung the back parlour bell; I went up stairs to mistress, and went into the back parlour to her; my mistress gave me a key of a bureau, that she had got up stairs, and desired me to go up stairs and fetch down the green pistol cases; she told me that Mr. Caddle was going to take the pistols home; I went up stairs, and in the first floor, back room, in the bureau, there I found the green pistol cases; I brought them down to my mistress. she was in the back parlour, still with the gentleman; when I got into the back parlour with the green pistol cases; mistress had got one pistol in her hand, the other was laying on the chimney piece; I put down the green pistol cases, and my mistress took them up; then I went down stairs into the kitchen again; then I left Mr. Caddle and mistress still in the back parlour together; about twelve o'clock Mr. Caddle went out, I heard mistress let him out; then after mistress had let Mr. Caddle out, I heard mistress go up stairs; when she went up stairs she brought down the two knives, and the black silk she took off the handles of them, and put them in a cupboard that there is in the front kitchen; after she had done she went up stairs, after she had been up stairs some little time, she came down stairs again, and went into the back parlour, and after being in the back parlour some time, she rung the bell for me to come up stairs, and I heard the bell ring. I went up stairs to my mistress; my mistress desired me to go up stairs, and go into her bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you usually sleep with your mistress? - No, I never slept with her before.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any observations on it? Did you see any thing on it? - I did not, I did on the blue sash that she had on, I see some sprinkles of blood; my mistress ordered me to go up stairs, I went up staris to bed, my mistress came too, we went to bed, and my mistress never said any thing more that night about the affair; the next morning I got up and got breakfast ready, and mistress came down to breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before your mistress was taken up after that? - After I got breakfast ready mistress came down to breakfast; after she had got her breakfast I went up stairs to make her bed; my mistress came up stairs while I was making the bed; she cut off a piece of cloth, which was on the two arm chair, that Mr. Courtoy had set in the night before; after she had cut off the piece of cloth, she was going about the room, and she said, make haste, Mary, and fetch the hair dresser, make haste, for I am going to town on some particular business; I made haste and went to fetch the hair dresser; she got herself cleaned, with a white dress on; after she got herself dressed, she desired me to go and fetch a coach, I went and fetched the coach, and brought it to the door, as she bid me; when she got into the coach, she desired me to tell the coachman to drive to No. 9, Mary-le-bone-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who lives there? - Mr. Caddle, who was drinking coffee with my mistress. The coachman drove away, and at about twelve o'clock my mistress came back again in the coach, and after she came in she went up stairs, and she went up stairs and took off her white dress that she had on; and after she had taken off the white dress, there came in a gentleman, who, my mistress told me, was the king's hair dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before your mistress was taken up? - After the king's hair dresser had been there a little bit. The gentlemen came about one o'clock, the officers from Bow-street, and took my mistress and me up.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you know the sash? - Yes, I should.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the cloth after it was cut from the chair? - I see it down stairs in the back parlour; my mistress had took it there I believe. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing was done to it there? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the gown that your mistress wore in the evening of the next day? - No, I did not; It was not a gown, it was a wrapper. (The note read by the clerk of the court.)</p>

               <p>Q. You are the officer of Bow-street? - Yes, I am. On Wednesday the 15th of April last, about one o'clock, I got to the house of the prisoner at the bar, No. 5, Han's-place. I knocked at the door. A young man came to the door. I asked if Miss Phipoe was at home? he said, no. In the mean time I was talking to him, in the passage, Miss Phipoe came up in the passage, the prisoner, in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200084"></xptr>mean time Mr. Courtoy, Carpmeal, and another officer came to the door. She ran down the kitchen stairs, shut herself into the back kitchen, I left Carpmeal and Mr. Courtoy in the passage with the young man, while I went down stairs after her. I found the back kitchen door fast; I forced it open, and there was the prisoner. With, that, I put my arm round her waist, in order to take her up stairs before me. We got about half way up the kitchen stairs, and she began to struggle very much with me, and at the same time had her left hand in at her pocket-hole. Carpmeal hearing the scuffle, came to the top of the stairs, and laid hold of her right hand; with that, with some difficulty, we got her into the parlour, and then set her in a chair. She kept her left hand very fast under her clothes, through her pocket-hole. I kept hold of her left arm. By two or three times forcing it, I got it out from under her clothes, with this pocket book in it, which contained the note. After I had taken this pocket book out of her left hand, which she had clinched in her hand, she said, there was a note in it. We made a further search about the house, in order to find the pistols that were mentioned, and the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the note? - The note was in the pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the note? - (a note shewn him) it is, my name is on the back of it. We searched the upper part of the house. I did not find any thing there, but some letters, and a bond. This letter was in a drawer in one of these rooms. I think in the back room one pair of stairs; that was all I found up stairs. The prisoner at the bar went down along with me into the front kitchen, and in searching in the closet of the front kitchen, there were a quantity of knives and forks and there were two in cases. I looked at them, and on this one I found some blood which I brought away that is all I know of it. We brought her and the servant girl away to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any part of any body's dress? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to apprehend any other persons indicted? - I went down to Chatham, after Mr. Caddle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Brown. How often had you seen Courtoy at your mistress's before? - Twice before this happened. He had been about a week before. My mistress denied that she was at home; but she was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see your mistress at any time when you see him there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(Shewn the knife) Was the knife that your mistress had in the evening like that? - It was like, but the handle was covered with black silk; we had two of these knives.</p>

               <p>Q. To Miller. Is that one of the papers that you found in the house? (A paper shewn him) - Yes, it is, and those two also.(Read by the clerk.)</p>
               <p>A letter addressed, Mr. Courtoy, Oxendon-street, Friday evening;</p>
               <p>"Sir, I am greatly surprised I did not see you this morning, in consequence of a letter I wrote you yesterday evening, concerning Miss Dechare. I am pretty well now; therefore, depend upon it, if you do not call early to-morrow, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200087"></xptr>the business I have often mentioned to you, I shall be at your house about eleven, where I shall take no denial, and then I shall know of Mrs. Smith what she has to say to me I shall then tell her, &amp;c."</p>
               <p>Q.To Miller. These two papers produced st, how were they? - Wrapped up together, in the form of a letter, one with the over, sealed up; it was broke open by Mr. Flood, the magistrate.(Read by the clerk.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Shepherd to Bague. Look at that paper in which the blank bond is enclosed, you know Mr. Courtoy's hand writing? - I think it is Mr. Courtoy's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at it. - No, I cannot say it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state that you believe it is? - I cannot say it is</p>

            . Is that your father's hand-writing? - I can swear, on my oath, it is not my father's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it like it? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding addressed the court, that in his opinion, the accomplice did not appear confirmed in a tittle of her evidence, therfore there was no case to go to the jury; on which account, he considered it to be unnecessary to ask her a single question in in the way of cross-examination. The court replied, the jury must be the judges, as they were to pass their belief on the evidence of the accomplice, and not him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Brown. You had lived with your mistress but five weeks before this happened? - Perhaps it may be two or three days above five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you had not lived with her. six-weeks? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mistress keep a good deal of company, or not? - No, not a great deal of company.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you leave her? - I went to prison, and my mistress too. I come from prison here.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen your mistress since you have been in prison? - No, I have not seen her since I came from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in separate prisons? - -Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen Mr. Courtey? - No, I have seen him only at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had some talk with him? - No, not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever come to you in prison? - No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nobody from him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you kept on the prison allowance? - No, the governor of the place gave me money whenever I asked for it; and Mrs. Phipoe sent me a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were taken up, and went to Bow-street, what did you think would become of you? - I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you afraid of any thing happening to you? - No, was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not conscious of doing any thing that was wrong? - No, I was not afraid.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you had been there six-weeks; no further intimacy with your mistress than during that six weeks? - It was not quite six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q.I don't quarrel about a day, about five or six weeks, and not more. You let<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200088"></xptr>Mr. Courtoy in that day yourself? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You let him out, and he said, good night, God bless you? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now we have the first and the last; now, little girl, what candles were alight this night? - Two brass candlesticks, covered with black silk; the candles in them candlesticks were alight in my mistress's bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many more were alight? - The candle I followed up with my mistress up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. And down you came, I suppose you knew your way in the dark? - Yes, I could find my way down.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Crddle, had he any candle? - Yes, one.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in the kitchen, had you any candle? - No, I had none there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you had two journies up and down stairs from the knocking? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went into the room without any ceremony? - Yes; but the first time I did not hear the knocking.</p>
               <p>Q. But when you went up stairs backward and forward, you went in at pleasure, there was no interruption? - I went in when mistress ordered and came out again.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Courtoy went up stairs, and saw these two pistols, you did not know they were loaded? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. The knife you say was covered with black silk? - Yes, two of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you had seen this so, you came down, were not you frightened? - Yes, but when Mr. Courtoy came there before, Mrs. Phipoe had made very free with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was comical, but you was not very much frightened? - No, I was not much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. This black silk about the candlesticks, and about the knives, they all appeared very comical, but you were not very much firghtened at them. However, you never went out of doors to get any assistance, or ask any body to come in? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. All through this you was not at all alarmed, and when Courtoy went away at last, he said, God bless you, and you thought there was no harm? - Yes, I see him go away.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you went to bed and slept hearty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I want to know how you get out of this fcrape, recollect where you put the candle, and by what light it was that you contrived to read that note? - I took it in my hand and looked at it, and went down stairs. I could not read it as I was coming down stairs, because I had no candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry it to Mr. Caddle? - Yes, I did. I just gave a look at it as I went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read pretty well? - I am not much of a great scholar.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot write? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. But you can read a little? - I can make out a little bit, no great matters.</p>
               <p>Q. After all this was over that night, you and your mistress went to bed, and there was nothing more said about it? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you a great deal surprised the next day, when you were taken by these fellows to Bow-street? - Yes, very much surprised.</p>
               <p>Q. All that had passed you thought comical, but it did not strike you at all to be dangerous; you only went in and out of the room where Mr. Courtoy and Mrs. Phipoe were, you went in once, and she sent you down for a pen, and she sent you down for another thing, and you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200089"></xptr>say Mr. Courtoy sitting by the table writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the paper, pen, and ink, provided by you? - They were on the table when I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never staid for any length of time to see what they were doing? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And they spoke French together the greatest part of the time? - Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a sort of thing that you did not understand? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, it is a very odd thing that there should be a little English in this, as to sending the girl out of the room, because it was not sit for her to know what they were going to do? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see Courtoy when he cut his finger? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How they came cut you don't know? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Being cut, of course there must be a good deal of blood get over the towels and napkins, and things that were there, and Mrs. Phipoe, being near she must have some on her? - Yes, I see it on her sash.</p>
               <p>Q. But what was done by Mrs. Phipoe and Mr. Courtoy, you don't know? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor did you see what they were doing of, except as you described? - No, they were writing.</p>
               <p>Q. But what was before the writing, or after the writing, you don't know as to their behaviour? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you at any time, while Courtoy staid, see him with any thing by which he could cut himself? - No; nothing but a pen in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. But he made no complaint to you at all? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you hear him cry or mourn? - Yes, he called out for mercy several times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. But he made no complaint to you? - No, he said nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding addressed the court, that there was not evidence sufficient to go on a Jury, as this promissory note could not be the subject of a felony, it having not been proved to have ever been in the possession of Courtoy at any time; he was followed by Mr. Gardiner; but the Court over-ruled the objection.</p>

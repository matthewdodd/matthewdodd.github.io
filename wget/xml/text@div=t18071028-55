On the 27th of September I was informed by my mother, that this man come out of the back of a house that is not finished, the trace harness was deposited in that house; I saw the prisoner go by, it was seven o'clock in the morning; I not being dressed, I asked Mr. Stanley, a publican, to lay hold of him, till I had dressed myself; when I came out, I took him by the collar from Mr. Stanley, and took him to the watchhouse; he begged of me to let him go, he said he did not mean to take the harness, only he had not got a knife to cut the leather off.</p>

               <p>Q. I am told it is not; you did not know any thing of this poor man yourself. - A. No otherways than knowing my own property.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find it in his possession. - A. No, not when I saw him.</p>

Yes; as I was rising in the morning, I saw the man; I did not take any notice of him at first; after that I saw a boy come and take a trowel off the cellar window; then I saw the window open, then I called my son; they both went away; the man had got a bag in his hand.</p>

            . I am a publican; I now live in Berwick-street, Soho.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live then. - A. In Margaret-street, Hackney-fields. On Sunday the 27th of September, about seven in the morning as I was taking the shutters down, I saw Mr. Green looking out of his window, he desired me to stop the man with the bag; I ran down the street after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner running. - A. No, he was then walking. When I had gone some way down the street, whether he saw me I do not know, but when I got within ten or a dozen yards of him, he set off running and turned a corner; when I came in sight of him he stood by a ditch full of water, I saw the corner of a bag a little way out of the water, I laid hold of it and pulled it out; then the prisoner ran away, I ran after him, caught him, and gave him up to Mr. Green. I then took the bag from the side of the ditch and carried the harness to the door, and there left it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. I understood you to say when you came up to him, he had nothing in his possession belonging to the prosecutor. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You called after him, he is deaf; you did not expect a deaf man to hear. - A. So, I since understand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Sunday morning I was going to see my brother, he belonged to the Tower hamlets; I crossed Hackney road to this street that leads to the Shoulder of Mutton and Cat fields; that gentleman says he called out to me, I turned round, I thought he was calling to somebody else; I crossed over a ditch; that gentleman followed me, he said, halloo my friend, you have got something that does not belong to you. I had a small basket on my shoulder with a bunch of grapes in it; I never had a bag, nor had I any harness.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

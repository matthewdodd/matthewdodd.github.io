             JUN. I am in partnership with my father. We are <rs id="t18111204-22-viclabel121" type="occupation">seedsmen and flourists</rs>

                  <interp inst="t18111204-22-crimeloc122" type="placeName" value="Lombard Street"></interp>

On the 18th of November, about eight in the evening, I observed the prisoner coming out of the warehouse with a bundle of mats on his shoulder, I let him pass me conceiving it to be one of our men. Immediately afterwards our warehouseman came and locked the warehouse, I asked him if he had delivered any mats to any person, he said he had not. I immediately followed the prisoner and charged him with taking the mats out of our warehouse. The prisoner said he was going to take them to the Bell and Crown, Holborn. I told him he had taken them out of our warehouse, he must take them from whence he had them, he returned with them down Lombard Street towards the warehouse, and then he told me that he had got them out of Thames Street. I told him I would go with him to the place from whence he had them. We were opposite of the Anchor public house in Water Lane. He threw the mats down and ran off, he ran up a dark passage, I followed him, he dared me to approach him, I immediately called for help and jumped upon him, and brought him down to the Anchor public house, he then said if I would not hurt him or those implicated with him, he would tell me the whole particulars how he came by them. I immediately sent home and they brought a constable, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp Q. Did not you understand him to say that he had them from the warehouse-keeper. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he with you. - A. No, he is gone. I have not seen him since the day after the affair happened. These are the mats, I believe they are our property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was never in his warehouse in my life, nor scarce know where it is, he has stated many things that are not true. I had these mats from his servant to carry to the Bell and Crown.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

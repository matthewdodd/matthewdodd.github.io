                  </hi>. I am a waterman. On the 13th of January, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was walking up High-street, Deptford, in company with a friend, and went into the Centurion to have some refreshment—the prisoner came in while I was there, and called me by name—I took no notice of her, but came out, and went to the Lord Duncan—I came out of there, and walked down High-street—I got into conversation with her, and between Downing-street and Effingham-place, she put her hand into my waistcoat pocket, took out my money, and ran away with it—I ran after her, caught her, and took her into the Lord Duncan, where my friend was—I told him I had been robbed of my money—he asked her if she had any money about her—she said she had not a farthing—he saw she had something in her mouth, put his hand to her cheek, and found there was some money there—she directly ran out—I ran out after her, called a policeman, and gave her in charge—one half-crown, one shilling, and one half-penny were found in her mouth.</p>

I was with the prosecutor on the 13th of January—in consequence of what he told me, I asked the prisoner if she had any money about her—she said she had not—I said, "If you have, you had better give it up to the young man"—she said she had no money at all about her—I said, "Don't say so, you have some in your mouth"—I put</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 159.) On Sunday night, the 13th of January, I was on duty in Broadway, Deptford, and saw Francis and the prisoner—he told me she had robbed him of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and desired me to take her into custody—I asked her if she had done so—she denied having taken any money at all, or having any—I took her to the station-house, and asked her to give me what she had in her mouth—she said she had nothing—I then took her by the throat, fearing she might swallow it, and she spat out a half-crown, and one shilling and one half-penny—the prosecutor was perfectly sober.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in South Audley-street, and observed the prisoner there and Mr. Demole - a carriage was coming by Mr. Alderman Wood's house - the prosecutor was in the thickest of the crowd - as the carriage passed I saw a boy go behind him, and make a motion. I thought he cut his seals off. I jumped over and laid hold of the prisoner, who was before the prosecutor; the boy got away. I saw the seal fall in the road, it appeared to fall from the prisoner. I secured him, and he denied it.</p>

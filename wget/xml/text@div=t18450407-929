                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, and live in Penny-fields, Poplar. On the 12th of March I was at the Bridge-road leading to Mill-wall, near the West India Dock, and saw a wagon coming from Garford-street—Anderson was driving it—it was loaded with hemp—Mullinger was on the top of the load—when it came to the Bridge-road the horses were stopped, and I saw a caravan with two horses driven up by the prisoner White—when White came up, he and Mullinger had a little conversation, and then he delivered part of the load of hemp to White, in thp caravan—they then drove away—Anderson drove the wagon, and White the caravan—I followed the caravan to the Poplar toll-bar, where I saw White pay the toll—I went to the toll-man, and found to whom the caravan belonged—I then went to the premises of Curling and Co.—I knew the wagon was employed for them—I met the officer—we went to Curling's premises, and took the prisoner Mullinger.</p>

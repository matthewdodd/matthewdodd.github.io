            . On the 20th of April as I was going through Eagle Court in the Strand, the Prisoner came up to me, and said, What have you got in your breeches? I put my hand to my breeches, and found my watch was gone. I took the Prisoner into the Street, and then into the Swan tavern. I sent for the guards, and took her before a justice - I had my watch about a quarter of an hour before - I had not been in any company, I had been in the city.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He had got two other women along with him, and he said I had got his watch, and had given it to another woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100010"></xptr>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. It was about nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. It was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know her then to be the person?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. Because we took her into the tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober then?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was an odd thing for a young gentleman to pick up a woman in the street, and was sober when you went about such a scandalous practice. Did not you charge two other women with it?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed no other but she and one more, what became of the other?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. There was a great mob about, and she got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how could you charge her with taking your watch when she had nothing upon her?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. There was another woman came up to her, and I belive she gave it to her, for I missed it before the other woman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she take it?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. She wrenched my breeches open, and then I suppose she took it. I never let her go after I took her till I carried her before the justice, for I charged her with it directly - I was going through Eagle Court, it is a thorough-fare, I did not go into the court with her.</p>

               <p>Mr. Forrest. I was coming along, I saw a quarrel, and looked into the croud, and saw Mr. Hoskins holding a woman (I think) by the collar, I assisted him, we got her into the tavern, she stripped herself, but the watch was not found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hoskins seem to be sober?</p>
               <p>Forrest. He did.</p>

            . I am servant to a fishwoman - I have seen the Prisoner come to my mistress's habitation. I was coming with a jole of salmon, and saw a gentleman (that last witness *) with two women, and they both had their clothes up in the court; so, says I, What do you go to play the rogue together, and they said get along you B - h, get along, and the woman pushed me down salmon and all.</p>
               <p>* Hobbins was mistaken, she did not know the Prosecutor from the witness, though they were very unlike. She delivered her evidence in a very odd manner, laughing most of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw two women with the gentleman?</p>
               <p>Hobbins. Yes; and they had both of them their coats up.</p>
               <p>Q. What women were they; was it the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hobbins. No, not this woman, for I went after the women for the salmon, for I knew my mistress would make me pay for it; so I said to the gentleman, you pushed me down, and the gentleman came up to the Prisoner, and said, you are one of the B - hes, and dragged her into the tavern. I stood a great while, and there came a great many soldiers, what became of the women afterwards I cannot tell; so, said my mistress, Do her all the service you can. - I am a Dutch woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you discern whether the gentleman was in liquor, you are upon your oath?</p>
               <p>Hobbins. Upon my oath he was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner one of the women who was in company with the gentleman?</p>
               <p>Hobbins. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pursue the other two women?</p>
               <p>Hobbins. He run after them, but he could not overtake them; oh! L - d G - d bless me, this is the gentleman [she then happened to see the Prosecutor.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He had a beggar woman before the justice.</p>
               <p>Hoskins. I had hold of another woman, I had two women in my hand once.</p>
               <p>Q. You swore positively that from that time you took the Prisoner, you did not let her go?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. I did not let her go.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hobbins. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Hobbins. It was dark, it was between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Jury to Forrest. Were Hoskins and you acquainted before?</p>
               <p>Forrest. I never saw Mr. Hoskins before.</p>
               <p>Jury. I think you say he was sober.</p>
               <p>Forrest. He was.</p>
               <p>Hobbins. He was very much in liquor.</p>

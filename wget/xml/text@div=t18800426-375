                  </hi>. I live at 6, Merton Road, Kensington, and am a gardener—on 26th March about 3 p.m. I saw the deceased, Joseph Olden, come out of the Builders' Arms public-house—the prisoner was outside close against me—Olden accused the prisoner of throwing water over him—the prisoner said "I did not do it"—Olden said "If you did not do it, you caused it to be done, and you shall settle for it"—he called the prisoner some awfully foul names, and said he would have some lads down that would make him settle for it—then he called the prisoner a b——snotty puppy—the prisoner said "If you call me that again I shall give you a smack in the face"—Olden then said "You b——I will have a go at you myself," end he pulled off his jacket and waistcoat, and threw them in the van—they then squared up to each other and commenced to fight—I could not say who struck the first blow—this was on the pavement—the prisoner Struck Olden under the arm with his right hand, and then with his left hand he struck him under the right jaw—Olden fell forward on one knee, and then pitched forward on his face at my feet—we set him up in a sitting position—some one brought some water, and I poured some into his bands and rubbed them—the whole thing did not last more than five or six minutes—I saw his jew drop, and said "The man is dead"—I have known the prisoner from a child; he was always a very quiet man—they were both Sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see anything till the deceased came out of the public-house—I could not say whether he was turned out; he came out without his hat, and it was thrown out after him—he was very much ex<lb></lb>cited—he commenced swearing as soon as he got out—the prisoner was the first person he spoke to; he was not doing anything to aggravate him; he tore off his coat and waistcoat in a great passion and squared up to the prisoner in a very excited manner.</p>

I work at a dairy in Newcomb Street, Notting Hill—on this afternoon I was coming by the Builders' Arms and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and Olden there and a mob of people—I pulled up behind Olden's van—he was standing on the pavement with his left hand on the top rail of his van talking to the prisoner—he said "I am only here by myself, but none the more for that I will have a b——go"—they then both took off their coats and fought—Olden hit the prisoner the first blow in the mouth—the prisoner then hit him under the left side with his right hand, under the heart, and with his left hand under the right ear, and he fell on his left side—two chaps picked him up and sat him on the pavement with his back to the van—I fetched some water and bathed his head—I saw his jaw drop and said he was dead—a surgeon was fetched and I left.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am Coroner for one of the divisions of the county of Middlesex—on Wednesday, 24th March, I held an inquest on Joseph Olden—I saw the body in the mortuary attached to the workhouse, lying on its back, wish the right side towards the window—I saw on the right side of the neck a pouch nearly as large as my fist, red, containing a sanguinous deposit, and discoloration around from effused blood: that would be the natural consequence of a blow on that spot, as there is a large, blood-vessel there which was ruptured—the shock would be sufficient to cause death; it was a very severe injury—I did not think it necessary to order a post-mortem examination—the prisoner was examined before me—I took his statement, read it over to him, and he signed it (<hi rend="italic">This staled that he was first attacked by the deceased on earning out of the public-house, and after repeated provocation he knocked him down.</hi>)</p>

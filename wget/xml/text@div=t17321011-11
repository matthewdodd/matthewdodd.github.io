He describ'd the Prisoner, I took him home to my House, and as soon as he saw the Prisoner, he said, that's the Man. The Prisoner then confess'd he had taken 'em, but said he was driven to Necessity, and intended as soon as possible to raise Money and fetch them again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told Mr. Marsh that I sold 'em for your use, and the Money I got for them was laid out in Necessaries for your House; you know that you sent me to pawn a Silver Seal at the Chandler's-Shop, for no Body would trust you for a Penny; and you have since moved off your Goods by Night.</p>

            . When Mr. Macqueen brought me to his House, the Prisoner told me, that he had sold other Books to Mr. Millan at Charing-Cross; we went to Mr. Millan's, and found one Book which the Prisoner said he had sold to him. From thence we went to the Anchor and Vine at Charing-Cross; Macqueen then said, that the Prisoner might go about his Business, for he would not prosecute him, and so the Prisoner was discharged. When he was gone, Macqueen threatened to prosecute me for receiving stolen Goods. He sent a Girl on some Message to his Wife, and when the Girl return'd, he ask'd her, who let her in, and she describ'd the Prisoner. I told him I thought it was very strange, that he should still harbour a Man whom he pretended had robb'd him. He said, if I would get his Books from Mr. Millan's, I should come to no harm; I told him I would not trust to that, and so I got a Constable, went to his House, and apprehended the Prisoner.

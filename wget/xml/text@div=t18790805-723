                  </hi>. I am a tiresmith, of 21, Wharfdale Road, Islington—on 28th June, about 8 p.m., I left my house perfectly safe—there is a stair-case window not more than 8 feet from the ground, which I found open when I returned at 11 o'clock—when I opened the hall door the gaslight shone in from a public-house opposite, and as soon as I put the key in I found marks of a crowbar—I went into the kitchen and lit the gas, and then came up and found several matches on the floor, which had been lighted and a match box, which was not there when I went out—there were footmarks on the window sill and on the carpets—I missed nothing.</p>

On 28th June, I was on duty in Wharfdale Road, five or ten minutes before 9, and saw the prisoners loitering about in a very suspicious manner—I watched them—Pearce knocked at the door of No. 21, which is a corner house, no one answered, and he went to the other two, who were standing at the corner of the street—they conversed a short time and all went into the doorway—Stannard seemed tampering with the lock of the door while the others covered him—they were there five minutes; they then went to the corner and conversed and Pearce went away, but came back and joined them and they all went into the doorway of No. 21—a baker and another man came up and disturbed them, and they went into the New Wharf Road and</p>

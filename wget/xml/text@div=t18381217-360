                  </hi>. I am barn-man to Mr. Sherborn, at Bedfont. He has a barn in a rick-yard there, called Spencer's Barn, and a field called the Thirty-two Acres—on Saturday, the 3rd of December, and for a fortnight before then, I was employed in the barn, threshing the wheat which came from that field—there was no other wheat in the barn at that time, than that which came from that field—there was about fifteen or sixteen quarters of wheat in the chaff, lying on the barn-floor on the Saturday, in a heap—I fastened up the barn that evening at five o'clock, quite safe, and gave the key in at Mr. Copas's house—he is Mr. Sherborn's bailiff—I went to the barn again on Monday morning, about six o'clock—it was dark then—I fetched the key from Mr. Copas's—I found the lock of the barn was not as I had left it—it was turned up—I had left it down—it still remained locked—I unlocked it and went in, but did not notice the heap till about seven o'clock, when I found it mixed, not as I had left it, and five, six, or seven sacks of wheat gone—the witness James Withall came into the barn to breakfast that morning, and in consequence of what he said I went with him, and searched round about the barn—the ground was soft, and I ob<lb></lb>served footmarks of two persons, in a direction from the barn—Withall traced them, I did not—I produce a sample of the wheat from the barn.</p>

                  </hi>. In the early part of this month I was working at Mr. Sherborn's farm, as a labourer. On Friday, the 30th of November, after I took my money, I was with a man named Tilliard, and Trundell at Gammon's public-house—Tilliard asked me, in Trundell's presence, what was in my master's barn, which is called Spencer's Barn—I told him some wheat—Tilliard said he wanted to make a sovereign for rent between this and Christmas, and he must have some of it—I told him to mind he was not <hi rend="italic">cathed</hi> at it—I went to work about six o'clock on the Monday morning, and saw Neele about eight o'clock in the barn—I went with him round the rick-yard, and saw some foot-maiks—I did not tell him whose I thought they were—I followed them in the direction they went—they led towards Gammon's premises, which are about 200 or 300 yards from Spencer's Barn—they were both from and to the barn—I afterwards saw the patrol compare Trundell's shoes with those foot-marks, and they appeared like then—I continued to work for Mr. Sherborn a week after this—I then staid away for two days, and when I came back Mr. Sherborn would have nothing more to do with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are sure you did not say whose shoe marks they were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nothing of the kind—I said I thought I knew them, and that I thought I knew where the wheat was gone to—I do not think I told Neele that they were Trundell's foot-marks—I did not say so till after I lad been to Mr. Gammon's—then I did, but not at first—it was in the tap<lb></lb>room of the public-house that Tilliard spoke to me about the barn, about six. o'clock—there were several people there, I cannot say how many—I do not know whether he meant to speak it secretly—he did not whisper to me—he spoke loud enough for me to hear—I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther others heard it—he did not halloo as loud as he could—he spoke in a low tone—I was close to him—other persons were at the same table—our conversation was not all about wheat—it was not about sheep, that I know of—I was drinking with Tilliard—I had a pint of beer with him<lb></lb>I cannot say whether Trundell heard what Tilliard said or not—my con<lb></lb>venation was with Tilliard, and I was drinking with him, not with Trun<lb></lb>dell—he sat next to Tilliard—he was there like any of the other persons—I have been here before—I was accused of stealing a watch, but no bill was found against me—I was never taken up for robbery before—I was never before a Magistrate but once before in my life—that was for leaving my wife, about five years ago—I was never in custody for any thing else—I work at various places, wherever I can get work—I never was in Jen<lb></lb>kinson's custody but once, that was when I left my wife—I knew Tilliard very well—I have drank with him sometimes, not very often—I have often seen him at the public-house—he was born and bred at Bedfont—I was never taken up on suspicion of murder—they took me in charge for running away from my wife, and they asked me while in custody for that, if I knew any thing about the murder at Bedfont, but I brought witnesses to prove where I was that night and the night before—that is five years ago—the charge about the watch was about six months ago—I did not see the shoes taken off Trundell's feet—I saw them compared against the gate, the post if the barn, and several places.</p>

               <p>the 3rd of December, I received information and went to the bam, and ex<lb></lb>amined about the rick-yard—I saw the patrol compare some shoes with the foot-marks there, and in my judgment those shoes made the foot-marks—they were in the rick-yard where the barn stands, and also in the way to Mr. Gammon's premises from the rick-yard—Withall afterwards showed me some sacks of wheat, three of which had Mr. Sherborn's name on them—I com<lb></lb>pared the grain in them with the bulk in the barn, and in my judgment it had formed part of the bulk that was there on the Saturday, and which came from the thirty-two acre field—it had a quantity of wild oats among it—the wheat in the sacks was not cleaned, nor was the wheat in the barn—in my judgment they had formed part of the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the horse patrol at Bedfont to pro<lb></lb>duce samples of the wheat found in the loft, and that in the barn. On Mon<lb></lb>day morning, the 3rd of December, about half-past eleven o'clock, I went to Mr. Sherborn's, and in consequence of information I accompanied him to Gammon's stable—I found the loft door fastened inside—you have to go up a ladder from the stable into the loft—the stable-door was unfastened—I found some hay at the far end of the loft, which I removed, and under it found five sacks of wheat, three of which were marked with Mr. Sherborn's name—I took the prisoner Bavin into custody directly—he was down in the yard at the time—I then went and took Trundell at the Black Dog tap, about 150 yards from Gammon's—I took of his shoes, and compared them with some foot-marks in the rick-yard—they exactly corresponded—I tried them to six or seven impressions—two in the rick-yard, and others across the meadows, in a direction to Gammon's yard—it was not along the high road, but over fences and gates—there was a faint impression in Gammon's stable-yard, but I could not identify that—there was a little wheat scattered about in the yard leading up to the stable door, and some at the stable door also—I compared both Trundell's shoes—the right shoe was particularly remark<lb></lb>able, having a half-tip on the heel, four nails on the other half of the heel, and seven rows of nails on the sole—one nail was missing from near the toe, and that was also missing in the impression—the tip and four nails at the heel were also in the impression—I have not been able to find Tilliard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you the shoes here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he had but that one pair to wear—they were laced shoes—it had rained in the night, which made the impression in Gammon's stable-yard faint, as it was gravel—it did not affect the others—as the soil was soft—I did not compare Til<lb></lb>liard's or Withall's shoes—Withall was there in the morning, and of course he left foot-marks there—I knew Withall before—I have only had him in charge once—I took him on suspicion of the murder—there was a half-tip on both Trundell's shoes—they were not old, about two or three months old—they were very good.</p>

            ; about two o'clock in the night, on the 7th of October, I heard the watch cry the hour, soon after, heard the latch lifted, thought the lodgers might be coming in; there is a little window on the side of the door, I heard the glass shake, then there is a fence round the back kitchen window, I heard move twice; I heard a scratching on the kitchen window, down on the wall near the kitchen window, almost a yard and a half from the ground, as if there was a slipping down of something, then I heard the window pulled down; the sash draws down, the top sash, then I heard the lock of the back kitchen window smack, it makes a loud smack when it shuts, and the door open, which creacked; I was in a great fright, I waked my husband, told him somebody was got into the house; my husband listened with me, they were on the stairs we thought, I listened till they came to the parlour door, I called out, who is there, nobody answered, he got out of bed, I begged he would not open the door, but call the watch, which he did; when the watchman came in they searched the house; I know the prisoner at the bar, he lived in our house almost a year and a half, since that time there never was any intimacy between him and my daughter, she is sixteen years old; I keep no servant, my daughter does the work of the house; they found the street door and back door safe, my daughter shut the latch, and she brought the key of the house to me; the rule is to lock the door and put it in the fore kitchen, and that key was brought to us.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>My daughter is sixteen, I cannot tell the prisoner's age, I never heard of it, they were never play-fellows together; I had been asleep, and waked when the watch went two,</p>
               <p>Have you, and your husband, and daughter, had any conversation about it? - We have spoke to it again.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect your husband encouraging your daughter to swear against him, or tell her she should be chained to the floor if she did not? - No, sir; I never heard of such words; he was not taken up for this affair, not upon bail for it; I never saw my daughter and him together; his sister and brother lodged there a year and an half.</p>

               <p>Did they keep company together while he lodged there? - Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How was the front room occupied? - There was a carpenter and his wife lodged there; there is a butcher and his wife in the first floor, and in the garret a woman and her husband there.</p>

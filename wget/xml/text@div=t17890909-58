               <p>I am a butcher; on the 17th of August, on a Monday, the prisoner at the bar came to my shop in the afternoon; he told me he had the misfortune to have a sheep returned upon his hands by his master; and that his master had stopped his wages; the sheep had been lost two days; and begged my boy might kill the sheep; I gave him leave; and he brought the sheep at seven in the evening, with three others; and my boy killed the sheep; I saw it the next morning; and seeing it was so good a sheep, I thought no person would return it upon his hands; at nine the next morning, he came to ask if it was killed; I asked him whose sheep it was? he told me Mr. French had returned it upon his hands; he afterwards asked me to let my boy kill one of the ewes? I told him he should not, and desired him to take them away; he told me his master had bought a score of sheep; and that he had twenty-one; I went to Mr. French's, to inform him I had a sheep that was killed last night; and would be glad he would send somebody to look at it; he was out of town; but one of his men came and looked at it, who swore it was his master's sheep; he knew it by a mark I. C.; and marked down the rump with oker; the prisoner came in the afternoon, to know if I had sold the sheep; I told him it was sold; but desired him to stay a little; mean while, I sent for a constable, and he was mitted.</p>

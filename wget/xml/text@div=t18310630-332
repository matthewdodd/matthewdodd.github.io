               <p>Corbyn. Q. Did you count your money? A. I counted it about two minutes before I laid my head down - there were a good many men and women in the house; I might have been seen to count it.</p>

            . I went into the White Hart with a friend about nine o'clock, to have a pint of beer; Dunn sat in a box opposite me, reading a book - I saw the prisoners sitting in the next box to me; when Dunn fell asleep they went over to where he was sitting - I was not in the house above five minutes; nobody but Dunn and the prisoners were in that box - I saw Robinson sit down by his side, and put her band into his pocket, while Curbyn stood before her to conceal her: they did not stop five minutes - he was asleep when they left the house; I had not seen him count his money - I told a man who was in the box with me, that I would go over and tell him; he advised me to have nothing to do with it, and I did not tell - when Dunn missed his money, he came over and asked if I had seen any body pick his pocket; I pointed Robinson out, who stood at the tap-room door - he went over, and told her if she would give him part of it back, he would say nothing about it; she said, "Go and look for your money," and then he gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Robinson. Q. Did you not see me sitting in the same box as your friend? A. No: when Robinson was taken I went home - Corbyn was taken in about a quarter of an hour; I am a char-woman.</p>

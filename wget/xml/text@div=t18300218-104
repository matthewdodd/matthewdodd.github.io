I lost a great quantity of plait within the last three months; I found out one of the thieves, who was tried and convicted yesterday - the prisoner did live in Little Wild-street.</p>
               <p>JANE BAKER. I am in the straw bonnet line. I bought about twenty scores of plait of the prisoner, at three different times, just before Christmas; she said she was selling it for a person in the business, who had lost the use of her limbs by sitting in a draught, that she was going to the hospital, and was obliged to sell it for tea and sugar; this is a part of what she brought - I gave her a shilling for this bit.</p>
               <p>JOHN AUSTIN. To the best of my knowledge this is part of my property, but I should not like to swear to it; I took other witnesses to Bow-street, but they did not think it necessary to examine them. The prisoner said she had it of the soldier, who was convicted in the other Court yesterday.</p>

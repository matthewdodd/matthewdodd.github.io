                  </hi>. I am foreman to Charles William Waterlow, a builder, in Bunhill-row. On the 3rd of June, I received information about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, and went into the premises at Nos. 66 and 67, London-wall, which are under repair—the prisoners were all employed there—Moore was a bricklayer, and the others are labourers—I had that morning given Moore orders to remove a sink—about half-past one o'clock I was called into the cellar to supply some oak to cover over a sink—I did not see anything at that time, but I watched and saw Bains look out of the warehouse-door two or three times—he left the warehouse, crossed London-wall, and went down Blomfield-street, and in a minute or so, Driscoll came out of the warehouse with a basket on his shoulder and went after him—a policeman was with me—we followed—I overtook Driscoll in Bloomfield-itreet, and took the basket off his shoulder—Bains was a little way a-head of him, and I desired the policeman to take him—I found in the basket about 40lbs. of lead—I did not know the lead—I believe the premises belong to Mr. Waterlow's father.</p>

On that morning, about half-past ten o'clock, I saw Moore and Bains taking down the sink-after it was taken down, I saw Moore take out of the front wall a leaden trunk, and give it to Bains—it was not attached to the sink—it was for the use of the sink—I saw Bains take it into the back cellar—Driscoll began to beat it up in the cellar—I gave information—I remained on the premises till twelve o'clock, when I went to dinner—when I came back be<lb></lb>ween</p>

               <p>one and two, Driscoll and a man named Kelly were knocking up the lead again—Mr. Sims came down to get some planks to cover a cesspool—I then saw Driscoll put the lead into a basket and take it out—he passed me with the basket on his shoulder he could see me very plainly—Moore was there at the time, another bricklayer, me and another labourer—I did not see what became of Driscoll, and the lead afterwards.</p>

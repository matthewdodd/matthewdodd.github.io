On the 30th of May, at eleven o'clock at night, my house was fastened up - I was disturbed at half-past two, by glass breaking; I got up, and found the shop shutter forced aside, and a square of glass broken; I called Stop thief! through the window, then opened the door, and the watchman brought the prisoner up; several articles were handed to me, some off the pavement; I missed a quantity of rings and jewellery.</p>

            . I am a private watchman. On the 30th of May, at half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was on my beat in Whetstone-park, and heard a rattle spring; the prisoner came running through Feathers-court into Whetstone-park - I stopped him - he said "Oh! Sir, what have I done," and fell on his knees. I took him back to Ryan, who was following him - he was searched, but nothing was found upon him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. At two o'clock I saw the prisoner and another man standing at the corner of Feathers-court, Holborn - I am certain of him, for I took particular notice of them. I said it was a wet morning - he said, "It is watchman" - I went my round, returned in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220022"></xptr>him parting from the other man; he crossed towards Hanson's shop; I went and sat in my box for five minutes, and then heard a cry of Stop thief! I looked, and saw him stooping down from the prosecutor's shutters - he ran up the street very fast, through Feathers-court - I sprang my rattle, and before I could overtake him Golding had secured him; I am sure he is the man - I only lost sight of him as he turned into the court; we took him to the watch-house; I went into Feathers-court, and picked up a phosphorus-box and matches; I went to Mr. Hanson's, and some of the property was found by the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Hoare, the Registrar of the Bow County Court—I know the defendant as manager of the London Creditors' Agency, of 40a, King William Street; before 25th February I had known him as acting for suitor's at the County Court—I knew a clerk of his who came to the office on 25th of February—I am not sure of the time, Mr. Tijou took the affidavits marked A and B; one affidavait purports to be sworn by Mr. Guerrin, before Mr. Lovett—I noticed on that affidavit some alterations which were not initialled; the other affidavit was sworn by Mr. Bennett, before Mr. Gover—there were some irregularities on that, but I did not notice them myself—I did not examine it; they were afterwards returned to the defendant by post—I reported what occurred the same afternoon, and on the 26th I saw these affidavits, A and B—I did not see them till about 3 o'clock—the affidavit A purports to be sworn by J. C. Bennett, before H. A. Lovett, on 26th February; B is the one that was sent back; A was sent in substitution for one of the other two that were returned—I noticed on B some initials, which were not there when I sent it back—Mr. Tijou spoke to Mr. Hoare about it—on the 1st March, a letter was written to Mr. Ault, and before he could have received it, he called and saw Mr. Hoare in my presence—the affidavits were there, and this letter D, dated 26th February, signed with the prisoner's initials—I think Mr. Hoare first spoke; he said "I have just written to you." Mr. Ault said "I have called in consequence of something I have heard from Mr. Lovett, about some affidavits; it is a serious business for me." Mr. Hoare replied that it was a serious business. Mr. Ault then said, "Perhaps you would allow me to give my version of the affair," or words to that affect—Mr. Hoare said "Certainly, sit down"—he then sat down,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187508160004"></xptr>
               <p>and said that on the affidavits being returned from the Court to him, and knowing that one of them was sworn before Mr. Gover, who objected to initial alterations without have the affidavit re-sworn, he had prepared a fresh one himself in its place, that was the affidavit marked A—he said "I prepared this affidavit and gave it with the one marked B, to a clerk or canvasser in my employ, of the name of Shown"—he stated that Shown had also drawn his journey money to go to Millwall, to bring the deponent to the City, and that he had brought them back to him the following morning, apparently correct, and he then at once enclosed them in a letter to Mr. Hoare—the letter marked D was then shown to him, and he said "Oh, that is the very letter"—Mr. Hoare then said "Do you know anything about this man Shown, what sort of character has he"—he said "Well, he was recommended to me as a good canvasser, and I employed him in can<lb></lb>vassing in my business in making inquiries as to addresses, but I was told by the person from whom I had his character, that whilst he was a very good man of business, it was just as well if he did not have too much to do with money matters"—Mr. Hoare then indicated that the other affidavit, B was also a forgery, and Mr. Ault said "Yes, no doubt," he also said that the "J. C. Bennett," and "H. A. Lovett" on the affidavit A he recognised as Shown's handwriting, and he believed the initials to B were also Shown's—as he was leaving, he asked Mr. Hoare whether he should send Shown down, and Mr. Hoare said "Oh, no, I don't want him, I can do no good with him," or something of that sort.</p>

I am Registrar of the Bow County Court—about the end of February my attention was called to some affidavits—I afterwards saw these affidavits, A and B—I was informed by my clerk that he had already made inquiries about them—I wrote a letter to the defen<lb></lb>dant, more particularly about another matter; but before it could have reached him, he came to <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. on the 1st of March—I was in my own room there, and Mr. T. Couthery, and Mr. Tijou—I knew him before—I Bad some conversation with him about these affidavits—I reported the matter to the Judge of the County Court—under a recent Act of Parliament, a summons at once issues upon these affidavits—judgment is obtained without a hearing, unless there is a defence upon the merits—they are filed in the regular way, and then summons and process issues.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Bow County Court—on the 25th February I saw two affidavite, one of them was that marked B, the other was an affidavit sworn by Bennett—the two affidavits were given to a boy, about 15 or 16 years of age, named Ault, I believe the prisoner's clerk—they were returned on Thursday afternoon the 25th, they were irregular; afterwards the affidavit B and a fresh affidavit A were sent to the Court in a letter—I was present part of the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On the Thursday when I saw young Ault I pointed his attention to the B affidavit, which was then uninitialled—it was arranged that the initials of the commissioner should be supplied, and that that affidavit and the other should be returned by post next day—the alter<lb></lb>ations were in the Christian name, Joshua, and in the description of the trade, nothing else; the plaint could be issued without the affidavit being filed.</p>

I am an attorney and solicitor of 48, King William Street, City—I am a commissioner for administering oaths for the three Common Law Courts, I have known the defendant, between two and three years, as connected with the London Creditors' Agency, almost immediately opposite my office—I have been in the habit of swearing a large number of affidavits for him—I keep a monthly account, and when an affidavit is sworn I make an entry in my book as nearly as possible, sometimes I swear twenty a month—sometimes I charge 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sometimes less, it depends upon circumstances—I never initial an alteration without the affidavit being resworn—I think I know the defendants writing—I should think the body of the affidavit marked A is filled up in his writing—I have some little doubt about it—I am rather inclined to think it is his—the signature "H. A. Lovett" I should say is not mine—it is such a close imitation that it is really almost difficult to say whether it is or not—I have no entry in my book of an affidavit sworn by Bennett, on 26th October—the signature "H.

On 2d April I was in Devonshire-square, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner and a man, about 5 o'clock in the evening, and followed them to Mary-le-Bonne-street—just before they reached the corner of Wimpole-street, the man gave the woman a loaf, and about two minutes afterwards he pulled something from his pocket and Beckoned towards Mr. Chandler's shop—the prisoner went in, and the man went the reverse way—the prisoner came out and went after him, but had not time to join him, as I went up to her—I told her I should like to know her Business at Mr. Milton's shop—she said that it was nothing to me—I then told her that I was a police-sergeant—she had she left hand closed, and</p>

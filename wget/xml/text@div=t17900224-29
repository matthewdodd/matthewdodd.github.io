               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. This was on the 17th of this month? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was dark? - Yes; and a great number of people in the shop; I had two pieces of the same linen, and both marked alike.</p>
               <p>You would not be able to swear to this piece only? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>You pursued him into Brownlow-street? - I did, and took him; and left the linen, which was picked up by some person, and brought to my shop; but I do not know by whom.</p>
               <p>That person is not here? - No.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Holroyd in Gray's-inn; a barrister at law I was coming down Holborn on the 17th instant, Ash-Wednesday: I saw a person lift up a bale of linen at Mr. Thwaites's door; the man that was in the act of taking it up, did not appear to me to be their porter, or shop-man; I went into the shop, l gave information of it, and Mr. Thwaites immediately pursued him, and took him; I remained in the shop till he was brought back: I went to the justice; and I verily believe that the prisoner at the bar is the man that took it from the door of Mr. Thwaites.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This happened to be about six, or a quarter after six? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This piece of linen you say was of a whitish colour, and taken from the outside of the door, close to the threshold? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Candles were lighted in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When at the justice's you saw the prisoner: did you know him? - Yes; but I am very sorry to say one of Mr. Thwaites's men pointed him out to me; but I know he was the man.</p>

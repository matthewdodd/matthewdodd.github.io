            . I am a marshal of the City. On the 28th of June, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the prisoner's house, No. 4, Cock and Hoop-yard, Houndsditch, and found a box there containing the property stated in the indictment; when I entered the room the prisoner was sitting in the front-parlour, with the box before him - his hands were in it; he appeared to be counting the articles out; I asked him who they belonged to - he said they were his own, and he could show me a bill of parcels of them; I asked him to do so, but he said he was so confused that he could not find it then; no bill of parcels has ever been produced; I took him into custody with the articles; Mr. Reece saw them two or three days afterwards, and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How far is his house from Piccadilly? A. I should think two or three miles - there seemed all sort of things there; I do not know that he attends sales.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there any appearance of a shop? A. Not the least; nor were there any shelves to deposit property on - it was quite a private parlour.</p>

            . I have a warehouse in Piccadilly, nearly opposite the Burlington-arcade. I have seen all the property produced, and examined it - it is part of what was stolen from my house on the night in question.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How have you been sworn? A. On the Testament; I consider that oath not only binding on my conscience, but on my soul - I never doubted about a future state. I have a very large stock of smelling-bottles - they constitute a family; I know them by their features; here is a cut-bottle with a gilt top, which had been broken, and has been mended - it had been filled with salts before it was mended, and the smell still remains in it; my salts are of a peculiar compound - there is an article in them which nobody else puts, and by that I know the scent; here is another with the face of the Duke of Wellington on it - I made no mark on them, but I know them from their general appearance, and the salts that are in them; my young man purchased them from the manufacturer; I do not believe I have sold two of this sort; here is one filled with a sponge of a particular shape, and one with a tarnished silver top, which I can swear to, as well unto a man's countenance - it had got tarnished by the gas.</p>
               <p>Mr. ALLEY. Q. They had got tarnished by the gas? A. Yes; they were kept near the gas, and became tarnished; one has a particular bruise on it, which I can swear to.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do not all plated or silver goods tarnish by being kept some time? A. Yes; we have had these three or four months; here is a bottle, with a peculiar smell, which I can swear to; I swear conscientiously, that no salts like these are kept any where else; they cannot be exactly like ours; the composition is our own; we have had this peculiar scent three or four months; we may have sold fifty bottles with it; we fill bottles when they are brought to us; these bottles are made by Gilbertson; his porter brings them to us; I have been to his house - he is an engraver and a chemical apparatus maker.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you had many from Gilbertson with gilt tops? A. About half a dozen; here is one with a portrait of the Duke of Wellington - another with a bruise, which I can swear to; I believe them all to be ours.</p>

            , were examined on behalf of the prisoner, and deposed to their being in his company, at the Surry Theatre, on the 23d of June.</p>
               <p>Mr. ALLEY. My Lord, this robbery was on the 16th - this evidence has nothing to do with the case.</p>
               <p>PHILIP PHILLIPS. My Lord, I can prove where he was on the 16th, as well as on the 23d; I was asked about the 23d before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120034"></xptr>Q. What have you to say about the 16th? A. On the 13th I received an order for goods, and on the 14th and 15th I was getting them ready; (I am a watch-maker, and occupy the first-floor at No. 4, Cock and Hoop-yard) on the 16th I was very poorly, and was taking salts, and stopped at home all day - and at that time the prisoner was very bad, and attended by Dr. Keith; he did not go out all day, for he was very ill - and on the 17th, which was Sunday, I left him to walk with my wife to Highburybarn; I got home about nine o'clock, and sat with him till ten, when I went up to supper - I returned and sat with him (which is not uncommon) till I went to rest. I have locked the street door myself every night for the last ten months, to preserve my property; I locked him in that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were you told it was material to prove where he was on the 16th? A. I was not told to prove it at all; I knew there were two indictments against him; I was first given to understand this indictment was on the 23d, and afterwards on the 17th. Mr. Wooler told me it was on the 23d.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he tell you it was on the 16th? A. He told me that last Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you then, when you were first examined, no to mention a word about the 16th? A. Because I was not asked. I recollect very well where he was on the 16th- my wife was with me, but she is not here. Dr. Keitch lives in Somerset-street, Goodman's-fields; I asked him to come here, but he said his profession would not allow it, he was so very busy; I did not call on him myself; I sent to him last week; I have not desired him since to come; my wife is very well: she knows as much about the prisoner being at home on the 16th as I do; I did not think it necessary to bring her - I do not know what was the matter with the prisoner - no doubt it was some internal complaint; he was at home also on the Sunday.</p>

            . I recollect Mr. Lyons being taken ill on the 15th, and he was ill the next day; I have boarded in his house for two years. I am sure he was not outside the door on the 16th.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What part of the house do you occupy? A. I boarded with Mr. Lyons, and live in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have an opportunity of seeing what business is carried on in his room? A. I am not in his room all day; I do not know what business is transacted there; I went under an operation at Guy's Hospital on the 19th of April, and since that have been in the habit of laying down two or three hours every day - I cannot say what happens when I am asleep. The officers awoke me up when they came. The prisoner occupies the second floor - I sleep on the ground floor, but in the day time lay down on his bed; he is down-stairs in the day time, for he also occupies the front room on the ground floor, and I have the back room ground floor at night also; I went to bed on the 16th, about eleven o'clock, after he had had retired to rest.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you let yourself in? A. Mr. Phillips always locks the door, and takes the key up with him; he left the house on the 23d, to go to the play. I was desired to come here to-day, but was not told to prove any thing about the 23d.</p>
               <p>MR. COPE re-examined. The house in question is in the City.</p>

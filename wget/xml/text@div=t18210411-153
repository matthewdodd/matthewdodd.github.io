I called Stop thief! and they called out also. I saw the prisoner throw some of the property over the rails of a yard; I knew him before, and went to his father's - he was not at home. When I got home, I missed a salt-holder, stand, and tumbler; a man produced the stand from over the rails - It was in my shop just before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. By what do you know it - A. I have more at home. He was not at home. I went out and took him in the street, he was dressed in a brown coat; I think I can positively swear it was brown. I knew him by sight very well before. I did not want any thing from his father to settle it. I know where the other boy is, but do not wish to trouble my head about it.</p>

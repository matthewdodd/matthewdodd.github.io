                  </hi>. I am a printer and stationer, of 126, Camberwell Road—in August last I received a letter from Gear and Co., of No. 6, Three Crown Square, Borough, for brief and hand—made paper—it was on note paper of this description (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had a printed heading. "Gear and Co., Stock and Share Brokers"—the order was produced at the police-court—I sent the goods by one of my porters, and he brought back a receipt—two or three days after I called at 6, Three Crown Square—as you came up the stairs there was a door right facing you with "Gear and Co." on it, and at the side, close against it, was "Laird and Co., Bills for acceptance to be left in the letter-box"—at that time I did not see anything on the door about a bank—I saw Gear, and said, "I am Mr. Thompson, and I have come for my account"—he said, "My partner is away in the country, when he comes back I will pay you"—he said the order was incomplete, and he wanted some more paper—I said "I know nothing at all about you, will you give me a reference, as our terms are cash?"—he said "No, I can easily get three months' credit if I like"—I then agreed to supply the further goods—he gave the order at the time—he then took me into the adjoining office, and introduced me to the prisoner Laird; he said, "This is Mr. Laird, a friend of mine, he wants some memoranda printed"—Laird wrote out the order for 500 memoranda forms and gave it to me—I produced it at the police-court—Gear also gave me an order for 500 memoranda forms; he said, "Don't make them alike, as we don't wish the public to know we are connected"—they were to be paid for on delivery—I sent the paper and the memoranda forms to both Laird and Gear—I applied for pay<lb></lb>ment</p>

               <p>several times, but did not get it—I saw Gear once afterwards—he said that his partner was out of town, that he had not got any money, when he came he would give me a cheque—I asked who his partner was—he refused to tell me—I asked where he lived—he said he was not going to tell me, it was no business of mine, or words to that effect—the value of the paper supplied to the two was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe I have seen it all since, at two pawnbroker's, Mr. Ullman's and Mr. Layman's.</p>

I am a stationer in Coleman Street, City—I know Gear—he was introduced to me by a clerk on the Wool Exchange last June—about the end of June he gave me an order for two reams of foolscap paper—he came to our place of besiness with this clerk and gave the order personally; also to get up a proof of a prospectus, and a ream of note paper and one or two other sundries like a letter-book—he handed me a form of the "Nava de Iraque Gold and Silver Mining Company, Limited, of Spain, capital 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I did not invest any of my money in it—I supplied him with the paper and printed the prospectus—I never got paid for either—I sent out a collector, and afterwards went myself to Three Crown Square—I have waited there half an hour, sometimes an hour, sometimes two hours, and at last I saw Gear—I said, "My name is Love"—he did not seem to recognise me—I said I had called for a settle<lb></lb>ment of the bill I had sent in—he said his partner was on the continent, and would be back in a week or two, and then I might have the money—he did not tell me what he wanted the paper for—he did not tell me who he was, or what business he was carrying on, but I presumed he was a stockbroker, by seeing at the end of the printed prospectus which was handed in to us, "Gear, Stock and Share Broker"—my bill was about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not seen the prospectuses again—I saw the foolscap at Ullman's and other pawnbrokers, a couple of reams, or I believe more—I identified it as that I had supplied; there was more than two reams supplied—we went to two pawnbrokers; Mr. Thompson's foolscap was at one and mine at the other, but I cannot tell which one it was.</p>

I shall see him to<lb></lb>day and I will bring you the money to-night"—he sent a telegram that night to say that he had been detained in the city, but trusted to<lb></lb>morrow would do as well—I went to see him in that week, but could not—I left word with the servant that I should come on Saturday morning before 9; I went and met him 200 or 300 yards from the house, and he produced another cheque on the City Bank, and said, "I shall not pay you with this, I will get it cashed and pay you in hard money"—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), he did get it cashed the same night at a neighbour's, but I never got the hard money.</p>

Greenfield and Abbot, solicitors, of 37, Queen Victoria Street; we took proceedings on behalf of Mr. Wohlgemuth on this bill and promissory note in the Superior Court of Common Fleas Division; we got a judgment and a Judge's order for the payment of so much a week, but we got no payments whatever; we also took proceedings in the Wandsworth County Court; we went to 24, Hill Street, Knightsbridge, the address of Rose mentioned on the promissory note; it was a very large house in a dilapidated condition, the windows broken and the bell broken; there was nobody occupying it; I knocked and rang and got no answer—I was not able to serve Wymark on the bank bill—I have got an order for substituted service—Wymark did not tell me anything especially about the British and Foreign Commercial Bank—he said generally he was connected with the bank, that he was the principal party, and that he would pay the money on the bank bill—I had not seen Gourlay at that time as to payment—I did not know him until he was pointed out to me by Wymark as the person connected with the bank who would probably pay the bill—he gave me Gourlay's address as Rokeby Road or Street, New Cross; he also gave me the address No. 6, Three Crown Square—after that I saw Laird and Wymark together in Cannon Street—I was talking to Wymark, and Laird came up; he was represented to me as Gourlay, not as Laird—that was the occasion when he said "This is the man who will pay the bill"—Wymark said "This is the clerk to the solicitors who are troubling me for the money"—Laird smiled, and walked across the road to the Cannon Street Station—that was all the satisfaction he got from him.</p>

I am traveller to Richard Podmore and Sons, boot and shoe manufacturers at Stafford—in consequence of instructions I received on 17th September last, I went to 30, New Bridge Street and saw Hodges—I introduced myself to him—he said he was desirous, according to a letter he had sent down to our people, of placing an order of 15 or 20 cases for export—he wished our people either to send him samples, or me to show him samples, and he could satisfy them with referencs—I said I should be very pleased to show him the patterns which I had in town, and he appointed for Wymark to meet me next morning at 10 o'clock at the Saracen's Head Hotel—I saw Wymark there next morning about 10.30—he said he could not stay then as he had some other appointment to keep—he came next day by appointment, and I then showed him the patterns—he selected some, and I arranged to call and see Hodges, which I did about the 19th—he said he had not had time to go through the list that Wymark had given him, but he would do so—I said, "You said you could give satisfactory references; will you kindly do so now?"—he said, "I can give you a reference on a barrister, who has all my affairs in hand;" but I said, "Our people would prefer bankers' references or security"—upon that he seemed annoyed, and said he should not trouble his bankers to do anything of the kind—I said "Very good"—upon that he said he would go through the order and communicate with the house—I afterwards saw this letter and the order for boots to the value of 278<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was an [order from the samples we had supplied—the order is not signed; it is headed, "From James Hodges, 30 New Bridge Street, E.C."—the letter accompanying the order is signed "James Hodges"—we did not execute the order—the firm wrote, asking for references, but none were supplied.</p>

I am a merchant of 59 Mark Lane—in the middle of last year I was introduced to Wymark by a traveller of mine—I suppose it was for the purpose of doing some business—he gave me an order I believe in May for a ton of glue to be supplied to Lindsay and Co., of 37 Walbrook—he said they were very respectable people and had plenty of money—I made inquiries and declined to supply the goods—one day after that Wymark brought Laird to my office to see some corn flour; Laird wanted a sample which I believe I gave him and told him the terms were cash—he did not say anything to that; he wanted to try the corn flour first—he wanted to sell me some very cheap champagne, which I declined—I did not sell him the corn flour—when Wymark introduced him he gave me his card, "Laird and Co.," somewhere in the Borough.</p>

I am in partnership with Mr. Pratt, as stationers, 5, Ludgate Circus—I know Hodges—in August last we had an order for printing to the value of about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was executed and the account was sent in with the goods—I called at 30, New Bridge Street, immediately afterwards, and on two or three occasions before I succeeded in seeing Hodges—I then told him my name, and said I had called for payment for the work done—he said, "You must wait till the Company comes out," which I immediately repudiated; I told him I held his written order for the goods and looked to him for the money—he said he did not do business that way, he was in a large way of business, saying thousands of pounds away, he was going to pay 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the next, ay for something connected with this Company, and I must wait—I still persisted in wanting payment at once—ultimately he promised to pay on Saturday or Saturday week—I called on the day named, but did not see him—I subsequently saw him on several occasions—I and my partner called two, three, and five times a day; when I did see him he simply said he could not get any money, he could not pay, he had not got the money—I believe my partner was afterwards fortunate enough to get 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then this statement was rendered, leaving a balance of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on one occasion I received from him this post-dated cheque for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn on the General Credit Co.

I want my cash, or some acknowledgment"—he said, "It is no use troubling me. I told you I was staving off bankruptcy. If you trouble me like this you won't get paid at all"—I asked who was in the cab with him; was it his solicitor?—he said, "No, it is my son," and he was going hunting—he was dressed as if he was going shooting—he said, 8 I would let the matter stand over for two or three days he would send me a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not, and I went down to Hounslow again, and forced myself inside the house—I saw him in the library about 7.30 in the morning—he said, "I cannot spare a moment. I am going off to the North"—I said, "You must spare a moment, for I do not intend to leave you to-day"—he said, "what will you have to-drink?"—I said, "If you have got anything in the house let me have some brandy," and he gave me some brandy—I stayed in the library, reading a book of my own that I had brought with me, and his little boy came in, for whom he gave me an order for clothing—I gave the little fellow my book, it was about Oxford, I thought it would do the boy. good—I left and went to the station and saw Hodges, and said, "Come, Hodges, the thing is got too stiff now. My partner instructs me, if I do not get some satisfaction, to go to extreme means. If I do not get a bill of acceptance from you you will hear from me in some other course"—he</p>

So we took the train to Waterloo—I bought a bill of acceptance and drew on him for the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he accepted it, and I gave it away to a friend to borrow money on it—it has not arrived at maturity yet, and it never will—I afterwards saw Hodges and his son and brother at Mr. Robert's office—I said, "I have come about this cheque. It is returned to me. What can I think of that after what I saw in the paper from Blanchard Wontner? I do not want to turn enemy, can you pay me, anyway?"—he said, "If you wish to have your money you must wait"—I said, "How long? This is not business, I am going"—he said, "For God's sake, Boulger, don't go away like that," and he ran out after me and said, "Wait a minute, till I see Mr. Roberts"—I waited down the passage, and he came and said, "Was not that cheque included in the acceptance of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said, "Do you think I am here to give evidence for you? I am not in a position to compound a felony. You have had a letter written to you by Mrs. Ray<lb></lb>mond. If you keep the appointment I dare say she will forgive you, at it is paralysed money that I have got"—I said, "If you do not pay me I. shall go and try to find Mr. Wontner'g address"—he had his umbrella in his hand, and, being afraid of that, I ran across the way into a refreshment place, and his brother followed me and said, "You had better see him amicably and settle it"—I said, "I have done all I could amicably but he won't pay"——about two hours afterwards I went to the station, and I saw Hodges and his son get into a third-class carriage—I got into another division of the same with my back to them, and heard him say to his son, "That d—Boulger is following us. If he comes to Houns<lb></lb>low you must do him in the fields. You go to the left when you get out at Waterloo, I will go to the right, you get out first, and I will follow up slowly"—when they came to Waterloo the son did get out first—I get out at the left hand and Walked on the heels of Hodges—that was the way they carried out their diagram—I went up to him and said, "If you do not see me to-night I shall see St. John Wontner at his address"—I never succeeded in gettting a fraction of my money, and never shall—Wymark told me he was a servant of Hodges—I saw him in that occupation, along with a very respectable looking man, Mr. Moles, the secretary of this Bouldnor Pier Company—about the 29th of March I had a conversation with him respecting a Melton waterproof that he wanted turned—I refused to turn the waterproof, but I accepted an order and submitted patterns, which I left in the hands of the prisoner's brother for selection, but he went into the country.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TORR</hi>. I am not a Bournemouth man; I have bean there perhaps three times; my place is Poole—Barnes is a towns-man of mine—I cautioned him, and said, "If you go quiet with me I will go quiet; but if you kick up rough I shall, there are plenty of doctors and hospitals in London, they will mend all that we break"—I thought it necessary to tell him that before we started—I told him that I should repeat everything that he said—he went on talking to me after that; he had an object in it, when he thought I was interested in his story he asked me to remove the handcuffs, but I did not intend to do that—he told me that he had once talked a gentleman out of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I knew what he was, and what he had been—I did not make a note of what he said; I have not told half of it—he asked me what he should tell the Magistrate—I said, "You had better tell the truth"—he said, "I dare say they will draw it all out. "What sort of a man is Mr. Wontner? Is he vindiotive?"—I said, "No, naturally enough, if he gets hold of one end of a tale he likes to see the other"—I did not advise him not to have a solicitor—he asked more than a dozen times to have the handcuffs off, but I thought he might get out of the train if I did; men do escape from trains—I had a severe beating once, and was laid up for five months, and that made me cautious—Barnes was no friend of mine, he was always moving in a higher sphere than was, he had his place burnt down before I started work—I had not seen him for the last 12 years before—I don't know what his connections are, but he gave me a description of what he thought of such men as Wymark; Laird, and Gear—I know he has been hard up for money of late years; I never knew him flush—I said to him, "You don't seem to have much in the shop, Barnes"—he said, "No. If there is anything worth taking they come and take it"—I did not notice the name over the shop, I went in at the side-door—I knew if I let him get on one side of the door and me on the other I should come back without him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> These (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the letters that were delivered to. me at Wymark's; they relate to dishonoured bills and cheques—Barnes said, "Poor Gear is only a drag upon them, they should get rid of him as soon as they can; Laird is a man of iron will, he would dare and do anything and not feel afraid; Wymark is a cunning old devil, always wants a glass of sherry when he meets you, but he has never got any money to pay for it"—I had not mentioned their names to him, but they were in the papers—he volunteered these statements about them—he asked me if we had stopped Laird's private letters, I said, "No"—he said, "I am glad of that, I was afraid there were some there that. would damn me"—he pointed to some that were in the bundles that I had taken from his house, and said, "I should like to have them,"but I declined.</p>

I was in company with Harvey and took Wymark into custody—I told him he would be charged, with Laird and Gear, with obtaining things by fraud—I read the warrant to him—he said, "As for this bill there is part of it paid"—I found on him a number of papers, which I handed over to Mr. Wontner—I afterwards went with Mr. Thompson to the pawnbroker, where the paper was identified—on 4th February, in company with Harvey, I apprehended Hodges at Lambton Road, Hounslow—I showed him the warrant and read it to him—ha said, "I know none of the persons except Wymerk; he came to me with some bills; he came to me a second time, and said he could</p>

Is Mr. Williamson in custody?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Have you a warrant for my brother?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Mr. Williamson ought to be arrested as well as me. I don't know why the rogues brought me into this"—I asked for all the private papers he had in the house—he at first denied having any—I said we must search the house—he then told his son to go with me, which he did, and opened some drawers, and I took all the papers that were there, put them into a bag, and brought them to Mr. Wontner—next day I went to 30, New Bridge Street, and took a quantity of papers from there, and gave them to Mr. Wontner—the office was shut up when I got there—I had to remain there from about 11 o'clock in the morning till 4.30 before I could get in—Hodges and his son then came, opened the door, and let me in, and then I took possession of the papers-one paper Hodges tore up—I took it to Mr. Wontner.</p>

The son came first and said he had no key—I said I would wait or would break open the door—then the father and son came together—there was only one little room—he said that was all he had—there were a lot of offices in the building—I don't recollect that there was any name on the door—I heard Boulger describe the state of the door and the general ruin of the place—I did not see anything of that, but I heard from the landlord and the housekeeper that Hodges' furniture had been seized before, and that he bad to leave, the other rooms—Hodges said if he was left till the next day he would have 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was all hundreds and thousand he was talking about in the train.</p>

Laird and Gear were apprehended under my instructions, I having a warrant for them—after they were in custody, on 29th November, I went to 6, Three Crown Square—there were two small rooms adjoining each other at the top of the house—"Laird and Co." was on one door and "Gear and Co." on the other; "office hours from 10 till 4 and on Saturdays from 10 till 2"—in Laird's room I found an old table, a chair, and some dusty papers, which I took away and gave to Mr. Wontner—the light was a tallow candle stuck in a bottle—Gear's room was nearly similar; a dirty small room, the furniture was not so good, it was boards put on a trestle for a table—there was no bank and not a shadow or sign of any business—I have had a pretty long experience, and they were about the worst I ever saw—I found a number of papers in Gear's room directed to Laird, and a number in laird's room directed to Gear—when I was first directed to make inquiries in January last year, I examined this place, and then I saw painted on the door leading to both rooms "British and Foreign Commercial Bank"—when I called again it was painted out*</p>

Are they taken up?"—he saidf "I have paid money on them, and they are all right"—"I may take your word?"—" Yes; anything you like to put before me, any written document I am willing to sign; if these shares are not right you can do what you like with me; "and it was on these conditions I advanced the</p>

At the time I was offered the shares in the Lonsdale Building Company I did not know that the mortgagee was in possession—I know it now, to my sorrow—Hodges gave me the shares as a collateral security on the bill—I don't know what the value of the property is—when this bill was offered me, I said to Hodges, "What security have you?"—"The security is some shares to a large amount in the Lonsdale Company, Chancery Lane"—"Are they all right?"—"Yes"—I said, "I have been done enough, I don't want to be done with these shares. Are they taken up?"—he said, "I have paid money on them, and they are all'right"—"I may take your word?"—" Yes; anything you like to put before me, any written document I am willing to sign; if these shares are not right you can do what you like with me;" and it was on these conditions I advanced tie</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor—I have known Hodges three years Messrs. Peto Brothers are under agreement to pay him 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the agreement is dated 7th February, 1878—the time for payment has not yet come, and he cannot enforce payment until certain buildings are erected—it is 6,766<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—'Messrs. Peto erected chambers in Chancery Lane, called Lonadale Chambers, and it is an agreement upon that—from my knowledge of him I am surprised to hear this charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The debt was assigned to me by Hodges on 28th September, 1878, on certain terms—I did not advance money on it—I did not know his circumstances at that time—I did not know that he was borrowing or in a state of impecuniosity—he represented himself as well to do, and I understood he had good property under contract—I had no occasion to inquire into his circumstances—I acted for him in certain matters—I was not aware that he had a traveller named Wymark, or mat he had dealings in needles, boots, or pianos—I understood he was interested in landed estates, buying and selling—he told me that Peto Brothers had agreed to pay him a commission of 7,610<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for introducing to them the proposal for the erection of Lonsdale Chambers, the value of which depended entirely upon tip—result of the measurement of the works when completed, and the payments made to Peto Brothers of the full contract price by the Midland Land Society—I do not know the value of the shares in that society—it is matter of public notoriety that there is such a company—the "matter is in the hands of surveyors—I sued Hodges last June for a bill of costs; I was paid a portion and some remains due—the money was obtained under an execution on the premises in New Bridge Street, in June, 1879, I think—he paid afterwards without proceedings—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the lawyer's letter which produced the money.</p>

               <p>money expended by my brother has been a total loss—the cost of printing and plans was very excessive—my brother was the real purchaser of the Basingstoke Canal, and I was the nominal purchaser, in pursuance of which 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid as a deposit, which my brother found, and as the contract for the purchase was not carried out he had to forfeit the deposit—I have not seen these pawn-tickets, but some very impecunious persons watch about the office, much more impecunious than himself, and I am bound to say that I myself have purchased a few of them, and have them at my house, and he told me he had purchased tickets or advanced money on them, I don't know which—he lives at Hounslow, and pays 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent—he is married, and has a grown-up family; if you want a sample, there is his eldest son.</p>

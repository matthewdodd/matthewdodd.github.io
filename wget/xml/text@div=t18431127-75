                  </hi>. I am the wife of Allen Bell, of Ogle-street. We have only been there eight weeks, and do not keep the house—the prisoner lodged upstairs in the same house, with his parents—on Monday, the 13th of Nov., between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, I took a sovereign out of my bottom drawer—there were fourteen besides—eight were wrapped up sepa<lb></lb>rately in dirty yellow paper, an old almanack—it was in a pocket-book in a drawer—while in the act of counting it, I saw the prisoner looking in at the door—I cannot say whether he saw me counting it—I locked the drawer, and put the key into the small drawer—the eight sovereigns remained in the paper—I went to the drawer again on Tuesday, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, to pay my rent, and missed the eight sovereigns—I did not see the prisoner that day—he left home on Monday night—I saw him run out at the door—he did not come home that night—he always used to come home—this was the first time he missed, that I know of—I did not see him again till Wednesday night—I saw no more of my money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eighteen years old. I live with my mother, in Ogle-street, Marylebone—I have seen the prisoner about the streets—I saw him on Monday morning, the 13th of Nov., about nine o'clock, and again in the evening, between eight and half-past—he told me not to say anything to any body, and he would tell me something—he told me he had found some money in St. Martin's-lane, and had hid it in the yard, because he did not want his father to know it—he did not say how much it was—he went into his mother's house, came out again, and showed me five sovereigns and six half-sovereigns,</p>

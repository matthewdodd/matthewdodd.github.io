On the 5th of May I was directed to watch a wagon of Mr. Flight's, in the Uxbridge-road—it was driven by Bradley—it went down Portobello-lane to a rick of hay in Mr. Salter's field—there was a man there cutting the hay—the wagon was loaded with a load of hay in the ordinary way—I saw it leave, and fol<lb></lb>lowed it—it stopped at the Hoop public-house—I saw William Lyall and George Lyall there—William Lyall was ostler there, and George Lyall, the prisoner, his son, assisted him—they came out—Bradley got on the top of the load of hay, and threw down a truss—one of the Lyalls took it into the stable—I cannot say which—I saw William Lyall look round be<lb></lb>fore they removed it, and then it was carried in—the prisoner George Lyall came out of the stable again, but not the old man—a second truss was then thrown down from the wagon—George Lyall took and carried it into the stable—directly the second truss was taken, Mr. Nicholls went and put his hand on George Lyall's shoulder, and I took him into custody—William Lyall made his escape—while I had got George Lyall, another truss was thrown down on the footway—I then went into the stable and found one truss of hay there, and two more in the loft—I saw Mr. Nicholls go towards George Lyall, and at that time I saw the truss of hay fall from his shoulder—I did not hear him say any thing.</p>

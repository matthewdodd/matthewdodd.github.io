                  </hi>. I am a dyer, and live in Edgware-road. On the 24th of Nov., between two o'clock and half-past in the morning, I was in Park-lane, perfectly sober, and, near Grosvenor-street, I saw the prisoners before me—when I got within about fifteen yards of them they both parted, allowing me to go between them, one on one side the path, and the other by the curb—when I got about a foot in advance of them, I received a blow on the right side of my head—I cannot tell which of them was on my right—I staggered and fell, and, while falling, cried out, "Murder"—they both instantly ran off—it was very light; there is the reflection of six lamps from the park lodge, besides the usual lamps—while on the ground, two per<lb></lb>sons, and, I think, three, came up to me, as if they came out of the shade of the railings; thinking them of the same party, I called, "Murder," which kept them back—a policeman came up in about two minutes, and raised me from the ground—Utting, a policeman, directly brought the prisoners to me—three minutes could not have elapsed from my receiving the blow and his bringing the prisoners to me—I knew them directly to be the men I had</p>

I was on duty in Park-lane, near Grosvenor-gate, at two o'clock—I heard a cry of "Murder"—I immediately hastened to the spot—I was walking in that direc<lb></lb>tion at the time—I ran directly, and saw the prisoners running in a direction from where I heard the cry—I pursued them—I tried to stop them in Park-lane—they turned into Brook-street—they were running towards me at first—I overtook and stopped them both—I said I heard "Murder" called, and re<lb></lb>quested them to go back with me to where I heard the cry—they refused, and Keeley got away—I said, "It is no use running away, I will take you"—I saw another constable, gave him Shepherd, followed Keeley, and caught him again in Wood's-mews—he was not out of my sight above five or six seconds, and was still running—it was not three minutes from the time of my hearing the cry till I took them back to where I had heard the cry of "Murder"—I found two constables there raising Quaterman off the ground—he was all over blood, and his head cut—he recognized the prisoners directly I took them up—three men came up at the time the constables were assisting Qua<lb></lb>terman off the ground, and, being all Irishmen, I asked the prisoners if they knew them—they both said they did not—I then asked the three men, in their bearing, if they knew them—they also denied it—in going to the station one of them turned his head over his shoulder and said, "Morris, I am going to Vine-street station-house"—he spoke to the party they had denied know<lb></lb>ing, and the three talked to the prisoners in going to the station—when the man spoke to Morris, I said, "Why, you denied knowing each other, and now you know them; "and according to their account they were all in one party, and both the prisoners said in going along they knew the three men well, that they were all in one party.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Albion-street, Hyde Park. On the 24th of Nov. I was sent for to No. 10, Edgware-road, and found the prosecutor in bed in a state of great prostration, which I attribute to a blow on the back of his head, from which there had been a great effusion of blood—it had been dressed—I eventually removed the plaster, and found an incised wound about two inches long, deeply incised, extending to the skull itself, but it had not broken the external coverning of the brain—I think it must have been done with some instrument with an edge to it—the edge of a stone would do it—I immediately gave information to the Magistrate, as it was a matter of great uncertainty what the result would be—I was at the prosecutor's bed-side when his deposition was taken in the prisoners' presence, and saw Mr. Hardwick sign it—I heard the prisoners' statement, which was read over to them—I saw the Magistrate sign it—when it was read over to them they</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at I, Ritchies'-place, Brompton. On 16th Oct., I was close by the Sir Joseph Paxton public house;. about 12 o'clock, or a quarter past—I saw the prisoner opposite the Brown Bear, which is very nearly opposite the Sir Joseph Paxton, he was standing on the pavement—I was on the opposite side, and heard a bit of a disturbance—some <hi rend="italic">civilians</hi> were having some words with themselves, about fifteen yards from some soldiers—the prisoner picked up a stone from the broken stones on the Macadamized road, and put it in his handkerchief—he then took it out again, put his handkerchief round his neck, and threw the stone at a soldier—the moment the stone was delivered the soldier fell, it was Pitt—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man that did it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon of St. George's Hospital. Pitt was brought there with his eyeball very prominent, and completely filled with blood, which was caused by the rupture of vessels internally from the concussion of the stone; there was a slight abrasion in the external folds of the eyelid—he has lost his eye—a stone would produce the wound I saw.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If a stone had struck it with, such violence, should you not expect to find a cut? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a slight cut; an abrasion, not such as would be produced by a rub—I should not have expected to have seen more of a wound or cut—I attribute the effusion from the vessels to the direct concussion of the stone—there was no distinct cut on the eye—blood was coming from all those surfaces which contain vessels—that was the result of the concussion, not of inflammation.</p>

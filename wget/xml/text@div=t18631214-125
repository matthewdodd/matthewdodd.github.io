                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live at Market-street, Fitzroy-market, Tottenham-court-road—on Saturday, 29th November, I returned home about 11 o'clock at night—on knocking at my room door, there was a chair put against it to prevent my getting in, and when I got in my husband struck me—he was lying down on the bed, and he got up and struck me—there was a knife lying on the table—I took it up, and he tried to get it out of my hand—in doing so he cut his own hand, and after that he struck me again, and got the knife from me—with that the candle went out, and I called out "Murder"—then he struck me again on the head, and I don't remember any more, except that I felt a blow on my head, but how it was done I could not tell—he stabbed me—he had threa<lb></lb>tened me before many times, and struck me before—he has threatened to ill-use me many times—he was not sober on this occasion—he is in the habit of drinking, and then he illtreats me—I felt a blow, but I did not know what it was with till afterwards, when I saw the blood—I am certain I did not fall on the knife—I felt the blow on the side of the head, near the temple—I was standing up then—he had knocked me down before that, and I had got up again.</p>

I am fourteen years of age, and am the daughter of of the prosecutrix and the prisoner—I remember the evening my mother came home when this quarrel took place—my father came home at 8 o'clock on Saturday night, and stopped in a little while, but went out again—he came in at 11 o'clock, and put a chair against the door, and said my mother should not come in, and he put a knife on the table—when my mother knocked at the door, he told me to open the door, and when she came in, he punched her—she tried to halloa out," Murder!" but my father would not let her, and he stuck her with the knife, held her up against the wall and stuck her with the knife, and then he punched her again after he stuck her with the knife, and she ran down stairs—I went for the police—my father put the knife on the table when he came home the second time; he took it out of the cupboard—he did not use it for any purpose; he took it out of the cupboard and placed it on the table—he said he would stick it into my mother when she came in—he said that to me—they had a few words together first when she came in.</p>

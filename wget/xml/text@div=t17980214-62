               <p>Q. When you missed the horse, you went down to Banbury? - A. Yes; on the 6th of November; I went to Mr. Wyatt's, he keeps the White Lion, he is the post-master.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went there, did you find any horse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.D marks of this gelding before you missed - He was a black horse, he had a star in his face, two saddle marks upon each side, four white marks upon his pole.</p>
               <p>Q. How was his tail? - A. His tail was a full switch tail.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was his legs? - A. His off leg behind was white.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Mr. Gosling had the horse? - A.About a year and a half; I bought him for Mr. Gosling, he is a cart horse; I found him at Mr. Wyatt's, at Banbury, in the stable, he was standing there, trimmed, his main had been pulled and his tail docked.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the tail appears after it was docked? - A. As a coach-horse, it was quite fore then, it appeared to have been done for the value of a day or two, it was quite raw and fore; I am sure it is the same horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the horse know you? - A. I think he did; immediately as I went into the stable, the horse turned his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners at the bar at Banbury? - A. I got down on the Monday night, and I saw the prisoners the next day morning at breakfast, at Mr. Wyatt's.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts in the house? - A. I am not positive what room, but I think, in the kitchen; nothing passed between us, Mr. Wyatt was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they taken into custody? - A. On the Tuesday morning, the same morning I saw them at breakfast, it was near nine o'clock, I was not in the room when they were taken, I was with them when they went before the Magistrate, I don't know the name of the place, Mollington, I think, was the name; the Magistrate committed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do I understand you, that over night, you left this horse and two others in the field? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master was very angry with you the next day, because the horses were gone? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us you shut the gate, did you tell your master so? - A. I am sure it was shut.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Describe how it was shut? - A. By listing of it up.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Had you ever known the horses go astray before? - A. They had got out, but this horse never left his company.</p>
               <p>Q. You had always been as careful in shutting the gate as you were that day? - A. Yes; but sometimes they got through a gap.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were there gaps in the field at the time you speak of, where they could get out? - A. Yes, there were gaps there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. What distance might the field be where the horses were from the common where you found the other horses? - A. About four or five hundred yards.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140075"></xptr>Q. How many miles might it be from your master's house to Banbury? - A. That I don't know; it is about forty miles to Oxford from Hounslow, and I suppose it is about one or two and twenty miles from there to Banbury.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the horse in the stable, he appeared differently from the horse you had lost? - A. He was trimmed and docked.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us the horse, when you opened the stable-door, turned round and saw you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Notwithstanding those alterations, you had no doubt it was your master's horse? - A. No; the moment I saw him I knew him; I can swear it is the same horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaillant. Q. Thought the horse has got out of the field before, you always found him with his company? - A. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. But you found the gate open in the morning? - A. Yes; and found the other horses only a quarter of a mile off.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you? - A. I keep the White-lion, at Banbury; I have seen the prisoner, Swaine, at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Banbury from Oxford? - A.Twenty-three miles.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Swaine come to your house? - A. On Thursday the 2d of November, between nine and ten o'clock at night; he brought a black gelding with him, it was a heavy coach-horse, or a light cart-horse, I conceived him to be fifteen hands high; I particularly remember a mark upon his pole, four white strokes near the ear, a star in his forehead, three, or more, spots by the saddle.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his legs? - A. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, before that, receiving any hand-bill? - A. Not before the horse was taken; I saw a hand-bill which came by the post, on Saturday November the 4th, and, in consequence of that hand-bill, it led me to observe the horse more particularly than I should have done.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe? - A. I observed the horse had been lately docked, within a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else? - A. I observed him to have a hollow back.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the prisoner, Swaine, brought this horse was any body else with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Swaine riding the horse at the time he brought him? - A. Yes; he rode him into my yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass between you and Swaine? - A. Not immediately.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he come as a guest to your house with this horse? - A. He did; and the next morning trimmed the horse, he supped and slept at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed the next morning? - A. He told me he had got a very useful horse for my purpose, to run at the wheel of a coach; this was after he had trimmed him.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to trimming, what do you mean? - A.Trimming heels, pulling mane, and cleaning ears; then he told me he had got a very useful horse for the wheel; I asked him whereabouts; the price might be; he said, twelve guineas; we did not deal; I did not think the horse was two dear, but I did not chuse to hazard my money; the horse was cheap at that price.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other conversation pass between you and Swaine? - A. He repeated it very much, he begged of me to become a purchaser.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from him where he came from with the horse? - A. He said he had bought him; I believe he said at Uxbridge, but I am not confident.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn how long he had hand him? - A. I don't think he said how long he had had him; that was all the conversation that took place on the Friday; he staid in the house the remainder of the day of Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. The horse remained in the stable all Friday? - A. The stable yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the other prisoner, Holderness? - A. Yes, I do; he came on the Sunday evening, much about eight o'clock; the horse remained there Friday and Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he come? - A. He came on horse back.</p>
               <p>Q. When he arrived at your house, was the other prisoner there? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they meet each other? - A. I believe, Swaine might expect him, for they went into the yard together; they had been at my house five or six weeks before that, and Swaine staid then eight or ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them both together, and they appeared acquainted with each other, do you remember any conversation passing relative to this business? - A. Not till the next morning; when I saw them before, they described themselves as partners in a coach, and dealers in horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give any other account of themselves at all then? - A. I don't recollect that they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they say that they came from? - A.Ealing, in Effex; this was the former time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on the Monday morning, you say you had some conversation, were they both together at that time? - A. Yes, about nine o'clock; they both requested me to go and see the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before the time they requested you to go and see the horse, that you received the handbill? - A. I received the hand-bill before; Swaine says to Holderness, I have shewn Mr. Wyatt the horse, and he does not chuse to buy him; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140076"></xptr>thinks he is rather too sluggish; then I was requested, by Holderness, to see the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what passed when you were with the horse? - A. I asked Holderness the price of the horse, and he asked me twelve guineas; I did not become a purchaser, I was confident, from the description of the hand-bill, it was the horse belonging to Mr. Gosling; they desired me, if I thought him too sluggish, to run him in my coach; I did not immediately say I would not, because I was in expectation that the horse would be owned; I had, on the Saturday, sent up information, from what the hand-bill expressed, to Mr. Bennett, at the Rose and Crown, Hounflow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try him in the stage? - A. No; I kept them in suspense about trying the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them say where they got the horse, or purchased the horse? - A. They said they bought him, but I don't recollect they said where.</p>
               <p>Q. All this happened on the Monday? - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did any body arrive at Banbury? - A. I believe it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on Monday evening; Hall came.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he shewn this horse? - A. Yes; and he owned him as the property of Mr. Gosling, he described the horse before he saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the prisoners at this time? - A. They were in bed in one of my rooms; on the next morning, about nine o'clock, I made known the charge I had got against them, and charged them in custody of the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. You were present at the time the peace-officers secured them? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing? - A. They sat with their backs to the light, consequently the constable was behind them; the constable said, you must go with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say? - A. They said they should not go till they knew what it was for; I told them, it was in consequence of horse-stealing; they requested to know which horse it was, Holderness did, and Swaine was close by him; I told them it was the black horse; Mr. Gosling's servant came in, and they turned round from the table, and Holderness said, he lived servant with Mr. Gosling.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that before Hall had said any thing to them? - A. He had made his appearance, but he had not spoke, Mr. Gosling's name had not at all been mentioned; the constable said, I must not be detained here, you must go with me; and he took them before a Magistrate, and he committed them to Oxford Castle; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I understand the prisoner, Swaine, came to your house on the Friday evening? - A. On the Thursday evening; the other came three days after.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a good many other inns in the town besides your's? - A. There is but one other inn.</p>
               <p>Q.Notwithstanding it was thus public, from hand-bills passing through the town, yet those men remained in your house afterwards, and actually wanted to part with the horse? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us when the horse came to your house it was docked? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was nothing uncommon in taking the shears and dressing a horse? - A. Nothing uncommon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the Post-master? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any other hand-bill, except the one you have mentioned, by the post, answering the description we have heard of? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other hand-bills that came in the form of a letter by the Post directed to other publicans? - A. There was no other hand-bill that came to Banbury that day to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you got the hand-bill? - (The hand-bill produced).</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Are you sure this is the handbill you received? - A. Yes; I put my own mark upon it when I received it. (It is read).</p>

            .) What have you to say against either of the Prisoners at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Hern. The 22nd of February I weigh'd up my Stuff, then I lost a Quill of Silver Wire; the 26th of March I weigh'd my Stuff again, and I lost a Quill of Gold Wire and a Quill of Gold Plate.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them?</p>
               <p>Hern. When I found I had lost them, I cry'd thoroughly; I tax'd my little Girl, my Apprentice, with it: I cry'd bitterly; she put her Hand round my Neck, and desir'd that I would not cry. I got a Warrant for the Mother and Child both.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Hern. In <placeName id="t17460515-16-crimeloc81">Golden-Lane, in the Parish of St. Luke's</placeName>

               <p>Q. How much did you lose?</p>
               <p>Hern. I lost two Ounces of Silver, and an Ounce of Gold.</p>
               <p>Q. So you had a Warrant for them, and had them before a Magistrate; and what past there? what did she say?</p>
               <p>Hern. She (the Girl) said she took the Quill of Wire out of my Drawers, and hid it behind the Bedstead 'till Sunday; then she took it out, and her Mother was to meet her at St. Luke's, which she did, and her Mother went home directly, and the Girl went into the Church. The Girl told the Justice that her Mother set her on; next she told the Justice, that she unty'd my Bag, and took two Quills, and hid them in the same Place that she did the Silver Wire ?</p>
               <p>Q. Did she deliver that at Cripplegate Church?</p>
               <p>Hern. Yes, she gave it her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say? Did the Mother say any Thing?</p>
               <p>Hern. She denied it positively. I ask'd the Girl before the Justice; Mary, did not you tell your Mother on Easter Sunday the Grief and Trouble I was in? Yes, said the Girl, Mother you know I did.</p>

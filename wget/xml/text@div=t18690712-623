I live at 3, James Street, Islington—on Saturday, 5th June, I was coming from the Carved Red Lion public-house—I saw the two prisoners together—Hays came up to me and tried to pick my pocket—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself for trying to pick a poor woman's pocket—Carney followed me into Colebrooke Row, and said, "What did you call me a thief for?"—I said, "I did not"—he said, "I will knock your b—eye out"—he made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at my brooch, and he gave me a violent blow, and then knocked me down and kicked me three times in the side—Hays was not there at the time I was struck—he came up after and said, "I have not touched you"—I had a half-crown and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my hand—Carney knocked it out of my hand and took my brooch—he then ran away—Hays came up just as I got up—he said, "I have not touched you—I said, "All right"—with that he took two halfpence out of a child's hand, and ran away with them—the money was in my hand when I came out—I am sure of that, for I came out to pay it.</p>

I am a clerk in holy orders—on 5th June I was coming home from church—I saw two men and the last witness appa<lb></lb>rently in altercation together, as I got to the top of the street—I can't positively swear to the two men—my belief is that the prisoners were the men, but I could not positively swear—as I got near to them, one of the men seized the woman by the throat, in a very furious manner, and struck her two terrible blows in the face, then lifted his leg, and gave her A fearful kick in the lower part of the body, and she fell—I called out to the man, and made an effort to reach him, but he ran away—I never saw his face—the other man came up shortly after, and said, "Where is the villain gone? I will take him "—there was a little child standing near—she said, "That way," and pointed with her hand—the man took something out of the child's hand, and ran away—I then went to the woman—it was so momen<lb></lb>tary that I cannot swear to the men.</p>

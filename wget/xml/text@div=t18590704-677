                  </hi>. I live at 131, High-street, Shadwell, and am a hat manufacturer—On the morning of 13th May last, I went to bed about 1 o'clock—my house at that time was safe and secure—I came down in the morning a little after 7—I found the doors and windows broken open and a hole in the roof through the ventilator—I missed 40 or 50 caps, 9 felt hats, a pair of spectacles, and several other articles, to the amount of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave information to the police immediately, and they came to the pre<lb></lb>mises the same evening.</p>

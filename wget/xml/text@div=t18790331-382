                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I went to the shop and put down the counterfeit coin, which I thought was a good one. The prosecutor took it to his sister, and I dare say they were there two or three minutes, and I was waiting for the change. She came in and said, "Do you know what you have given?" I said, "A two-shilling bit." She said, "Yes, it is a bad one. I believe you are the man who left one here on Saturday; if you don't pay for that one, I will lock you up." I said, "It is not likely, I know nothing about it; I had to work for four hours for that 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." They went into the parlour again and were there two or three more minutes. If I was guilty I should not have stopped in the shop like thai I have never been convicted in my life.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at York-terrace, Queen's-road, Peckham. I occasionally employed the prisoner—about three weeks before I was before the Magistrate I missed three silver spoons, and in consequence of the inquiries I made a tablespoon came to my notice—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is mine—I also missed an old teaspoon, which I have not seen since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mrs. Saxby, and have care of the plate. This table-spoon is Mr. Saxby's; it was found at Mr. Russell's, in the Kent-road—I was there—three weeks before I was before the Magistrate Mr. Saxby had some company, and there were extra spoons out—that afternoon the prisoner was allowed to stay to tea, and the next morning I missed two teaspoons—the old one was lost previously.</p>

                  </hi>. In Oct. I was in the service of Mr. Russell, pawn-broker, of the Old Kent-road. The prisoner came, brought this spoon, and asked if it was silver—I asked where she got it—she said her husband found it in Mill-lane, Deptford—she gave her name "Eliza Somerville"—I took the spoon into the parlour to Mr. Russell, came back into the shop, and the prisoner was gone—nothing was advanced on it.</p>

About three weeks before I went before the Magistrate the pri<lb></lb>soner came and offered to sell me a tea-spoon—it was similar to this pattern-one from Mr. Saxby's, marked in the same way—I refused to buy it; she asked why; I said because I believed she had not come by it honestly—it was afterwards offered to me by a man, broken—I believe it was the same; it was the same kind, and marked in the same way—a day or two previously the prisoner had offered me a small spoon, which I believe I bought.</p>

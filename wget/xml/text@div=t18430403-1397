                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper. I live in Great Dover-street, Borough. The prisoner was in my service in 1842—he was in the habit of collecting money on my account—he had a collecting book to take out in the morning, with certain names inserted in it, and as he received these monies it was his duty to insert them in this book at the time, and when he re<lb></lb>turned turned at night he generally gave us a duplicate of his monies which he had received in the course of the day—we generally send a bill with every parcel of goods sent out, and either I or my young men call on the customers for their weekly payments—on the 26th of May, 1842, the prisoner received by his book, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it ought to have been that day 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is the collecting book in which he ought to put it down—I know by Mrs. Beckley's hill that she paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that day—the aggregate of all the money was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184304030208"></xptr>
               <p>1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that day according to her bill—on the 22nd of June he received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Goss, and that was inserted in the book after it was made up can tell so by the addition—after the shilling was inserted the addition was incorrect—the books were generally kept by a clerk—on the 22nd of June there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Goss, which was not accounted for—the amount was 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the book including that was 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short—on the 2nd of Nov. there was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. short from Mrs. Moore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did the prisoner come into your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the end of 1839—he came on trial first, and then he became my ap<lb></lb>prentice—I had a partner named Thomas Hutchinson—we have dissolved partnership—he is alive and well, I believe—we ceased to be partners on the 19th of last April—I have understood that would be an end of the prisoner's apprenticeship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner talk of leaving you after he was free? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I first gave him warning about a fortnight prior to his giving me warning to leave, which was in Feb.—I did not induce him to stay by offering to raise his wages—I will not swear I did not—he may have made two journies in a week, and sometimes one, after these customers—the number of distinct per<lb></lb>sons he would have to call on would depend on the number we have—he would have to call on forty, fifty, or sixty in a day—he might probably on a Monday have to call on two hundred, to collect these sums of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has it not happened sometimes that the prisoner has paid an excess of money from what he has received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not on these days—it is very pro<lb></lb>bable that sometimes he might have paid more than he received—such a thing might happen as that, out of these two or three hundred items—he has omitted to put down the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in one column, but has put it to another person, and that would account for the excess—the columns in this book represent customers—this book lasts six months—here are different columns, in which the entries ought to be made—such a thing might have happened that the entries have been made the next day, but it was unknown to me—I do not recollect your putting to me at the office an enormous number that had got under the wrong head—I had not time to examine this book every night—it has been left to my clerk—the prisoner might have paid me sixpence on the 26th of May—I will not venture to swear ha did not pay me the sixpence—I generally received the money at night; if not, the first thing in the morning—I have an account of the money I received—I do not enter every night myself what money I receive from each; but if not, I do it in the morn<lb></lb>ing—sometimes it is done by the clerk—there were three examinations of this case before Mr. Trail, the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he tell you his opinion, when you had gone throngh the whole case the last time, that it was a matter of mistake? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No sir, I do not re<lb></lb>collect his expressing that as his opinion—I do not recollect that he gave me his opinion—he took a great deal of trouble to look over the book with me—I think I gave the prisoner warning about Feb., 1843—he left me about the middle of the month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you detain his boxes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, sir—boxes he had none, sir—I never saw his boxes—I detained some things of his, I cannot tell what they were in or what the things were—I considered I had reason to detain them—when I came home at night from collecting, there were some parcels for him to take out, and he said he would not take them out for me or any other person—he had given me warning to leave, and wanted to leave directly—he at the same time asked for his wages—I said I should go through his books</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184304030209"></xptr>
               <p>and examine his accounts—that was my reason for detaining his goods—he made application to me afterwards for them, and I was summoned to Union-hall—he made application to me again, in presence of his father—the first time I saw him, after he insisted on leaving me—I met him in Blackman-street—I met the prisoner at the Bull's Head, Camberwell, a month ago, last Thursday—he was in company with his father—Mr. and Mrs. Pounsford were there—the prisoner then again applied to me for his wages—that was the time I spoke of, and I said he had been receiving monies, and not accounting for them—I might probably say, "You have been robbing me"—he said, "Why don't you take me up, and prefer a charge against me, if you have any?"—I know he was at that time living at Messrs. Milson and Coats', who are in my line of business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever got in any trouble yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never shut my<lb></lb>self up from the gaze of this world for a short time, that I know of—I know Mr. Martin very well—I was in his service once, along with a person named Piper—Mr. Martin and I had a fall out—I never fell into a cellar, nor shut myself up—I never knew that there was a charge, and the police were after me—I never shut myself up—I know a person named Flight—I was never locked up in his house, nor in Bosier's house—I lived with Mr. Martin eight years—an old man came into his service, we had a quarrel, and I left—I never stopped in Bosier's house—I never lived in his house for three weeks, nor for three hours—I lived with Mr. Martin eight years, and left him—he sent for me to come back, with an advance of salary—I went back, and stopped some time after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now from the 9th of March, when you charged the prisoner at the Bull's Head with his accounts being wrong, did you do anything to take proceedings against him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—on the 14th I received a letter from a solicitor, that legal proceedings would be taken against me, unless I paid the prisoner's wages on or before the 16th, but I did not take notice of the letter—I think it was not on the 16th that I had the prisoner taken into custody on this charge, but I will not swear it was not.</p>

WYLDE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> My friend took a deal of trouble to convince the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate of his view of the case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I and Mr. Martin had a quarrel—I left him, and he induced me to go back at a larger salary—I returned, and had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week additional—and more than that, I am doing business for him now—a mistake might happen in the columns—I never heard from the prisoner that he had made a mistake—I had to look over a great number of accounts before I found out these defalcations.</p>

               <p>to look after her—I went to the Crow public-house, which it nearly opposite the court where I live, in Moor-lane—I saw her there, about receiving the change of the sovereign, and I noticed Oxley there, close to her—I did not notice anybody else—there were twenty or thirty people there, I should say—the front of the bar was full of people—I followed my daughter out of the door, towards my own house—I was not more than two yards behind her, and as I was about turning the corner of the court I was knocked down, by whom I do not know—I received the blow in my months—I should say there were two or three persons near me at the time—I could not say how many, as I was knocked down so suddenly—I should say there was more than one—directly I was knocked down I was kicked—I saw who kicked me; it was Oxley—I begged for mercy—that was while I was down—I called him a coward, and asked him what he was kicking me for—I was kicked about the head by Oxley; but it is nearly well now—I was also kicked, in other places—I said to him, "You have kicked my head nearly all to pieces, and now you are satisfied; you have broken my arm; what have I done to be served in this manner?"—I did not know at the time that my arm was broken; but I felt in sad pain—I felt a kick, on my arm—there was no one near me at the time but Oxley, and it was, under a gas-light—I had an opportunity of noticing him well—I became insensible, or nearly so—before I became insen<lb></lb>sible I attempted to get up—I had nearly got up, and Oxley kicked me in the front of the head, and I saw three men, rushing into my house after my son, and I heard one of them say, "Pull the b----out"—they were like beasts going into a slaughter house; they hardly knew which to get in first—I was taken to the hospital, and had my arm set—I have still got it in splints.</p>

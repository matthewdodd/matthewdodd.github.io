On the 26th of December, I went out about four o'clock, returned about six, and missed these things; I live on the ground-floor, and had locked the door; I found a door which leads from the cellar had been opened; the prisoner lodges on the first floor, and was in my room that afternoon; the shirt then laid on a chair; she asked if I had got to iron it; when I returned, I found a hole cut in the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not in the habit of leaving the key for your husband? A. Very seldom, but did not on that day - only two persons lodge there. I had a good opinion of her. She told me herself that she was in the house alone for twenty minutes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any more shopmen? A. Only the manager - he took it in - I wrote the ticket, and gave her the money; she was three or four minutes in my view.</p>

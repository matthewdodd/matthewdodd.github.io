            . I am servant to Mr. Wornack. Last Monday, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, there was a great crowd round the house. I had been out. When I came in, I found them there. There was three men with bludgeons in their hands. The shop was full of people, taking the bread. I was alone in the shop. It was shut up before I went out. I left the door upon the latch; they asked for bread. As they were going out I saw the prisoner with some loaves; I laid hold of him, and he dropped them. He had two loaves under his arm.</p>

               <p>JOHN WILSON. I took the prisoner off the shop counter; I pulled him through one of the broken windows. Goodwin was in the shop.</p>

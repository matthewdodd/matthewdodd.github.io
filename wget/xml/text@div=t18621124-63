                  </hi>. I am a seaman belonging to the Albion steamboat, which was lying off Fresh-wharf on 8th November—about half-past 12 o'clock that night, I was going down Lower Thames-street, and met the prisoners—Lester asked me whether I could get him a bed—I said, "Yes, there is a man named Lightfoot, who keeps a house near here; I will see and get you one if I can"—he immediately struck me under the ear, and knocked me down—I was senseless for the moment—I called out for assistance, and they both ran away—when I was on the ground my money was taken from my pockets, a half-crown, three shillings, and some halfpence—they also took my cap.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lester.</hi> I am innocent. I never saw the man till he gave me in charge. I was going to see a friend, and had to go on board my ship next morning. I went into a water-closet, and the policeman found me there half asleep. This is a thing I have never been guilty of in my life, as God is my judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Harvey.</hi> I was passing through Thames-street, and saw the prosecutor speaking to a man, but this is not the man. I was going to Nelson's-buildings, on the fifth floor, and heard a cry of "Murder" and "Police;" up came a policeman, and asked me what I was doing there—I said that I wanted to see a man, and he took me to the station-house. There were a lot of detectives at the Mansion-house, but none of them knew us. I never saw the prosecutor before, and he does not say that I knocked him down.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 563). On the night of 8th November I was on duty in Lower Thames-street, and saw the prosecutor—he was quite sober, but was staggering on the pavement, having just recovered from a fall—I asked him what was the matter—he said, "I have been knocked down, and robbed"—I said, "Do you know where they are gone?"—he pointed to Wilson's Barracks, and said, "They are gone up there"—I went to the bottom of the staircase, and in a water-closet on the fourth landing I found Lester, and asked him what he did there—he said, "I have come to see Mr. Green"—I went up, and found that a Mr. Green did live in the building, but had gone to bed—he got up, and I asked him in Lester's presence, if he knew Lester—he looked at him, and said, "Yes, I know him"—I said, "When did you see him last?"—he said, "Not for the last six months"—that he had lodged in his house six months ago"—it is a place let out in lodgings to seamen—I held him there while my brother constable went up stairs—Mr. Green locked the door, and went in—my brother constable called out, "Here is the other one," and Lester and I went up stairs, and found Harvey concealed in a room on the fifth floor—I found this cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the second landing, coming down stairs—Lester had his trousers down—Mr. Green was undressed: I had some difficulty in making him hear—I searched Lester, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lester.</hi> I had only been a week ashore, and went to see Mr. Green, as I was going next morning.</p>

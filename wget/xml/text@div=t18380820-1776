                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Sergeant who keeps the Coach and Horses public-house at Tottenham—he is a cripple—I attend to the business—I receive and pay whatever money is received—the prisoner was the pot-boy—he was not to receive bills, but only for the beer he took out-if he did receive money he was to bring it home—he was in the habit of bringing me money he received-I-enter in a book the names of those who have not paid—I made out a before of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for Mr. Panton, of Edmonton—I entered it in a book before I made the bill—I delivered the bill to the prisoner to get the money, and when he returned he said the lady had not paid him—he never paid it to me—I sent the bill on the 6th of June—I found this out on the 9th, and charged him with having received it—he said he would settle it in the morning, but instead of that he got up and left the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mrs. Panton.

I think, not 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner brought the bill, and told me to give it to my mistress—he waited—I took it to mistress, and she said she would come down and pay it herself—she came and told the prisoner he had got 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. too much at the bottom of the bill—he said he was very sorry, and he would scratch it off—he did so, and then mistress said, him the money—she asked him if he could receipt the bill, and he said, "Yes"—I saw her put the money into his hand, and he wrote, "Paid" to the bill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Captain Panton, and live at Edmonton. The servant brought this bill in to me—I observed a mistake at the bottom, and went out myself and told the prisoner there was a mistake—he said it was his mistress then had made it—I made him understand it, and asked if he could put "paid" to it—he said he could, and I paid him the money myself—the prosecutrix after seeing the bill, said the mistake was not her doing, that it was written after she sent the bill—I paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—I had refused to pay for the beer unless I had a bill, as there had been a mistake—I believe this was the first bill, I paid—I generally paid when the beer was brought.</p>

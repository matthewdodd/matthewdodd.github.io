I have had several consultations with different lawyers, who are of the same opinion as regards certain investments. Of course the responsibility rests with you and I, and as far as I am concerned, I am quite prepared to take the responsibility, but of course can do nothing except with your sanction and approval I shall be glad if you will give the subject your attention, and let me know your opinion as soon as possible, as good things are turning up every day in this locality, simply requiring a little watchfulness and buying at the right time, being on the spot to do so. I will do anything I possibly can to benefit the family. I hope to be able to get over to Bed-ford in the spring or summer. The accounts received from there are good as regards health, but not as regards pecuniary means. I certainly think by the terms of the will we have power to vary the investment.

               <p>same day I wrote to our London manager—I afterwards read to the prisoner a copy of the letter—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>; "February 26, 1869. Dear Sir,—My customer, Major Beswick, has requested me to give some explanation about the transfer which has been stopped. This evening, on his return home, he was surprised to find, not only my note, but one from Mr. Maxted, Gibraltar, which he has shown me, declining to make the transfer. Strange to say, someone, evidently well acquainted with the circumstances of the trus-teeship, sent a letter, purporting to be signed by Mr. Maxted, requesting the sale, and stating that he himself would pass through Liverpool, on his way to the United States, and would then execute it. Major Beswick, who has not seen his co-trustee since he was in Gibraltar, with his regiment, twenty-two years ago, when Mr. Maxted was a young man, acted on the letter, giving us the instructions upon which the transfer was made out. The party presented himself this week, signed it, and appears to have intended to have come to-day to arrange about the distribution of the funds. From the letter received to-night there can be little doubt someone is personifying Mr. Maxted, and the matter has been placed in the detectives' hands, and it is for this reason the detaining of the transfer is desired. Mr. Beswick, who, perhaps, from the fact of his being the Head-Superintendent of the Police force here, alone makes him acutely feel the trick which has been played upon him, is most anxious to exonerate himself, and has requested me to say that he will at once proceed to London to see the Bank autho<lb></lb>rities, if you think it would be desirable. In the meantime he is extremely sorry for the trouble he has occasioned you, and is much obliged for what you have done.")—When I read that letter to the prisoner, he said that I had omitted to state that he had seen Mr. Maxted one day on his return from the Crimea—on 1st March I, saw the prisoner again—he repeated what he had told me before, with this exception, that I think he then for the first time stated that he was going to Bedfordshire, on matters con<lb></lb>nected with the trust, on the morning when the supposed Mr. Maxted accosted him in the street, and that he would not leave a stone unturned to get at the bottom of the matter, and give us the earliest intimation—he also said that the party had not called again—it was between 10.30 and 12 o'clock in the morning of the 23rd February, when the prisoner brought the power, and he took it away and returned it with the words, "late of Gib<lb></lb>raltar" added, in less than half-an-hour, I should say—this (<hi rend="italic">product</hi>) is the prisoner's pass-book at our bank—I could not tell from this what balance there was to his credit on 24th January—these entries are made by Mr. Beswick himself, and are not copies from the bank-book—according to those figures the balance seems to be 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to his credit—this book should be kept by the bank solely—it is irregular for a customer to make entries—this book does not appear to have been in the bank since 11th January last—the balance then to his credit was 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 1st January it was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a draper, at Argyle Street, Birkenhead—during the course of last year the prisoner was indebted to me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter that I wrote to him—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated October</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1868, <hi rend="italic">enclosing an account for</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and regretting that he was obliged to requst an <hi rend="italic">immediate settlement, or a bill at one or two months</hi>)—I don't think I did receive any payment at that time—I went to the prisoner in the course of the present year to ask for payment—I think it was some time in February, and I wrote him this letter—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 16th February, and was a renewal of the application for his account, amounting to</hi> 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and offering to take a bill, renewable at the prisoner's convenience</hi>)—Besides writing those letters, I went and saw the prisoner at his office—he spoke to me at one time about a sum of money he expected to be able to pay me with; in fact, he let me</p>

               <p>see a letter that he had received from the manager of the Alliance Bank—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter he showed me—he said he was going to sell some stock, and he was merely waiting for the signature of a gentleman who was coming from Gibraltar—that was about the last week in February—I said I would wait—I think that was after the letter of 16th February—I told him I was wanting the money at the beginning of March, and be told me if he did not get paid at that time he would give me the bill I asked him for—he did not pay me the money up to that time, and the last day of February, or the 1st March, I called on him to get his signature to a bill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer at Birkenhead—on 5th March the prisoner called me into his private office, at the police-station, and said, "Hemmingway, there was a man at my house on 25th February very near making a mess of me when I was returning from Bedford," or "going to Bedford," I am not positive which—he then handed me this slip of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) and said, "I want you to go over to Liverpool and see Mr. Keogh, the Superintendent of the Detective Department—see him per<lb></lb>sonally, and ask him to be kind enough to instruct his detective officers to be on the look—out for a man answering this description—if they should succeed in apprehending him, I will go over any hour, night or day, to identify him"—I then said, "There is no charge on the paper; what charge shall be preferred against the man if he is apprehended?"—he said, "He was very nearly getting a lot of money from me, and he will probably be staying at some second—class hotel at Liverpool"—I then went over to Mr. Keogh, and made some inquiries, but was unable to obtain any informa<lb></lb>tion—in the police—office at Birkenhead there is a report-book kept, which is here; it is the usual course to enter any complaint in that—I believe there is no such entry in it.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi>) On Saturday, 8th May, I received a warrant from the Mansion House for the apprehension of the prisoner—I went to Birkenhead, and took the prisoner into custody, at 45, Hamilton Square—I told him I was an officer from London, and held a warrant signed by the Lord Mayor for his apprehension for forging a power of attorney for a transfer of stock in the Bank of England, to the amount of 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, standing in the names of Frederick Beswick and Mr. Maxted—I produced the warrant to him, and asked him if I should read it—he said no, he did not want it read, he knew all about it; he had expected it for the last two months—he said he had known what inquiries had been made, that it was in unfortunate thing for him; what he had done, he had done out of kind-ness, and if he had been guilty of such an offence he had plenty of time to have gone away, but he was determined to stand it—I took possession of a variety of documents from various places; some of them I have produced—I have a large number of letters, some I got from his private house, from a drawer in his bed-room, and some from his office at the Police Court, Birken-head—I found this copy of a will, and the deed altering the trustee—those letters have my initials on them, they are letters from creditors.</p>

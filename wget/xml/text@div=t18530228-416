                  </hi>. I am the daughter of John Skeen, a cheese-monger, in Mile-end-road. On 19th Jan. the prisoner came to my father's shop about 7 o'clock in the evening to purchase a quartern of cheese—he offered me a half crown, which he put on the counter—I had no money in the till to give change, and I gave the half crown to the servant to get change—while she was gone a policeman came in, and the prisoner ran away leaving his cheese on the counter, and without receiving his change—the servant afterwards came back with the half crown which I sent her to change, and I nailed iton the counter—I afterwards gave it to the policeman.</p>

On the evening in question, between twenty minutes to nine, and nine o'clock, the prosecutor came to my lock; he was very much agitated - I put my hand to his face, and found it wet; it was too dark to distinguish whether it was blood or water - I took him home, and found his throat was cut; it was light enough to see a man's face - he was robbed about one hundred yards from my lock.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 24th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, our inspector came to me to go into a field, adjoining where I was on duty, to see if I could find any sharp instrument or bludgeon; and about four o'clock in the morning, I went and found a watch, laying on its face, exactly at the entrance of the gateway - there appeared to have been a scuffle about two yards from where it lay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Was not this spot between two hedges? A. The watch laid on the gateway, nearly on the east side of the post - it was not hedges; there is a small fence, and the scuffle appeared to have been near the fence; it would be darker at night on one side the fence than in an open place - the fence is about four feet high; I do not think that would make it darker on the ground, because it is about midway between two gas-lamps, which throw a reflection nearly on the spot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Sibey, a shipwright, at Green and Wigram's, the ship-builders' yard. The prisoner worked in the same yard—on Tuesday, the 17th, about half-past twelve o'clock in the day it rained, and I went into a shed—the prisoner was down in the saw-pit—Wilkins and Rawlinson were with me—I went down into the pit to give the pri<lb></lb>soner a lift with a log, and as I got out of the pit I began dancing on the side by the wood—some dirt fell from my shoes into the pit—the prisoner then said, "I will give you a smack in the mouth"—I then jumped down into the pit again, and offered to fight him, but he would not, but; made his way up to a corner to get out of the pit—I caught hold of his leg, and he tried to kick me on the head—he got out of the pit, got hold of an iron crow-bar, and was going to <hi rend="italic">launch</hi> it on my head—Wilkins took it away from him—I directly got out of the pit, and asked him what he meant—he made no answer—I turned my head aside, and then he took up an iron dog, and hit me across the neck—I did not see him take it up, but felt the blow on my neck, which knocked me down, and I was insensible—I fell with my head on a log which was on the pit—when I came to myself I was bleeding dreadfully from the back of the head—I was taken to a doctor's—my head was dressed, and I was put to bed all the afternoon—the doctor has attended me every morning since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shipwright, and work in the Black-wall-yard. I went with Cole and the others into the shed out of the rain—I was at work in front of the pit—there was no place nearer that we could go to—the prisoner was at work in the pit—he asked us to go and give him a lift with a log—Cole, I, and Rawlinson went down and helped him—Cole then got out, and began dancing—some dirt fell on the prisoner's head, and he said, "I will give you a slap in the mouth"—Cole jumped down into the pit, and pulled off his jacket—he did not appear to be angry—the prisoner got out of the pit, and Cole laid hold of his leg—the prisoner then swung over the log to kick him—the prisoner caught hold of the crow-bar, and was going to throw it down at Cole—I went round the log, and laid hold of it—Cole was then down in the pit—I did not see him come out of the pit—it was while I was turning round—I saw him lying on the log afterwards, and then saw the prisoner inflict one blow on his head as he laid on the log—I cannot say whether he was insensible—I cannot say whether he hit him with the crow-bar, or what it was, but I saw him hit him on the head while his head was lying on the log, and he put up his arm to strike him again—I believe it was with the dog—I saw Price come up and lay hold of the prisoner—I did not observe whether the prisoner had a black eye—I did not see Price do any thing when he took hold of him—I took Cole up—he was bleeding—both my hands were covered with blood from his head—I took him to the doctor's.</p>

I am a shipwright's apprentice, working in the yard—I went to the shed because it rained—the prisoner asked us to give him a lift up with the log—we went down, and gave him a lift—after we came down I took up some saw-dust, and threw on his head—he said he would give Cole a smack in the face—Cole took off his jacket, and jumped down into the pit—the prisoner was getting out of the pit—Cole caught hold of his leg, and after he let go of his leg the prisoner swung on the log, and tried to kick him, but could not—he then took up the iron crow, and tried to throw it on him—Wilkins took it away—Cole jumped out of the pit, went up to him, and asked what he meant by that, and <hi rend="italic">squared</hi> up to him—Cole turned on one side, and he took up the dog, and struck him on the neck—I did not see Cole pull his nose—he fell down on a log, and while he was lying on the log the prisoner struck him again on the back of the head with the dog—I cannot say whether he struck him hard—it was cut to the skull, he bled very much—my hands were covered with blood—I believe some of us had been teasing the pri<lb></lb>soner—something was said to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Brunswick-street, Blackwall. On Tuesday the prosecutor was brought to me—I examined, and found a wound about two inches long in the upper and back part of his head—there had been great hemorrhage, his clothes were saturated with blood—I applied adhesive plaster, and bound it up—the wound is still open—I saw it this morning—it was not a dangerous wound in a healthy subject—it depends on the constitution of the patient—the skull was laid bare, and it was such a wound as would be inflicted with this dog—this might fracture a man's skull with very great facility—I still attend the prosecutor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

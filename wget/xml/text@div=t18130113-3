On the 24th of December, I lost a silver watch; I value it at five pounds, a gold chain, value six pounds, and a seal, one pound. It was taken from my front room two pair, in my own house. I had seen the watch in my room about twenty minutes before seven. I took it to see what o'clock it was.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130004"></xptr>I laid it on the chest of drawers. I missed it about eleven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you come out of the room - A. A few minutes before seven. I did not see the watch after that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes; she was a lodger in my house. On the 26th, I had a quantity of bills printed, and sent them about to the different pawnbrokers, and in about half an hour after the bills were distributed, word came from Mr. Everett, in Berner-street, that the watch was at this shop, pledged for four pounds. On the same evening I changed a one pound note for the girl's mother, and I changed her another on the 27th. On Monday morning, I took these two notes to the pawnbrokers. The lad he proved them to be two of the notes that he paid to the person that pledged the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you so - A. Yes. After that I came home to my own place, and asked the mother whether she had any more notes. She gave me another note, with the same date on it. I asked the mother, how she came by these notes. She told me, that the daughter brought the notes. I then took them to Malborough-street office. The daughter said, she took the notes of Mr. Goddard, a pill-box maker, in Noel-street, and when the prisoner found that Mr. Goddard denied given her the notes, she confessed that she went in the room and took the watch, and pledged it at Mr. Everett's, in Berner-street, for four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner encouraged by you, or any body else, to confess - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you rent the house that you live in - A. Yes, and live there with my family.</p>

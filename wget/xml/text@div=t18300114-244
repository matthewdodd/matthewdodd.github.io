               <p>JOHN REYNOLDS. I am a smith, and live at No. 5, Hare-street, Hoxton. In December Bennett introduced me to Tomkins, as I had asked him for work, about eight o'clock in the morning; it was on a Saturday - Bennet told me Tomkins was the foreman of the works; I went and asked him if he could give me work - Tomkins told me he should like to see me at the Gun in Shoreditch; I went there between twelve and one o'clock, and Tomkins said he had got a job in hand, and where could he meet me on the Monday - I appointed the

               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You were never accused of stealing dead bodies? A. No; I was the worse for liquor. and was sent to Guildford as a vagrant - that was some time last year.</p>

I do not know such a man;" I said,"Do not you know the young man to whom you proposed to do that job for you at the counting-house?" he said,"I don't know him;" I said, "You must know the young man you gave 3l. to, to say nothing about it" - he went in, and staid about ten minutes, when he came out and said, "I can't see the other parties to-day;" I said, "It must be settled to-day between one and two o'clock, there is 50l. reward, and you must do the best you can, or things will go forward in the job" - he said,"Will you have any thing to drink?" I said, "I do not mind," and we went into a public-house, I believe the Antelope - I said I did not like gin, and we had a quartern of rum; we came out, and he said, "I will meet you to-morrow at the Robin Hood and Little John, between four and five o'clock" - I said that would do, but I did not go.</p>

            . I am a labourer, in the employ of the Gas Company; I lodge in the same house with Tomkins, and was at home when the officer searched his house - I know it was his room which was searched; I have seen him wear a blue coat on Sunday.</p>
               <p>JAMES BROWN. I am an officer. I took Bennett on the 28th, and he was discharged by the Magistrate - I took him again on the 6th of January; when I was locking him up he said, "If I had known you had been after me again, you should have had some trouble;" this is the paper in which the cheques were sent back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Then one was discharged? A. Yes; there was no further evidence at the time, but more was received afterwards, and he was committed to Clerkenwell till the indictment was found.</p>

            . I am an officer, and live in Goldsmith's-row, Hackney-road. I went with Oviden, and took Chittenden - I asked him to write his name on a bit of paper in case it might be wanted; I saw him write it- this is it; I told him to go into the tap-room - I went, and compared his name with the writing on the paper, in which the cheques were sent - I went back to Chittenden and said his writing agreed with that; he seemed to be quite struck, and never said a word - in going to the watch-house he made some observation to Oviden; he seemed to say he had been sold, and if he had known he would have sold the lot - that I understood to be the substance.</p>

            . I am a labourer in the Imperial Gas Company; I know Chittenden, he is a smith - I went into the smith's shop about a fortnight before the robbery; I saw Chittenden there, and asked him to sharpen me some tools, he said, "He could not do it by himself" - he had a key screwed in a vice, and was filing it; I went away, and returned in ten minutes, it was then out of the vice - I saw no more of it; it is not part of his duty to make keys for the factory; I saw the handle of the key, and it appeared to me as if it would fit the outside counting - house door.</p>
               <p>Chittenden. This witness knows I had left the place five or six weeks before the robbery. Witness. It was about a fortnight before he was discharged I saw him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE EVANS. I am landlord of the Antelope; I remember Tomkins being at my house on the 2d of January, with another manl did not know - they had a quartern of rum, which was entered to Tomkins' account in the book; I was very busy, and did not notice the other.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.Was it by Tomkins' order you entered it? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Chittenden's Defence. I can prove I was at work on the night of the robbery, and not within three miles of the place; I could have brought four or five witnesses, if I had known that they had been wanted, but I did not expect I should have been on trial at all, as Mr. Bennett discharged us.</p>

            . I am a labouring man. On Friday fortnight I was in Cloth-fair, and met Reynolds against the Hand and Shears; he asked how I got on for work; I said, "I had now and then a day or two's work for Mr. Rhodes" - he said he could tell me of a plan I could get some money by - he said there was a man named Tomkins, foreman of the Gas Company, and I might go and tell him, if he did not give me some money, I would tell his masters that he did the robbery - I said, "I do not know the man, and I will have nothing to do with it" - he said he would go and show him me; he said he had got a good situation, and rather than lose it he would give me some money - he begged I would not mention it.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you go to the foreman? A. No; I told this story at different public-houses, and people said if I was any man at all, I should state it - I had seen Reynolds before, but we were not on intimate terms; I have not laboured in Shoreditch church-yard, and I defy any man to face me in that - I cart coals, and do other work - I have worked for Mr. Wise in carting bricks - it is three months since I was in any regular employ; I was then kilnman to Mr. Rhodes - I worked for him two years; I have known Reynolds three months - I have known Sherwin, but never was at Shoreditch church-yard with him - I was never in a prison.</p>

             re-examined. I stood over Chittenden while he wrote his name, and gave him the pen; I do, upon my oath, believe the writing on this envelope to be his, the post mark could not be made out - I took it to the Post-office, and they said it was put in at Holborn-bars.</p>

            . Q.Was it usual for you to make up your money on Wednesday night? A. Yes, and to pay it on Thursday; I never saw Reynolds before, and I should think he could not know the money was made up on Wednesday, without some one belonging to the works telling him. <rs id="t18300114-244-verdict1305" type="verdictDescription">

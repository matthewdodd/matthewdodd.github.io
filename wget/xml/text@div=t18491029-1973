                  </hi>. I am now living on my property—I have been an attorney—I live at Dalston. On 7th Oct., about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing through Brook-street, and just before I got to Newington-common, I met the two prisoners coming in an opposite direction—they would not allow me to go on, and Barrett appeared to me to make a snatch at my watch—the ribbon and key were hanging out of my pocket, and at the same moment I received a push from Wilson—I held up my walking-stick, and then they began to abuse me, saying, "I will knock your b—old head off," and so on—they retreated, and I kept following them up as well as I could—they went into a beer-shop, and came out again—one of them went up a turning, and the other stood still abusing me—they disappeared soon after they came out of the beer-shop—I could not find a policeman, and could not take the prisoners till the following morning—one was taken at his mother's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an easy chair maker, of 127, Long-alley, Moorfields—I know the prisoner, and gave him a job once, about two years and a half ago—on 2nd Feb. I went to bed about half-past II o'clock; the doors were all fast—I sleep in the back parlour which looks into Sugar-loaf-court—I did not observe the window, as I did not know the sash opened—it was shut when I went to bed—next morning I was awoke by the opening of the drawers, and saw the prisoner standing at my bed-side steadfastly looking at me—(the drawers were not open when I went to bed, that I am aware of)—I jumped out of bed, laid hold of him, and said, "You vagabond," or "You villain, it is you"—I had got hold of his coat when he was outside the window—he turned round and said if I did not let go he would knock my b—y head off—I could not bear him on my arm on the sash, so I let go, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202230014"></xptr>
               <p>he ran away—I gave information at the police-station—I missed nothing, but a day or two after I found the front lock of the door was wrenched from the screws—a drunken man could not have got in in the way he did—there was no fastening to the window, but it shut to, tight—it required considerable force to open it—it was open when I awoke.</p>

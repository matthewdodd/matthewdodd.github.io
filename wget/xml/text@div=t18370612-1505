                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. John Glads<lb></lb>den, cheesemonger, Tottenham-court-road. On Saturday night, the 10th of June, I was in the shop, and missed 6lbs. of bacon, which I had seen safe three minutes before—the prisoner was in the shop—Brooks told me something, and I found it in the prisoner's basket—it had not been sold to her—she said she had paid for it—I asked who she paid for it—she said neither of us—there was another shopman—I gave her in charge—I cannot positively swear to the bacon, but I believe it to be my master's—I missed a piece similar to it—there were a number of customers there—the other shopman is not here—it had been in the window.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It was in my basket—it was at the top of it—I intended to buy it, and asked them to weigh it two or three times—I always use the shop. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She has dealt there a long time—I cannot tell what she might say to the other shopman—it was on the top of her basket—the lid was over it, and it was under her cloak.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller. I was outside the shop, and saw the bacon lying on the window board—I saw the prisoner reach towards it, pull it towards her, and put it under her cloak to secrete it—she then reached towards another piece, looked at it, turned round, and saw me watching her, and laid it down—she then stooped down, put the first piece into her basket, and pulled her cloak round it to conceal it—I was in the doorway—I went into the shop, and told the shopman—the prisoner asked no questions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had no intention of taking it—I went down to the bottom of the shop for butter and eggs, and when I came back they ac<lb></lb>cused me of stealing it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She moved to another part of the shop with it, but not to the bottom—she did not ask anybody to weigh it.</p>

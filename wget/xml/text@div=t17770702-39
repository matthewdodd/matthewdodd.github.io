               <p>JAMES BUBB sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a tobacconist, I live opposite Mr. Wensley's: on the 17th of May, between nine and ten o'clock, when I was sitting at my door, I heard a man say, he has got the bacon; on which I looked out and saw a man with a flitch of bacon under his arm; the man ran and I ran, but M'Credy stopped him; I laid hold of him on the other side, and we brought him back to the prosecutor's; he dropped the bacon in the street; I lost sight of him after I saw him with the bacon; I am not sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

             M'CREDY sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw four or five men walking backwards and forwards; I suspected they were going to take something from the shop; I watched them; I saw the prisoner come down the prosecutor's steps with a flitch of bacon, and go towards the Adelphi; I followed him; he was not more than twelve yards before me; he dropped the bacon in the street; I never lost sight of him; I seized him, and Mr. Bubb came up, and we brought him back; he had the bacon under his arm when he came down the steps; when he had ran a little way he threw it over his shoulder; when we had taken him, he said he was not the man: a waterman took up the bacon.</p>
               <p>Did you never lose sight of the prisoner? - I never did.</p>

               <p>I am waterman to the hackney coaches: as I was watering the horses I saw the prisoner come down the prosecutor's steps with the bacon under his arm, and run away; I pursued him, I never lost sight of him; he dropped the bacon from under his arm; I did not see him throw it on his shoulder: Bubb and the last witness laid hold of the prisoner, and I took up the bacon.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am innocent; there were several people in the street running; they laid hold of me, and said I was the man; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

He occupies the whole house, excepting one room and the shop, which is occupied by Mr. Raylis, a confectioner—the prisoner was in Mr. Raylis's service for about a week—on Saturday night, 2nd Dec, I had a porte monnaie, containing 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were two sovereigns, some silver, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I placed it in a bookcase, in a room on the third floor, in Mr. Pottinger's occupation, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—I went out, and returned about 11 o'clock the same evening, Saturday—on Monday morning I missed the purse and money—this is the purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is mine—the money was Mr. Pottinger's.</p>

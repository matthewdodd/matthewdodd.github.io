I was employed to search the prisoners' house rather before the 23rd of November - they live in Kendal's-court, near Vine-street, Spitalfields; when I entered the room I saw the clock hanging up, and recognized it by the description I had received of it three weeks before; I took possession of it - nobody was in the house; I do not know that he lived there myself.</p>

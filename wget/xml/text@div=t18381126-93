On the 6th of November I went with Etheridge and Ducket, to No. 3, Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's—we went up stairs to the first floor front room, and found a man and woman, who gave their names as Lucy Clayton and Charles Tree, sitting by the fire—I took them into custody—I called for assistance—on the hob of the stove I found an iron spoon with plaster-of-Paris on it, and some portions of white metal—on the mantel-piece J found a file and some small particles of white metal adhering to the teeth, and in the table-drawer an iron holder with white metal on that—I found a coat in the room, which belonged to the prisoner, for as I was conveying him to the station-house he hallooed out to a girl, "Bring my coat down to me, for I am going to Bow-street"—that coat was afterwards brought to him, and he claimed it as his—it was hanging on a line in the room—I received infor<lb></lb>mation that a man had been taken by some other persons.</p>

I accompanied the officers to the house in Buckeridge-street—after the other room was examined, I went up to the attic of the house—I found on the table in a basin portions of a mould broken in the centre—I found plaster-of-Paris by the side of it, some powder in a tea-cup, and a small piece of window-glass with plaster-of-Paris on it—there was a good fire in the room, very dear, at if it was coke—the window of that room was pointed out to me by Hall—it was open—there was nobody in the room—the window led on to the roof.</p>

I was assisting the other officers—I was in George-street, at the end of Buckeridge-street, and could see the house they had gone to—I saw three of my brother constables go into No. 3, and I saw the prisoner come out of the attic-window of that house—I pointed the window out to Ducket—the prisoner was dressed in a white jacket and a black hat—I saw him go to the attic window of No. 4, and get in there—I saw him come out of the door of No. 4, and run up Buckeridge-street into the Hare and Hounds public-house—I went in after him, and found him concealed behind the door—his hands and face were covered with powder of-Paris, and he appeared to have rubbed his hat with his hand-as it was white also—he had nothing in his mouth, but at the station-house he vo<lb></lb>mited up a deal of powder-of-Paris-White searched him in my presence, and found on him a mould containing a good shilling and five counterfeit half-crowns done up in a piece of paper—I afterwards went to the attic with Ducket—the window was open, and there was white on the tiles where he had laid his hands—it appeared to be powder-of-Paris.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in company with Hall, and took the prisoner into custody at the public-house—I produce a mould which was found on him, also the half-crowns—he said, "That is quite sufficient-you have got enough;" and as I took him to Bow-street, he said to a girl, "I am safe <hi rend="italic">bellowsed</hi>—good bye."</p>

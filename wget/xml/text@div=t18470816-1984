                  </hi> I am a private in the Royal Marines, stationed at Woolwich Dockyard—on Friday evening, the 30th of July, about half-past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoners in a small boat, alongside the pin<lb></lb>nace, in the river—they were shifting things from the boat to the pinnace, and from the pinnace to a barge, it was canvas, rope, and metal of some descrip<lb></lb>tion—the men were first in one boat and then in another—I gave information to Ellis, and he and I watched them—I saw one of the prisoner with a shovel—he appeared to be digging a hole in the ashes, and putting rope and canvas in the hole—they were all three in the barge at the time—I was on the</p>

               <p>wharf at the dockyard, about a hundred yards from them—my attention was directed to a copper-pot in the after part of the small boat that I first saw them in—I afterwards saw it in the barge, thrown on the top of the ashes—the barge was placed under my care at three o'clock in the morning—I then found in it an oar, a pot, a block, some rope and canvas, and half a barrel of pitch on the ashes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman R</hi> 162.) I am employed at Woolwich Dock-yard—on Friday evening, the 30th of July, about half-past seven o'clock, Kendall gave me information, and my attention was directed to a boat along<lb></lb>side of a barge—there were three persons in it; Court was one, I knew him—I cannot speak positively to the others—I saw them take something from the boat and put it on board the barge—I suspected it was not right—the three persons then left the barge, got into the boat, and rowed it to the Bell Water-gate pier—I ran round, and saw Court in the boat, which belonged to him; it had his name on it—the other two prisoners left the boat, and got on the pier, and Court was handing them some things which appeared to be sailors' clothing—I asked them what they had got, they said property they had brought from the <hi rend="italic">Spiteful</hi> steamer—I asked them their names—they gave the same names that they did afterwards to the Magistrate—I am quite sure the prisoners are the persons.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Parry, and keep a broker's and sale shop in Playhouse-yard. I lost this pair of boots on the 10th of Feb.—I had seen them ten minutes before—they are my husband's—on the Fridy evening afterwards, Mrs. Bullen, who lives in the same place, and keepn shop in the same line as mine, sent her boy over to me with the boots, to ask if they were not mine—I went and asked Mrs. Bullen, in the prisoner's presence, where she got them—she said the prisoner brought them to sell—she said she had been sent to sell them by a man whom she left in 1 public-house in Golden-lane—I said if she would show me the man I should be glad—I went with her to the public-house—there was no man there—I gave her in charge.</p>

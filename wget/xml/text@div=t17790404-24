The prisoner took a lodging of me at three shillings a week, and lodged with me near a twelvemonth. I had given her warning to quit the lodging; when the time was up, she told me she was not provided, and I permitted her to stay a few days longer. On the fourth of March she left the lodging without saying any thing, and took the key with her. I waited a week to see if she would return; finding she did not return, I took a young man that works with me, and tried some keys I had in the house, and got the door open. When I got in, I found the bed cut to pieces, and the tick gone, and missed all the other things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). On the Wednesday following I saw her in a stall near Gerard-street. I took her before a justice. She denied knowing any thing of the things, or pawning them; the justice ordered her to be searched, and duplicates were found upon her which led to the discovery of the things.</p>

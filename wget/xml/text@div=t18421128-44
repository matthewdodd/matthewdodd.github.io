                  </hi>. I am a builder, of Grays' Inn-road. On the 4th of Nov., the prisoner was in my employ at a house in Long-acre—I went there be<lb></lb>tween three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I looked into a closet in the room—there was a quantity of lead and glass in the room, which was mine, and in the closet, in the prisoner's bat, I saw about 51bs. of lead, covered over with his dinner-bag and gloves—I afterwards said to him, "Brown, is this your hat?" he said, "Yes"—I said, "How came this lead here?"—he said, "I did not put it there"—I placed the hat back in the closet—there was a coat laying on the left hand side of the hat—I passed my hand over it slightly, and thought I heard glass graze together—I left Harvey, my fore<lb></lb>man, in the room, went for a policeman, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

            . I am a coach-spring maker, and made these springs on Mr. George's premises - I saw them there about three weeks before they were lost, and on the 29th I saw them in the officer's possession; I know McDonald by sight - he is a stranger to the premises.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HUSON. I am a Policeman. On the 28th of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners together at Mr. Jones', a pawnbroker, High Holborn- they were both leaning over the counter on which the springs lay, offering them in pawn; they came out together; I took McDonold, and in about an hour and a half, in consequence of information, I charged him with stealing the springs - he said he would fetch the master who gave them to him in half an hour; I trusted him to go, but he never brought any body to me to own them -I found him in the shop of Mr. Washbrook, a springmaker, for whom he worked; I took Donoghue that evening - he said he had nothing to do with the springs, he merely carried them there for a man: I brought the springs from the pawnbroker's, and have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>McDonald. I came to the station of my own accord. Witness. I told his master if he came in to detain him, but I met his master bringing him to the station.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>McDonald's Defence. Seven weeks last Thursday, as I was going to breakfast, I met this man and another opposite St. Giles' church; being in the habit of pawning for my master, to get the work on, this man asked me to show him where I pawned, and as it was in my way home, I did so.</p>
               <p>Donoghue's Defence. On Sunday evening I stood at the corner of Drury-lane; a man came up in his shirtsleeves and a hairy cap; he asked me to carry a parcel, and if I had a basket - I said No; I borrowed one - the man took me into a stable in Parker-street; he told a man to put the things into my basket, and told me to meet him at eight o'clock on Monday morning; I went, and he brought out the springs and asked me to pawn them; this man being in the habit of pawning, I asked him where to go.</p>

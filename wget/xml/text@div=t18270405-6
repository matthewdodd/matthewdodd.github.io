I was in a state of pregnancy, and very much alarmed.</p>

            . I am a gardener, and live at Mr. Sturts. On the 1st of March I heard a cry of Murder! I looked, and saw the prisoner running between the hedges in the London-field; I jumped over the hedge, and asked the prosecutrix if he had robbed her - she said Yes, and ill-used her; I ran after him about three quarters of a mile, and when I got within about twenty yards of him he pulled the bag from his bosom, pulled out of it a white silk scarf and a white pocket handkerchief, and chucked them on the ground; he then picked them up, and put them into the bag again; I then got up to him, took hold of his collar, and took the bag from his hand; he begged of me to let him go - I would not, but he turned and pulled himself away from me; I caught hold of him again took him back to the prosecutrix, and gave her the bag, which she claimed, with the things that were in it, and gave him in charge; he said he would cut his throat if she would not let him go - he took out a knife, opened it, and put it up to his throat, as if he was going to do so, but the next witness prevented him. I had seen him about an hour before the cry of murder. I took him to the watch-house, with assistance.</p>

            . I am a carpenter and joiner, and live at Hommerton. On the 1st of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I overtook the prisoner and Boroff, as I was coming to town - he wished me to assist him, which I did, and took the prisoner to the prosecutrix, who was in the field - he begged her forgiveness, and went on his knees once or twice; when she would not let him go, he said, "If you don't let me go I will cut my throat;" he took a clasp-knife out of his pocket, and said, "Now, I will cut my throat;" I had hold of his collar with one hand, and prevented him with the other. Some gentlemen came by, and desired us to take him to the watch-house - we did so, and gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in a situation in life far superior to what I now am. I have been in his Majesty's service as coxswain.

            , I was sitting in the fore parlour with the children, there was nobody at home but the children and me, they were Mr. Martin's children, the prisoner knocked at the street door, I never saw him before, when I opened the door the prisoner asked me, if Mr. Tweedale or Mr. Martin were at home.</p>
               <p>Are they in partnership together, as taylors? - Yes, I said, they were neither of them at home, he asked me if I thought they would be in in an hour's time, I said, I could not tell, perhaps they might; he said, then he would come in to write a note, and he came in, and I went up into the dining-room to fetch him some paper, pen and ink; I shewed him into the fore parlour, and as I was coming down stairs, I heard the cupboard door go to; I did not take any notice of that, I went into the passage to the little boy, who was sick there, and I heard the door again.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the beauset a fixture in the house, or is it a cupboard of itself? - It goes into the wall.</p>
               <p>It is not a separate piece of furniture? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230055"></xptr>Do you recollect whether when you went up stairs and left the parlour, in order to bring the prisoner the ink, whether you left the beaufet shut? - It has folding doors, the doors were put to when I left the room.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How does it shut? - There is no lock on it.</p>
               <p>How does it fasten? - There is no fastening only as it shuts to; I left the little boy in the passage, and came to the parlour door, and I met the prisoner at the parlour door, and he asked me if I could give him a candle, to seal the letter, I told him, I could not give him a candle, he said, a light of a match would do if I could give it him, I told him, I could not give him either; he said, then he would make a wafer do, and he put a wafer to it, and he gave it me, this is the note.</p>
               <p>(The note read.)</p>
               <p>"Sir,</p>
               <p>"I should be obliged to you, if you will call on me in the morning,</p>

               <p>(No direction.)</p>
               <p>As the prisoner was going out of the parlour door, I looked into the cupboard, and I saw the things were gone.</p>
               <p>What things did you miss? - Two salts, two salt spoons, and one table spoon.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these things were in the closet before the prisoner came into the room? - The children were both in the room, the eldest is but three years old.</p>
               <p>Were they old enough to reach up to the beaufet? - The eldest could open the beaufet door, but could not reach any thing that was in it; when the prisoner was going to the door, I went into the passage and I told him to stop, for he had got something that he should not have; I was going to open the street door, and he caught hold of me, and told me, if I offered to speak or to move, he would beat my brains out; then he gave me a blow over my eye, I thought I had lost the sight of my eye, for some time I could not see, and with the force of his fingers in my mouth he forced out one of my teeth, he told me, if I would be quiet, he would go out quietly; I told him I would, and he opened the street door, and went out; I was laying down in the passage; he forced me down when he had his fingers in my mouth.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose property were the spoons? - Mr. Martin's.</p>
               <p>Court to Martin. Were the spoons and salts your property? - Yes.</p>

I got up and went into the parlour, the parlour windows were both open, and a gentleman that lives opposite came up, and I desired him to follow the prisoner, he saw the condition I was in; his name is Blacketer, he saw the man run out, and he heard the children and me cry, I told him that the prisoner had robbed the house, he was at the parlour window, and he saw the prisoner walk two or three times across the parlour; but he did not know but he was a gentleman come on business, he pursued the prisoner directly; I look upon it, that my cries, and those of the children brought Mr. Blacketer over.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the prisoner, can you with certainty speak to his person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure you cannot be mistaken? - No, it is impossible; Mr. Blacketer brought the prisoner back to our house, in about ten minutes, that I might be sure it was the same; I immediately recollected him, I told him he was the same person.</p>
               <p>Was he searched? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I live opposite to Mr. Martin's, on the 13th of July I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of Mr. Martin's house, I heard the children and the maid cry out before he came out.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner walk gently away, or did he run out? - He came out the same as I would come out of my own door, and then he ran afterwards.</p>
               <p>At what distance did he begin to run? - When he was got from the door about ten yards.</p>

             speaking to you? - I went to know what was the matter, and the girl looked out, and her face was all bloody, I did not go into the house till I fetched the prisoner back, she looked out of the parlour window next the street door.</p>
               <p>To the best of your recollection, what did she say to you? - To run after that man, she was in a very shocking condition, I did not know what was the matter with her, her mouth was all bloody.</p>
               <p>What did she say the man had done? - She told me to run after the man, and I ran after him, and overtook him in about the space of six or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of him? - Yes, I lost sight of him, on purpose that I should catch him again, I met him in Gerrard street, and I took him, I only lost sight of him that once, that was when he ran about one hundred yards, I thought he would come into Prince's-street again, I am sure he was the man I saw coming out of the house; I brought him back to the house, I did not know what he had done, till I came back, when I came back, I went into the passage, and I left him in the parlour, I searched him afterwards in the watch-house, I found nothing on him; when I brought him home to the house, I went to ask the girl if this was the man that used her ill; she said yes; he said, says he, she says I am not the man; I heard her say no such thing, but I heard her say, he was the man when I came back again; the maid had picked up two salts, two salt spoons, and a table spoon; one of the table spoons was laying behind the door; the prisoner swore and wrangled with me, and threatened to strike me; I told him not to strike at me, he should go to the constable; I never left him till I saw him locked up in the watch-house.</p>

            . Are these the things that you saw there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see these things on the floor in the fore parlour when you recovered yourself? - I was in the room, but the children were standing in the window, where the things were found after, and there was nothing at all in the window, I was in the back parlour when the things were found on the floor; there was one more table spoon in the beaufet that he left, they were all laying together, and a pair of sugar tongs was left; the table spoon was on the same shelf, and the sugar tongs was on the shelf below it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to Blacketer. What situation did you find me, when you took me, was I running or walking? - You walked to a house, and could not get in, and then you went into an alehouse; I caught him by the collar, and said you must go with me, he made some expressions at me, and damned me, and struck at me, I did not mind what he said, I was strong enough to take him any where, he tried very much to get away.</p>
               <p>Court. But you do not answer the prisoner's question, was he running or walking? - I cannot say whether he was running or walking.</p>

               <p>How many were in the room the time you was with me in the parlour? - To the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230057"></xptr> best of my recollection there was only one man, and two women, there was, I dare say a dozen came in after, at least, and I ordered the door to be shut, and I would let no more in.</p>
               <p>Court. When you brought him into the room at first, did you see any spoons on the floor? - I saw nothing on the floor but the carpet.</p>
               <p>If there had been any thing on the floor, would it have struck your observation? - Yes, I took him to the place where the things were found, and desired him to sit down a minute, and if they had been there, I must have seen them.</p>

               <p>My Lord and Gentleman of the Jury, The many notoriously false publications, which have daily appeared in the papers since my commitment, might probably prejudice me in the opinion of this honourable Court; but, however, conscious of my innocence with respect to the same; I trust that every aspersion which has been so vilely propagated against me, will be discegarded by you; and I doubt not, but my conscious innocence will fully appear: The evidence that this girl adduces, states, that I came there between the hours of six and seven in the evening, and knocked at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230058"></xptr> door, when she opened it for me, she admitted me in the parlour, went up stairs, and coming down heard the cupboard door make a noise; that she came down and challenged me with taking something, and afterwards she says, she looked into the beaufet and missed some things; my Lord, she thereupon laid hold of me by the hair of my head, and endeavoured to tear my coat; I tried to extricate myself from her; Mr. Blacketer says, he did not see me run out of the house, and cannot say whether he saw me run or walk: Gentlemen, you see my situation; a servant maid had before, in this court, positively swore, that I had robbed her mistress of sundry wearing apparel, and it was fully proved, and is well known to many gentlemen in this court, that the property she swore I had robbed her of, she had robbed her mistress of herself; and servant maids in general are very aukward, and so destitute that they often take their master's and mistress's property, and lay it on others: But I shall not intrude on the time of the court; I shall trust to your Lordship's known goodness, to give in charge to the Jury that I am not guilty: I certainly endeavoured to extricate myself from the girl when she laid hold of me and tore my coat: I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. How do you account for being in the house? - My Lord, I knocked at Mr. Martin's door, with a view of having some things made; he is a taylor.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you account for the note that you delivered? - I left it for Mr. Martin to call upon me.</p>
               <p>Court. It is signed C. Jenkins? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Martin. Do you know anybody of the name of C. Jenkins, that answers to the description of the prisoner? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I went by the name of Jenkinson at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. But unfortunately for you this is Jenkins.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, with respect to the present case it may be proper to inform you, that if a person knocks at a door, in order to get in to commit a felony, it is in the eye and in the consideration of the law, as much a breaking, and will as much satisfy the charge of burglary, as if the door was broken to pieces; because where ever a door is opened contrary to the intention of the owner, if they knew the errand of the party, the law will consider the door opened in this manner to be a breaking, but if you should be of opinion that this entrance of the prisoner's does not meet the strict legal idea, then the last count of this indictment does not state a particular breaking and entering; but states only a stealing in the dwelling house, and an assault on

             then being therein and put in fear; and you will observe that under this act of Parliament, the value taken must be five shillings; now gentlemen, you will judge how far a person is put in fear, against whom violence is used, and who appears in the condition this girl did; not that the law requires actual force, because if there is a violence used, and goods are taken through that violence, against the will of the person, it is sufficient to satisfy the indictment; for there are particular circumstances, by which, if actual force was requisite, the prisoner might escape; as for instance, one man may be knocked down before he is aware, and another may possess a manly spirit, and be as it were incapable of fear, especially of a person whom he sees to be by no means his equal in strength; therefore the law always implies fear where there is a proof of violence.</p>
               <p>Another circumstance for you to consider in this case is, supposing it was established before you in the fullest proof, that this plate was never taken out of the house, and it had been thrown down on the floor by the prisoner, before the prisoner had been out of the house; yet the least taking, and the least carrying away, tho' to ever so small a distance, with intent to commit a felony, is a taking away sufficient to satisfy the law: Having now laid down the law, I will state to you the evidence, (here the learned Judge summed up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230059"></xptr> the evidence, and then added) if you credit the witnesses, there can be no doubt, but that the prisoner was in the house, and you will judge of the intent with which he came there; indeed, if there was any doubt with respect to his being in the house, his own defence has fixed that, because he tells you he was in the house, and he assigns the reason why he hurt the girl, which he says was upon her attempting to detain him. It is not necessary for me, Gentlemen, to be extremely circumstantial in observing on this evidence; I have laid down to you the law that applies to it, and you are much more competent to judge of it than I can possibly be: The girl is confirmed in her evidence by those who heard her cries, by those who saw her at the window; and likewise by the Prisoner's Defence, who mentions that the usage she has received, was while he and she were in the house: If therefore, you believe her testimony, as confirmed by the testimony of others, you will find the prisoner guilty; if you have reason to discredit her testimony, and think that there is any inconsistency, any link wanting in the chain, any chasm, by the failure of which the evidence is not brought home to the prisoner, then you will acquit him; or it is in your power to acquit him, with respect to the robbery, and find him guilty of the larceny only.</p>

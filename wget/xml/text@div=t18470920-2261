                  </hi> I am a slop-seller, and live in Tooley-street, Southwark—the prisoner was in my service, on and off, for three of four years. On Sunday, the 22nd of Aug., she was there, and I gave her into custody—I then went to her lodging, I knew where she lived, as she has been with me so long—the policeman went with me—we found thirty-eight duplicates—I have seen some property of mine at the pawnbroker's—they are here—most of them are mine—five or six of the pawnbrokers gave up the goods—my daughter discovered it, and I told the prisoner to put on her bonnet and shawl, and go with me—she said, "For God's sake, Mr. Tagg, "or "master, forgive me"—my daughter told her she heard her walk in the shop, and my second daughter charged her with stealing a pair of drawers—she professed innocence—she then said she was sorry, and begged I would forgive her.</p>

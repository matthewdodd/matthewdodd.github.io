On the 20th of May, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock at night, before I went to bed, I left this silver wine-cooler safe at the extreme end of the counter; every thing was perfectly safe - a man sleeps in the shop; that was the last time I saw it before it was stolen - it is worth 92l.; the house is my dwelling-house; about ten minutes after eight o'clock in the morning, when I came down out of my dressing-room it was gone - this was on Friday, and I saw it at Hatton-garden office on the morning following - I had no doubt whatever of its being the same; I was certain of it - I never saw the prisoner before he was in custody; he was a stranger, and had no business in my shop - I should think he had no</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What were you going to add, you should think he had no what? A.

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On Friday morning, the 21st of May, about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Wilmington-place, Spring-street, Spa-fields, and saw the prisoner coming with a bag over his shoulder; I knew him before - I looked at him, and he at me: I watched him some little distance, and after turning the corner of St. Helena-place, I saw a person (who I had before seen in his company,) knocking at No. 29, St. Helena-place; I did not then know who lived there - the prisoner was going on; he looked round after he had passed the person knocking at the door - he looked back towards where I was; I followed, having suspicion, quickened my pace, and laid hold of his collar - immediately as I laid hold of the bag something pointed came to my hand - it seemed to me to be silver; I knocked at a door opposite, where Duke, my brother officer lived, and took him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270012"></xptr>in there - Duke was not at home; I found this wine-cooler in the bag, and asked if it belonged to him - he declined answering any questions: Duke came in in a few minutes - I took the property to my own house, which is in the same street, and went to look for the other, but missed him; I returned, took the prisoner and property to Hatton-garden, and on the Saturday Mr. Solomon claimed it; I met him in Queen-street, Longacre, as I was going to his house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you asked what was in his bag, did he not tell you it was an article in the way of his trade, as a silversmith? A. No - I stopped him, and asked what he had there; he said, Nothing, immediately, but then said, "I shan't answer any questions;" and when I got him into Duke's house, I said, "Is this your property?" he said, "No, it is yours."</p>

            . I am a coal-porter, and live at No. 4, Off-alley, Buckingham-street, Strand, nearer to Charing-cross than the prosecutor's shop. Last Friday week, the 21st, as near as could be, five minutes after eight o'clock in the morning, I was standing in George-court, Which joins off-alley, and leads down towards the Adelphi (I was not in sight of Soloman's shop) I saw two men coming down George-court; they the stopped just before they got to the top of the steps - the prisoner is one of those men I am certain, because I took my oath of it before; I took notice of him, and swear now that he is one of the two men - the other man had got a long white bag; before they came down the steps I saw them put something, which looked to me like a silver tankard, into the bag - I was about ten yards off, but the court is very narrow; they were on the top of the steps - I was looking up towards the Strand; I saw them put it into the bag - they came down the court and passed me; I took particular notice of them - it is not possible for me to be mistaken in the prisoner's person; I only just turned round, and when they got to the bottom of the court, they turned up the hill to the left, towards Adam-street, Adelphi - I saw the prisoner on the Saturday at Hatton-garden, and was certain of his person.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Was it the prisoner or the other man that put the thing into the bag? A. The prisoner, because the other, who held the bag, was a little taller; I am positive he is the man who put it into the bag; the prisoner carried the tankard, and the other the bag; the prisoner put it into the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What have you said? A. That the other held the bag, and the prisoner put it in; the other looked a darkish man - I do not exactly know whether I should know him again; if I had seen him the next day, perhaps I should have recognized him - I did not suspect any thing; I thought it was curious to have such a thing in the court, but being such respectable dressed men, I took no more notice - I did not notice them for more than two or three minutes; I had my eyes fixed on them both at the same time - it was a long white bag; the other man had a black hat on, I am certain of that - I cannot say what colour his coat was; it was a body coat, I believe, but will not be certain - I cannot say whether I should know him again; I might or might not, it is so long ago - he had dark eyes, and a dark complexion altogether; it was quite light where I was - I do not think the other man squinted; I will swear he did not squint.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say you thought not? A. Because I was never in a Court of Justice before, and you flurry me; I observed the prisoner as he came down; he pretty well touched me with his arm, and I looked him in the face - I looked at both of them; the prisoner passed me close - they were by the side of one another; I did not observe the colour of the prisoner's coat - there was nothing remarkable about him; I never knew him before, but am certain of him - I took notice of his face; I know very particularly that he had got a very large nose - I took notice of his nose; it was rather a long nose - the prisoner has rather a long nose in my judgment; I do not call it a snub nose, and I know him by his features; he is a slim young man - they were both slim; I gave information of what I had seen before nine o'clock - I happened to see one of Mr. Solomon's men, who had heard that I had heard something of the case; that man is not here - I never saw any thing of the kind in the court before, but as they were such respectable looking young men, I did not suspect any thing till I heard of the robbery; I am sorry to think I mentioned it, as it has got me into trouble - I am sure I have not accused the wrong man; Mr. Solomon's shop is about one hundred yards from George-court.</p>
               <p>Q. The young man tells me the received this from some body to carry, are you sure you do not know who gave it to him? A. No, I do not - it is not because I heard he carried the bag, that I swear to him - if I had seen him so soon afterwards I could have sworn to him any where.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is this the vessel you call a silver tankard? A. Yes, for I saw so much chasing about it, and I saw this goat - to the best of my belief this is the vessel; I am confident the prisoner is the man I saw put it into the bag.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Solomon. I know this wine cooler; I saw it safe about two minutes before eight o'clock, on the further end of the counter - I did not see it taken; I was absent from the shop about five hours - I left to go to another establishment in Holborn; it was safe then - I left nobody in the shop; there are two folding doors, which are fastened by a weight against them, and another by a spring - all the doors face the Strand; there is a kind of lobby - the prisoner is a stranger; I never saw him in master's shop - I saw the property at Hatton-garden on Saturday morning, and knew it to be master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it? A. By the mark of the weight inside the did, 230 ozs. or 320ozs. - I will not be sure which; the figures are 230, but how they are placed I do not know - it may be 320 or 230, and I know it by a mark on the lid, in order to fix it in its proper place; that is the figure 2 on the ridge inside - I cleaned it the morning it was stolen, before I left the premises, and saw that mark - I had the lid off, and was obliged to look for the figure 2 to put it on; I never saw one with the number 2 before - I generally see them marked No. 1; I do not remember seeing any suspicious<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270013"></xptr>character about the house in a blue frock coat - I never saw the prisoner about, to the best of my knowledge - we have a number of people call; I am not always there.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is that the identical vessel you left on your master's counter that morning? A. I verily believe it to be so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is that a common article? A. I never saw one resembling it in the least; it is of considerable value - it would be worth 5s. an ounce as old silver; I cannot be mistaken in it.</p>

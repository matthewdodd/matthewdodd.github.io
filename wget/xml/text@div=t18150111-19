               <p>JOHN BROWN. I live in White Horse-street, Stepney; I am a carpenter. On Saturday evening last, about seven o'clock, I was coming up Ratcliffe Highway, I saw the two prisoners at the bar; they were carrying beef, one had one piece of beef, and the other the other, I knew Neal before; I had suspicion; I stopped them; I asked them how they came by it; they said, they got it on board a ship. I took the prisoners and the beef to the office, and gave information where I met with the prisoners; it was exactly seven o'clock when I met the prisoners.</p>

               <p>Q. On Saturday last about half past six were you in your shop - A. Yes; the beef found upon the prisoners was taken to the office; I swore to it; it was returned to me. It was in my shop at half past six.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any beef - A. The beef that was taken to the office, I saw in my shop at half past six; afterwards I missed it from my shop. The beef that I saw in the office was the beef that I had seen in the shop. The officer came to my door, and asked me whether I had lost any beef; I missed the beef. I went to the office, and saw the beef<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110011"></xptr>there: it was my beef; I swore to it. It was beef that was in my shop for the purpose of sale. I saw no one take it out of my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left your shop - A. I did not quit the shop at all; my wife was in a little room partitioned off. I sat at the door-way, on purpose that I should have an eye over the shop and the meat. My wife reached me a cup of tea and a bit of toast; I reached out my hand to take it, and when I sat up, I missed a piece of beef; that was about half past six. I said to my wife, we have had a d - d good customer; she said what; I replied the piece of beef is gone.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence.</p>

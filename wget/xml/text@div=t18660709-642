                  </hi>. I live at 8, Bermondsey Terrace, Bermondsey, and am foreman to Mr. Humphreys, firewood merchant, Dockhead—I know Lovett—he has been six or seven years in Mr. Humphreys's employ as</p>

               <p>boy, and going out with the cart since he has been bigger—Clark is a firewood cutter in Lower Whitecross Street—on 11th June, about half-past 8 in the morning, Lovett left Dockhead with a horse and cart, loaded with boxwood, to the order of Mr. Lynes—not wood from the box-tree, but selected deal picked out for the purpose of making boxes, sound pieces selected from the rest—there was half a fathom in the cart, 108 cubic feet—the wood was up to three feet in length—when Lovett left with the cart he was to go direct to Lynes, Twister's Alley, Bunhill Row—our course of business is to give the carter a delivery note when the customer is not to pay for the wood—I gave Lovett a delivery note on this occasion—the delivery note is in duplicate, one half is kept by the customer, the other signed and delivered to carman, and brought back home—that is held as evidence of the receipt of the wood by the customer—that half delivery note was brought back to me by Lovett, about half-past 11 in the morning—it is here—about half an hour before Lovett returned Mr. Lynes's boy came to me—in consequence of what he told me, when Lovett returned I told him that Mr. Lynes had sent down, saying the wood was short, and he would have to back with me and see to it—I had not then seen Curtis—Lovett said, "I don't know anything about it. If the other man, Hickie, has done anything wrong, I must get out of it the best way I can"—strict orders had been given to all the carters not to leave their carts to any one else—Hickie worked for us 18 months ago—I told Lovett that Lynes's boy said that some of the wood had been left in Lower Whitecross Street—his answer was that he didn't go with the cart—he said, "I have been on a message for my father"—Lovett went with me to Mr. Lynes—I measured the wood, and found five-sixths of the quantity that left the yard—the value of the wood missing was about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I. then gave Lovett into custody—I saw Clark the same morning at his cellar, in Whitecross Street—he rents a cellar under the shop, No. 51—I told him that I had come on very unpleasant business, that we had information that one of our carts had been leaving wood there that morning—Clark denied that any had been left—he said he had had no wood in that morning—I said, "We have witnesses that one of our carts had been delivering wood here this morning"—he still persisted that he had none—I went to fetch an officer, who searched the place, and found a lot of wood similar to that which had been sent to Lynes's that morning—the quality was sound dealings—I took 39 pieces of that wood away—that was nearly the whole of what was missing from Mr. Lynes's cart—Clark said, "I bought that of you"—he is a customer of ours, but not for boxwood—when we sold wood to Clark we always sent a receipted bill—our transactions with him were always for ready money—we did not pursue the delivery note system with him.</p>

I asked him, "Who put the wood down at Clark's?" he said, "Nobody." I said nothing more, and he said nothing more—I wanted to see Mr. Lynes, who was engaged—I saw him after the cart drove away—I assisted in measuring the wood with one of Mr. Lynes's men—ten shillings' worth was missing, one-sixth of the whole quantity—the whole quantity was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was only 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth—I believe it was Hickie who was throwing wood off the cart.</p>

STRAIGHT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long before this 11th June had you received wood in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Seven to eight days before I have been in the habit of receiving wood of this kind from Mr. Humphreys—I never was charged with receiving wood that ought to have gone to a woman named Hayley.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the difference between deals and battens? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Battens run from six inches to seven inches wide, and two and a half in thickness—the deals are three and a half—they are larger pieces—to my knowledge, no investigation has ever been made into my conduct as regards any wood—I have never received any wood that ought to have gone to some one else.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Adelaide Place, Lower Whitecross Street—I have a very large yard to my house—the prisoner, Mr. Clark, is on terms of friendship with me—about 24th May he came to my husband and asked his permission to put some wood in the yard—I afterwards saw the wood in the yard—my husband is a house decorator—I don't know what kind of wood it was—the wood was there six or seven weeks—the wood was carried away by Mr. Clark's son-in-law.</p>

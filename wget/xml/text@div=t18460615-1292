                  </hi>. I was cousin to the deceased, and live at No. 11, Rotherfield-street, Islington. He was forty-five years old—he was stout, rather strongly built, and a man capable of aadergoing consider<lb></lb>able fatigue, and a person of average health—I recollect bis having an attack of jaundice about two months ago—he had quite recovered from it, I think—I saw him last alive on the 28th of May—he was then complaining of rheumatic pains—I saw no more of him till I went down with Mrs. Dresser to Sad<lb></lb>brook-park on the Tuesday following—we got there about fow o'clock in the evening—I then saw his dead body there, at Dr. Ellis'g house—the body was swollen very much at the stomach, and the skin, under the eye, was discoloured, very dark indeed, and the ear and the back of the ear were nearly black, and there was a froth issuing from the nostrils and mouth* covering nearly the face—I did not see the discolouration of the eye at that time—they weie covered by the froth, but afterwards, when it was removed, I saw that they were both discoloured—I saw Dr. Ellis—I made some obser<lb></lb>vations as to his death from rheumatism,—the doctor said he did not die of rheumatism but from hepatitis—that had he known he had been suffering from that disease he would not have admitted biro—he stated that he admitted him on his own statement as suffering from rheumatism that afterwards he dis<lb></lb>covered, on examination, a disease of the liver; that he had a similar attack about five years ago, which the medical gentleman who attended him on that occasion treated as rheumatism—he said there was no imputation on the skill of the medical gentleman, for the disease (hepatitis) was of a very insidious character—it was frequently oaly discovered by the use of the knife, after death—on coming into the rocaa shortly after, I asked some questions as to the state of the liver, and he stated he would give me a brief diagnosis of the case, and handed me this paper—he expressed his readiness to assist at any post mortem examination, or to meet any medical man—he expressed great sympathy with the widow.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The following is the diagnosis.</hi>)</p>
               <p>"Mr. Richard Dresser came here on Friday last to seek relief from what he termed rheumatism iu the hip, (properly <hi rend="italic">sciatica</hi>,) giving no other par<lb></lb>ticulars—the case was thought admissible, but it soon appeared, that he had been suffering from hepatitis of the subacute character, giving rise to suppura<lb></lb>tion,</p>

               <p>occasioning exudations of lymph, and a rapid extension of the disease to the adjoining viscera—the symptoms were tympanitis, total inaction of the bowels, and sluggishness of the urinary organs; very severe pain in the left leg, from the groin along the thigh to the ankle; coldness of the extremities, and loss of power. He was treated as is usual to subdue the symptoms; the pain was soon suspended; the bowels, though stubborn, acted freely after the means had been tried, and continued to do so, and the urine either passed of itself, or was drawn off. The appetite allowed of his taking a little farinaceous nourishment; but the disease proceeded insidiously; the subacute inflammation advanced gradually, until there was no sign of active progress; the organ became very generally the seat of suppuration; the pulse became quicker and softer, with much perspiration; the countenance pale and sallow; there was tumefaction of the liver, with a doughy and dematous, or boggy fal of the hepatic region generally; the enlargement or bulging was very great about the false ribs; oppression, with dyspnœa, or short breathing, imme<lb></lb>diately preceded his decease, which took place at twenty minutes before eight o'clock this morning, June 2nd, without either a sigh or a struggle. In three or four hours after his decease the fluids filled the chest and throat, and oozed copiously out of the ears, nose, and mouth."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in partnership with Mr. Hick, and live in the New Kent-road. The late Mr. Dresser was a patient of mine—I had known him six or seven years—I have attended him as his medical adviser during the whole time he was in town—he had a severe attack of rheumatism about four years ago for which I attended him—it yielded to the ordinary treatment—in March last, I was called to attend him for a pain around the back, jaundice—I considered that resulted from a deranged action of the bowels—he had a cold—he was perfectly well in a few days—it was very slight—with the exception I have mentioned, we considered him of good health, although he was not a robust man, and had a very feeble heart, a languid circulation—I saw him in April—I do not think I saw him in May—I did not see him when he last complained of rheumatic pains—there was a post mortem examination after his death by Mr. Hicks and myself—the liver was very well—we examined the chest first in consequence of the appearance of his countenance—there was blood exhuding from the lungs—they were in what we considered a very gorged state, very full of blood—the heart was large—the walls of the heart were thin, and that also was gorged—I think the state of congestion of the lungs and heart was quite sufficient to account for his death, that congestion would be accompanied by coldness ol the surface of the body, and shortness of breath terminating in death—the liver was very well, very healthy—there was no derangement of structure or actual disease in the heart or liver—my attention had been called to this diagnosis—some of the symptoms correspond with it in one or two particulars—the enlargement and extension—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I see here only one,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the presence of those circumstances stated in the paper, sup<lb></lb>posing them to have existed during life, be sufficiently indicated, to be judged of accurately by a person of competent skill in the medical profession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think sometimes it might be, but not generally—I confess it may be diffi<lb></lb>cult, but I think it might be judged of—I think it very difficult to ascertain suppuration of the liver, without a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—tympanitis of course could be judged of by distension of the bowels—hepatitis could not be ascertained from examination, except from the symptoms—I mean there may be fever with hepatitis—I think it might be told and judged of in the living subject.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming that diagnosis was accurate, that there was hepatitis, suppu<lb></lb>ration taking place, extending itself to the viscera as stated there, would the external application of wet cloths, and frequent bathing, be in your judg<lb></lb>ment a proper course of treatment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—a patient of his con<lb></lb>stitution, of feeble circulation, would unquestionably be more apt to become the subject of congestion by external applications of that kind, than persons of a more vigorous frame—I think I should be able to judge of that by the pulse—with a person of his constitution, I should certainly have objected to the application of a cloth dipped in water—to my mind, from the appearances I found, I should certainly say death was accelerated by the treatment described, at four o'clock on the Monday—or, at least that state of lungs and heart which I found, and to which I attribute the death.</p>

COCKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think this post-mortem examina<lb></lb>tion was conducted by yourself and partner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—no one else was pre<lb></lb>sent except one of our assistants—it took place on the Wednesday or Thursday, I am not quite sure which, at eight o'clock in the morning—I think on the Thursday—I do not think it was on the same day as the body was brought—it was brought on Tuesday—I have no note of what I observed—I have not dated my examination—I took it in writing, but have not seen it since, whether my partner has it I do not know—we did not each make a separate note—I wrote until I was called away, and I believe he continued it—I do not know whether notice of this <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination was given to Dr. Ellis—I did not hear his name mentioned with respect to it—I made the examination in the belief that the result of it would have the effect of con<lb></lb>tradicting the diagnosis he had adduced; but allow me to say, I did not see the diagnosis until we had determined to make the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> exami<lb></lb>nation—we determined on making the examination on the evening prior to it—I cannot tell whether it was Wednesday or Thursday, and then I taw the diagnosis—I certainly made it with the belief the result would be to show the inaccuracy of the diagnosis—if it had been suggested that somebody should be present on behalf of Dr. Ellis, I should not have objected to it, but 1 did not think of it—I think there was no congestion of the liver—I will undertake to say there was none, as far as I could judge—I was called away; my partner, in a very hasty manner, called my attention to the kidneys—I said, "I see nothing here particular; however, you prosecute it, I must go"—some one was waiting for me, therefore I did not give the kidneys a fair and proper examination—I consider that the liver was very healthy—I think I never saw one more so—I saw nothing wrong about it—there certainly was no congestion about it—taking the subsequent death with the appearances I found upon the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination; I attribute the acceleration of death to the application of wet cloths—I should</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184606150072"></xptr>
               <p>think such application injurious to any part when the circulation was to feeble, and the heart so feeble, and the extremities so cold, as I understand they were—I ascribe the coldness of the legs, and the other symptoms which Mrs. Dresser has spoken of, to loss of blood from congestion inwardly—they were deprived of blood internally—I think congestion was going on, which accounts for the symptoms which Mrs. Dresser states she saw on Monday evening—medical men are very often mistaken in these matters—I am frequently mistaken—it is impossible from mere observation of the symptoms, without a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, to ascertain beyond doubt the real nature of the disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Therefore you would hardly say that a man is to be judged, with refe<lb></lb>rence to his competence as to medical skill, or as to criminality if death should take place, you would be far from stating that he is to be judged, without a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination 1 <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We find a man may mistake a minor complaint, certainly—he is to form a judgment of the disease; but, speaking criminally, we all probably apply in ignorance, therefore may come under the term of criminality, for applying what we suppose to be a remedy, and is afterwards proved to be injurious—I, in my judgment, think that the congestion which led to the death may have been accelerated by the appli<lb></lb>cation of wet bandages—I should say, having known him and his consti<lb></lb>tution seven years, it would have been very improper, at any time, to have applied water to the surface of his body—I was his medical attendant, and certainly had the advantage over one attending him for the first time—he was what we consider a healthy man, but I cannot say he had nothing the matter with him, because he had a feeble circulation, depending upon what we considered to be a feeble heart, but he had not disease—he might have gone on for very many years, perfectly well—I thought him a healthy man, but I think a medical man, judging from his pulse, at any time, even from the first illness, would see that he had a feeble circulation, and consequently that he must be careful in his mode of treatment—a good deal would depend on the temperature of the water applied—it would make a considerable difference whether the moisture was allowed to evaporate or not, and the length of time the application was continued is to be taken into consideration—there was con<lb></lb>gestion generally throughout the lungs, and the heart was considerably congested—the blood was in the cavity of the heart—I myself examined the heart, lungs, liver, viscera, and spleen, and then we were going on to the kidneys—I saw a part of the kidneys, but not enough to give a fair opinion—no ex<lb></lb>amination was made of the brain or spine—the head was not opened—we do riot always open the brain—probably, had I not examined the lungs, I might have been induced to look at the head, I do not know that I should—I saw quite sufficient to satisfy my own mind, and therefore did not prosecute it further—I believe a congested state of the brain might produce some con<lb></lb>gestion of the lungs—had such a state of the brain possibly existed, it might have produced the appearances about the lungs and heart, but from the in formation I had it could not have been the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTONE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would a temperature of eighty-five degrees be proper to apply to a body of his description? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I think it would be too cold, and casculated, generally, to produce the appearance which I saw is the lungs and liver, and with the symptoms that I have heard mentioned by Mrs. Dresser, I should think then very considerably so—I think that a bath at eighty-five degrees upon the constitution of the deceased would necessarily drive or propel the blood from the surface of the body to the internal organs, that is the lungs—I saw no trace whatever of any disease of the brain which would produce congestion of the pulmonary organs—I should say that the brain was not diseased, even without examining it—I think I could judge</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184606150073"></xptr>
               <p>of that fairly—if there had been a disease of the brain, producing congestion of the pulmonary organs, I think I should not have been able to trace the connection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not stated that you prefer the application of quite cold water to water at eighty-five? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I may have said that this would have been the impression on my mind, if I was asked, of the two, which I would chose, a dash of cold water on the body, and dried immediately, or the continual application of water at a higher temperature, I think I may have said that I would prefer the former, and that would be the impression on joy mind now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in partnership with Mr. Waterworth. I had not attended Mr. Dresser professionally myself—I made tht <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I believe it was on the Thursday after the death—Mr. Water<lb></lb>worth was with me part of the time, but was called away before I had com<lb></lb>pleted the whole examination—the body looked externally like a man that had been drowned, immersed in water, from bjs bloated countenance, and the bloody serum issuing from his mouth and hose—there was also a great deal of congestion throughout the whole of bis trunk—there was a great deal of congestion over the whole trunk posteriorally, which, might perhaps be the effect of gravitation—I proceeded to make an internal examination, and found the lungs and heart enormously congested or gorged with blood—ths heart was large and flabby, but otherwise healthy—the liver, I must say my<lb></lb>self, was, I thought, a little too much filled with blood, but in other respects perfectly healthy—the kidneys were slightly diseased—I ascribe the death to congestion of the lungs and heart, which might be produced cither from ex<lb></lb>exposure to cold, or cold applications of water, which would propel the blood from the surface of the body into the internal organs—I have been present while the evidence has been given, and have read the diagnosis—the symp<lb></lb>toms described in that do not agree with the opinion I formed from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I know of very few instances of suppuration of the liver—I should not think the application of cold water, or water at eighty-five, a proper course to adopt for a person suffering from suppuration of the liver—I should believe the system under such a state, would not have power to produce reaction; it would tend to lower him too much—I should not think the application of cold water, or water at eighty-five, would be a proper treatment for a person suffering from the symptoms described in that diagno<lb></lb>sis—I should not adopt it myself—I believe it is wrong, and it is considered so by the profession generally, nor was it proper in the state I discovered on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been in partnership with Mr. Waterworth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years and a half—that was my first commencement of business on my own account—I bad been an assistant for several years previously—I had the entire care of a large Union practice in Hampshire, for several years, as assistant to a gentleman who was surgeon there—there is rarely a week passes but I am in the habit of attend<lb></lb>ing <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations, for, although I am in practice, I am still an Attendant at the hospital, and it is there I attend them at times, and find I profitably employ my time in so doing—I consider there were quite sufficient traces of congestion in the liver for me to see it—it was healthy, but congested—I believe that that state of congestion might have been the result of even a few hours, it was of so slight a nature—I believe the weather was particularly sultry at the time of the examination—the removal of the body from Sudbrook to London, and the hot weather, would no doubt accelerate decomposition a little—the vessels lose their tone after death, and become relaxed—the blood has a certain specific gravity.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184606150074"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it not, by the force of gravitation, descend as far as it can, from the relaxed state of the vessels, and concentrate itself around the internal organs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the lower parts of the body, but not particularly to the inter<lb></lb>nal organs—it goes to the lowest part it can get to, to the part nearest the surface of the ground—the lungs occupy the whole cavity of the chest, and lie as much anteriorally as posteriorally—the body was on its back—the con<lb></lb>gestion could not have been produced by gravitation, and I can hardly think it could be increased—I believe the lungs were so fully congested, that I doubt whether the congestion could be increased by the effect of motion—there was no decomposition, not sufficient to give rise to anything of that sort—if you examine a body next day, there is a slight degree of putrefaction—there was not sufficient in this case to give rise to any disorganization; I think, not sufficient to give rise to any descent from the lungs—I think there was not sufficient putrefaction to have caused congestion through gravitation—I do not think congestion tends to increase decomposition, and with that a relaxed state of the vessels—we did not examine the head or brain, because we thought we had found sufficient cause of death—the body looked as if it had been drowned—I connect that with the fact of congestion—the face wai bloated; I do not think that was the result of incipient decomposition—I will say it was not—the frothy appearance is all to be connected with the congested state of the lungs—there is always a certain quantity of air left in the lungs, which, acting on the fluids, where they exist, would tend to cause an oozing out after death—that is not the case with every man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What fluids are you speaking of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Blood—the lungs were so gorged with blood that it oozed into the tubes, as you may say, the air tubes of the lungs, even after death—it is impossible so to gorge the lungs but what you can get a certain quantity of air in, but air is a very different thing from blood—some part of the kidney was so diseased, that there was not enough of it to perform its functions—it prevented the secretion—that was certainly caleu<lb></lb>lated to produce very serious disease—it interferes with the blood, and I should think would generally disorder the whole system, but the amount of disease here was not sufficient for that—there was sufficient disease of the kidney here to interfere with the due exercise of its functions—a man may go on with such a state of kidneys for many years—I believe there are means of ascertaining that the kidneys are diseased long prior to death—we of course cannot ascertain the amount of disease before we see them, but can ascertain that they are considerably diseased—I think there was not sufficient disease in this man's kidneys to interfere very seriously with his general state of health—I believe they would secrete the urine properly—I have frequently examined bodies where persons have had a greater amount of disease of the kidneys, and yet not have suffered during life—there was no doubt here sufficient indication of disease—my partner did not want to see it, as he was called away on urgent business—I found it just as he was leaving, and called his attention to it—I do not think he said he could see no trace of disease, but that I might prosecute the inquiry if I liked—had I seen the individual with cold extremities, and the difficult breathing which has been spoken of, I should have thought him suffering, if not from congestion, at least from a great tendency to it—I think there may be other derangements which would lead to those symptoms—I know there are several—from other symptoms taken in connection with those two that have been named, I should have imagined that he was suffering from congestion of the lungs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had happened to know that just before, the bowels were in a very disordered state, that it was necessary to have recourse to artificial means for their relief, would all those things together have induced you to doubt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184606150075"></xptr>
               <p>No, they would irot, certainly—had I seen an individual suffering as described by the widow, 1 should have considered he was suffering from congestion of the lungs, I mean the difficulty of breathing, the dark countenance, and the cold extremities—the darkness of countenance was connected with the con<lb></lb>gestion, by preventing the due circulation of the blood—there are diseases of the brain which cause congestion of the lungs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure you are not mistaken about the five o'clock bath, was not that on the Sunday morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am persuaded it was on Monday—there was none on Sunday—I did not attend him on Sunday—the doctor wai not there the whole time of the bath—he just went outside the door and came in again in a minute, and had him taken out of the bath—I assisted at two baths—the first was with the doctor, and the second with the bathroan—that was on the Monday—the bathman generally carries a watch with him at the time he gives the baths—whether he had it then or not I do not know—I am perfectly ignorant of the water treatment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter at the establishment at Sudbrook-park. I have been there altogether about eighteen months—I remember the Monday, the day before Mr. Dresser died—I was in his room on the Monday morning from half-past three o'clock till five, when Dr. Ellis came in—I did not return after that—I saw no more of him—I did not give him anything—he seemed to be in a very comfortable way.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Park-place gardens, and was formerly a member of Parliament—I have known Dr. Ellis about six months—I should say he is a person of care, skill, and humanity—I was under his care a short time, and have every reason to speak favourably and well of what occurred—I should say, great care was one of his peculiar "fortes," and with regard to his humanity, from what I heard other patients say, (I had no occasion to test his humanity myself,) it was very great indeed, and most per<lb></lb>fectly satisfactory—he always appeared extremely attentive—particularly so.</p>

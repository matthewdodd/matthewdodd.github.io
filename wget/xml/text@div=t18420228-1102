                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Foley's-buildings, Black-heath. On the 17th of February, about eleven o'clock at night, I was proceeding from London to Blackheath—I stopped at the King's Arms public-house, in the Kent-road, to wait for an omnibus—I saw the prisoner standing outside the door of the King's Arms, and requested him to call in omnibus for me if any passed—he said he would, and I gave him a pint of porter—I had twelve sovereigns in my left-hand waistcoat-pocket at that time—I was perfectly sober—I had taken nothing whatever—no om<lb></lb>nibus came up, and I proceeded to walk—when I got about 300 yards from the house, the prisoner came behind me, and tripped me up—I fell back<lb></lb>wards on the ground—I felt his hand in my waistcoat-pocket—he immedi<lb></lb>ately took out the twelve sovereigns, and ran away—I saw his face by the gas lamp on the spot, while I was on the ground, and his hand in my pocket—I am quite certain of him, and I am quite certain that the person who threw me down and took my money, was the person to whom I had given the pint of beer—he ran away towards town—I got up, and proceeded towards my residence—I did not follow him—I looked back, and he was gone out of sight—I followed back a few yards, but did not see any thing of him, and have not the least idea what became of him—I gave a full description of his person at several station-houses—I saw him again next day, and he perfectly agreed with the person—he only put his hand into my waistcoat-pocket, where my money was—he had not seen my money at the inn—he might have heard it jink—I might have been playing with it in my hand in my pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 18th of February, be<lb></lb>tween four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I went with the prosecutor into the King's Arms public-house, and inquired of the landlord if he had seen the prosecutor there the night before—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he had seen any person in company with the prosecutor—he said, no; he recollected his speaking to somebody outside—we then went to the Green Man and to the Swan public-houses, but not inside—we then went to the Bricklayer's Arms public-house—I told the prosecutor to go in and see if he could see the person who robbed him—he came out, pointed to the prisoner, who stood at a little distance, and said, "I think that is the man that robbed me"—I told him he must be very certain he was the right person before I could take him, and told him to go and look at him—he went to him, and spoke to him—I did not hear what he said—I went near him—he looked round, and then he said he was the man that robbed him—I asked him again if he was certain he was the person who robbed him—he said, "Yes, I am certain that is the one that robbed me; I know his voice"—I then took the prisoner to the landlord of the King's Arms to see if he recollected seeing him in the prosecutor's com<lb></lb>pany the night before—the landlord said no, he did not see him—the pro<lb></lb>secutor had previously come to our station that same day, and given a description of the person who robbed him—he described him as a person about twenty years of age, rather short, and stout—he was asked whether he was pock-marked or not—he said at first he was not sure, but after that he said he was pock-marked, and that he was dressed in a black coat—I believe he said he was of a light complexion, but I cannot be sure—I do not believe he said anything about his eyes—I searched the prisoner, and found 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

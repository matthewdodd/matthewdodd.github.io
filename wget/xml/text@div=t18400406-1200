                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I was a clerk in the prize-office at Chelsea Hospital in April, 1835—I continued there till the beginning of 1837, when there was a reduction of clerks, and I was put on a superan<lb></lb>nuation allowance—it was my duty to answer the applications of persons for prize-money, and for that purpose I had access to the prize lists, which would show the regiments, and the persons belonging to them entitled to receive prize-money which was not already received—the prisoner was in the habit of coming to the Hospital in 1835, and before that—he had the opportunity of acquiring a knowledge of the mode in which business was done—I know Beresford Eaton, he has been a navy agent—I had seen Mr. Flinn repeatedly as an applicant for prize-money, and I was intro<lb></lb>duced to him by Mr. Eaton more intimately—I entered into an arrange<lb></lb>ment with Mr. Eaton and Lieutenant Flinn about information to be given by me with respect to prize-money—the agreement in the first instance was to furnish the names of some soldiers entitled to Diamante prize-money—Diamante is on the coast of Calabria—I was to receive two and a half per cent. for the information I furnished in that case—it was merely for giving information, whether they got any thing or not—after that I saw the prisoner more frequently—there was afterwards an arrangement</p>

               <p>made between Mr. Eaton and myself, on the subject of information as to the names of officers who were entitled to prize-money—that occa<lb></lb>sionally included non-commissioned officers—it was about persons entitled to prize-money of right, and also which had been forfeited by the lapse of time—I was to have five per cent. for that—I received a per-centage from Mr. Flinn himself on one occasion—I have frequently received a per<lb></lb>centage from Mr. Eaton—among other names which I furnished to Mr. Eaton, I gave him the same of George Langly, a sergeant in the St. Helena infantry, and also the amount of prize-money he was-entitled to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there, at the time you furnished the information, any document in the office to which you belonged, by which you knew that Langley was dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was occasionally in the prize lists a mark, but I do not recollect distinctly whether there was a mark against Langly's name in the prize-list or not—I was to have a per-centage for the information I furnished respecting Langly, if the money was received—the five per-cent was only in case of the receipt of the money—I saw the prisoner at Mr. Eaton's shortly before the money was received—he asked me if appli<lb></lb>cation had been made for the St. Helena sergeant's money—I told him I did not think it had—he told me to look out, for if application had not been already made, it would shortly be made—I remember paying that money at the hospital—I took the receipt for the money, and gave a cheque for the amount—I saw Mr. Theleure—I cannot say whether he is the person to whom it was paid, it is so long since—I saw the prisoner again shortly after the payment of the money—I mentioned the circum<lb></lb>stance of the money being paid, expecting a commission—I mentioned it first to Mr. Eaton, and afterwards to Mr. Flinn, at Mr. Eaton's house—he asked to whom the money was paid—in consequence of some inquiry made by Mr. Eaton or Mr. Flinn, I examined the book, to see who it was paid to—I found it out by means of a card, I believe—I told Mr. Flinn it was paid to a man named Theleure—he said he knew nothing about it—I have teen the prisoner write frequently, and think the receipt endorsed on this paper is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long were you in the office at the Hospital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went in 1821, and left in 1837—it was Mr. Eaton who first applied to me for information respecting prize-money—the first proposal was made about the Diamante prize-money—the first offer made to me was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I declined that, and said I would do it at a per-centage—Mr. Eaton made that offer for the information respecting the Diamante prize-money—Mr. Eaton frequently paid me a per-centage—I should think I have received from Mr. Eaton 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—my salary as clerk was 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year at first, and then 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had no undertaking with any prize agent but Mr. Eaton for giving information, I swear that—I have taken this per-centage for the last five or six years that I was in the office—I never received any money from any agent except Mr. Eaton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I presume it is quite in accordance with the rules of the office that clerks were allowed to give information, and receive a per-centage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is contradictory to the rules of the office—none of the other clerks knew of that arrangement of mine, to my knowledge—I did not tell them of it—I did not receive any letter about Langly, nor did I see it—I was not aware the application had been made until the money was demanded—I had nothing to do with the corresponding department—I did not refer to any book to ascertain whether the man was dead before I paid the money</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060142"></xptr>
               <p>—I will swear it—it is possible, if there was a mark of "dead" against that name on the list, I might have put that mark, but I certainly never referred—I took the name from a book before the money was paid, and entered it in a private memorandum-book of my own—I do not know whether the mark of "dead"—was against it then—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the original book</hi>)—there is no mark against that same—this is the book I copied the memorandum from—I do not think any body was present but Mr. Eaton, Mr. Flinn, and myself, when he asked me about the sergeant's prize-money—I have never received any per-centage on that money—I did not ask Mr. Eaton for it—I mentioned the circumstance to him when the money was paid, and he said he had not received it—I then mentioned it to Mr. Flinn, and he said he knew nothing about it—I should think it is eight or nine months back that I was first applied to for information as to this, it is since I have left the office—I think I then told all I knew, as I have to-day—I told it shortly afterwards—MR. Bicknell, the solicitor, applied to me—I wrote to him, and gave him the information—I first saw him personally, and told him I had abstracted some names, and into whose hands I placed them—I think I mentioned Lieut. Flinn's name in my letter to Mr. Bicknell, but not in my first interview, nor Mr. Eaton's—there was a suspicion against me—I do not think I have been threatened with a prosecution in respect to this transaction—there were several cases of this sort—whether this is one of which they entertained suspicion against me I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been generally threatened with a prosecution on account of the part you took in these transactions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, yes, perhaps—I be<lb></lb>lieve I have, but I did not understand you distinctly—I know I have acted in breach of my duty, contrary to Act of Parliament, and believe it is in the power of the Hospital to punish me—I believe I have not been threatened that I should be prosecuted and punished—there has never been a distinct threat made to me—I do not think Mr. Bicknell has ever said any thing distinctly to me about prosecuting me for it—he has certainly told me what he could do, but never told me, "I will do it," that I recollect—he has told me I am liable to be punished—I told Mr. Bicknell that I had received 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for per-centage—he is perfectly acquainted with that—he has seen it from my own memorandum, and I have admitted it—Mr. Bicknell has my private memorandums—I did not give them to him—they were taken from me—my house was searched, I think, last May or June, the same day that Mr. Bicknell saw me, I think—I was not at home at the time—it was after that that I wrote to Mr. Bicknell on the subject—I wrote to him shortly after giving him an account of the transaction, it was not so full an account as I afterwards gave him—I think in Decem<lb></lb>ber I gave him the fullest account—that referred to a great number of other cases—he urged me to tell him all I knew.</p>

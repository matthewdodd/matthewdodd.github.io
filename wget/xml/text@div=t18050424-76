             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the niece of Mr. Dark? - A. Yes, when I came down stairs in the morning my aunt told me of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Your aunt and you keep the shop I understand; look at these five pair of stockings? - A. These are Mr. Dark's, I saw them on the Saturday night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say you are sure these stockings are part of Mr. Dark's property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a great variety of cotton stockings? - A. We have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, when you were at the Magistrate's, saying you could not undertake to speak to those stockings till you had got some more to match them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that was the reason that you formed that opinion upon the subject? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you recollect the Magistrate sending for a needle and thread - Why did you send for a needle and thread? - A. To mark the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. That you might know them; that when you came to the Old Bailey or elsewhere, before the Grand Jury, you might swear to them - You had no occasion for a needle and thread, if you could have known those stockings abstracted from all other stockings in the world; I suppose you would have known them if you had worn them and mended them; then you would not have wanted a needle and thread? - A. I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. These stockings you marked at the Magistrate's, in order that you should know them again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you only know them again by referring to other stockings that you had in Mr. Dark's shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You put a mark on them to know they were the same that were put into the constable's hands? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say you had matched them with some others? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these stockings that you had to match them with of the same manufactory that had not been stolen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course whoever had robbed the house, they had stolen some stockings, and had left others behind them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they matched exactly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark on them? - A. It was torn off.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the shop mark? - A. Plain, 4 s. 6 d. on a piece of paper tacked to the heel.</p>
               <p>Q. You found that part of the stockings which had not been taken away from you corresponded with those stockings, and which were of the same parcel? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When you saw those stockings at the pawnbroker's, had they been worn? - A. They did not appear to me to have been worn.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these stockings, and see if you know them? - A. They are Mr. Dark's, and they are of the same sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they any mark by which you know them? - A. The mark is gone, but there is the tacking at the heel that was done at the shop; I generally mark all the stockings so, I tack them together, and there is the mark that I put at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. You make a tack at the heel to all the stockings that come into your shop? - A. Yes, always, and it is in these stockings now; I tack them together in pairs.</p>

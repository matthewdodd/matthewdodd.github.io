                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of meat appointed by the Corporation of the City of London, doing duty at Newgate-market—on Tuesday, 6th March, about 7 in the morning, I was on duty there, and saw the defendant beside a waggon with a man named Jarvis—the defendant took two pigs from the waggon, and took them one at a time into Mr. Burroughs' shop, a salesman in the market—I saw the last one deposited there, and then went in and saw them both, and found them unfit for human food, they were the carcases of two sows which had died in conse<lb></lb>quence of having recently pigged—their insides were green, and they had evidently been dead some time—the teats were cut off, and a portion of the milk sacks—the carcases were in a high state of inflammation, and I caused them to be inspected by Dr. Letheby and Mr. Newman—the carcases had been scalded and dressed in the usual way in which they are dressed for market—the salesmen receive consignments of meat and sell to the butchers on commission.</p>

I am medical officer of health to the Corporation of London—on 6th March, I examined the carcases of two sows which had died in the act of farrowing, or immediately after—the flesh was not fit for human food—they had been dead some time before they were dressed, and the intestines had lain in their bodies after death, I know that by the green putrefaction of the inner lining of the abdomen</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective City-policeman—in consequence of instructions from the Corporation, I went down to Leighton Buzzard on 7th April, and saw the defendant; he is a higher, and deals in pork, vegetables, and similar articles—I said that I was a detective officer, and had come from London to make inquiries concerning two sows which had been sent by Mr. Jarvis's waggon to Mr. Burroughs' shop, in Newgate-market, and which Jarvis stated belonged to him, and most likely he would be prose<lb></lb>cuted for sending them, but if he chose to answer any questions he could, but it was most likely I should have to use it against him before a Magis<lb></lb>trate—he stated that he had bought the sows dead and dressed on 5th March, but declined to say of whom or what he gave for them—he said that he bought one of the sows and a calf at the Bell at Hockliff, on the other side of Dunstable, that he went with Jarvis's waggon to London, and when it arrived at Newgate-market he carried the sows from the waggon to Mr. Burroughs' shop, that he never intended Mr. Burroughs to sell them for human food, for he did not think they were fit for it; that he had spoken to Thomas Baker who keeps a public-house at South Minims, as he and Jarvis came up with the waggon; that Baker was an agent to Mr. Elliot, or some other man who was a boiler, that Baker did not want the meat at South Mimms, but would meet him in London and buy it, which he had not done.</p>

               <p>which consists of salesmen's shops in different alleys and streets—there is no great building—my shop is in Warwick-lane, which is in the market—I have known the defendant four or five years, he has brought a good deal of meat to me on his own and on other people's account—on 6th March, between 7 and 8 in the morning, I was absent from the shop for a minute or two, and when I came back I found the carcase of a sow lying on one of my blocks—I saw the defendant almost immediately afterwards with another sow which he placed alongside the other—almost immediately after that Mr. Fisher came in, and in the defendants presence examined the sows, said they were in a very bad state, and seized them as unfit for food—the prisoner said nothing—meat is never consigned to me for any other purpose than human food—the prisoner came two or three times that day—he came three-quarters of an hour, or an hour, after he brought the sows, and said that he did not intend them for sale, but had brought them up for the boilers, and merely placed them in my shop to be convenient, because they were taking some meat of Jarvis's out of the waggon—I told him he should not have brought them there, and that he ought to have told that to Mr. Fisher—he made no reply—I think he has brought me meat three or four times before, not more, and I have paid him for it—we cut quarters up, if butchers require it, and have boards for that purpose at the back of the shop, and it was there that he threw them.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner: Webb delivered me four shillings, two of which were marked; I found on the prisoner three good shillings, six sixpences, and 8 1/2d - in his waistcoat and breeches pockets I found ten counterfeit shillings, and in his jacket pocket a paper containing fifty-one counterfeit shillings, each wrapped separately in paper; I found some letters in his pocket-book, and under the seal of one of them was a bad sovereign, in whitey-brown paper.</p>
               <p>MR. FIELD. I am an inspector of counterfeit coin. These two shillings are both counterfeit, and from the same die; the sixty-one shillings are also counterfeit, and from the same die - there is a slight silvering on them, which a little rubbing will remove.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went and pawned my clothes for 6s., and as I came out two gentleman came and asked what I had been there for; I said to get something to enable me to go home: they each gave me 2s. a piece.</p>

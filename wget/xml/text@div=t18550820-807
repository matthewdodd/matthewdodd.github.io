                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an Interpreter</hi>). I am a tailor, and live at Whitechapel. On Friday, 6th July, I saw Myers—he said that as far as laid in his power he should raise money sufficient, and he could get work for me to the amount of thousands; that he knew some of the highest foremen in the establishment of Mr. Pearce, the army contractor over the way, and if I would raise money he could get me work—I was with him in a public house, and he pointed over the way—I do not know the name of the street, but that is the owner of the public house (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Richards</hi>)—both Myers and Dowling showed me the house—Myers took me to the public house on the Saturday following at 1 o'clock, and we there met Dowling—when I went in, Myers asked Dowling if he could speak a few words to him—he spoke to him, but I did not well understand what he said—Dowling told me that he was the highest man at Mr. Pearce's, and had got the control—I asked him who Mr. Pearce was, but I could not understand what he answered—he addressed me in English, and Myers translated it—I gave Dowling 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that occasion in the public house, that was because he told me that he would get me plenty of work—I can speak a little English—I talked English with Dowling, and that which I could not speak Myers spoke for me—I could not understand the meaning in English of the sentences which Myers translated, I only listened to what Myers told me—Dowling handed me over six coats to make, that was directly after I had given him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me no receipt for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it was for security for the six coats—I made them up and Myers took them to the place, because I did not know where to go—I went with him, and saw Dowling in the same room—he said in English that I came too late, that he had 100 coats and could not wait any longer for me—Myers said, that we ought to have been there before—I understood some part of it, and</p>

               <p>the remainder Myers told me—Dowling took the six coats, and brought me down seven others—he said something about a farther advance of money, but I did not understand him—I counted to Myers 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the table, and he counted it into Dowling's hand who put it into his pocket—I did not understand what was said about why this money was to be paid to Dow<lb></lb>ling—I had known Myers a week or a fortnight before 6th July—he spoke to me on 6th July, about knowing Mr. Pearce's foreman, in German, and I thoroughly understood what he said—he said that he knew the highest foreman of the government contractors, but did not mention the name of one of the contractors before the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid, and then he mentioned Mr. Pearce over the way—that was before I paid him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I would not give him the money, till I was shown the name of Pearce over the way—Dowling said the word "Pearce," and Myers showed me over the way—I could not understand the word Pearce from Dowling, without any inter<lb></lb>pretation from Myers—I heard from Dowling that he took the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for security, but I understood nothing from him except what Myers translated—Myers said that he saw Dowling take in the work and give out the work, and he was the highest foreman at Pearce's, that the governor had no control, that he had all the control, and could do as he liked—he did not tell me how long he had known him—when Myers first spoke to me he said, "We have got a chance to make a fortune of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," because he was the highest foreman—before I gave the money, I asked him if he knew the man—he said, "Yes, and you will make us both unfortunate if you do not give the money"—that he saw Dowling take in the work and take out the work, and it would be mine and my children's fortune—Dowling gave me this paper (<hi rend="italic">a receipt for</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—I cannot read English, nor can I under<lb></lb>stand German in writing—I cannot read.</p>

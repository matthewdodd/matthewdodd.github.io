                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a tobacconist'-shop in Hampstead. On the 30th of July a man came for a halfpenny-worth of to<lb></lb>bacco-dust—I said I did not sell it—he said, "Not sell it?"—I said, "No"—he turned immediately, put his hand over the counter, took a box of che<lb></lb>roots, and ran away—I should not know him again, he was too quick—this is my box that he ran away with.</p>

I saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutors shop—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," followed him, and stopped him—he had nothing with him—I did not see him throw anything away—I did not swear that he threw the box down, that it split, and that the cigars fell into the road—this is my mark to this deposition—I saw the box drop, but I could not see who dropped it—there was no one else near the prisoner that could have dropped it—there was no one within ten yards of him.</p>

I was standing in my shop at a quarter past two o'clock that day—I ran to my door, and saw some one running—I saw a box drop from him—I took it up, and found it con<lb></lb>tained cheroots—the person was brought back by Gill—I could not identify him—he ran by too quick.</p>

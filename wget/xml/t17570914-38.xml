               <p>Q. How came you to be so particular, as to his being the person?</p>
               <p>Ben. I took notice of him in respect of his saying, '' I have got a note, but I don't know '' whether you will chuse to take it;'' because a gentleman never says so. I took notice of him on his saying those words.</p>
               <p>Q. What does a gentleman say on such an occasion ?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you apprize Mr. Drummond of it?</p>
               <p>Ben. No, I did not. I apprehended the prisoner might be a gentleman, and was going out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this that you repaid the money?</p>
               <p>Ben. It was three months after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you publickly speak of this at that time?</p>

               <p>Ben. I spoke of it to several people, but not publickly.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ben has made himself an evidence, and it is impossible for me to prove a negative where I was at the time. If a thing of that kind falls in any honest man's hands it should be made publick. It was his duty to have published it in the papers. I know my own innocence, therefore can speak very freely. I may be like another man, and another man may be like me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ben. The prisoner says one man may be like another, look at him again, and determine, upon your oath, whether you take him to be the man, or whether you can swear positively that he is the man that brought this note so indorsed to you?</p>
               <p>Ben. I really believe him to be the very man. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your opinion when you saw him at justice Fielding's?</p>
               <p>Ben. I knew him plainly the first moment I saw him there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. On the first examination he did not speak positively, but said I was very much like the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever dubious as to his being the man?</p>
               <p>Ben. No, I was not; the moment I saw him I told justice Fielding he was the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can say no more than that I am innocent. He accuses me very unjustly.</p>

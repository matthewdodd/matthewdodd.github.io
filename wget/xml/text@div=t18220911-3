On the 10th of August, I received twenty-four sovereigns and twenty-seven shillings of Mr. Dowling, a salesman; I also received five sovereigns at Mr. Butler's in London-wall, and one I had in my pocket. I called at many more places, which detained me till between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, and then I had to return to Mr. Dowling's - as I crossed <placeName id="t18220911-3-crimeloc11">Wentworth-street, Brick-lane</placeName>

I was pulled down by one of the women, and held down till my money was taken - I felt it go out of my pocket; I was kept down till the person who took it got out of my sight. When the money was gone a man caught hold of me, and pretended to assist me - this was nearly nine o'clock at night; it was dark, and the lamps were lit. The prisoner is the woman who was present a minute or two before the money was taken, but I did not see her at the time it was taken - I could not turn round I was so penned down by another girl who was with the prisoner when I first saw her. There were two women present when my money was taken. As soon as I could turn round the prisoner was gone, and the other one got away - I saw the other run away alone; I did not see the prisoner while they were taking the money or afterwards. I did not see who took it, but I saw the prisoner with the woman who held me before; they were talking together. I did not see her again till above a week afterwards. I had been drinking, and was not sober - I might have drank three or four pints of beer, and a glass or two of gin or so - I walked without assistance, and was particular in fastening my pocket. The man got away. I was pulled down by the two women - I had seen the prisoner not two minutes before. I saw no other women but the prisoner and another. I lost all my money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You saw nobody take hold of you - A. One of the women and somebody took hold of me behind, but I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or not. I did not see the man till the instant the money was gone. I believe the neigbourhood is the resort of women of the town. I am satisfied that the prisoner was in company with the woman a few minutes before. I saw her again a fortnight or three weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she not brought up four times before you ventured to swear to her - A. Three times I believe.</p>

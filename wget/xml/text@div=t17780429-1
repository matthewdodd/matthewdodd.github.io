I sat upon the fore-board of my cart, with my horses double; there was a man in the cart with me; his name, I believe, is Minew, he is a weaver: as I was driving along, he said, Mr. Farrow your things give way. I turned my head and saw the tail of the cart open; it was a tilted cart, with a sacking cover, and was tied behind with a strong hempen rope. Seeing my cart open behind, I was stopping my horses; when a man came up on foot to the near side of my cart, and said, halloa! I said halloa! said he, what is the matter? I said matter enough; then he said, stop this minute or I will blow your brains out; I stopped. Then he put a cutlass to my breast, and said, if you stir or move I will cut your bloody head off. I did not see any pistol: as soon as he had said that, he halloed out, come on, come on; then Thomas Bright came on the off side of my cart, and another came up into the hind part of my cart, and one went to the horses heads; when he came to the horses heads, he said, what is the matter? the other said, go along, what is that to you, or I will blow your brains out; he replied, don't you know me, blast you come round, you are stupid, you don't know what you are about, and I have a good mind to blow your brains out; it was the man who stood over me that said that to the other that came on the off side of the cart; then that man came round to the hind part of the cart; then they called to one another, ship off, ship off. The man that stood over me kept threatening me that if I offered to look or turn my head he would cut my bloody head off. They then took a trunk containing ladies wearing apparel, a basket of earthen ware, a deal box of gingerbread, and an empty sack.</p>

               <p>How long did they stay with you? - Full a quarter of an hour; they came off for London. After they had ransacked the cart the first time, when they did not take the bag of grocery, they did not seem to be satisfied with what they had got; the man that stood over me said, have you nothing else? I said no; he then put his foot over the foot-board of my cart and felt the bag; he said, this is a bag of grocery? I said it was, and that I had forgot to tell them of it. Then he called out to one of them, come on and get this out, here is a bag of grocery; upon that Grant came up into the cart, Bright came up on the off side, and then the others called out, come on. Grant could not get the bag of grocery out himself, he blasted my eyes, and said, if I did not help him out with it he would cut my bloody head off. I assisted them, and the man that stood over me helped it down. Grant continued in the cart and searched it a second time; he swore, if he found a box or any thing in it more than they had got, they would cut my bloody head off. I begged hard for my life: I told them I had a large family, and I told them I had nothing but paper and half a hogshead of ale, and I begged them not to throw that out; they blasted me and the ale too; then I thought they would have let me go. Bright said, now the man may go on; the man that stood over me replied no, d - n him, he shall not; he bid Bright come and take a pistol. Bright came towards me and took something, but whether a pistol or what I cannot tell; the other bid him go to the horses heads, and said, if he offers to stir or move blow his brains out, and I will go behind and see if they have got all off; Bright went accordingly and stood at my horses heads, and he went behind my cart; I believe he might be gone a full minute; then he came up again, and said they have got all off, all is clear; Bright said, now he may go on; no, said the other, d - n him, he shall not go; then I was afraid they were going to use me ill. I begged for mercy; they said d - n you we will cut your reins. I begged hard that they would not; yes, blast you, said the man that stood over me with a culass, we will cut your reins, or people will say you have not been robbed, this will convince them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290004"></xptr> that you have. Then the man that stood over me with a cutlass cut my near horse's rein, and

I said, gentlemen, pray don't use me ill, for I cannot go on without I tye my horses together, for my horse in the shafts is blind; the man with the cutlass said, you may get down and tye your horses together, but if you offer to come behind your cart or look back, we will blow your brains out; and they said, if I met any body and made any alarm, they would follow me and cut my head off. I said I would not. I was obliged to lead my horses all the way home.</p>

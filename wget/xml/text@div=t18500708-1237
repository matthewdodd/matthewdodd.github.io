                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my employ up to 1848, as clerk, at a salary—in Nov., 1848, I arranged to employ him on commission, at five per cent. on what he collected—it was his duty to pay the full amount as received—the commission was always in our cash-book—I made advances to him from time to time—he never accounted to me for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. Williams in Nov.—that sum was due up to Michaelmas last—I made Mr. Williams' account out to Christmas—it was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave it to Reynolds, one of my assistants—the prisoner did not account to me for that sum, as having been received on 9th March—on 11th May he came to the desk where I was, and he said, "I have just received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Williams; it is all he can spare just now; he will let me have some more very shortly"—that is all the account he has rendered me in reference to that account delivered up to Christmas—he has never accounted for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. Dent on 25th April.</p>

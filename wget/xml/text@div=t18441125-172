                  </hi>. I am a watch and clock maker, and live in Blen<lb></lb>heim-place, High-street, Peckham. The prisoner was in my service about a month—I had not been engaged in business at Peckham above a fort<lb></lb>night—I carry on business at Farningham, in Suffolk—the prisoner was about to leave me—in consequence of having missed two tea-spoons I re<lb></lb>quired to see her boxes—she would not allow me to see them—I went out, called on somebody, and on my return I found the constable with the pri<lb></lb>soner in custody—her box was with her—they were coming towards my house—I saw her box searched by the constable a my house, and found a</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable P</hi> 90.) On Friday evening, the 15th of Nov., I was called by Mrs. Barnes into the shop—while speaking to her the prisoner came in—I heard Mrs. Barnes ask her why she took her box away—she said because she wanted to book her place to go by the eight o'clock <hi rend="italic">buss</hi> to Charing-cross—she ran out at the door, down to where she had taken her box, about fifty yards from Mr. Barnes's—I followed—she took her box from there—I took her into custody as she was turning the things out of her box into the chandler's shop—I stopped her from doing so, put the things back into the box, and took her and the box to Mr. Barnes's—on getting there the things now produced were found in her box—she said she had bought some of them at two or three shops above there—I found this silver spoon in her hand, a little knife, and this necklace.</p>

I have no reason to believe that my wife told her to help herself—my wife has money—I do not know that she always has money by her—I suppose she had sufficient, but I do not know how it was at that time—I understood the prisoner to bear a very good character when I took her—her friends are very respectable—I do not know what wages she was to have.</p>

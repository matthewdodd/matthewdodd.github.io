My landlady's goods had been all seized, and this other woman asked me to go and sleep with her, she had this man with her, he offered me four shillings to sleep with me all night; I told him I could not, for I had no lodging of my own, and he gave this young woman a shilling to get some liquor, and he gave me the handkerchief; he began pulling me about, and pulling me upon his knee, and said he would leave these things, which were worth more than four shillings; and then he said he was robbed of his watch, and his handkerchief, and a pair of gloves, and he gave charge of me to the watchman; I have never seen any thing of this young woman since.</p>

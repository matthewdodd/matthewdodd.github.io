                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Samuel Bailey, of Windsor-terrace, Canal-grove, Mile-end. On 3rd April I went from the front to the back parlour, about a quarter-past eight o'clock in the evening—two dresses were hanging in the front parlour, and a paletot, a handkerchief, and other articles—the parlour window looks into the street, it was a little way open—when I left the front parlour my sister was there, and she left it about ten minutes after me—no one went into the room, to my knowledge, after my sister came out—I went in again about ten minutes before nine—the window was then wide open, and I missed the two dresses, some calico, the paletot, and other things—these are the sheet and petticoat—I know them by the work on them—there was a mark on the sheet which is not here now—they are my father's.</p>

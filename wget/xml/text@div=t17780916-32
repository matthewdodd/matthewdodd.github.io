I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment on the 23d of July, except the silver watch, which I missed before They were locked up in a chest; the last time I looked in the chest was last March was twelve months. The prisoner was my servant; she had been with me ever since October was twelvemonths; I opened the chest and missed the things; I charged her with taking them; she immediately confessed, she had pawned them with one Burrows in Barbican, and produced the duplicates. I made her no promise to induce her to confess; she did it voluntarily as soon as I opened the chest.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I was charged with the prisoner; she confessed taking the things: the things were all mentioned before the alderman; and Burrows said he knew nothing of them.</p>
               <p>- BURROWS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker in Barbican. I know nothing of the prisoner, only her coming backwards and forwards to my shop. I have a watch and a buckle; that is all I have with me. I asked him to let me see the tickets; he would not.</p>
               <p>Did you take in seven sheets, &amp;c. of the prisoner? - I do not know; if the prosecutor will show me the duplicates, I will tell him whether they are mine.</p>
               <p>Ashburn. When the prisoner was taken up, I went to Mr. Burrows, and told him the alderman desired him to attend at Guildhall; he asked on what account; I told him he had taken in some stolen goods; I described the goods and the prisoner, and told him where I lived; he denied that he had any such articles. I desired he would go to the alderman, but he would not; but desired. I would go to some other pawnbrokers, for he knew nothing of any such woman in the court that I lived in. I thought he dealt so unfairly as a tradesman, I did not choose to let him see any of the tickets.</p>
               <p>(The duplicates produced.)</p>
               <p>Burrows. They are all mine.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes; the goods mentioned in the tickets are all at my house pawned by the prisoner. I did not give her any duplicate with the watch and buckle. They were pawned to me by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>[The watch and buckle were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.]</p>

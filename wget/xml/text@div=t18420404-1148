                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Seddon, who keeps the Swan public-house at Drayton. The prisoner was our domestic servent between three and four months—in consequence of suspicions which I en<lb></lb>tertained on the 8th of March, I marked eight shillings, and put them into my till—I saw the prisoner in the bar that day—I first missed one shill<lb></lb>ling, and afterwards the others—I told my husband next day, a policeman was called in, her box was searched, in her presence and my own, and two of the marked shillings were found in it—she seemed very much confused, and said if I would forgive her she would return me the money she had taken—I asked her what she had done with the other two shillings—she said if I would forgive her she would tell me.</p>

               <p>servent of all work—we only kept one servant—I never left my till unlocked except by accident—she had no key to it—it was unlocked at the time she got to it—I had left it unlocked by accident—I have missed money before, when I have left it unlocked, which was very seldom—I accidentally left it unlocked for five minutes about two o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon and again about half-past six—she was in the room at the time—I did not leave it unlocked to give her the opportunity of taking the money—I did it accidentally both times—I marked the money on the 8th—I did not do it by the policeman's advice, but out of my own head—I did not see the policeman till the 9th, after I had missed the marked money—I did not say any thing to the prisoner when I missed the money at two o'clock—I locked my till then—I unlocked it again about half-past six, and left the room for a few minutes, leaving the prisoner there—I went to the till for money, and did not lock it afterwards—I did not leave it un<lb></lb>locked on purpose particularly—I forgot it at the moment—I examined the till before I left the room at half-past six o'clock, to see that the money was right—I am sure I left it unlocked by accident.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 175.) On the 9th of March I was called in by Mrs. Seddon—I went into the prisoner's bed-room, the prisoner was present—Mrs. Seddon said she wished me to search her box, as she thought she had got some of her money—the prisoner said she had not any money belonging to Mrs. Seddon—she then pot her band into her box, took out a bag, and gave it to me, saying there was no money there belonging to Mrs. Seddon—I found in the bag three half-crowns and two franc-pieces, two shillings, four six-pences, and two fourpenny-pieces—I asked Mrs. Seddon if the money was here, and she picked out two of the shillings—the prisoner then burst out crying, and said it was the first time she had done such a thing, and if her mistress would forgive her, she would give her all she had got.</p>

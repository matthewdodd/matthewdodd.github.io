            , who lives at Enfield. On Saturday, the 26th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was about a quarter of a mile from my master's house, returning home from Southgate - I was walking by myself, and had a lanthorn in my hand. I was in the middle of the road, the prisoner overtook me, I wished him a good night before he came up, as I knew him before - he lived at Enfield with his father, another man was with him. He came up behind me, turned round, and seized me by the throat, the other man came up immediately, and picked my pocket of eighteen shillings in silver, and a tobacco-box; as soon as he seized me the other man took my lanthorn from me, and put the light out. I had an opportunity of seeing the prisoner's face before the light was put out. I did not call him by his name when I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. After they robbed you what did they do - A. They pushed me back, and went away. I did not know the other man. On the Monday following, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner at a public-house at East Barnet, in custody of Haines; his sister told me he was taken, and I found him there. He was searched in my presence, and three snares and 2 s. 6 d. were found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Do you live with Mr. Idle still - A. Yes. I knew the prisoner before, and he knew me. I went to the public-house at East Barnet the same evening to look for him, but he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not seen him, and never accused him of the robbery - A. No; he was taken at a public-house, at Rickmansworth, by Foster.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see him in custody at Rickmansworth - A. About a month ago.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you hear he was out of custody - A. I do not know.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 28th of December I was at Cheshunt, when Gadd applied to the magistrate for a warrant, I and Champness went to apprehend the prisoner; we found him at the Cat, public-house, at East Barnet, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; I told him we took him on suspicion of robbing Gadd - he said nothing then. We searched him, and found three snares and a half-crown on him - Gadd came in. I told the prisoner we wanted his partner, Holdridge. He said if I would go back with him he would take me to where I could find him. I went to a place called Bone, but could not find him; we put the prisoner in the cage. The magistrate committed him to Newgate. Gadd understood the magistrate was to let him know when to appear and prefer the bill, and he did not attend - no bill was found. The prisoner was indicted last Sessions, when he was not in custody.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Why did you not prefer a bill against the prisoner in January - A. I thought the officer was to let me know when to appear - I am certain the prisoner is the man who seized me by the throat. I heard his companion's name was Holdridge.</p>

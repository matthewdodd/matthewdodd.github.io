            . I am a labourer, and live near New Brentford. On Tuesday, the 16th of February, I was at the door of the Magpie and Stump, at New Brentford-Vincent came and asked me if I wanted to buy a bargain; I asked what it was - he said he did not rightly know, but he thought it was a swine - I asked where it was; he said a man belonged to it up the market; I asked if I could see the man - he said he did not think I could then, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180066"></xptr>at nine o'clock in the evening, if I would meet him there, he would take me to the man - I went at that time, and Vincent came and said the man was over at the market place - I went with him to the Butts public-house, close behind the market, and saw Thomas whom I knew before; I asked Thomas what he had in the sack - he said a pig; I asked what he wanted for it - he said 12s. - I said,"Let me put my hand into the sack, and feel if it is a pig;" he said, "Weight it first, and then you may put your hand and feel;" I did so, and then I said, "Now tell me the truth where you got this pig;" he said, "The whole truth of it is, I got it from a farm close against Feltham church-yard;" I did not know the farm at that time, but I have been there since - I said to him, "Bring the pig along then down to my house," and they both brought it; I locked them both in my room and bolted the door, but as there was only my wife in the house, I did not like to leave them there, so I said "I have not the money in the house, but if you will leave the pig, and go and get a pot of beer, I will come and pay you for it; but mind, I shall only give you 10s. for it;" they went - I told my wife to lock and bolt the door, and keep the pig inside; I went, and got the officer - we went, and took the prisoners at the public-house; the next morning I went to Feltham, and at last found Mr. Brumbridge - he came, and owned the pig.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you were bargaining about the pig, did Vincent say any thing? A. No; he only stood by.</p>

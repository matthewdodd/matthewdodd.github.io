               <p>JANE STANLEY. I am single, and live at No. 17, Britania-street, City-road. I am a <rs id="t18260406-34-viclabel179" type="occupation">dress-maker</rs>

On the 3d of April, about one o'clock in the night, I was going home - I got out of a hackney-coach in St. John-street - I had come from Deptford; my sister, whose name is Thompson, came with me as far as Leadenhall-street, and I got into a coach; I got out of the coach in <placeName id="t18260406-34-crimeloc180">St. John-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18260406-34-crimeloc180" type="placeName" value="St. John-street"></interp>

               <p>Q. Why not go all the way in the coach? A. The fare would be 3s. 6d. I dropped a shilling as I was paying the coachman; after I was out I stopped for a moment to pick it up; I saw the prisoner - two men appeared to be in company with her - they seemed to be talking together; one of the men jerked my hand, and insulted me; I was afraid of them, and told them they might pick the money up if they liked, as I was afraid of them - I directly left them; the prisoner followed me about 300 yards from the coach - she walked by my side, all the way talking to me; I wished to avoid her; I never saw her before; she kept calling me names all the way, and asked me at last if I would treat her; I said I did not think there was any place open; she then caught hold of me, and knocked me down; she held me down by force, in a kind of dirty corner on the pavement; I did not know she was taking my money - she then tore off my tippet, and tore my muff from my hand; I struggled to keep them but could not - she ran off as fast as she could, and I after her - I called murder seven or eight times, when the watchman came running up. I picked up my tippet in the way, about fifty steps from the spot; the watchman stopped her in my sight, and picked up my muff. I have no doubt of her person. I said "This woman has knocked me down and robbed me," and gave her in charge - I had 8s. 6d. in my pocket - I had 11s. before I went into the coach; my pocket being nearly behind me the string was broken and my money gone. She was never out of my sight - the lining was torn out of my muff in struggling.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty on Sunday night, crying the hour of one; two drovers met me by Wilderness-row, and said a lady had come out of a coach and dropped some money - I took no notice - they said "Go and look in the mud, you will find it;" I passed on and heard a female voice crying murder; I turned and ran up Wilderness-row, and stopped the prisoner, who was running from the prosecutrix; I said"Halloo! what is the matter, who cried murder?" the prosecutrix came up, and said she had knocked her down and stolen her tippet and muff - she had picked the ticket up; I found the muff at the prisoner's feet, behind her; the prosecutrix was perfectly sober; she gave charge of her.</p>

            . I am constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house; the prosecutrix gave the same account as she has now. I have the tippet and muff.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Smithfield. I have known the prosecutrix for nine months - she walks the City-road, and used to walk the Strand; I am unfortunate, like herself; she came into the Bull public-house, tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me to give her part of some gin and peppermint which I was drinking with another female; I gave her some, and asked her to pay for some - she said if I would walk up St. John-street she would treat me; I did so; the landlord turned us all out, it being time to shut up; she would not pay for any gin; I slapped her face - she said she had no money - I slapped her face again; she screamed Murder, and dropped her muff; I never attempted to run - we were both in liquor, which the watchman well knows.</p>

               <p>COURT to JANE STANLEY. Q. Is there any cause for her saying you get your living in the way she says? A. I do not; my sister lives at Rotherhithe - her husband is a gardener, and keeps a shop also. I never saw the prisoner before; I had been spending the day with my sister.</p>

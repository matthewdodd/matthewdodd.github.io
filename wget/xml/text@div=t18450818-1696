                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and live in Jermyn-street. The prisoner was in my employ—I am in the habit of paying my tradespeople every morning—on the 28th of June I gave the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay Mr. Paxton for butter—he came back, and gave me an account on a paper that he had paid it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Paxton. On the 28th of June I was at home, and it was my duty to receive money that day—there was no one else there to receive money—I am sure I did not receive 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Wiltshire, who keeps the Bell Tavern, Newgate Market—on Saturday, June 4, the prisoner came about nine in the evening—I knew him before as a journeyman baker—he asked for a glass of ale, for which we charge 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and put a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece on the counter—I gave him change, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—he called my attention to the ale being warm—I did not examine the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece till I was going to put it in the till—I suspected it before, and was going to try it, when he drank the ale in a very great hurry, and went away—he could not see me going to try it; I think he must have seen the movement of my hand—I examined it after he had left—it was bad—I kept it separate in a piece of paper in my pocket—I marked it, and gave it to the officer on 14th June.</p>

I am a stationer in Farringdon-street—o" the evening of 14th June the prisoner came to my shop—he asked for a penny pencil and a penny memorandum-book—I placed them on the counter; and he took out of his pocket two shillings—I detected by the shade of the light that one was bad; and that bad one he gave me—I saw that he fumbled them about in order to give me the bad one—I told him it was bad, and asked him where he got it—he said, "In a public house in Bloomsbury"—I asked him where he lived, and he said in Queen-street—I sent for an officer, and gave him into custody—I gave the officer the bad shilling.</p>

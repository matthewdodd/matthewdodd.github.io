I knew the prisoner Fenn for about fourteen months previous to his absconding - I have known him about a year and a half altogether; I became acquainted with him at Mrs. Cook's, in Holborn - I discounted this bill (looking at it,) for him in February; this is the bill - I discounted it for him at his house in <placeName id="t18280911-6-crimeloc30">Hyde-street, Bloomsbury</placeName>

Hankey's; I advanced the money for him - I afterwards heard that he had absconded; I went to his house, as he had some money of mine in his possession - I could not find him; I afterwards saw him in Chancery-lane in custody, at a lock-up-house - that was about the middle of March, about a month after I had discounted the bill; I had an interview with him there, and he said something about the bill.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. He was in custody then, had you not promised him favour provided he told you the truth? A. Certainly not; I did not depute Berwick Melton to apply to the prisoner to request he would give me information on the subject, and say, "I would not hurt a hair of his head" - on my solemn oath I did not; I do not know John Hanbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that neither yourself, nor by means of any third person, you used any means to induce him to give you an account of the transaction? A. Never in my life; several persons were present at our interview at the lock-up-house.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. You spoke to him of this bill? A. Yes, and he declared to God Almighty that I had not got a bad bill - he also added, that if anything could give a man satisfaction in his present melancholy situation, it was my liberal conduct towards him during our acquaintance; he said no more at that time; I had another interview with him the next day but one at the same place, and spoke of the 50l. bill - I had made some enquiry after I first saw him, and told him I was fearful, from the result of the enquiries I had made, that he had deceived me with regard to those bills; without any reservation he said then, "I am sorry, but they are forgeries" - I left him then, and have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Was any person present at this last interview? A. No - I saw him by himself; I knew he had been taken into custody at Calais.</p>

               <p>Q. And without any reservation he said the bill was forged? A. On my oath he did - I did not shew him this bill at the time, but a memorandum.</p>
               <p>Q. What he said was in a general way, you did not particularize this bill? A. Yes, I did particularize this bill; I had a memorandum of two bills - I have since destroyed it; the bill was in my possession then - I shewed him a slip of paper, on which I wrote the particulars of this bill, and another of 150l. - they were the largest bills I had; I went to him to tell him the result of my enquiries; I gave him the full amount for the bill, deducting the discount - I took no more than the regular discount, but cannot now say how much that was; I was not at Calais - Mr. Vincent went there; I conceived he had absconded, for he had obtained a bill of mine, and had money of mine - I think my conversation with him was before a docket was struck against him, but I never attended to the Commission at all; the bill purports to be accepted by a person living at Colchester - he was a stranger to me, and so was the drawer; I took it entirely on the prisoner's recommendation.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. You called at Mr. Fenn's house, where you had discounted the bill, and found him from home? A. I did - I went there for money which he had of mine; he has never pair it to me - I have never received it.</p>

            . I am an attorney. In consequence of information and instructions which I received, I went to France after Fenn in March last; I went to Paris, and found he had left; in consequence of what I heard I went to Calais, and found him there; I think it was at the London hotel - it was at a house: I had known him from the 2d of January this year, but am not certain to a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him, what passed between you? A. He appeared like a frantic man - he stated that he was ruined, and stated who had ruined him: I held out no inducement or promise of favour to him; he did not require it: I made a memorandum of what passed between us on the evening of the same day - here it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and tell us what he said? A. His first words were "I will go quietly to Newgate, only don't put me in irons - I will plead guilty; I shall then have about six weeks after I am condemned: I will be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110007"></xptr>seen by no one; I will do as Fauntleroy did, and it will he all over in a minute; I was coming to England to deliver myself up to Justice." I desired him to compose himself, and produced some bills to him.</p>
               <p>Q. He mentioned somebody had been his ruin, and appeared frantic - was that the first he said? A. The first he said was "Melton is my ruin; he has gained by me 7,000l. within the last two years," and when he got more reconciled he named some other persons, and he said I must not leave him, or he should cut his throat; I staid with him, and afterwards brought him to England.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any officer with you, or did he come quietly with you? A. He came quietly with me for he was travelling under a false name, and the commissioner gave me his passport; I have seen him write during my acquaintance with him, and know his hand-writing -(looking at the bill) I believe this, purporting to be the acceptance of J. Powell, to be the prisoner's handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you saw him he told you he was coming home? A. Yes - one Cook was with me; did not hold out inducements of any sort to the prisoner - I never told him if he would make up the amount of money deficient I would protect him; I believe

             is the person who was in company with him - I did not hold out anything in the shape of inducement to him; Hanbury was not there a minute, for he was getting on the packet. I am attorney for this prosecution; I was at the Fleet prison when the prisoner was examined before Mr. Alderman Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you next day send an account to the newspapers, which was afterwards published? A. I did not at any time; I was employed by Davies and Northover, to suppress their names, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give an account to the newspaper, which was afterwards published? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you authenticate anything that was written? A. Yes, I said I believed it was true; I was called on, and asked, and I said so; I do not know who called on me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not some of the people belonging to the newspaper office? A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. They called on you with an account of the transaction, for you to authenticate before it was published? A. I cannot say whether it was before or after. I know my own hand-writing; I believe I struck out some words - I do not know whether it was afterwards published - I never saw it in the newspaper, nor was it read to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this (producing a manuscript) - "I know the above to be true in substance and effect, J. Vincent, solicitor, Clifford's Inn?" A. That is what I was called on to do; I struck out some offensive words.</p>
               <p>Q. This is an account of the transaction, not of an examination? A. I was called on to do it.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You say there was some person with the prisoner when you first saw him at Calais - where did you first see him? A. They were together; they had got their boxes, and were going on board the packet for England; I stopped with Mr. Fenn - the other person went on with the packet: Fenn was very anxious to go on with the packet, but I would not let him, as I had been out six nights and days; the conversation between us was after that person had gone. The examination was taken before Mr. Alderman Brown, when Fenn was in prison for debt; I cannot say whether it was before or after that examination that I was applied to, to authenticate the statement.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whose handwriting is that paper? A. I believe it is my brother's writing - he is my clerk; Davies and Northover desired me to supress their names, and it was to keep the newspapers from putting in worse, that that was communicated; I did not instruct my brother to write that paper - I do not know but what I might instruct him to copy the rough draft that was sent to me - it was sent by a reporter; I authenticated it, when I found more than twenty forged bills in person's hands.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was there a rough draft of a paper sent to you? A. There was - it was not written by my direction; I had nothing to do with it - I authenticated it certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the statement contain some of the matter that was in the original? A. Yes; the original heading was in that way, only it contained allusions to other persons, which I struck out, and I did so in another instance, I think in the Sunday Times - I know I called on them, and struck it out while it was in the press; they did not publish that account, but there were several accounts. The paper which has been shewn to me contains the same matter as was in the original draft. I thought I was doing a service to the persons by what I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you also attorney for a Mrs. Cook? A. I was - I knew nothing about the prisoner, and therefore could not know him as Peter Fall - I knew him by no other name than Peter Fenn.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (Written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I am now called upon to defend myself against charges which place me in the most awful condition of responsibility that can oppress the mind, and alarm the heart. When I contemplate myself in this awful instant of my life, standing as a criminal accused of that violation of the laws of my country, which makes the forfeiture of existence, the punishment of guilt. When I look back upon the station in society, which but a short time ago, I filled with respectability of character, and usefulness of exertion - when the rapid current of conflicting thoughts, bring to my reflection, the sad reverse of all my better hopes, and happier prospects: I feel conscious, that under a mental pressure of disquiet and apprehension, so overwhelming, the difficulty of securing sufficient composure, and self-possession for a methodical and deliberate arrangement of all the circumstances of the case, which the task of defence comprehends, must be extreme; more especially, when to an individual in the unhappy condition in which I now stand before you, the better skilled and more advantageous aid of counsel is by law disallowed. If I may hope for firmness to encounter this difficulty, I look for it not in the presumption of self justification, but in the motives which originated the very transactions that have inculpated me, and brought me to this fearful issue of their results. Yes, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, from these motives, best known to myself and to my God, I seek now for that stability of mind which will enable me to render my defence in your estimation, so far available of its object as to induce you to pity, not to condemn. To shew how these motives have been connected with these transactions, I must entreat your patient hearing, while I enter into a detail of the occasions and causes from which they have arisen, and which, when compared with the evidence of my prosecutors, and the motives which have induced them to bring me to trial, will, I hope and trust, evince in my behalf a disposition more prompt to make the exigency in which I found myself involved, subservient to the restrictions of justice and truth, rather than subversive of either. I would begin these details by truly asserting that these prosecutions have come most unexpectedly upon me, in as much as those who have preferred them first detained me by civil action, although they had been long in possession of all the evidence of the nature of the transactions upon which they found their indictment; and therefore may it not be rightly concluded, that if their object had been to promote the ends of justice only, and if they had been fully convinced that those transactions would have borne out such a proceedure, they would long before have made them the subject of judicial enquiry, instead of seeking to profit themselves by a compromise, which they repeatedly proposed, but which, in the ruined state of my affairs, it was impossible for me to find the means of carrying into effect; and even had I possested those means, acquiescence on my part would have been an act of the grossest injustice to my other creditors, and moreover, with a strong conviction of my own motives, I then felt impressed with a consciousness that had they recourse to such a proceedure, there did not exist grounds to sustain an indictment. Had that consciousness been of a contrary nature, and had it reproached me with criminal intentions, it cannot for a moment be doubted, but that I should most gladly have seized upon the facility which they offered me of rescuing myself at all events from so perilous a situation, and out of the wreck of my property I might perhaps have gathered sufficient resources to have enabled me to meet their offer, and join with them in defrauding the rest of my creditors; but I did not apprehend such peril, because I felt that I had not incurred it; and I also felt that, as a bankrupt, whatever could be realized from the wreck of my property was not my own but the property of all my creditors. Subsequently to the offer of this compromise, I went through the ordeal of a commission of bankruptcy, and mark, that the act of bankruptcy was proved by Mr. Vincent, the attorney for the prosecution, although I had previously told him, when in Calais, that I wished to return with all speed to London to prevent this. In the progress of that commission I met with no opposition; my last examination was passed, and in a few days I should have been at liberty to make the most streanous exertions in my power to do as much justice as I could to all my creditors. But, although not opposed, it appears that I was very closely watched by my prosecutors; and on the eve of my liberation from prison as a debtor, they withdrew their civil detainers, and I was, without any intimation or expectation of such a measure, transferred to another prison under more awful circumstances. Here allow me to make use of an intermediate remark; had I accepted the offer of a compromise, and been able or willing to have given an unjust preference to my prosecutors, their present mode of proceeding would never have been adopted. It will be proved by evidence, that had I been in circumstances to have given 1000l. to my prosecutors, I could have possessed myself of all those documents which have made the grounds of this prosecution. Here then, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, suffer me to direct your candid judgment towards the intrinsic quality of that justice, which they assume as the disinterested principle which has induced them to place me in my present calamitous situation. It will be further proved, that promises of all kinds, entreaties of all kinds, threats of all kinds, have been by them, made use of to bring me to the compromise which I have mentioned, from an unfounded supposition, that I was in possession of a sum of money equal to their expectations. My share, however, of the proceeds of these ruinous transactions was too small, and the share of my prosecutors too large, as the collective amount of the business of several yearsmay seem to enable me to retain any such adequate sam in my hands as might have enabled me to satisfy these my prosecutors; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110009"></xptr>this they ought to have known; for, although they discounted bills, through my agency, to the amount of at least 12,000l. a year, they always took care to make me pay 20 and sometimes 30 per cent. No one can more deeply lament than I do, the fatal infatuation which induced me to join others, and amongst these my prosecutors themselves, and their attorney, in this unjustifiable species of pecuniary traffic by bills of no relative value: but the facility which the gain of usurious interest offers to the negotiators of such paper, however worthless, or however introduced, provided they bear one supposed responsible name, will account for the temptation, although it will not justify the practice. In an evil hour I yielded to the temptation. For a period of several years my prosecutors participated largely in the benefits of these transactions, not confining themselves to their own means, but very frequently obtaining my acceptances for theirs to facilitate and increase their means of discounting largely; and yet these are the persons who now appear to prosecute me, endeavouring to wrest these transactions into such a shape, as may enable them to subject me to the infliction of the last and fatal sentence of the law. As to the very serious charge of forgery, with which I stand accused, my prosecutors well know, and they declared it before Alderman Brown, the Magistrate who committed me, that my name alone was at all times sufficient for them to negotiate any bills which I might offer, when they wanted to raise money for other discounts; and, indeed, they oftener came to my house to solicit bills from me than I to theirs. There could not therfore exist any necessity for my using the names of others so illegally and so unwarrantably, for the fraudulent accomplishment of my views. If it be asked why I have not brought forward the persons whose names are connected with these bills, I have to observe, that as they have been parties with me in the usurious application of them, they have (as it is natural to conclude) withdrawn themselves from my reach to avoid my controul. It has been represented in the exparte statements of the Journals of the day, that I absconded from England, and that Vincent, the attorney for the prosecution, with Mr. Cook. one of my prosecutors, had gone in search of me. But where did these gentlemen find me? Why, at Calais, on my return to England, just about to step into the steam-boat, after having finished the business on which I went to France, and which was totally unconnected with my pecuniary affairs. I had learnt in the interim, that the state of my affairs required my return; and when those gentlemen met me, they examined my portmanteau, under the impression that I had a large sum of money with me; but they found nothing but a few articles of jewellery, from which Vincent took a diamond ring, which he put on his finger, and said he would keep for the trouble he had been at; and Mr. Cooke took the rest, together with Bank-notes to the amount of 45l. which they never would have returned, had I not informed Mr. Wigley, the attorney for my commission, of the circumstance. Far be it from me to throw out any reflections upon the character of Vincent or my prosecutors, which the appalling necessity of my present situation cannot deduce from the facts of my case; I am quite aware of the doubtful reserve of assent with which such reflections are usually heard, when proceeding from the lips of one similarly conditioned to myself; but, if it may be admitted that the solemn consideration of that condition may so far influence my heart, as to make it circumspect in every assertion and representation of fact, then I would fam hope, that what I have stated and may continue to assert, is not the language of sophisticated contrivance, but a plain description of real occurrences. On the faith of this declaration, I would entrent you to decide between the conduct of my prosecutor and my own; I was returning to make the best I could of my embarrassed circumstances - they met me, not providing any cautionary means for the concealment of my return, but openly going on board a vessel amidst the rest of the passengers; when, instead of constraining me by arrest for debt, or upon a warrant for any criminal charge, they proposed to me to give them what money I had, adding that they had a plan for my escape: but, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, from what had I to escape? my conscience did not echo at this word, nor did it suggest its meaning in any sense which might he appropriate to the position of my circumstances, for surely had escape been my object, I had far better opportunities of completing it before my prosecutors met me, than any which they could have devised; and least of all, should I, with so much fatnity of plan, have frustrated such an object, by returning to the very country from which that escape would have been indispensible. From such a proposal on their part, what can be deduced, but the evident conclusion that they would have opened every channel for my evading the claims of my other creditors, had I been able to accede to their demands, by purchasing that chance on their own terms; and neither law nor equity would have been matters of consideration to them, if justice to these creditors could have been sacrificed to their joint proposition; and yet with this plain fact against them, they take credit to themselves for having (as they call it) overtaken and secured the man whose escape they would have sanctioned. Forcibly impressed with a just sense of their conduct, which I had rather leave to your feelings, Gentlemen of the Jury, to characterize, than take upon myself to pourtray: my resolution was instantly formed - I had only to persist in what I had previously determined upon. I returned with them, instead of returning by myself; and to shew that such return was an act of my own voluntary occurrence, when we arrived in London, I went to a coffee-house to sleep, while they returned to their own homes. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I do earnestly implore you to put all these events together, and allow me, as it is customary in all circumstances which bear relation to the conduct of every prisoner who comes before you, that portion of considerate admission which gives to such conduct the aspect of unconscious criminality: if such unconsciousness of crime, had not, in all its calmness, had possession of my breast, and if I had contemplated escape as the only alternative to save my life, I might have avoided returning to London; and when actually returned, I might have taken advantage of the opportunity given me, of sleeping at the coffee-house, in that degree of freedom which left me to my own disposal. Had I availed myself of any one of the facilities of escape, which the proposal of my prosecutors placed in my power, I had not now been before your Lordship, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury, waiting in anxious tri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110010"></xptr>bulation of heart and mind your decision upon the facts which I have stated, so far as you may deem them correlative with that justice of which you are the authorised dispensers. But, Gentlemen of the Jury, I do most fervently beseech you to detach your judgment from all possibility of influence, arising from every assertion that has been brought into action against me, previous to this solemn period of my appearing at the bar. One such assertion I would anxiously rebut, and the more so, because I can most unevasively deny it before that Omniscient Being whose name I still reverence, and who knoweth the very imagination of the thoughts. Mr. Pratt, one of the prosecutors, has declared that I have admitted to him the bills were forgeries. Let me ask you, Gentlemen of the Jury, to what purpose could I have made this admission? even supposing it were true, could the faculties of my mind have been so astounded by mere alarm as to have betrayed me into it, surely that alarm, if guilt produced it, would have led me to take quite a different course, for that alarm must have been for my life; and who is there that under any alarm of this kind would not seek to preserve life, and to extricate it from peril? Could I, on the other hand, have made the admission when under no compulsion so to do, when my conscience would have upheld me in an unqualified assertion of my innocence of the charges brought against me. It is true that it sometimes happens to a timid mind tacitly to admit an accusation which it knows to be false, under the conviction that no proof of it can possibly be adduced; but, Gentlemen of the Jury, neither fatuity of mind arising from consciousness of crime, nor timidity acted upon by a principle of expediency, held any ruling influence over me of which Mr. Pratt could take the advantage, so as to substantiate the constructions he has put upon my words, for in fact I made no such admissions; I deny it utterly, and on the truth of that denial I stake the salvation of my soul. I did indeed so far yield to his promises on the one hand, and his threats on the other, as to admit that the bills were bad - bad in a commercial sense, in which sense the word is always understood; and in this sense alone I used the expression, meaning that as I myself was unable to honour them, I did not expect they would be paid by the other parties. It is clear that when Mr. Pratt took those bills from me, and gave me other bills in exchange, not money, as he had sworn, besides taking 15 per cent. for his accommodation, he was satisfied with my responsibility; and at the time he asked me for bills, I most unequivocally declare that I felt that responsibility to be commensurate with Mr. Pratt's - I say his responsibility; for Mr. Pratt forgot that when he swore he gave me money for the bills, he gave me other acceptances, not cash altogether. Mr. Cooke also, though he swore before Alderman Brown that he had discounted the bills with his mother's money, no doubt forgot at the time they were done by him with part of his own acceptance, other bills and part cash. Thus far, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have confined myself to the principal transactions by which I am inculpated, and to the motives which have remotely or more immediately led to them. Perhaps in such a case of so deep an importance to myself, as a matter of life and death, and also so important to society and to yourselves as to the urgency of one essential point that such a decision may become too consistent with the justice due to society, of which my prosecutors would now appear the advocates, and to the sacred suggestions of your unbiassed consciences; perhaps, I say, under such a complication of the most active anxieties that regulate the exertions of man, both in defence and accusation, it may not be deemed irrelavent or inexpedient that I should sepresent to you, for your advangeous consideration, the conduct of the attorney for the prosecution Mr. Vincent, who first proved the act of bankruptcy against me, next offered to me the terms of compromise, both personally and by messengers, then suggested to me the conditional plan for my escape, and lastly, as you now see, has devised, in co-operation with my prosecutors, another plan to take away that life which I would not purchase at the dishonourable price of sacrificing my other creditors to the cupidity of himself and his clients. Since my arrival in England I have been assailed by the most insidious and contumelious instrumentality to which a malignant and inhuman spirit could give action. I do most contritely confess that like other men I have offended both inad vertently and wilfully against my better judgment; but I do protest against the means and motives which ich e been applied by my enemies to distort and multiply my offences from among those enemies; and in elucidation of those means and motives I feel compelled, in justice to myself, to select by name and profession Mr. Vincent, the attorney for the prosecution. I have good reason to expect, if the witnesses which I shall bring forward will compute, by the standard of Christian rectitude, the immeasurable distance which divides personal consideration from the power and opportunity of testifying, in behalf of an individual whose existence is weighed in the balance of life and death, that I shall be enabled to trace to that Mr. Vincent a most unfounded and acrimonious article in some of the morning papers of the 2d of April, the major part of which he himself personally knew to be false, and that at an instant of time, when he was, by professional and personal assurance pledged, in word and honour, to do all he could to assist and serve me. Whether or not my prosecutors were privy to this enormity of cruel, and in my present circumstances sanguinary anticipation of the success of their projects against me. I have not the means to prove, although I have too much reason to suspect their co-operation. To you, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, such conduct as I think I shall prove against the attorney for the prosecution, must appear abhorrent and abominable; and so far I feel I am justified in bringing this circumstance before the cognizance of this Court, and in justification of the epithets which I have used of "cruel and sanguinary." I can incontestibly prove that, failing in his object of compromise, he expressed himself in the following deadly terms - "I will have his life; and like a wasp, will sting him to death." Why this acrimony on the part of Vincent, the answer is obvious; he dreads my being restored to society, lest I should bring in light deeds which, as an attorney, must strike him from the Rolls; such as deeds of usury in the discount<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110011"></xptr>of bills, and taking post-dated cheques for a week, and giving his own, at the enormous charge of five per cent per week, with the addition of a dozen of wine as a present. I have deprecated that possible construction of the tenor of my defence, so far as it may be exposed to the charge of denunciatory accusation of my prosecutors and their attorney; but I think I may refer the justice of my observations to that test of their motives and measures which the more equitable and humble feelings of yourselves, Gentlemen of the Jury, will naturally, and I hope simultaneously adopt: and now, Gentlemen of the Jury - for to you I address myself more particularly - in the appeal I have to make to your convictions, your feelings, and your decision. Hitherto I have presumed to make my address to his Lordship conjointly with yourselves, and I have done so on this ground, because as the Judge, by whose direction the useful or fruitless endeavour of my defence will be pointed out to you, I have addressed myself to him in the earnest anxiety of mind, that whatever his adjudication of my case may be, he may perceive that I have so modelled that address that he may be in possession of my own knowledge of the facts, and of that construction of them, which is, whether arising out of my motives or actions, or may be in correspondence with his impartial view of both, and in adoption to that privilege of every man before a court of British judicature, who cannot be regarded as guilty until your verdict has pronounced him to be so. In that tremulous state of suspense which every man labouring under so solemn an accusation as that against which I at this important moment have had to contend; I leave my fate in your hands, with a well-grounded confidence, that whatever may be your decision, no advantage will be withheld from me which my view in this defence may have made out in my favour, nor any disadvantage adopted by you which may deteriorate my cause, or set aside those hopes of a favourable verdict, which my conscientious convictions of better motives than what my prosecutors have ascribed to me may have justified me in forming. Gentlemen of the Jury, allow me to place myself before you, exactly as I feel in my heart and soul that I ought to appear to you. I am accused of a very heinous crime, that of forgery; I protest against this accusation by the most solemn asseverations of my innocence. I have opened to you the whole tenor of my transactions out of which this accusation has originated; I have asserted, and my assertion will be proved, that my prosecutors, if they were in possession of that evidence which would substautiate the accusation, have offered and endeavoured by various acts of their own to induce me to accept a compromise of the illegality of the act on which they have grounded this accusation; I have developed the means and instrumentality which they have used to urge my acquiescence in their offer. I have placed before you the opportunities and facilities which they offered me of escaping from the consequences which they, in their anxiety to obtain my acquiescence, urged upon my consideration, and pressed upon my self reference; I have laid before you the reasons for my refusing that acquiescence, and I have, I hope, made it appear that it was not consciousness of guilt, but of duty, which has operated upon me throughout all my resistance to their promises, entreaties, and threats; and I have manifested a desire to act with impartiality to those of my creditors to whom such an acquiescence in the views of my prosecutors would have been unjust, disgraceful, and dishonest, in the worst sense of these terms. Bu Gentlemen, if I were to enlarge the sphere of my appeal to your favourable construction of my defence beyond this part of its extent, I should plead to my personal susceptibilities, and implore their intervention in my behalf, while I relate to you that the widow of the late Mr. Lewis, who was an assistant of mine for above twelve years, and who was to have succeeded me in my school, and her three orphan children, for whom I stood godfather, and whom I promised the father on his dying bed to support, that their daily subsistence, and, I may add, their very existence in society depends on my exertions and opportunities of supply for their wants, were they present here, and could be aware of the consequences of your verdict, their little hearts would burst out with the exclamation "Be merciful to our only friend and protector, and restore him to us," but, Gentlemen, it is not my object to overpower my feelings, or to interest yours beyond the influence of your judgment; but, if upon your having maturally weighed the nature of the evidence against me, and the character of the witnesses who have given that evidence; if, upon comparing the meditation of the crime of which I am charged, and the total inadequate proofs to bring it home to me; if, upon considering the incongruity between the motives of my accusers, and those which could be supposed to actuate me to the perpetration of the deed which forms the ground of accusation; if you should haply think that, upon any computation of injury suffered by the parties who bring forward their accusation, their loss has not been equal to that gain which they have so long derived from their participation in their transactions which are alleged in accusation against me; and, finally, if you perceive from the nature of that proof by which they have sought to substantiate their charge of forgery against me, the premises are incongruent with those proofs, or those proofs not sufficient to substantiate those premises; then, Gentlemen of the Jury, I would infer, with that measure of hope, which I may justly be supposed to calculate upon, in accordance with the honourable impartiality and humane consideration of a British jury, that you will at once, by your verdict, relieve me from the awful responsibility under which my spirit now struggles and groans in afflictive foreboding, but not in guilty anticipation of your decision. Hitherto, Gentlemen of the Jury, I have said but little in extenuation of that criminal perpetration with which I am presumptuously charged, destructive as all degrees of this crime of forgery must be to the interests of society in a commercial country like ours, still, even if it had been proved to have been committed by me in this instance, I am prepared to prove, that so far as my prosecutors are concerned, they, and they only have been injured, and the injury which they have suffered has been nothing in proportion to their participation in these usurious gains which they have been for several years securing to themselves; if I had committed the turpitude which they have sought to fasten upon me, and to which they would make my life the sacrifice, to them only is that injury confined, and from the sense which they themselves have shown they had of that injury, I would infer that they cannot have been materially, if at all, affected in their property and pecuniary interests, when, as in fact, they would have compromised that loss by offering to take one-fourth of its amount, not scrupuling to comprehend in that compromise a certain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110012"></xptr>and assured plan for my escape from all penalties attached to the deed, which they then did not designate as forgery, but which their disappointment of my acquiescence has led them after, beginning by a civil action, subsequently to form into the shape of a felonious act. I would hope that I need not further urge these circumstances upon your consideration, judicial and humane. There does, however, remain to me one painful urgency upon my personal anxiety to interest your sympathy, which I would not, which I cannot, suppress. You see before you, Gentlemen of the Jury, the eleemosynary guardian and protector of three helpless orphans, without any seasonable succour they must long ago have been left to the perils, and corruptions of a world of vicissitude and temptation. I have hitherto shielded them, so far as mortal intervention could effect it, from the privations of one, and the viscious infections of the other; and, at this very moment, I feel it my duty more than ever to use all my endeavours to provide for them, when their mother has been stripped of all the little furniture which her husband left her at his death, it having been sold by public auction for the benefit of my creditors. If my life continue not, they will in vain seek for succour from any other source, and my fate determines irremediably theirs. I know, Gentlemen of the Jury, that this is no plea against the decision of your impartial view of my case; but I do also know, that if it be within the range of that impartiality to save my life from the attack now made upon it, you especially that have children, will feel an additional gratification to that of doing your duty, in the consciousness that you have saved the lives of three human beings from the worst of evils, in giving to their earthly protector, the renewal of his opportunities of continuing that protection. I hope I may so far rely on your justice, beseeching you to endeavour to divest your minds of any prejudice which you may have entertained from reading the statements in newspapers. I am aware that such an endeavour is almost beyond the power of man fully to accomplish; still, I do entreat you will make the attempt, and I am persuaded you will do so, remembering that those statements were made by Vincent, the attorney for the prosecution, in conjunction, no doubt, with the prosecutors, for the better accomplishing his cruel designs, and thereby prevent that justice being done to me which a plain statement of facts, unprejudiced by false and exparte statements, must have produced, in ensuring me your favourable verdict. But, Gentlemen of the Jury, I forbear further to urge your humane feelings in contradistinction to or even in concurrence with, your justice. I hope I may say that I rely implicitly upon the latter, beseeching you to endeavour to divest your minds with emotions beyond the power of description, in all their force. I do unfeignedly implore the Father of Mercies, and the God of all consolation, before whom we must all one day appear, to give an account of our use or abuse of his mercies dispensed to each of us, to direct your judgment, and to conform your wills to the following of his own divine example, in judging, not according to appearance, but in righteous judgment, and that judgment tempered with mercy."Be ye merciful, even as your Father which is in Heaven is also merciful."</p>

               <p>Case of Clerical Delinquency - Further Particulars.</p>
               <p>In consequence of certain rumours, we have made inquiry into the conduct of this person, and in the whole annals of guilt, we scarcely find one equal in atrocity. It appears that about thirty years since this man was ordained in holy orders, under the name of Fall, but why, or wherefore, he subsequently changed his name to that he now bears, remains at present a mystery- under the assumed name of Fenn, he was employed as a teacher in Kirkman's academy, at Islington, and about ten years since purchased, on his own account, an academy in Bloomsbury, in which he succeeded beyond his most sanguine expectations. Unfortunately for him, and, we may say with truth, for the greatest body of his creditors, Mr. Fenn was not satisfied with the profits derived from his school; he started also as a bill-broker, or rather discounter of bills, taking to himself (as others of that notorious class do) an exorbitant rate of interest- he thus made many bad debts, and was himself ultimately induced to resort to other usurers, who, like himself, though more wary, were not wanting in the rate to be charged to a brother miscreant. Spurred on by this connexion, he was led to commit the crime of forgery, and not only committed various forgeries himself, but he also made one of his tutors draw and accept bills in fictitious names - he also had the unmanly hardihood to involve his pupils in his guilt, for he has also, in a like manner, made them draw, accept, and indorse fictitious bills, and has circulated that kind of rubbish (among tradesmen only) to an enormous amount; and in order to give a greater facility to his criminal traffic, an account was opened at Messrs. Ransom's bank; this circumstance gave a degree of credit to his movements, and by an insinnating address, pretended friendship, and plausibility of manner, ingratiated himself with various tradesmen; he would in some instances pretend that he possessed a a bill for a large amount, such as 2000l. on this nobleman or the other, and that he was himself to receive 200l. or 300l. from the pretended nobleman, for the accommodation, and consequently could afford to give the unsuspecting tradesman 50l. for the loan of 500l.; the tradesman confiding in the sanctified clergyman has in many instances been thus duped to the tune of 2000l. or 3000l. Again the clergyman would produce one of his concocted bills, and say "If you discount me this 200l. at 5 per cent. I will take 50l. worth of goods, and you shall draw a bill on me for the amount of the goods;" so that this fellow has in many instances obtained 250l. for one of his forged bills of 200l. It appears that the circumstances which led to his immediate detection, was his absenting himself from his home, together with several of his cheques (which he had post-dated) becoming due, which were returned, as a matter of course, by his banker, for want of funds; under these circumstances a meeting was convened, and an intercepted letter coming to hand, disclosed the whole system, and that the Rev. gentleman had emigrated to Paris, under the assumed named of George Lewis. It may be imagined that he had associates in his guilt, and cosequently those associates leave no stone unturned to prevent inquiry. We say, if certain parties (whom we can name) are not equally culpable, how is it that an immediate inquiry has not been instituted? public justice demands inquiry. It is a curious fact, that with all the Rev. gentleman's frauds, it does not appear that he has lodged any of his concocted paper with his immediate associates, namely, the bill-brokers. The following are a few of the persons who hold the Rev. gentleman's forgeries:-Messrs. Davies, of Giltspur-street, Auctioneers; Mr. E. Jones, Whitefriars'-wharf, coal-merchant; Messrs. Toswell's, Garlickhill; Messrs. Cookson, Strand; Mr. King, Bolton-street, Piccadilly; Messrs. Hansler and Mc. Kensie, Round-court, Strand, wine-merchants; Messrs. Davidson, Oxford-street; Mr. Pratt, Parliament-street; Mr. Marshall, Great Ormond-street: Mr. Wigley, Essex-street, solicitor." - I know the above to be true in substance and effect. G. VINCENT, Solicitor, Clifford's Inn.(The authentication did not appear in the newspapers.)</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110013"></xptr>JOHN HANBURY. I am a printer. I was at Calais this year; I saw Mr. Vincent the attorney and Mr. Cook there about the 24th or 25th of March: the prisoner had then been there one day and one night, and was returning to England with me. I came from Paris with him; I came home by myself, leaving them at Calais, and saw them in London the next day, the 26th.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did Vincent, or Cook in his presence hold out any inducement to the prisoner to confess himself guilty of the crime, or to make disclosures? A. They did, both of them, Vincent in particular. He made no confession in my presence: this was at a house called the Crown. close to the landing-place - I heard these offers made both in England and Calais.</p>
               <p>Q. State what passed at Calais. A. We met Mr. Cook and Vincent at the door, as our trunks were going out to the packet, and we were going to breakfast - they wished to speak with the prisoner privately, and wished me to retire - I refused, as I was his friend, but after some persuasion on vtheir parts I did retire for a time; in the interim the prisoner's trunk had been brought back to his bedchamber; on my return I saw Cook and Vincent searching his trunk, and several Bank notes and sovereigns were on the table: I asked them if they had any writ for him whereby they could detain him in Calais, as they would not let him return with me; they said No, they were his friends, and he was quite safe in their hands. I asked if they had seen Messrs. Wigley and Boteleer at Paris - they said No, they had not - they acted for themselves; they had no wish to hurt him - they only wanted their own and to let him escape - they said they had a plan for his escape if they could get their money. I then applied to the prisoner to know if I should stop with him - they assured me they were his friends, and it was fortunate for him that he had fallen into their hands: I then told him I must go, and he gave me a 5l. note to bring me home, for my money was spent - that is all I recollect passing in Calais.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, were you sent by Vincent to propose any terms to the prisoner? A. I was, with a Mr. R. Thompson - Mr. Pratt did not send me to him.</p>

            . Q. Did you not send that witness to Fenn to threaten him for his life if he did not confess what he had done with the money? A. I never spoke to the man except at Calais - I never sent any message by Richard Thompson - I do not know him - I found there were six or eight persons equally guilty with the prisoner - there is a Mrs. Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say to Mrs. Thompson that if the prisoner would acknowledge the truth as to the bills, he should not be hurt in any way whatever? A. I never did.</p>

             re-examined. Vincent did send me and Mr. Thompson to Fenn - his words I think were, he would lose his life if he did not confess where he had hid his money.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did you go over to Paris with the prisoner? A. No, I met him at Paris - I went there for Mrs. Lewis - I went to Calais first, and found he had gone to Paris - I first went about the 19th or 20th March, and found him in the post-office - I went to the post-office to inquire for him, instead of the police-office, by mistake- he came in to inquire for a letter while I was there - he went by the name of Lewis at Paris - he has been Mrs Lewis's protector since her husband's death.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean, I suppose, they were living together? A. I deny that insinuation - it was as a father; he promised the husband on his death-bed that he would protect the wife and children - I was present - that was in November. Mrs. Lewis was not in Paris: I went there for her to see what was the matter with Mr. Fenn, as she expected him in two days, and he had not returned. I did not know he was going by the name of Lewis till I went off - I then heard it from Mrs. Lewis: I have known him twelve years; I never knew him by the name of Fall or Ford; he has been in England ever since I knew him; I have heard from him that he has been in Jersey, not in Guernsey; I have heard that he went by the name of Fall by the papers; I saw the outside of a letter before I went to Paris, but not the inside - I cannot say it was from him. I travelled with him from Paris to Calais - he still kept the name of Lewis: I did not see Messrs. Boteleer and Wigley at Paris - I know they were in Calais, as I saw them there - Mr. Boteleer is a gentleman of great respectability connected with some fire-office in Bridge-street. I have been printer to one morning journal these ten years; I had permission to go to Paris - I know nothing whatever of the bill transactions. When I saw Vincent and Cook at Calais, my baggage was going to the packet with the prisoner's - I was at Calais about two and half hours after that, but not with them - I refused to leave the room for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and when I went out I came in again - I was not absent half an hour, and did not stop there half an hour - I left them to go on board after the trunks were searched; I was present then - there were some Bank notes and sovereigns taken out, and I believe there were some papers, but I did not take particular notice, as they professed themselves such friends - I had not breakfasted when they came.</p>

               <p>Q. On your oath, had you not breakfasted, paid your bill, and was going on board the packet? A. I never paid a bill at all, Mr. Fenn paid it; when I was going out of the passage they presented me with the bill - I said the gentleman up stairs would pay it - that was an hour after I first saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Mr. Cook made some professions to him? A. He clasped his hands together, and said he was a ruined man (Cook did) - he smacked his head, and said he was a ruined man, and begged him to confess what he had done with his money, as there must be money somewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. With whose money? A. The prisoner's. Cook said he must have money, and wished to know what he had done with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the whole of the inducement held out? A. In Calais it was. Fenn paid my expences, and so he did Cook and Vincent's - Mr. Cook told me so; I had no communication with Mr. Pratt.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. They appeared to treat him as such great friends:- you did not particularly notice what came out of the trunk? A. They did so. I only know of charges against the prisoner's character from the newspapers.</p>

            . I am not in any trade: I know Mr. Pratt and the prisoner. I heard Mr. Pratt say something about Fenn and what he would do - Fenn was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110014"></xptr>not present - he did not empower me to communicate to Fenn what he said.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On Wednesday, the 21st of March, I had some metal spoons on a dresser in the back room - I afterwards saw a rummer-glass on the bar; the prisoner came that evening, and had some bread and cheese - he went into the bar, and I think into the tap-room; I then missed a glass, and went to the tap-room - I saw the prisoner there; I had a stick in my hand - I struck his pocket, and heard a glass break - he took it from his pocket himself: it was ours - I then told him to feel again, and he took out a wine-glass; I then told him to let me look into his pocket, and he took out two spoons, one of which is ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. What is there particular about these glasses? A. I know this one by the bottom of it - it was figured glass, but has been more broken since; there were several persons there - I do not know whether any were intoxicated; I do not think the prisoner was - I did not miss a pint pot; he denied having the glasses, and when he pulled them out, he said he did not know who had put them there - he offered me 1s. for them; he staid there, I suppose, two hours afterwards, and then went home - I knew where he had lived for some years; several persons in the tap-room said they thought he put them in himself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you first say to him? A. I said I thought he had some of my glasses - he said he had not: I said I should like to see - he then pulled out this glass; I asked if he had not another, and he pulled out this wine-glass - I said it was like mine - I then asked what he had in his other pocket, and he took out the spoons- they had been jovial together, but I did not see any tricks; I heard afterwards that Lawrence was accused - it did not appear that there had been any tricks played; he was not apprehended for a week afterwards - my husband was busy, and I could not go about it myself; he did not come to our house in the interim - he is a labourer; the things were taken from two different rooms.</p>

            . I was at the house, and sat within two yards of the prisoner - Mrs. Meadows told him he had some glass in his pocket; he said he had not - she said she was sure he had, and she struck it with the stick; he then pulled out the broken glass, then the other, and then the spoons - he said he did not know how they came there; he said something to a man, as if he accused him of putting them in - I had not seen any joking.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not his pocket so constructed, that it might easily be got at? A. I cannot say - his coat was unbuttoned; he was not drunk - I had been there an hour or two; some of the men were rather merry.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The constable came and took me - I waited two hours for the prosecutor; he said I must go with him; I said, "I don't like all this, I would rather settle it;" he said he should not have done it, but that I had said that his wife had put broken glasses into my pockets, that she might accuse me of taking whole ones.</p>
               <p>MR. MEADOWS. I did not say any such thing - he wanted to settle it, and I said it was impossible.</p>

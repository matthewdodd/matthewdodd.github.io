               <p>- GREGORY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Wood, I saw the prisoner on the 21st of November standing at my master's door, looking into my master's shop, about half past eight o'clock in the morning Wednesday, with a two foot rule in his hand. I took no notice of him, thought he was a person taking a plan, which many men do in our business; about five minutes after, I saw him come out of my master's shop with the glass in his hand. It is a dressing glass in a mahogany box frame, I said to my fellow servant, do you run to my master, and when he came back I told him to go about Little Moorfields way, and I would go down Moor-lane. My fellow servant took him, and he ran away from him; on Saturday the 24th I took him again in Long Alley, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him enough to be able to say that he is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover the glass? - Yes; we got the glass on the 21st.</p>

               <p>I am fellow servant to the other witness; I went in pursuit of the prisoner, on the 21st I took him about a quarter before nine, when I took the glass from him. I found him about two or three hundred yards off, it was in Little Moorfields; I have kept the glass ever since. I asked him where he was going with the glass, he said it was a jobb of his own, I told him it was not, it was a glass of our's; he directly pushed it into my hand, and ran away. I am sure the prisoner is the man; he was taken again on Saturday the 24th.</p>

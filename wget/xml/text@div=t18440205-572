                  <hi rend="largeCaps">WILLIAM EGERTON</hi>. I am a cabinet-maker and appraiser, and life at No. 34, Jamaica-street, Stepney. I have a front parlour converted into a shop—part of that window had been broken, but was secured by a little painting on a panel being nailed against the window inside—on the 13th of Jan., a little after seven o'clock in the evening, I had fastened down that window, and drawn down the blind, when I heard a rustling in the window—I stepped towards it, and taw a lad's arm in the window—I went out of the shop, up the passage, and, as I was opening the door, saw the prisoner—he commenced running away—I ran after him, up James-street, into Charles-street—he threw several things away as he ran—he ran against a gentleman, and stopped—I did not lose sight of him—I was not more than ten yards from him—I came up, and said I must take him back again, as he had been taking something out of my shop window—when we came back to where I had seen him throw something away, I picked up part of a fancy tobacco-pipe—I sent for a constable, and gave the prisoner in charge—I went to my window, and missed a musical pitch-pipe, a fancy to<lb></lb>bacco-pipe, a brass pattern horse-shoe, and three brass weights—they had been about two feet within the window—he could reach them all very easily, by thrusting his arm through the glass, and moving the painting on one side—the nails were pushed out—the prisoner saw me pick up part of the property—he said he had not taken them, that he was running after another boy—I said I believed he had taken something, for I had seen him throw something away—he said he would assist me to look for anything I had lost if I would let him go—I would not do so—it was just dusk—I had never seen the pri<lb></lb>soner before—he was dressed as he is now—I am quite positive I did not lose sight of him—ten yards was the greatest distance he was from me.</p>

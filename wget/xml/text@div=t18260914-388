            . I am a watchman. I met the prisoner in Lisle-street, Leicester-square, on the 1st of June, at half-past two o'clock in the morning, with a bag under his arm - he looked at me, and went on into Little Newport-street - I went up to him and said, "I think you have got something that is not all right;" he threw it at me - I caught it in my arms - it contained this glass; he ran off; but was not a quarter of an hour out of my sight - I gave the alarm, and he was taken.</p>

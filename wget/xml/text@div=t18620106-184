I am clerk to Mr. Pockett at Swansea—this bill of lading bears my signature, for Mr. Pockett—I first saw that document on 15th December, before I put my name to it; the elder Gray handed it to me—I cannot say whether Mr. Pockett was present, he was at home—I saw Mr. Gray upon the 15th December—he brought the bill of lading to the office—I occasionally sign documents for Mr. Pockett in the course of business—I signed this document which is in my hand now, from Mr. Pockett's instruc<lb></lb>tions—that was on 15th December, in the morning—the elder Gray came to the office to me rather early in the morning—it was on the Saturday, before dinner, that Mr. Pockett gave me directions to sign this bill of lading—we dine about 1 o'clock—I looked at it previously to signing it—it was then for twenty casks—the word "six" was not there—I cannot say whether these numbers were there or not; I would not swear positively—I do not believe there was any weight filled in the bill at that time—I read from the the margin twenty-six casks—those words were not on the margin when I signed it—I know the elder Gray's handwriting—this bill of lading, dated 5th February, is signed by me—I cannot say whether it was in the same state when I signed it as it is now—it purports to be for fourteen casks—I cannot recollect whether I read it previously to signing it—I signed it by Mr. Pockett's direction—how I recollect the twenty casks so well is, Mr. Pockett was about leaving home on Saturday, 15th December, but I did not take much notice—on 15th De<lb></lb>cember I asked the elder Gray for the duplicate bill of lading, and he said he would bring it—I did not receive this duplicate—I saw it in Mr. Pockett's office on 15th December—there were fifteen casks brought down or were on the wharf at the time that was signed—there were five more casks brought a week or nine days after—the bill of lading was originally for twenty and</p>

I carry on business in Lawrence Pountney-hill, London, in partnership with Isaac Solly Lister—I know the two prisoners—the younger prisoner was carrying on business with his brother under the firm of "Gray Brothers," at Llandoer—the elder prisoner was taking an active part in managing that business, and sometimes represented himself as a partner—we made arrangements as to making advances upon alkali, manufactured by them, and we arranged with the two banking houses at Swansea, to make advances to them—they were to take the alkali down to the wharf, and take the bills of lading to the bank, if they wanted an advance—the alkali came to Bristol by boat, and then by rail on to London to us—on 16th December, I received this bill of lading, dated 15th, from Mr. Dester, and on 17th I received this letter in the handwriting of the elder prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "December 16th, 1860.

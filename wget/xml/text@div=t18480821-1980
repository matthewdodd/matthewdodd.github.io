                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 132.) On 16th July, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was in Lawn-place, Wilsden, and heard loud screams from a female on the towing-path of the Grand Junction Canal—I went up, and found the witness, Sarah Spicer, screaming—she pointed out a spot in the canal, and also pointed out the prisoner who was about thirty or forty yards off—she said he had been quarrelling with the woman who was in the water—I took him into custody, and asked what he had been doing—he said he had struck her, and he was very sorry for it—I gave him into the custody of another policeman who came up, and one of the by-standers went and fetched a rake—we dragged the canal, and very shortly succeeded in getting out the body of a woman—we sent for a surgeon who said she was dead—I took the body to the Crown—I found this bonnet, cap, and shawl on the towing-path close by the spot—there is blood on the cap and bonnet on the same side, and the bonnet was broken and crumpled as it is now—the prisoner had a child in his arms, and was coming towards the spot as I went up—I assisted in getting the body out—the nearest part of the body was about five feet from the bank—the towing-path is level with the water—there is no bank for a person to jump off—a person might be pushed in head foremost—that would send them some way into the water—a person jumping would go in about the same distance—it is on the descent after you get in—I saw the body when taken out—I did not see any blows or marks of violence about it—there was not sufficient light—I did not see it afterwards—the prisoner had nothing in his hand—the woman had not the least appearance of life when taken out—from the time I first heard the screams till the body was taken out was about half an hour—she must have been left in the water without any effort to take her out—it is a lonely place—I asked the prisoner why he did not assist in getting her out—he said he had a complaint on him, and the doctors had prevented his going into the water—he said it was fistula—I have not ascertained whether that is correct—I believe the water is three feet deep so that a person who had any life in her might find her feet and come out—that depth would not drown a person—she was face upward.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Spicer, of Twyford Farm. The prisoner has been in the habit of working at Mr. Hudson's, at Acton—I have been working there in the hay fields—I knew Ann Fitzpatrick by working with her in the same fields—she cohabited with the prisoner—on the night in question, she and the prisoner, and I and Henry Reed were coming from Harlsden-green about half-past eleven o'clock—I and Reed were about two hundred yards behind—Fitzpatrick and the prisoner began to quarrel—I do not know what about—they continued to quarrel for some time—I then heard Fitzpatrick give a violent scream, and say, "You b----rogue, Newman, you have done for me"—I then ran towards her, and found her in the canal—I ran directly I heard the scream—it might take me twenty minutes, or rather more to get there—I had to run about two hundred yards—I do not know exactly how long I was—I was very much frightened—the prisoner was standing close by the edge of the water with the baby in his arms crying—I could see Fitzgerald's body in the water—it is very shallow there—not more than up to the prisoner's middle—I asked the prisoner what he had done—he said he had given her a blow, and she had thrown herself into the water—he did not hasten to take her out—I screamed violently for assistance—he went away, and said he would fetch somebody to pull her out—the con<lb></lb>stable came up—I showed him where the body was, and saw him take it out with a rake—it was the body of Ann Fitzpatrick—she was then quite dead—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210165"></xptr>
               <p>the prisoner had been carrying the child before the quarrel occurred—Fitz<lb></lb>patrick's bonnet and shawl laid close against the quick hedge that goes along the side of the canal—the towing-path divides the hedge from the canal—when I first went up I saw the body in the water—it was not floating—it was so near to me that I put out my hand to endeavour to take hold of her clothes—I could not reach her—I suppose it got further out afterwards—for when the officer came it was out of sight—I was very much frightened—I kept screaming, and crying all the while instead of rendering any assistance—I did not see her make any effort to get out—she was on the top of the wa<lb></lb>ter at first, and then went down to the bottom.</p>

               <p>twenty minutes, as if in trouble—they were <hi rend="italic">screeches</hi> for assistance from the side of the canal, which was about a mile off—I went towards it, and found it was Mrs. Spicer—the prisoner was then in custody—I asked Mrs. Spicer what was the matter—she said, "There is a woman drowned in the canal "—I asked how she came there—she said, "That man struck her (pointing to the prisoner,) but I don't know whether she fell in, or by the blow; but there she lies"—the prisoner said nothing—I did not see the body—I got a rake and in about ten minutes got the body out; it was about six feet from the bank—the water is three feet deep there—it is shallower than that by the path; it gets gradually deeper—there was nothing to prevent a person walking in and getting the body out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Kensal-green. I saw the body of the deceased that same morning—she had a severe bruise on the nose, just such as would be inflicted by a blow from the fist—I think it almost impos<lb></lb>sible that it could have been received by falling into the water, and coming in contact with any hard substance there; the water would break the fall—I should say, from its appearance, that the blow must have been such as to strike her to the ground or throw her off her legs—if she had been drinking that would be more likely—it was an <hi rend="italic">ecchymosised</hi> wound—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the state of the vessels of the brain indicated previous indulgence, and a blow would be calculated to produce insensibility, which, however, might have been recovered from, if immersion had not taken place; but the blow rendering her insensible she had not power to struggle in the water—I should not say that drowning was the immediate cause of death, for I found plenty of air in the lungs, and no water—the body had not imbibed any water—it is my opinion that she was knocked into the water in an insensible state—I think it possible that she might have thrown herself into the water after receiving the blow—a lapse of time would occur before con<lb></lb>gestion or insensibility would take place—she might have received the blow and rushed in, and at the same moment might be deprived of her senses—I attribute her death to congestion, from which, owing to her being in the water, she had not the power of recovering—I do not think the water itself would have done it—if she had not been hurt she could have got out at that depth—the blow itself might have caused death; but 1 do not think there was sufficient in the brain to account for death without the aid of the water—the position in which she was found, with her feet towards the bank, does not at all fall in with the idea of her having thrown herself in, unless it was in retreating to escape from the blow—I am acquainted with the spot—the stream is very blight there—the bank is very shelving—if the woman went in herself she must actually have walked into the water—the blow was not such as would be received from the rake in getting the body out.</p>

I have known the prisoner ten years, and knew his wife well—she was apt to take a little gin, and when she had taken a few glasses she would talk about making away with herself—two years ago, last Christmas-eve, she was taken to the hospital for having taken some poison; I do not know what—I was in the room at the time, and helped to take her in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—she had been tipsy all that afternoon—the prisoner always behaved kindly to her—he is very near-sighted.</p>

On the evening of the 24th July, I was fetched to Southall Bridge—I got there a little before 7 o'clock—I saw a bundle lying on the grass by the side of the road, near the bridge about 30 feet from the bridge—I opened it and found the body of a female child; it was naked—it was tied up in what appeared to be the clothes of the child, which were torn down behind—they were the things that have been produced to-day, including the socks and shoes which were on the feet—I removed the bundle to the Leonard Arms public-house—as I noticed it I found that the legs were up on its chest, all close together, so that the legs actually rested on the chest—I had the child washed that night; I noticed that the left arm was very black—I showed the body to Mr. Bott, the surgeon, the same night, between 9 and 10 o'clock, and on the following Wednesday, the 25th, I showed it to Mrs. Brittain, and on the 28th to Mrs. Bull—at the sametime they saw the clothes that have been produced—on the 26th, I apprehended the prisoner, I found her picking peas in a field in. the parish of Aveling, belonging to Mr. Woodthorpe—that would be about two miles or two and a quarter miles from Southall Bridge, past Wennington—it is the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising at Aveling—I saw the body of the deceased child on the evening of the 24th July, somewhere between 9 and 10 o'clock, at the Leonard Arms, Wennington—it had then been taken out of the" wrapping that it had been in, and was lying naked on some straw, stretched out—the legs were not then doubled up—I made an external examination of it—it was a female child about two or two and a half years old—it was exceedingly decomposed and very much discolored—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the 25th, before I was examined at the inquest—on removing the scalp there was an appearance of some effusion of blood, under the eyebrow, under the region of both eyes—that might have occurred before death, but I should not like to give a positive opinion upon that point; it might have been a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearance—the brain was healthy though too much decomposed to say anything about it—there was a certain quantity of dark blood—the vessels of the skull were filled with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200087"></xptr>
               <p>dark blood—I do not think that conld have been a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> occurrence—it would rather tend to shew that there had been some asphyxia—it might have been the result of suffocation, but I do not think it was, that ap<lb></lb>pearance was not consistent with its having occurred after death—in death from suffocation I should expect to find the vessels and the brain gorged—the veins of the skull are generally more or less filled with blood, but they were rather more so on this occasion—I found no injury to the skull itself—on opening the chest I found that the organs were very much decomposed, and judging from the condition of her I was of opinion, and I still am of opinion that the death was from fainting, because the heart was empty—that is sometimes called syncope—the heart was very pale, but I have since found it is quite possible that the emptyness of the heart, although not the paleness might have been caused by <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> changes, not from immer<lb></lb>sion in water but simply by accumulation of gases in the cavities of the heart distending it, forcing out the blood before it had coagulated—I do not think that that would affect the color, this heart was markedly pale—the stomach was full of semi digested food—I found no water in the stomach—I should generally expect to find that in a case of death from drowning, and I should also expect to find frothy mucus, I found none—as far as I could judge, the other viscera were healthy—the right arm was broken about the middle—the bone was splintered very much—the ap<lb></lb>pearance on the outside of the left arm was much blacker and darker than any other part of the body; I mean the external mark—the right arm was also broken about the same place, and the bone was very much splintered—there was a large effusion of blood, and the whole of the tissues were infiltrated with black blood—I could not trace the opening where the blood came from, but from the condition of the parts I considered that it came from one or more of the chief veins of the arm—I imagine that was caused by the veins being lacerated by the broken splinters of the bone—I formed the opinion that the child had died, from syncope and from loss of blood from the veins in the arm.</p>

The appearances I saw about the arm and the blood were quite inconsistent with <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances—they must have happened from injuries inflicted during life—at the time I considered that the child had been put into the water after death, and judging from all the collateral circumstances I think so still—I have since discovered from my reading that the heart will empty itself after death, but my opinion is still strong that the child did not die from drowning—the effusion of blood under the eyebrow might have been caused by a blow or it might not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The body was in a very advanced state of decompo<lb></lb>sition—that generally makes it more difficult to ascertain whether wounds are <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> or not—I do not make any exception in this case; it is a general rule—both arms were broken; I am not prepared to say that might not have been a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> injury—the right arm might have been broken before or after death—a fall of nine feet might have broken it—I say that the wound on the other arm was before death, because of the condition of the tissues; they were so thoroughly infiltrated with blood; it seemed to have Boaked through into the system—after death copious bleeding will not as a rule toke place, and it does not soak into the tissues in the manner this had done; it had infiltrated into the minute interstices of the tissues.</p>

               <p>occasioned before death, and also because the tissues were so thoroughly infiltrated with blood—it had soaked into it and into the tissues itself, and into the true skin—the child was not suffering from any disease that 1 could discover—there was a slight red patch in the colon, that might have been the result of diarrhoea after measles, but it was most probably <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—the liver was very much decomposed, but as far as I could tell it was healthy—I did not see the legs bent up—it would not be a matter of any very great difficulty to bend a child's legs.</p>

             GEARING. I am constable of the night; about half past one o'clock on Sunday morning, the 17th of November, the prisoner brought two men into the watch-house, charging them with taking down two shutters, with intent to rob, but he could not tell the number of the house; the two men, named Riley and Saunders, were locked up. Shortly afterwards I went to look at the premises, before I could get up to the prisoner, whose box is just by the premise, he put his hand into the box and presented two bonnets, saving, he had found them in his box. I found a square of glass broken in the window. I told the prisoner to look about, and perhaps he would find something more. I afterwards came back again, and he produced another bonnet. I asked him where he found it, he said down behind his box, I borrowed his lanthorn of him, and going behind his box, I said, is it down here that you found it. He hesitated, and then said, up there; I said where, he replied, tied to a bar. I asked him whether that was the place, because it was very wet, and expected if he found it there it would have been wet. I asked him if he sprung his rattle for assistance, he said no. I asked him where he left his lanthorn when he first discovered this, he replied, that he had left it with the watchman at the bottom of the court. This was about half past two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was on duty, the first alarm was the prisoner bringing in the two men, accompanied by the patrole. Riley was brought in first, by M'Carthy, and two minutes after the prisoner brought in Saunders.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might the prisoner be in the watch-house making the charge - A. Not more than five minutes; during which time there was nobody taking care of his box; it is not usual to have any body in the box while he is away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a person might easily come in and place any thing rhere - A. Yes; I don't know where the prisoner lives, nor how long he has been a watchman; the bonnets were all that was missed.</p>

            . The bonnets were two or three inches from the glass, so that they might have been taken through the window.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL ROBERTS. I am the watch-house keeper; I was called up about a quarter before three in the morning by Furzeman; I went down to Mr. Hanks's premises and examined the glass, I found the pin of the shutter had been taken out. The prisoner was in his box, which is close to the window, he has a good distance to go when he calls the hour; he has to turn down several courts. There were no marks of violence on the shutters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. The prisoner has been a watchman two or three years; he lives near Red Lion-square.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had stolen the bonnets might he not have conveyed them home if he chose - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>JAMES MULLINS. I was going down Holborn about a quarter past one o'clock on Sunday morning, I saw the shutters down, I asked the prisoner about it, and he produced two bonnets; the constable of the night asked him about his lanthorn, and he said he had given it to the watchman; the prisoner was standing outside his box at the time, he had been in his box before. The bonnets were brought out after I had left him. We looked behind the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after or before the second hat was produced that you looked behind his box - A. We had looked before, there was no bonnet there then, and when he was told it was a watering-place, he said it was tied to the iron bar.</p>

I want to speak to you, I went back to him, and he said you are one of the bakers, I said, what of that? he said he should take me into custody; I went with him, and he gave me to another man; I was kept in the watch-house; the prisoner came in with another man in about seven or eight minutes.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my beat is near Lincoln's-Inn-fields; as the prisoner was calling half past one, he called to me, saying, Cowell I want to speak to you. I said, what, have you got a prize? he answered, come along, and I will show you. He took me up the court and showed me the shutters. I asked him how it was done; he said, I do not know; I said, it looks very bad; he replied, I have got a man to take to the watchhouse, and I will leave you in charge the while. He left me and walked quite slow towards the watch-house; he had no man with him. I thought it very strange; I looked behind his box, and every thing appeared right. I did not look in his box; there was nothing behind it but an iron bar, which belonged to the box; there was nothing in it. He came back at about ten minutes past two o'clock; he said, he had taken up two; I said, you told me you had only got one; he replied, that he had caught another, and one of them was a baker. I then left him. About a quarter of an hour afterwards he called to me again, and said, he had got two hats; I asked him if they belonged to the two men; he said, they are ladies hats. He shewed them to me in his box; they were put very carefully in one another. I left him again, and he called me a third time, saying, he had got three hats; I told him he had but two before; he said he had found the other in the box; I told him it was not there when I left him; he made no reply, and I left him again. About six o'clock he asked me to go to the watch-house with him; I refused, saying, it looked very black. He said he had left a lanthorn in my care; I told him, that he was a false man to say so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He walked away quite easy; he was gone about forty minutes; I had my own lanthorn, not his.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was gone did you observe whether the glass was broken - A. I cannot say; one of the shutters was down, and the other was leaning against the glass; he shewed me the hats in his box of his own accord; he did not shew me the third hat, he only told me of it after the constable of the night had been; when I told him it looked black, he could not answer me a word.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Where was your box - A. Down Lincoln's-Inn-fields; there was no box at the bottom of the court; I did not look at the windows; there was nobody passed by, all was quiet.</p>

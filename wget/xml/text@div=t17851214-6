               <p>Do you think it to be your's? - I should suppose it is.</p>
               <p>Had you it frequently in use? - No, it lay in a drawer, it was bought a year or two ago for one of my sons, for some optical experiments; this was an ink-case, made to hold two pens, and very curiously contrived to hold ink; here was a thing went with a hinge, and the bottom part is particularly made; instead of a cork for the ink, here is a piece of metal so contrived that you need not daub your fingers; these are such particulars that I can swear it is mine; I can swear positively to this; this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140017"></xptr> I used to carry about with me continually, but went out of town the Saturday preceding the detection of this robbery a considerable journey from town; and not wanting it I left it at home.</p>
               <p>What is the value of that? - Ten shillings, he sold the gold of it for half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Atkins. Here are two keys.</p>
               <p>Doctor Warren. Mr. Atkins informed me these keys would open my drawers; I thought they would, I applied them to the locks, and found they opened the drawers; one opened the bureau, and the other the library; the stockings were in the bureau.</p>

               <p>Where was this ink-case? - I left it laying upon the table.</p>
               <p>You had not missed this till Mr. Atkins told you? - I had not been come home from this journey above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Atkins. I found three duplicates upon him, which led me to three pawnbrokers, where I found the silk stockings; I first went to Mr. Priestman, in Princes-street; I found two more pawned at Mr. Brown's, all white silk, but numbered differently; I retured to Bow-street, and when I came back to Bow-street the prisoner was crying, I told him the Doctor had missed a gold box, he told me he sold it at a refiner's, in Long-acre, but he did not rightly know the place.</p>
               <p>Did you make him any promises? - Nothing at all, he told me voluntarily; I found out where it was sold, at Mr. Plank's, refiner, in Long-acre.</p>

               <p>I should have thought this would have made you suspect him? - I thought he was in the business; after which he says to me as I was trying the other, says he, I should be glad if you will try this bit also, it looks like gold, I have had it some time by me; I tried that, and I told him that was gold; then I replied to him is this your own property, and did you come honestly by it? he said it was his own property, and he came honestly by it; before I weighed it, I said you are sure you come honestly by it; I was very suspicious from the circumstances of these pieces; I asked him, more than that, what it came from, and he told me it came from an old ivory snuff-box, after which he said to me, pray what may be the value of that which came off the bottom of the ink-stand, I put it into the scale, and told him about five shillings or five and six-pence, it altogether weighed about nineteen pennyweights and eighteen grains, the value of all together was two pound fifteen; after which I told him what it came to, he told me is not it worth any more, I said if you think you can make any more of it try it somewhere else, after which he said, Sir, I suppose you will give me as much as it is worth, and you may have it, and I paid him two pound fifteen for it.</p>

W. on the welt, and the figure of the No. under it, they were marked by my wife, I know they were marked before they were delivered.</p>
               <p>What do you charge Dr. Warren for these? - Fifteen shillings a pair, there is never a hosier in London, that can charge a reasonabler profit for less.</p>

               <p>Court. Had he admission into your master's rooms? - I always thought him strictly honest, he laid a good deal out of place and I had compassion upon him, and gave him a bit of anything I had, when I was upon board wages.</p>
               <p>Had he access to any room in the house? - Not that I know of, I knew nothing of any of the things being lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of William Robert Smily; he is a silversmith, living in Camomile-street, Bishopsgate; I am clerk to him. On 20th July the prisoner applied to my brother as a wedding ring keeper maker—I was present—I had not known the prisoner before—he gave two refer<lb></lb>ences for character, and my brother went to them—the prisoner came the next day, and was then employed to make bright gold keepers, and I gave him the metal, and told him what to do—it was jeweller's gold, for making bright</p>

               <p>gold keepers—he had been told the previous day what he was to do—he was to work in a shop by himself, on the basement in my brother's house, and was to make bright gold keepers only out of this metal—some are made of standard gold; others of inferior gold, consisting of gold, silver, zinc, and copper—I gave the prisoner about four ounces and a half of this mixed metal, called bright gold, worth about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning—he was to begin work immediately—I went with him to the shop, and left him there—I had not given him authority to remove the goods anywhere else, excepting my brother's shop—I do not recollect that I saw him again after I left him in the shop—I missed him between 2 and 3 in the afternoon—I do not think I had gone into the shop during that time, if I did, it must have been very shortly after I first left him—we gave information to the police the same evening—when we found the prisoner was gone between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, we did not immediately look for the gold—we sent a clerk to his lodgings first, and when the clerk returned we looked for the gold, and it was missing—he bad not left any part of it—I should think we usually stop work about 8 o'clock in the evening, but I do not think there was any time appointed for the prisoner, because he was to work piecework—I think he did not make any rings or keepers—we could find none—I cannot recollect whether it was 8 o'clock when we sent for the police—I saw the prisoner again when he was at the station—I had opportunity of noticing the man—I have not the slightest doubt that the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 248). I took the prisoner on Holborn-hill on 10th Aug.—I took him to the station and searched him—I found on him some earrings, which a person claimed at the Mansion House who had given them to him to mend—I asked the prisoner what he was—he said he was a working goldsmith—I told him the charge—he said there were some mistakes about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Smily, and was so when the prisoner came, which was four weeks ago last Wednesday, the day he was put on the work—he came up out of his shop into my shop and asked for a light—I told him to take one from the forge—he took it down, came up again, and asked for a hammer to flatten out some solder—I lent him one, and he flattened it for two or three minutes—he went down and came up a third time, and asked for some <hi rend="italic">pickle</hi>; that is stuff used to clean the work—I told him we had not any such as jewellers use—he said other would do—he then asked what time we went to dinner—I said, "We go what time we like"—he then said, "Where had I better put the gold?"—I told him he had better take it in the counting house, or put it on one side—he said, "I will take care no one shall find it"—I never saw him any more—the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner. About a fortnight before 20th July I met him accidentally—he told me had been very unfortunate and thrown out of work, had been confined in the hospital, and undergone an operation for the stone—I had known him about five or six years ago—at the time I was foreman to Mr. Burt he was employed there, and was a very steady, sober, honest man—I had the opportunity of giving the gold out to every man in the factory; there were twenty-five of them—I never found anything wrong, and from the knowledge I had of the prisoner's character I gave him leave to refer to me, and Mr. Sraily called on me on 20th July.</p>

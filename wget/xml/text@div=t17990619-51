               <p>Prisoner. Q. You say you saw me put my hand in my pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person come into the shop while we were there? - A. Only the woman with the pie.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the note up before? - A. I only touched it with my hand, so, and laid it down on one side to give change.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take upon yourself to say you saw me take it out of my right-hand waistcoat pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- CHIPPINDALE sworn. - Last Saturday I asked Mr. Grant if he could give me change for a one-pound note; I put it down by him, and he gave me change for it; we went out, and were going down the street, when Grant says, I have not got the note; I returned with Coe; I asked Mr. Grant, says I, you had some raspings here, what have you done with them; says he, I have put them into the counter; says he to Coe, I think you are the rogue, and have got the note; no, says he, I have not; says he, you had better produce it; says the other, I think not, you had it to take the number; in the course of that a woman came in with a pie; I am sure, before she came in, there was no note on the counter, I am clear of it; upon this Coe put his hand to the side of the pie, and said, this is the note that lays here, I am sure, and brought it up; says Grant, let us look at it, there are three sixes and a five.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Whether the woman did not come into the shop while you were there? - A. Yes, she came in while I was standing by the counter, after the note was disputed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was I not there at the same time? - A. Yes, you were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went in along with this man to get change for a note; he laid it down on the counter, and, as Mr. Grant says, he took and laid it on one side; a person came in with a pie; after he got the change, I stopped for him, and Mr. Chippindale asked me whether I would walk down the next street, and have something to ear; we were going along, and Mr. Grant said, I have not got the note; good God! says Chippindale, I laid it down on the counter; says I, go back again; I went back again with him, and the note lay by the side of the pie.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Chippindale.) Q. Did you see me take the note? - A. I saw you give it to Mr. Grant by the side of the pie-dish.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. We went away, and had something to eat; I was very much vexed, and I went back, and said, I feel myself very much hurt at your treatment, as if I had taken the note; after, words ensued, and he said he would take me before a Magistrate; he was very warm, and in a great passion.</p>
               <p>Chippindale. I did not see him take the note out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Grant then made use of very scur<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190049"></xptr>rilous language, and said, if I did not go about my business, he would take me up, which he did, and I was taken to Queen-square.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Chippindale). Whether Grant took me by the hand? - A. I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you say he did not take his hand from the dish? - A.Apparently he took it from the side of the pie.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that note was restored was it before the man was taken up? - A. I suppose near upon an hour; the prisoner and I went to get something to eat; the prisoner returned back, and spoke to Mr. Grant upon the accusation he had made; he said, he was very much hurt, and he returned of his own accord; he did not go to Mr. Grant's house, but to the public-house within two doors.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

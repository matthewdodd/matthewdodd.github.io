               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Mr. Witherby the attorney for your creditor? A. Yes - the 40l. was paid to the prisoner to endeavour to effect a compromise; I was arrested for more than that, and the prisoner was to make the best arrangement he could with Mr. Witherby; I remember an interview with the prisoner and Mr. Witherby at Whitecross-street prison in January - the prisoner did not then urge Mr. Witherby to accept the 40l. as a compromise; he certainly appeared to me to be doing what he could to serve me - I did not see Mr. Harmer after that, but I sent frequently to his office to say that I was detained; I supposed that Mr. Harmer was fully aware I had paid the 40l. to the prisoner, but I never mentioned it to them; my business was never settled.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. When was the money paid? A. The latter end of December; I applied about my discharge in about a fortnight, but I did not send to Mr. Harmer's office till after the term.</p>

            . I was attorney for the plaintiff in the action against Miss Denning; I never received any money from the prisoner to settle it.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any interviews with him on the subject? A. I had several; he endeavoured to effect a settlement - he said Mr. Harmer's business was of that nature, as to preclude him from entering into such low matters as Miss Denning's, and the whole matter was in his hands; he then said he would draw a cheque for 100l. to settle the business - I advised the plaintiff to take the 100l., and so get clear of the business, but it was refused; I think the prisoner offered to pay 40l. more than once, but the matter was so scandalous, I would not allow any compromise to be made - I always refused to take it; I thought it was all illusory - I forget whether he told me that he had received 40l. from Miss Denning's brother; he never produced a cheque to me - he invited me to attend at Whitecross-street, which I did, and, in Miss Denning's presence, he said he would draw a cheque if I would give her a discharge, and he subsequently offered 40l. at my office.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did he say where the money was? A. Yes, I asked where it was, and he said, "At Mr. Harmer's."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not repeatedly call at Mr. Harmer's, and address a letter to me on this subject? Witness. I cannot deny that I called, but you made no reference to the 40l. then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you communicate with the prisoner at Mr. Harmer's? A. Yes, I called, and I fancy the subject was talked of; there was not any concealment - it was my clients who refused the terms. I saw no reluctance on the part of the prisoner.</p>

            . I live in Broad-street. In 1829, I employed Mr. Harmer, as my attorney, about some family property, which was disputed; the prisoner attended to that as Mr. Harmer's clerk - on the 18th of January, 1830, it was arranged that some stock should be sold out, and I attended at the Bank, with the prisoner; here is the receipt of the stock that was sold that day - it was 163l.; here is a deduction of 10l. on the back of it, made by Mr. Scholey, the executor, and 20l. the prisoner deducted for Mr. Harmer; this is the bill the prisoner delivered to me, it amounts to 20l. 0s. 8d. - he told me he kept the 20l. to pay that bill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the 20l. paid to him? A. No, I saw him pay the money to the executor; Mr. Scholey expected a present - this is the prisoner's writing on the back of the receipt; I cannot tell who wrote the bill of costs, but the prisoner gave it to me - I went to Mr. Harmer's office, and stated to the prisoner, in the presence of the other clerks, that I was going to apply at the Bank to sell out the stock; I did not notice the attendances, which are set down in the bill of costs, at the time it was given to me - I only looked at the amount; the prisoner deducted it, and gave me the balance.</p>

            . I am a clerk to Mr. Harmer. I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings in February, 1830; I think the prisoner had quitted the office about three weeks before - I had, in that interval, been endeavouring to find him; I found a paper in a tea-caddy, or a small box - it is an account at the back of a letter, which is the prisoner's writing; the account, I think, is his brother's writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner quit the service himself? A. To the best of my belief he did; Mr. Harmer gave him notice to go, but he did not wait till the end of the time - Mr. Harmer's business is very extensive; if I wanted money to settle any expences I should go to Mr. Harmer for it, but if he had a client he did not know, he would say, "You had better ask the clients for it;" the accounts are settled every week, but sometimes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050087"></xptr>they are not, as we are at assizes, or on examination - if I received money from any client it would appear in the book when my cash account went in; our rule is to give the accounts in every week, and I think I can swear that not more than a fortnight has ever elapsed without their going in - I do not think that business has gone on for clients of whom Mr. Harmer knows nothing; if any one applied to me I should mention it - there is a bill-book in the office; I never keep drafts of bills, and enter them in the book a long time afterwards - I should say that it has never happened that the clerks have received sums of money above 20l. of clients of whom Mr. Harmer knows nothing; I never heard of any mortgage being taken by Mr. Harmer - it is not the custom for clerks to attend to clients, and not let Mr. Harmer know it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Are the clerks allowed to retain any money for occasional disbursements, and to bring it to account afterwards? A. No my Lord; if I received 20l. I should take it to Mr. Harmer, and if I wanted any money I should tell him, and he would give it me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You know where I resided. Witness. Yes- I went to your lodging two or three days after you left the office, and found a number of vans; you had taken a van to go to Surrey, and then to come to Islington - I did not know there were any civil proceedings against you.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES HARMER. I am an attorney. The prisoner was in my service about two years; he quitted me, I think, the first week in February, 1830 - I think he states two weeks in February in his account, but I believe he charged one week more than he attended; his duty was if he received a small sum of money from a client to enter it in the petty cash-book, but if he received a larger sum he was to pay it to Mr. Tomlin, or to me; he certainly never accounted to me for 40l. received from Miss Denning - I did not know that any sum had been received by him till some time afterwards, when I heard it from her brother; he never accounted to me for 20l. received from Mr. Tucker - I did not know it had been received till some time after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has it ever been required of him to give an account of this 40l. or 20l.? A. No, Sir, but when I had reason to suspect him I told him he must make up all his accounts, which he never did - if I had received from him this account found at his house, in which the 20l. appears, and the 40l. had been added to it, I should not have been satisfied, because his duty was to make it known to the cash-clerk that he had received it; I do not look over the accounts of the clerks - I do not recollect that it has ever happened that clerks have received money on account of clients, and have not rendered an account of it, because they had applied it to the purposes of the clients; if they had received a large sum and had a large sum to pay, I should not have complained of it if they had entered it and communicated it to the cash-clerk - if he had not returned an account of the 40l. for two or three days I should not have complained, if there had been any prospect of the matter being settled, but if he rendered an account it should have appeared in it; I never knew of the clerks having received a large sum of which they have not given an account at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a sum of money having been advanced by a clerk to Smallwood, which ended in a mortgage? A. I remember the prisoner applied on behalf of a person named Smallwood, a man in poverty, and I authorized some advances of 2l., to the amount I think of 30l. - I have no recollection of being made acquainted with an intention to sell the stock on this occasion; but finding it was a Chancery business, I introduced Mr. Tucker to Fry, and said, "Attend to this gentleman's business."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner ever communicate to you that he had furnished a bill, and received the money? A. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But if he had done so, you would not have complained? A. Yes, I should if he had not entered it; I do not see the bill-book once in six months- I should say it does not often happen that bills do not make their appearance in the bill-book; I know there have been two or three cases in which I have had occasion to look for very large bills in my bill-book, and I have found that a great part of them have not appeared in the book, for which I have given a lecture to my clerks.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Supposing the prisoner, on the 22nd of December, to have received 40l., and he made up his account on the 11th of January, ought it to have appeared? A. Certainly.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you mean, Sir, to state, that the first payments I made to Mr. Smallwood were not made without your authority or direction? A. I will not swear that, but I never authorized any clerk of mine to lend money to a client without consulting me - I recollect your stating that the client was in distress, though he had a good and equitable claim - I do not recollect your furnishing me with an account of the receipts and payments in that action; I think you have handed me money received from clients, and I have handed it to Mr. Tomlin - there is another collecting-clerk in the house. Mr. Mills; the book will tell whether he was so in December, 1830; he had no authority to receive money in the office, but to collect from clients - he certainly has never received directions from me to require the clerks to pay to him monies which they received from clients - I cannot tell whether, when you have rendered accounts, the balances have been in your favour; I had been urging for some time before you left, that you should make up your accounts.</p>

            . I am cash-clerk to Mr. Harmer, and was so in 1829 and 1830; it was the rule for the clerks to account to me - the prisoner did so, but he never accounted for 40l. received from Miss Denning; I did not know he had received it till about ten days after he left the office, when I heard it, in Mr. Harmer's private office; Mr. Martin was there at the time. The prisoner never accounted for 20l. received from Mr. Tucker - I heard of that about the same time; I have looked into the bill-book, and there is no such bill as this of Mr. Tucker's, entered there; the prisoner accounted to me on the 31st of January, 1830, in the usual way - here is the book; he gave an account of four items, but the 40l. and 20l. are not brought to account in that, or in any previous settlement - the last time he settled before was on the 12th of December; I had been urging him for his account in the interval.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there a balance due to him in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050088"></xptr>last account? A. Yes, 7l. 0s. 6d. on the account he has rendered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then this was longer than a week after he made his former account? A. Yes, it was six weeks - the accounts do sometimes go longer than a week- I should not have allowed clerks to say, "I have received a sum of money, but I have not settled the business yet;" I do not remember that any monies have never been received by the clerks from clients, which have never been entered in the book; I do not remember a sum of 80l. being received from Mr. Morris - I have heard there was a sum of money received on account of Mr. Harmer, in the case of Whitaker; I heard of 20l. which was accounted for to me, but not 520l. - I understood that had been paid to Mr. Whitaker; I never understood that the prisoner received it - I do not know that the prisoner received 80l. on account of Mr. Morris; it may be in the book - the sums on this receipt (looking at one) I know Mr. Harmer gave a cheque for, himself - they were probably both given to the prisoner to pay them; the prisoner had the management of the Chancery business, but it does not follow that if any money was paid he would receive it; it might have been handed to the clients at the time - there have been balances in the prisoner's favour, and on one occasion there was a large balance, but I think never so high as 40l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you produce that book as containing an exact copy of my accounts rendered from time to time to you? A. Precisely so - it contains the whole of the payments you have made to Mr. Harmer; there were balances in your favour - the sums stated in your last account were received in December; I cannot state what disbursements you have made since the receipt of the 40l. - it has been the case that bills have not been entered in the billbook.</p>

            . I am an officer. A warrant was placed in my hands on the 23rd of February, 1830 - I went with it in search of the prisoner - we were up three or four nights, seeking for him; I was at his house when this paper was found over the water, in Surrey - I saw his wife, but I saw nothing of him till I found him at Liverpool, on the 3rd of March last: I took him, and told him the charge against him - I made him no promise or threat; he stated that he was given to understand that the case against him was 300l., and he was sure it was not so much as 100l., or not more than 100l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know that he had a writ against his person and his goods? A. No, Sir; he did not say that Mr. Harmer charged him with being in his debt 300l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you went to my lodging in John-street, did you not hear that I had gone out within an hour? A. I do not recollect that - Mr. Robinson was in the house first; I do not recollect hearing that you were shortly to return - your wife did not tell me where you were.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, in an exceedingly long address, stated that the accounts of the office were kept in a very irregular manner; that he was in the habbit of receiving money from clients, and only brought to account the costs, keeping the sums paid by clients to him, as a floating balance, to meet various disbursements; that the only fault he had committed, was having by mistake applied more to his own purposes than his salary amounted to, which arose from the balances remaining in his hand without any settlement, that he absconded in consequence of pecuniary embarrasment, but if a balance had been struck, the amounts in question would have been included.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 43.</p>

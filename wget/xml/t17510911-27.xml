After that I went to the clergyman, and said, I was sorry this thing happened in this place; that this man, the clerk, is charged with a crime that is felony, therefore I think it my duty to apprehend him, having observed he had been out-lawed also in the London Gazette.

I went into the house, where I had a brace of pistols, and Mr. Goodwin had two, who said he would die with me.

There were about eighteen or twenty, and they rode up to Welch's door. I got into a hedge to conceal myself, and letting the horse go, he went straight home. The moon was about full, and being a light night, I saw all their behaviour. There was a single piece fired before a word was spoke, that I heard; then Old York called out, G - d d - n your soul, resign your prisoner. The gang then drew up against the house. After that they had surrounded it, Old York gave no time for me to consult my assistants, but immediately ordered the whole gang to fire; by his directions they continued firing near an hour, and they shot down 169 quarries of glass from the windows; and there happening to be four gentlemen lodged in the house that night, one of them knew

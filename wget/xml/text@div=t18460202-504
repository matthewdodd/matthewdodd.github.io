                  </hi>. I am the wife of Morris Horwitz, slop-seller, East Smithfield. On Wednesday, the 7th of Jan., in the evening, the prisoner Sumner came to our shop and presented this advance note, and asked me if I would cash it—it was for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked how he wished to have it cashed—he said he wanted clothes and money for it—he looked out articles which came to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked if I would allow him to have the balance, 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that evening, and I gave it him—he asked if he might take a cap which he had selected, as his old one was very shabby—I let him have it—he said his vessel laid in the London Dock, and was going to sail in the morning—that he lived with a widow named Cox, in Cannon-street—he said he would call about half-past eight o'clock in the morning for the things, but he did not, and I sent to the Minories to the address on the note, and from what the man I sent told me, I sent for the police.</p>

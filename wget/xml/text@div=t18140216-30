On the 4th of February, I lost two pair of stockings, an apron, a mug, and a chamber-pot; I lost them out of my yard at the back of my house; I had seen them about a quarter of an hour before I missed them. I know Bunney. I saw my things the next morning at Bunney's house, the mug and chamber-pot were standing on a table outside of the house, exposed for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Bunney - A. He is a broker, and keeps an old iron shop. I went into the house; I saw the stockings; Bunney was not at home. I saw a woman and a little girl. I claimed the stockings, the mug, and a chamber-pot. I did not see the apron. I afterwards saw Bunney, I told him the things were mine; he said, he gave fifteen pence for the stockings, and sixpence for the crockeryware. I have never seen the stockings since; the crockery I have got. It was Friday when I lost the things. On Monday afterwards, about six o'clock in the evening, I passed the woman prisoner in the passage, I asked her what she wanted, it was dark; she said, she wanted to go into the privy. I said, I think you are the woman that robbed me last week; I had her taken into custody. My wife told me she had confessed taking the things, and selling them to Bunney.</p>

               <p>Stokes's Defence. As I was going through the passage I stepped upon the stockings, I unfortunately picked them up.</p>
               <p>Bunney's Defence. To the best of my knowledge I bought the goods of the woman Stokes; she said they were her own, she sold them for distress; the crockeryware I put out publicly for sale.</p>
               <p>Bunney called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of John Hyde and others, Cheapside—they have a warehouse in Clement's-inn-yard—I am foreman there, and the prisoner was a workman—on the 18th Sept. in consequence of information I watched him from eight to twelve o'clock, and saw him put four bobbins away in a box, cover them with paper, and put gimp-work over the paper—he went to dinner at one o'clock—I then went to his box and found four bobbins out of five—I marked them—about four o'clock I saw him remove them into another box, wrapping them in paper with another—when he left work at seven I</p>

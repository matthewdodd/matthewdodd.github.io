            . What have you to say against the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Fisher. Please your Lordship, the Prisoner came into my Yard to Day, between nine and ten in the Morning; I live in Pearl-court, White-Fryars , and at the same Time I took them from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there in your Yard?</p>
               <p>Fisher. No Body but I; she went through the Entry, and a cross the Kitchen, and upon the Kitchen Step, she stood and dragged them off the Line.</p>
               <p>Q. What Stockings were there?</p>
               <p>Fisher. There were nine Cotton, and three Pair of Thread, Gentlemens Stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her take these Stockings from the Line, what did you do?</p>
               <p>Fisher. We stopped her in the Entry with them in her Lap; a Neighbour saw her take them, and she called to me to come and see, and I took them from her in the Entry.</p>

            . I was going down to the Yard, and I met the Prisoner coming up the Kitchen Stairs; the Stairs were dark, and I made way for her to come by; I thought she looked like a very suspicious Person; she told me a frivolous Story that she had been carrying Water, &amp;c. I knew my Neighbour had Linen drying in the Yard, and I was afraid she had taken something that did not belong to her; I asked her two or three Questions; her Excuse was that she had been doing something for a Gentleman up two Pair of Stairs; when she made this frovolous Excuse, I knocked at my Neighbour's Door, and desired her to come, I was afraid she had lost some of her Linen. When my Neighbour came out, she pulled the Prisoner in by the Shoulders, and took these Stockings from her; she owned she had taken them off the Line, and she owned it before Sir

On the 23d of April, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I went out, and double locked my door; my wife was gone to market - I had the key. I returned between eight and nine o'clock, and found the street door burst open, the drawers all open, and property strewed about; I missed a 5s. piece, and a few shillings from the drawer; some gown pieces laid in the middle of the room, with a large shawl, ready to pack them in. The officer was there before I got home; the gowns had been removed from their place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long ago was this? A. On the 23d of April, 1825 - my landlady's name is Penn; she has a stair case outside the house, which leads to her room; her door opens on some leads; I do not enter at that door. I never had a man named Gravett taken up on this charge - I did not appear at Hatton-garden against him.</p>

            . I live in King's-place, within thirty yards of Leggett's house. On the 23d of April, 1825, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I saw Gravett standing at the end of Church-row - he watched Mrs. Leggatt out to market, away from the house; he then went down Church-row, and about twenty minutes after seven o'clock, I went to Leggett's house for some milk, and passed Gravett within fourteen or fifteen yards of the house; I went on, and when I pushed Leggett's door I found it was open; a chain was round the knob - it had been broken open; I went into the shop, and the prisoner stood there; I have known him many years. I said, "Is not Leggett at home?" he said, No - I said, "I want some milk;" he said, "So do I;" I put my back against the door, and said, "Well, he won't be long;" he stood with a bit of parsley in his hand, twisting it about, in an agitated manner, and said, "Well, Mary, as Leggett is not here, we can't have it" - he then passed me, and ran away. I did not know where he lived - his family were brought up in our neighbourhood; I had seen him constantly about before this happened, but not afterwards, till the 24th of November last, when he was in custody, except once, about twelve months ago or longer, when he came and begged of me not to appear against him, and asked me to say he was asking for milk; I had a basin in my hand for the milk, but he had neither basin nor mug; I saw nobody else in the house. I saw Leggett between eight and nine o'clock, and told him what I had seen; I called a young woman, and told her somebody had broken in; we looked into the parlour, and saw the drawers open, and the things scattered about; Gravett was taken up, and examined at Hatton-garden - the Magistrate discharged him, saying he must be taken again if Smith was found. Leggett did not appear there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the door open? A. I pushed it, and the chain rattled. I found it ajar - anybody going to it might see that.</p>

            . I am a gold and silver worker, and live in Spann's-buildings, St. Pancras, fifty or sixty yards from Leggett's. On the 23d of November, 1825, about seven o'clock in the morning, I went to my gate, and saw Smith come running down as fast as he could, from the back walk, in a direction from Leggett's house; I thought there was something the matter; I went, and found Dimmock there. I went into the house which had been broken open, and the things were all in confusion. I knew the prisoner before, and cannot be mistaken in him. Limbrick was sent for, and then I left the place. I knew the prisoner lived in the neighbourhood, but I did not know where; he was frequently about, but I never saw him after this.</p>

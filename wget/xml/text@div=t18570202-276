                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I live in St. George's-street, and sell ginger beer. The prisoner Fairley came to my shop on 6th Jan., about 10 o'clock at night, for a bottle of lemonade—at that time I saw the prisoner Connell outside the door—I served Fairley with the lemonade—he paid me with a half sovereign, and I gave him change—the change lay on the counter—just at that moment Connell came in for a pennyworth of peppermint—I left off attending to Fairley, and served him—Connell then went out—after he was gone Fairley said he would have nothing at all, unless he had some of Williams's make—at that time the change was on the counter—I then looked for one of Williams's make—I looked round and saw a half sovereign on the counter—after that Fairley took the change and the bottle, and went away—at that time the prisoners were both in the shop—Connell afterwards went away—he only left the shop once—the first that went away was the one that came for the lemonade, and Connell left in barely a minute afterwards—I had only just time to serve him while he was in the shop—when he put the penny down for the pepper<lb></lb>mint then Fairley put down the half sovereign—I looked at the half sove<lb></lb>reign—it was a base one—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

I took Connell into custody—I told him it was for passing a counterfeit half sovereign in St. George's-street—Fairley was sitting by his side in a beer shop—Connell said he had not passed a half sovereign—I afterwards took Fairley—I told him it was for passing a bad half sovereign in St. George's-street—he said he had passed no bad half sovereign—I received the half sovereign from the last witness—I found on Connell three half crowns, a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, three shillings, and two sixpences, and some peppermint, and on Fairley 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took Connell on Tuesday and Fairley on the Friday—I went back to the beer shop on Tuesday to see for Fairley, but I could not find him.</p>

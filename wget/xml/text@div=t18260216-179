            . I am one of the conductors of the Bow-street patrol. On the 14th of February I was on duty in Playhouse-yard, with Keys; I saw the prisoner there with a bag of nails - I asked him what he had in the bag; he said nails, which he had brought from his waggon in Whitecross-street, and was going to take them to his own home, in Green Harbour-court, Golden-lane - that he had been out delivering nails, and he had delivered twenty-nine bags, but had forgotten to deliver the 30th, and intended to deliver it in the morning. I asked if he had any papers to show what he had delivered - he said he had the papers, but they only showed the delivery of twenty-nine bags, and the prisoner said they had thirty of them - I sent Keys to go with him to Mr. Slater's wharf, but he was not at home - I went the next morning, and saw Mr. Slater; I then went to the prisoner, and told him I had seen Mr. Slater; and he said it often happened that he took a bag home to deliver the next day.</p>

            . I live at the wharf, in the City-road; I am agent to Moses Robinson; I received some nails from him lately. The prisoner came into my employ at Christmas; this bag of nails is one of the twenty which I directed to my warehouseman, to deliver to Mr. Hanton, in Whitechapel - it was in our warehouse on the 14th of February.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Moses Robinson. Slater gave me an order to put a certain quantity of nails into a waggon, to deliver, which I employed the prisoner to do; there were thirty bags in all, which was one more than he wanted - and had been put in by mistake - I told him to bring it back, provided it was marked with a certain letter.</p>

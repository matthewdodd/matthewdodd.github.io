                  </hi> I am a solicitor, in partnership with my father in Old Broad-street. The prisoner was in our employment about ten months or a little more—he left on the 17th of March last—Mr. Peel's partnership had ceased long before that—the prisoner would not have any opportunity, in the ordinary course of business, of seeing Mr. Peel's signature—there was handwriting of Mr. Pell's which he could get at if he chose—there were deeds kept in boxes in an upper room, and he could have access to them if he chose—the house<lb></lb>keeper keeps the keys, but any of the clerks would be admitted by applying to her—there are many deeds no doubt there attested by Mr. Peel—the signature to this check of the 22nd of March has a strong similarity to the prisoner's handwriting—I should say the signature and the body of the check are the same handwriting—the figures I should say are very like the prisoner's—I do know whose writing this is at the back of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—the name of Simmonds on the front I should say was the prisoner's writing—I believe he has been sent to Jones Loyd's, with money—my father usually sends to the bank—I do not know in whose writing this order for a check-book is.</p>

               <p>cannot be certain—I have no doubt as to my belief of the writing—the writing in the body of the check is similar to his—that on the bank note is precisely as he writes quick—I have seen so much of his writing—I have seen him write quick and slow—I do not think there is a great difference between the writing on the note and that on the check—the writing on the check is not an easy hand—I do not think it is an easy flowing writing—the "Henry Thompson" is more easy, in my opinion, than the "£89"—I cannot say a word about the signature at the bottom—I do not think it is very free—it seems to be stiff.</p>

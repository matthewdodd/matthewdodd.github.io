I am fireman in the employ of the North London Railway—the deceased was engine-driver to my train—on the 19th of May our train left Fenchurch-street about 7, and arrived at Shoreditch about twenty-five minutes past—the starting signal was then against our going on—after passing the intermediate Bank signal-box, and before we get to Shoredith Station, there are the Auxiliary signals—they are about 300 or</p>

               <p>400 yards from the station—when we passed them they were "all right"—the semaphore signals at the entrance of the station were "all right"—at Shoreditch the deceased said he should not have so much time at Broad-street, and he would put a drop of oil in the engine then, and he told me to keep an eye on the signals—he took the oil-feeder in his hand, and got off on to the platform—shortly afterwards the Chalk Farm train came in, and knocked our train out of the station—I went back and found the deceased on the platform quite dead—our usual time for staying at the station is about a minute, and we were there about five minutes.</p>

I was the guard of the deceased's train—we left Fenchurch-street about 7 o'clock, and arrived at Shoreditch at 7.30—the starting signal was then against us—I think we were in the station about eight minutes, and the starting signal was against us all that time—the auxiliary signal was "off," which means, to proceed, but the semaphore was "on."</p>

I live at 44, Elen-street, Bow, and am a driver on the North London Railway—I was driver of a train from Broad-street to Chalk Farm—when I got within sight of Shoreditch station, I saw the signal for the "up" line was down—I saw the deceased, he was on the side of his engine, by the side of the tank—he had an oil feeder in his hand, but I could not see what he was doing—I saw the Chalk Farm train coming into the station, and I made all the signals I could for them to stop—the guard applied his break immediately, and the driver did his utmost to stop it—the line is very much on a curve before getting into the station on the "up" line—they first see the auxilliary signal, and then the station signal—if the auxilliary signal is clear and the station signal against us, there is time, with the application of break, to pull up before running into the station; but if the semaphore was down, and they saw my signal, there was not sufficient time to pull up before entering the station—they were coming at the usual speed when they saw me.</p>

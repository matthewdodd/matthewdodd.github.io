                  </hi>. On 2nd April I saw Mr. Picton at the Kentish Town Station, and found a punctured wound exactly in the centre of his breast, through the nipple—it divided no vessels of importance, it only went through the gland—it was half-an-inch deep, and might have been caused by this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I live at 3, Wellesley Road, Kentish Town—on 2nd April, about 7.30, I had just come from the factory and went into the George IV., Kentish Town—I heard words between the prisoner and the prosecutor, and the prisoner pulled out a knife and made a stab at the prosecutor, but I did not see the wound—I threw the prisoner down and took this knife out of his hand—I do not think he was sober—he told me he had been asleep.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I said "I have done nothing," and I did not know that I had <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate:</hi> "All I have to say, your Worship, is, that the man came up to me and said he would give me a punch in the nose.

I went to the factory where the prosecutor is employed, and borrowed a sack, and went to take the soot, and he said if I did not go he would give me a punch in the nose. About two hours afterwards I was cutting some bread and cheese with my knife in the public-house, and the prosecutor came in with his witness, and rushed at me to strike me. I put up my arm and he fell on the knife, in<lb></lb>flicting the wound. The fact of it is, it is spite. The witness is in the same business as myself, and if I am sent to prison he thinks he will get</p>

               <p>my business. It was a straight wound, not wider than the blade of a knife, which will prove that he fell on it. It was only two inches deep, and if I did it wilfully I should have done it with a great deal of force, and it must have made a down wound and not a slit wound. If he shows the wound you will see that I am speaking the truth. It did not go through his coat, only through his waistcoat.</p>

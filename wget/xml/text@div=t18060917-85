I had fastened my door, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170064"></xptr>three o'clock in the morning, I awoke, I found the door broken open; I found the prisoner asleep on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in the same house. - A. Yes, she lodged in the same room with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you. - A. I am an unfortunate girl.</p>
               <p>Q. What is she. - A. The same; I awoke her, I asked her how she came in, she said she did not know; I immediately went to my bed to look for my money, I found it was gone; the next day she took the bonnet and put it on her head, and went out of the room; I met her between eight and nine o'clock, I asked her for the bonnet, she refused giving it me, she had it on her head.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lived along with this woman a considerable time; what was mine was her's and what was her's was mine; she took the bonnet off my head, she used to lend me her things; she said first that the woman in the next room had taken her money, and then afterwards she accused me.</p>

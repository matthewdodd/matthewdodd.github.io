                  </hi>. I am the son of Nathan Casper, a watch-maker, in Bury-street, St. Mary-axe. I have known the prisoner nearly three months—on the 18th of March I went to his house by appointment—I took one gold watch, worth 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and six silver ones, which I gave him to, as he said he could take me to a place where it was likely I could dispose of them—we went to several places, and ultimately got to a pawnbroker's in South Audley-street—I stayed outside while he went in with the watches—I gave them to him, because he said he could sell some—when he came ont, I said, "Have you done any business?"—he said, "Come to the public-house opposite, and I will speak to you"—when we got there, he said he could sell the gold watch and two silver ones if I could take fifty ounces of sterl<lb></lb>ing silver; and he asked what price I could allow for it—I said, "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce"—he said, "That is just the price the man wants, and he is very</p>

               <p>particular—he will not buy the watches unless I shew him a bill and re-ceipt, as if I had paid for them"—I told him I could not give him any thing of that kind, as it was no way of business—he said, "It will not make any difference to you, you can come over the way witk me, and I will give you the silver and the money"—after some persuasion I gave him these two bills and receipts, but no money passed between us—he went over with the watches and these documents—he went into the shop, and I stood outside, as usual—after some time, I saw him run out, and before I could get to him he was gone—he never accounted to me for these witches—I was eight days searching for him.</p>

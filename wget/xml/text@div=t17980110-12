             sworn. - I am a bricklayer, I live upon Twickenham-common: On the 27th of November last, I got up between four and five o'clock to go to work; going past the barn I heard a noise in the barn, I stopped a few minutes, and saw the prisoner with a bag upon his back, I knew him before; I called to him, and spoke to him, he was within three or four feet at farthest from me, it was light enough for me to see him to know the man well; he passed by me, and said something, but I did not hear what it was, and carried the sack into his own house, that is all I saw of it; there was a light in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You do not begin bricklayer's work so early as that on the 27th of November? - A. Being a very light morning I got up, thinking it was day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that, and expect any man to believe it? - A. I did, and I will swear it again; I was deceived in the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it was moon-light, the first quarter of the moon was the 26th; now what sort of light was it? - A.(Hesitates).</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100017"></xptr>Q. What time did you go to bed that night? - A. A little before nine.</p>
               <p>Q. I should rather suspect you had not been in bed at all? - A. I am not that sort of person.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this barn from your house? - A. I believe, about an hundred and twenty yards, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, when you found it was not day-light, how came you to ramble so far? - A. That is not far, in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you usually get up? - A. As soon as it is day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose barn was it? - A. Mr. Davis's.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that at the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no doubt that he came out of the barn? - A. I heard the noise in the barn; I have no doubt but he did come out of the barn.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no business in Mr. Davis's barn, or upon those premises? - A. I never knew that he had any connection with Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you live from Mr. Davis's? - A. Better than three quarters of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. As you saw him coming out of this barn with a sack, how soon did you tell Davis of it; did you tell him of it for a week? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. A fortnight? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Three weeks? - A. It was the day before Christmas-day.</p>
               <p>Q. And not before? - A. No; but I had to another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps this man staid at his own house till he was taken up? - A. I cannot say; he did not that I know of; I know he was taken at Twickenham.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps there might be a quarrel between you and this man? - A. I never passed three words with him after he had been guilty of the action.</p>
               <p>Q. And, perhaps, you had never paid him what you owed him after he was guilty of the action? - A. I did not know that it was not paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your wife tell you he had been there, and was very troublesome? - A. I was not at home if he did come.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your wife tell you he had been there for his money? - A. Yes, she did tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Davis of it till after your wife had told you that he had been troublesome, and insisted upon his money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Thomas Dobson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you say to him that you would send this man out of the country? - A. I did not, to my knowledge; I do not remember that I said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Dobson is here - now will you swear that you did not? - A. I cannot swear that I did not, nor that I did.</p>

Yes; and I had it of a Boy in Chick-Lane, said the Prisoner, who asked me 3 d. for it; but I snatch'd it from him, and ran away with it. The Hat hung up against the Side of a Press in my Shop, and I miss'd it from thence, the Night before.</p>
               <p>Benjamin How. The Prisoner came up into my Room one Night, - I can't remember the particular Time, and told me he had a Hat in pawn for a Shilling, and if I would give him Money to fetch it out, I should have it for a Shilling more: So I gave him one Shilling to redeem the Hat, and he sold it me out-right for another. I believe this is the same Hat I bought of the Prisoner.</p>

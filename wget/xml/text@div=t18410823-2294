                  </hi>. I am an oilman, and live in Charlotte-terrace, New Cut. On the morning of the 7th of August, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought one gallon of oil—he gave me a sovereign—I gave him 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—I think it was a five-shilling piece, two half-crowns, and a shilling—he returned to the shop a little after one o'clock, and said his master and a friend had been inquiring about the oil, and if they came he hoped I should say it was two gallons he bad—he said he had purchased one gallon a short time before, which he paid for out of his own pocket—he said if I did not say so, he should get the cook and housemaid, and all of them into a scrape, that they would get the <hi rend="italic">sack</hi>—he staid some time beg<lb></lb>ging hard of me to say it was two gallons—I told him it was a system I did not approve of, and if he had purchased a gallon before, it would be quite satisfactory to Mr. Franks to say so—I urged him to tell the truth, saying it would be a gross falsehood on my part to say it was two when it I was only one—Mr. Franks and Mr. Harvey then came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a month—he had not purchased another gallon of oil at my shop, that I am aware of—I have only served him once—he was ten minutes with me desiring me to say he had had two gallons—his master then came in—he spoke to him, and then went away—I live very nearly the same dis<lb></lb>tance from the prosecutor's as Mr. Zetterquist does—it is not two minutes difference—when the prisoner came the second time, he bought 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of rotten-stone to polish harness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was at home on the 7th of Au<lb></lb>gust, when the prisoner came in and put 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down—he said, "That is the change from the oil"—he did not say what quantity—I asked him where he got the oil—he said from Mr. Knight, in the Cut (I had been to Irongalf Wharf, and meant to go again) I told him to go below and forward his work and to get his dinner, and at three o'clock to put the horse to, and I would go with him to Irongate Wharf—shortly after I went with Mr. Harvey, a friend of mine, and an acquaintance of Mr. Knight's, to Knight's shop—Mr. Harvey</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184108230209"></xptr>
               <p>went through the shop into the parlour, and I saw the prisoner come out from the parlour in about five minutes—I said, "What do you do here?"—he said he came to speak to Mr. Knight about the oil, as he thought I seemed to suspect all was not right—I said he had no business to do that, I did not complain about the oil—I had not expressed any suspicion up to that time—I told him to go home—he then said he came to boy some harness polish, which he had in his hand—after saying a few words to Mr. Knight, I got a policeman and gave him into custody—The prisoner asked why I did so—I said it was on a charge of felony—he said, "I know, sir, that I have done wrong respecting the oil, I assure yon that I bought a gallon about ten days back, that I ought then to have men<lb></lb>tioned it to Mr. George; I know that it is very wrong that I did not"—I said, "Well, John, but you have charged 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gallon, and only paid Mr. Knight 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he replied he certainly did pay Mr. Knight 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then alluded to the box at the Irongate Wharf—I said, "Well, you will put on your coat and go with the police," and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had he been in your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six or seven months—in that time I pose he bought six or eight gallons of oil for me—I did not see how much oil I had in my possession at this time—I cannot tell whether he had bought any within ten days or not—he gave me that account immediately on my speaking to him—according to the con<lb></lb>sumption of oil in my house, it is not likely it should have been bought and used—I should say there ought not to have been any wanted—The prisoner said, "If you measure the oil in the house, yon will find there was the gallon I have just now bought, and about half a gallon, which was in the can before I went for it"—I did not measure—I had no particular reason for not doing so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you had measured, and found the gallon newly brought, and the half-gallon also remaining, would that have satisfied you that what he said was correct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not certainly, because there would have been no reason for his getting the oil if there was some in the house—half a gallon will last us for some time—he never paid for oil out of his own pocket—I should say the two gallons we had before ought to have lasted—I do not, of my own knowledge, know when those two gallons were purchased, only from the books.</p>

               <p>1.30 in the night, I awoke, and heard my daughter say "Oh, lor! how can I go into the bar in the morning with my face and eyes beat like this?"—I did not go out to her—I got up in the morning, and began making my bed, as I thought it would help her—I had done so the morning before—the prisoner, who was down stairs, called "Dad"—I did not answer—he said again "Dad"—I said "Yes"—he said "Come down; Martha is down here, and I cannot get her up; I have been trying to get her up, but she is so heavy"—I found her on the floor, with her head twisted round—I put my arm round her neck, took her right hand, and said "Martha, my dear child," but she never answered me; there was no sense at all in her—the prisoner and I managed to take her up stairs—I said "We must have a female in"—he said "We will have no female here"—I took her by the feet and he by the head, and we got her up stairs, and laid her on the bed where I had slept, and went for a doctor, who came—I was there, and the prisoner was down stairs—a piece of skin was off by the deceased's nose, and another piece, I believe, off her forehead, near one eye; and on her cheek the skin was broken—there seemed to be a big knot in her throat, like a hen's egg—I felt it, but could not move it—on her collar-bone, her neck had turned dark, as if she had been squeezed, or had a blow, and it kept turning dark all round here—I heard nothing going on in the night before I heard her complain about her eyes—nobody was in the house but us three—I cannot say whether the prisoner had taken any drink or not—he knew what I was saying.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, of 14, Tyndale Place, Islington—on Sunday morning, 30th July, I was called to the prisoner's house about 10 o'clock, and saw the prisoner—he said "It is all over, she is dead"—I asked him to show me the body—I went up stairs, and found her laid out in bed—her face was one mass of bruises, from the head down to the jaw—I went down stairs, and said "This is an ugly case"—the prisoner said "It is"—I afterwards received instructions from the Coroner to perform a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I found on the upper part of the chest several blue marks about the size of a sixpence, as if the part had been gripped by pressure just by the collar<lb></lb>bone—on the chest end of the right shoulder, by the collar-bone, was another bruise about the size of a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and on the upper lip, at the left side, was an abrasion nearly an inch long—the skin was broken; it was a scratch, and a little external to that was another not quite so large, and the whole of the left side of the face, extending from the lower jaw to the temple, was one mass of bruises—on reflecting the scalp I found that the bruises extended down to the bone, and there was considerable extravasa<lb></lb>tion of blood—on removing the skull cap, and exposing the brain, I found on its left hemisphere an extravasated clot of blood almost as large as the palm of my hand, and on the right side I found another much larger clot—I placed the large clot in my hand, and on rough calculation it would weigh from 2oz. to 3oz.; the clot on the left side was thinner, about the thick<lb></lb>ness of a penny piece, but it was more extravasated—at the base of the brain I found another clot, much smaller, lying midway between the upper part of the spinal marrow, and the base of the brain—it was about the size of a filbert—the left temporal muscle was one bruised mass, pulpy, but the opposite muscle was perfectly healthy—the cause of death was effusion of blood, producing pressure on the brain, which must have been produced by a series of falls, or a series of blows—the bruises must have been produced from the same cause—the whole of the left side of the face was a series of bruises—they would not have been caused by one heavy fall, and besides that the condition of the temporal muscle was such that it must have re<lb></lb>ceived a series of blows—it was in a soft, pulpy condition—the fist is the very instrument which would produce those bruises—it must have been an instrument of a yielding kind, because there was no external sore.</p>

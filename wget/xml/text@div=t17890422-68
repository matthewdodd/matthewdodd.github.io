               <p>Did any body beat their breasts? - We had not been amusing ourselves in laughing at the people at chapel; we had been in the chapel about half an hour; I am a churchman, we did not insult them; we were going that way, and I hope there is no harm in going in.</p>
               <p>This robbery was done in the face of all the world? - It was in the publick street, there were not a great many people at the door at that time, there were some.</p>
               <p>How happened it you did not immediately seize this man? - Because we were desired not to seize him; we thought it best to fetch a constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. James Gardner, at Camber<lb></lb>well—on the 10th of Jan., about four o'clock, I saw his five ducks safe in a pen—I went the next morning a little after seven o'clock, and there was only one duck—I observed some footmarks close up to the place where the ducks were, and in the pen—some shoes were examined in my presence by putting the shoes in the tracks in a new piece of ground—I looked at the tracks first and at the shoes, and they corresponded exactly—nothing could be more exact—these are the two pairs of shoes—we compared them three days afterwards, but there had been no wet—the marks were quite fresh.</p>

I got these two pairs of shoes from the two prisoners on the morning of the 15th of Jan.—I compared them with the marks in Mr. Gardner's garden—I examined, as far as my eye could, the traces of the foot-marks from the pen to the garden, and to the best of my belief they were the same.</p>

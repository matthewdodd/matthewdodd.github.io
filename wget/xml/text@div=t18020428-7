               <p>FRANCIS CLARKE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Where do you live? - A. At Stainesmoor, about three miles from the King's-arms public-house, at Colnbrook, which is kept by one Hummerston, the brother of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What day were you robbed? - A. On Thursday night, the 28th of January; the prisoner lived with his brother, and I was taking some money of John Stevenson, at the King's-arms.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get there? - A.Between six and seven o'clock, and staid till after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I had been drinking a little, but not to hurt me; as I was going home from there, down <placeName id="t18020428-7-crimeloc35">Colnbrook-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, know either or all of them? - A. I knew the prisoner, for he saw me put the money into my pocket, and he called a man up to help him, saying, it was a twenty pound job.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it? - A.Rather darkish; next day I said, three thieves had robbed me, to my family, and that Hummerston was one of the gang, but only said so to my family, who are not here; having lost two horses, and my cattle dying, I made no enquiry about it, as I could not afford expence; I was sent for to the Justices, and the prisoner was brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you were sober enough to know him? - A. I don't know all the people that were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280006"></xptr>there, but he was peeping in at the door, and saw me put the money into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You had been drinking? - A. Yes, a little hot-pot, which is been and gin.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the prisoner lived with his brother, yet you did not go to any constable or Justice? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a month between the time you were robbed and when he was taken up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Aldridge, and what you said to him? - A. Yes; I said, I had been robbed by some of Hummerstone's gang, disguised in light-horseman's jackets, but I won't say whether I told him two or three, nor can I say whether I saw him that night, but think I did, and told him I had been robbed by three men.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark? - A.Darkish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you everhear there was forty pounds reward, as you have told us you were low in money? - A. Yes; but I don't do it for the sake of that, it is done to break up the gang.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever charge Stevenson with robbing you? - A. No; I said he kept me dilly daily so long getting change, or it would not have happened.</p>
               <p>JOHN STEVENSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Where do you live? - A. At Colnbrook: On the 28th of January, I met Francis Clarke, at Hummerston's, at Cotnbrook, the brother of the prisoner, about nine o'clock, and paid him three pounds nine shillings and sixpence; I never saw the prisoner in the room at any time, the prosecutor was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he was not there, or, that you did not observe him? - A. He was not there till after I had paid him the three pounds nine shillings and sixpence, and called

               <p>Q. When you first saw him, what condition was he in? - A. He came and set down, giving himself a thing, and I saw the sweat running down his face; but, before he came in, Thomas said, I will shew you my sow and pigs, and my calf, which he did; and while I was looking at the calf, says he, I have a hen's' nest on that truss of straw, which there was; then, when we went back, and Robert came in, Thomas says, d - n your blood, where have you been whoring about to? says Robert, I have been laying on a truss of straw in the calfstall; says I, Bob, that's a lie, for I have been looking at the calf, and, more than that, your brother has been looking at the hen's nest in the straw; then, says he, I have been lying under the horse's manger; says I, that is a lie too, for I have been looking into the horse's mouth to see how old he is; then, says he, d - n my blood, I have been where I like.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Where do you live? - A. At Horton, by Colnbrook; I saw Clarke on the night he said he had been robbed, and he told me he had been robbed by two light horsemen; it was very dark, and I did not know him till they brought a light, then I said, Mr. Clarke, it is you, don't you know me? he said, no, thought he used to know me very well, but he seemed to be very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he say there were only two present at the robbery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Did he appear to be wet at the time? - A. Yes, and he had lost his hat, his horse, and his money.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a good deal confused? - A. Yes, he looked so, and being in liquor, I could not understand him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether it was in consequence of liquor or a blow? - A. No; he told me two light horsemen knocked him off his horse into a ditch; he did not mension any thing about their clothes, or any gang, or did he tell me he had been receiving any money at Hummerston's.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18020428-7-verdict36" type="verdictDescription">

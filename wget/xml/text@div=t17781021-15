I lent her seventeen shillings upon it, not knowing it was stolen.</p>

The prosecutor said, if you have got it, for God's sake give it me! I will go home to my wife. I never had the the watch, nor know nothing about it.</p>

               <p>To the prosecutor. Can you recollect your having looked at your watch any time that evening? - Yes; going over Smithfield I did, and it then wanted about three minutes to nine; that was not five minutes before I lost it.</p>

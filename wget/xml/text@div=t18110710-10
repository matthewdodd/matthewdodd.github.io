            . On the 28th of June I was sent for to Mr. Carter's house, and there the prisoner was in the parlour. He was porter and warehouseman to Mr. Carter Mr. Carter asked the prisoner how much he had robbed him off; Mr. Carter said he supposed he had stolen a hundred pounds worth of property; the prisoner said he had not robbed him to that amount. He asked him to what amount he had robbed him; the prisoner replied, he supposed about fifty pounds. Why, said Mr. Carter, what have you done with the money. He said that part of it was in the drawer at home, in his house; Mr. Carter asked him what he took out yesterday, he replied two pair of breeches, and he carried them out in the crown of his hat, and that they were then at his house. He then begged for mercy, and said his house was in Merman-street, Commercial-road, and if Mr. Carter would forgive him he would sell all his property, and make restoration. I went to Merman-street, and there I found the other prisoner, his wife I asked her for the breeches that her husband brought home, she denied any knowledge of it. I asked her where the money was that she sold the last lot of things for to the jew Phillips, she denied any knowledge of that. I told her I must search the premises, and began to do so; she then said to Mr. Carter, she hoped he would be merciful, the things were in the other room; she went with us into the other room, and opened a box, and said the breeches were in the box, in that box I found the two pair of breeches, and in the third drawer of a chest of drawers she said I should find the money that the goods were sold for, and in a small box in that drawer I found fifteen pound in notes, and in the bottom drawer I found another pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

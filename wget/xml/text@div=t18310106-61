On the morning of the 28th of December, in consequence of what I had heard, I fetched a Police-officer, and found in my house a man who belonged to Mr. Gregory, and a carpet - I had had some dispute about the carpet, and I desired the two men who were there with it, to put the carpet out; I saw a Policeman there at the time - the prisoner, who was one of the men, put the carpet out; I then had occasion to leave home, and upon further consideration I agreed to pay Mr. Gregory for the carpet; I returned home the second time, and then found the carpet at my door, but I did not see the prisoner there - when he took out the carpet at first, he received 1s., by my orders; I did not give it him myself - the carpet was afterwards lost - it was worth more than 10l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the prisoner very unwilling to put it out? A. Not at all, he volunteered to take it out; he had no business there - he said, "If you will pay me I will put it out;" he took it out about three yards, I should think; he said, "If you will allow me I will take it out;" I had asked the Policemen to take it up, and they both declined - I did not make the least row about it; I have heard that my wife asked the prisoner for his address, and that he gave it - I have reason to believe, from inquiry, that it was a true address,</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time was it you saw it last safe? A. About twelve o'clock; when I saw the prisoner at my house, I asked him what brought him there - he said, "I came with the Policeman - he knows me very well;" I think it very important to state the place the carpet was left in; I live in the very interior of the Cloisters, and the place the carpet was put in is very remote - there are no less than four turnings, through dark passages, to get at it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went to the Little Cloisters on the 28th of December, about eleven o'clock - the prisoner went with me; I had known him by sight - when I got to the prosecutor's house, I found the man there who had brought the carpet; he was insisting upon leaving it - Mr. Connell came soon afterwards - he ordered me to turn the man and the carpet out of the house; I said I would turn the man who brought it out if he required it - I ordered the man to go out, and he did; the prisoner said he would put the carpet out if Mr. Connell would pay him for it - he had come up to me as I was going along, and said it was a fine day; he had a letter in his hand, and I thought he was going to Mr. Connell, or to some gentleman in the Cloisters, with it - he walked on with me; it was just after I had met with him - I was called by a little boy; I did not then know what I was wanted for; I saw the prisoner again about an hour afterwards, which I think was about twelve o'clock - I met him in Tothill-street; he said to me "I think this job will come to a law-suit - I think we shall have to be on the trial;" I told him I did not know any thing about it - he said, "What a joke it would be if any one were to go and steal that carpet;" I told him I thought it would be a rum place for any body to go and find a carpet - he said there were plenty in Westminster would not mind doing that, he knew.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the prisoner had been with you? A. Yes - I found the man with the carpet, Mrs. Connell and the servant; Mr. Connell came in about ten minutes - I knew the prisoner before, and often spoke to him when I passed him; I went away and left the prisoner there, and Mr. Connell went away - the prisoner and I were there about ten minutes; he had a letter in his hand, and I expected he was going to carry it there; I did not ask him to go with me - the prisoner had three examinations - I do not know of any other person being taken on this charge.</p>

            . I am ten years of age - I sometimes go to church; I live at No. 22, Princes-street, Westminster. On the 28th of December I saw the prisoner in Dean's-yard, in the Little Cloisters, about four o'clock in the afternoon - I went to Mr. Connell's house to take some bread, and rang the bell; the prisoner and another man were about ten yards from the door, and when I rang the bell they walked away; I saw a carpet at that time -I turned to go to Mr. Preston's, in Little Dean's-yard, and I saw the prisoner and the other man again - the other man bad the carpet then; I had looked at the carpet I saw near Mr. Connell's door, and that which I saw the man (who was with the prisoner) carrying, appeared to me to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near Mr. Connell's door was the carpet? A. About three yards from it; the place is a little light - it is not a place right open; there are houses in the Cloisters: I did not speak to the prisoner - he had knee breeches on, but I did not notice the colour of them; he had a velveteen faced waistcoat and sleeves - I did not notice the colour of them; it is common among the working classes in Westminster to wear waistcoats with sleeves - I cannot tell whether he had a black handkerchief or a cravat on; I did not notice the dress of the other man - it was getting rather darkish.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you saw the prisoner twice?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060033"></xptr>A. Yes - he was dressed in the same manner on both occasions; I had seen him about before - I am quite clear he is the man.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I received information, and went to the Cock public-house - I saw the prisoner there, and took him; I told him what he was charged with - he owned to being there at eleven o'clock, but denied being there afterwards; he told me he had written his address and given it to Mr. Connell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not in consequence of the direction he left in the house that you found his lodging? A. Yes - I did not find any thing there: I found on him three shillings, one halfpenny, and a duplicate of a handkerchief pawned in June - I took him on the same day, about twenty minutes before five o'clock; I had known him for twenty years - he has been in better circumstances, and had several hackney coaches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I deny being near the premises at all after the gentleman gave me the shilling; I heard the lady say, "I dare say there will be a law-suit about this - will you leave your direction?" which I did, at Strutton-ground, or else at the Cock, where I go to get a job - I have a wife now confined, and five children; I had not been home the whole of the day.</p>

            . I keep the Cock public-house, in Tothill-street. I have known the prisoner about three years - I remember the day he was taken, when the officer came and called him out; he had been at my house about one o'clock - he then left, and was away about two hours; he was in my house again about three o'clock, and remained there the whole of the time, for at least an hour - he comes to my house to drink a pint of porter, or to get jobs from me or some of my neighbours: after he came to my house at three o'clock I had occasion to go to my bed-room, and was there about ten minutes - I left him in the tap-room when I went away, and found him there when I came back; I consider he was nothing short of an hour in my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What reason have you for saying he came at three o'clock? A. From the time I took my dinner I think it was about three - I have a clock, and am often in the habit of looking at it; I had no particular reason for marking the hour: I do not know where the Cloisters are, but the Abbey is at the end of my street, I should think not short of two hundred yards from my house - I am not aware that he left my tap-room, from the time I came down from my bed-room till serjeant Paine took him out of my house, which I think was half-past four o'clock; I was in my bar, and occasionally went into the tap-room - I have no reason to think he went out, but I cannot swear he did not; there were other persons in the tap-room - I think I could walk to the Abbey in about eight minutes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was he in your house at four o'clock? A. I should consider he was in my house at least an hour before I went up stairs, and he was taken about half-past four.</p>
               <p>COURT to WILLIAM DAY. Q. How were the men walking? A. Pretty fast, Sir - I did not see them long in Little Dean's-yard; only about a minute - that was about four o'clock, almost directly after I had seen them in the Cloisters; I think it was about four - I went home directly.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 38.</p>

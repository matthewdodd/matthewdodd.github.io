               <p>HENRY WADE sworn. - I am a watchman belonging to St. James's parish; between the hours of twelve and one o'clock, I stopped the prisoner, near Hopkins-street, Golden-square, with the property upon his shoulder, I asked him where he had brought it from, he told me, from Oxford-market; I told him, if he would not satisfy me, he must go to the watch-house, and give a better account of it; at the top of Greene's-court, just facing Brewer's-street, he threw it down, and said, he would not carry it any further; I saw another of my brother watchmen, and called him to take charge of the prisoner, I took up the mutton, and carried it to the watch-house, I saw the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140056"></xptr>at the watch-house about nine o'clock the next morning, and he claimed the mutton.</p>
               <p>- JOLLY sworn. - I work for Mr. Barnes; I dressed the sheep, I saw it just as the watchman went twelve o'clock, I was called in to supper, and when I came out again, the sheep was gone, I went in, and told my master the sheep was stolen; I saw the sheep the next day, I know it from a hundred, for when I cut it down, the fat fell, and let the kidneys down, and it was skewered up, and the skewer was in it exactly as I skewered it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was coming down Carnaby-street, there was a man dressed in a striped jacket, and white apron, he had got this sheep upon his back; as I was passing him, he said, butcher, if you will take this sheep to Compton-street, I will give you a shilling, I took the sheep, and as I was going along, the watchman stopped me with it.</p>

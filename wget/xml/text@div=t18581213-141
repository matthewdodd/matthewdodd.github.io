                  </hi>. I keep the Pier Tavern, Woolwich. On Saturday night, 27th, November, I was at home about 12 o'clock in my coffee-room up stairs with some friends—I heard the door open and Inglish came in—I told him it was a private room, and he could not be admitted there—the word was hardly uttered when I received a blow from Inglish with a stick or his fist, and directly afterwards I received a blow from Marno, who was behind him, and he repeated it several times—I got them out of the room and shut the door, but soon afterwards they returned reinforced, and with sticks, and other weapons, broke the door open and made a general attack with belts, life-preservers, and other things—I was very much hurt—I was fixed in a corner by them—while I was holding Marno I received several blows from the life-preserver, and some one called out, "Murder him!"—a number of others were in the room, and they attacked everyone there—I was smothered in blood; I had several cuts on my head and was much bruised—I had no quarrel with them before; I had not known them—they were not drunk, that I am aware of—there was such confusion I can't tell—it</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Woolwich. On that night I was going up the steps at the last witness's house about 10 minutes before 12 o'clock. I saw the prisoners going—I followed them up stairs—the waiter said they could not have anything to drink, it was time to close the doors—they pushed him on one side and got on the landing—Mr. Murry was at the coffee-room door, and he told them it was a private room; he could not admit them—they rushed forward and the serjeant struck him on the head with his hand the first time—I then saw he drew a life-preserver from behind him, and knocked him senseless on the head, and Marno rushed forward—Mr. Murry staggered back and Inglish struck him with his list—they then rushed on every one—after a little time they were got out of the room on the landing and the door was shut, and then one rushed down and set up a shout, and directly several of them returned, and they broke the coffee-room door with pots and pokers, struck everybody, and knocked the tables over and the chairs about, and broke everything.</p>

I live at 15, Marcy-road, Woolwich—I was in the coffee-room that night and saw the two prisoners come in; Mr. Murry went to the door and told the prisoners they could not be admitted there—he had no sooner uttered the words before he was struck by a soldier—I was on my legs about to leave the room, and I was struck with this instrument on the temple—I can't positively swear who it was—I saw the prisoners strike Mr. Murry.</p>

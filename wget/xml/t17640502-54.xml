               <p>In regard to Mr. Steers, he, about fourteen months ago, was tried for stealing three India bonds of an hundred pounds each; he brought people to swear he bought them of a Jew; he got discharged from it, and since that he has turned evidence, since he brought people to perjure themselves. He was an evidence last sessions against

Mr. Fielding owes me a grudge; he advertised me ten guineas reward; he once offered to allow me 50 l. a year to be one of his informers; this is the 5th time I have been here, and never nobody appeared against me before. Lloyd has been taken up for picking of pockets, and has been five weeks in the Gatehouse. I heard at the Blakeney's-head, that Sir John said, if it cost him 500 l. he would never leave me till he had transported me. I never saw one of these candles; the candles were found in Steers's house; he buys stolen goods; he proves it; last sessions he bought all the hats stolen out of Lombard-street.</p>

On the 12th of June, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I was called up, and on coming down missed the clock from the bar; it was safe overnight. Gibbs came to me in about ten minutes - I then missed all the other property stated in the indictment. The clock is worth 2 l.; I gave 6 l. 6 s. for it two years ago. The other things are of little value, and were all taken from the bar.</p>

            . On the 12th of June, at a quarter past five o'clock in the morning, I was working at my own door, at the back of Davis's premises; my brother gave me information; I looked, and saw a man coming across the garden of Hollywell Mount chapel, which I have the care of - I went to the gate; he came out; I asked what he was after there; he said he was after nothing. I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got under your arm?" he said, nothing belonging to me; I said,</p>
               <p>"Then it must belong to the chapel." I lifted up a cloth, which was a shift, and under it was a dial. He went off. I put the clock down - my brother followed, and caught him; I came up immediately, brought him back, and Gibbs told us to bring him to his house, which was done, and on his person was found two silver spoons, a phosphorus bottle and matches, the key of the clock, a knife, and a pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say whether this is the clock - A. No; I gave it to Gibbs. I lost sight of him for half a minute, but I knew him before, and am positive that he is the man. He was in the prosecutor's service twelve-months ago for eighteen months.</p>

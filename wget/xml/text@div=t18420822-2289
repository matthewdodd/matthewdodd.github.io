               <p>PHILIP SMITH COX. I am a solicitor, and live in Park-road, Regent's-park. Mr. William Corbet Smith, of Biddleswade-hall, Leicestershire, is a client of mine—I received a letter from him respecting the prisoner, and gave information at the Police-office—On Saturday, the 2nd of July, I was in<lb></lb>formed she was in custody—I went to the station and saw her—I said, "This is a bad business"—She said she had some things of Mrs. Smith's, and if I would let her go, she would give them all up on the following morning—I said I could not do that—we waited till the officer returned—I then consented that she should go till Monday morning, as the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate was not sitting, and she then returned.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 30.) On Saturday, the 2nd of July, I took the prisoner in Quebec-street, where she was lodging—I asked her name—She said, "Cameron"—I said I wanted to speak to her, I thought I had something that would suit her—I was in plain clothes—we walked round into Berkeley-street—I then told her I was a constable, and must take her into custody—She said, "Oh dear, what for?"—I said, "For robbing Mrs. Smith"—She said, "Of what?"—I said, "Articles of wearing-apparel"—She then wanted to go to Mrs. Mellon's—I said I could not allow her—after that it came on to rain—She wanted to go into a public-house to have some beer—I said I could not allow her—I took her to the station—I asked if she had got the keys of her box—She said, "Yes"—after hesitating a moment, she gave them to me—She told mo correctly where her boxes were—She said there was an old flannel dressing-gown in the box, I was to bring it with me—I went to her lodgings, and in the back room, first-floor, I found a box—I opened it with one of the keys, brought the whole of the contents to the station, and put them on the table in her presence—I told her where I got them from—she said some of the articles were hers, and did not belong to Mrs. Smith—She selected one towel that she said was hers—I stopped her with that, and said, "No, there is Mrs. Smith's mark on it"—She selected a good many things—she said she took the dressing-gown by mistake—I released her from custody till the Monday morning, when she appeared, and was committed—these are the articles—here are some pieces of ribbon.</p>

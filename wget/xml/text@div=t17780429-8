Bill, I believe her brains are out; upon which I said several times, what is that you say? to which he made no answer; I then got down and helped to break open the door, and then all the people came in; we saw the deceased lying in the middle of the stable; the women carried her to the hospital afterwards; and she died the next morning; I talked with Howse about it early in the morning; he said that they were both in liquor; that he went to lift her off the tub, and they sell down together; and that she hurt herself against a flint stone, by falling over his shoulder. After that I told him she was dead! he fetched a sigh and said, Lord Jesus Christ what have I done; I must suffer for it: but I was wrong informed, for she was not then dead.</p>

He bid Freeman break the door open, and let in the whores to see how she lay in the straw.

             was murthering Peg Lane: we went down the court directly, but we could not hear any noise at all; upon which we went to our own lodgings, and then I heard the deceased make a great shriek; we went to the stable; the prisoner would not open the door to us.</p>

               <p>Did you hear the prisoner make use of any expressions? - I heard him d - n his eyes!</p>

               <p>Did you hear him say any thing more about her? - Not till he put the fork through the place to break open the door; then the prisoner said, here take the fork and let the bloody mares come in and see whether she is dead or not. When the stable door was broke open, she lay in her gore; we washed her and her brains were boiling out of her head like the scum of a pot.</p>

               <p>Did you hear him say any thing with respect to the manner of her death? - I heard him say that night in the stable, that she sell off the tub.</p>

               <p>You are the coroner who held the inquisition upon the body of the deceased? - I am.</p>

               <p>Is Mr. Hunter the surgeon here? - No; he is appointed surgeon to a man of war, and is gone abroad; he told me before he went, that Mr. Hawkins, one of the surgeons to the hospital, had examined the wound: Mr. Hawkins was subpaened to attend before the Grand Jury at Hicks's-Hall, as I understand by the father of the deceased; but Mr. Hawkins did not attend.</p>

               <p>Court. Mr. Hawkins, not Mr. Caesar Hawkins? - No, Mr.

            , his son. I called upon Mr. Hawkins, and told him that this court would require his attendance here. Mr. Hawkins said it was not his business to attend, but the business of the house surgeon, who always attended upon these occasions.</p>

               <p>You saw the head of the deceased I suppose when you held your inquisition? - I did.</p>

               <p>What did you observe? - A small wound; the scull was fractured.</p>

               <p>Did it appear as if broke with a sharp or a blunt instrument? - It appeared to me to have been done with a sharp instrument.</p>

               <p>The prisoner has declared that the wound was occasioned by the deceased's falling upon a sharp flint; was it such a wound as might be occasioned by falling upon a sharp flint? - I cannot say; the skull was violently factured, and was quite open, so that the brain came out.</p>

               <p>Did the wound run length-ways or round? - Round, about as big as a shilling I should suppose.</p>

               <p>I was drinking with Margaret Lane; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290015"></xptr> was a girl I had lived with between three and four years; she wanted to go up into the hay loft to lie; I listed her up into the hay loft, there was neither hay nor straw there; I would make her go down, because there was clean straw in the stable, and two sacks; she was not agreeable to go down into the stable, because if my master should come in the morning and should see her, she was afraid that it would come to my wife's ears, because she had got a warrant for her before to send her to Bridewell for cohabiting with me. I said she should come down, and hit her several times with my open hand: she said, pray don't lick me, pray don't lick me, and I will go down. I listed her then upon the butt, there is another butt near it; she over swayed me, and I fell with my knees in the other tub, and dashed her down with her head upon the stones with all my weight upon her; she cried out, O Lord! I helped her up, and she never spoke afterwards. I had been beating her in the lost; they heard her; I was taking her into the stable when they went to call the people at the alehouse; they listed her on the straw;

             came to the door, and asked what was the matter; I made answer, nothing; but she and I had had some words, and I had let her fall; Davy said, we will break the door open; I said, no, I believed she was very well. She spewed all over me; I asked Turner for a light, he said, he would not give a light for fear we should burn the stable; for a stable in the neighbourhood had been lately set on fire. I found her head wet; I said, Freeman bring a light; a light was brought me by him or Turner. Freeman got up into the loft again; I was looking to see whether her head was cut; the wick of the candle was but a little bit, the tallow was broke off the wick, and it slipt through my fingers and went out; and upon that I called out to Freeman, for God's sake come in with a light, for I believe her brains are out!</p>

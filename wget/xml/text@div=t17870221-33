            , Esq; of Harley-street, No. 9; I have lived with him above these two years; on Friday was a week, the 16th of February, the prisoner came to my master's stables.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before this time? - Yes, I had seen him in company with Newman when he bought the mare, about a week or ten days before that; he came to <placeName id="t17870221-33-crimeloc176">Charlotte-mews, West</placeName>

               <p>Whereabouts? - It was just going into the gateway, not quite in, but just going in; he said, come in young man, and I will pay you.</p>
               <p>What did he do with the horse? - I do not know, he took hold of the bridle, and gave it to the boy; he said come in, and I will pay you, and I followed him into a back room, and he called for sixpennyworth of brandy and water, and said, sit down my man, I will pay you directly; he asked me if I was hungry, if I would have a bit of bread and butter; I said no, I was not hungry; he said he was very hungry, he had been walking about all day, he would go out and get a plate of bread and butter; he went out for that purpose, but never returned.</p>
               <p>Did he produce any money to you in the room? - No.</p>
               <p>He talked of paying you? - Yes, he said several times over he would pay me, and desired I would sit down; I never saw him afterwards till we took him.</p>
               <p>How long did you wait for him in the room? - Four or five minutes as nigh as I can guess; I then asked in the house if he was there, and they said no; I then went into the yard; I did not find him, nor the horse there; I went into almost all the stables, and there was no such horse there; then I went to Newman's house to enquire for this man; I found the horse the next morning; I saw him coming out of Mr. Newman's stable, between six and seven.</p>
               <p>How far is Newman's from the Golden-horse? - It is within a mile.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210076"></xptr>Jury. It is rather better than a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Foulger. Newman was upon the horse; I went to Newman, and took hold of the bridle, and said the horse must not go till he was paid for, for that I had sold him over night to a man, and he had not paid me; he asked me what I meant, and I told him the whole story; Newman refused to let me have him; he rode off with him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that horse you saw with Newman upon it, was your master's horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a bay gelding? - Yes, it was cropped; my master has had him about a year and a half in my care; I knew him by having him so long under my care.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing else by which you can distinguish him? - No, there is no particular marks that I remember, only his colour, and being cropped, and having known him so long; I went to Newman's to enquire for the prisoner, because I had seen him with Newman before.</p>
               <p>How long before had you seen him with the prisoner? - About a week or ten days.</p>
               <p>Was the horse brought out to you, or did you see him by chance; - I saw Newman come out upon him; I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find the prisoner afterwards? - Yes, we took him the Sunday following; I was present when he was taken; he was taken at a public house, near Shepherd's-market.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I do not recollect saying any thing to him particular; I told the constable that was the man; I did not mention the horse to him.</p>
               <p>Was he given into custody without any conversation about the horse at all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with the prisoner about it? - No, he said when he got to the watch-house, that he should not have deceived me, if the other had not deceived him.</p>
               <p>Tell me the whole conversation? - He said he should not have deceived me, if he had not been deceived by George; by that I understood Newman, I knew his name to be George; the prisoner told me not to be frightened, for he knew how to do business.</p>
               <p>What did he mean by that; I do not know; that was what passed, I recollect them words.</p>
               <p>Was that the expression, that he knew how to do business? - Yes; I said to him at the public house, I suppose you know me; I unbuttoned my coat to shew him my livery, that I was the same person; he said nothing to that; when I first went in, I did not exactly know him.</p>
               <p>Were there many people in the room? - Yes, there were several people in the room.</p>
               <p>How came you to know him afterwards? - He came into the room where I was with the constable.</p>
               <p>Did you see him in the first room? - Yes, I saw him, and I said I thought it was he; I was not positive of him when I first saw him, but I thought it was him.</p>
               <p>Do you think the prisoner saw you in the first room? - Yes, I am sure he saw me, but whether he knew me or not, I do not know; when he came into the second room, I knew him directly; he did not attempt to go away at all.</p>
               <p>What may the value of this bay gelding be? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What do you believe to be the value of it? - I cannot exactly tell, I am no great judge of horses.</p>
               <p>What would you give for him? - We gave ten pounds, or ten guineas, I cannot say; my master said ten guineas, but I think it was only ten pounds; I know he gave ten pounds; I am sure he gave ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had not you the money tendered down to you? - No, I never received a a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he shew you any money? - No, I never saw any money.</p>
               <p>Did he offer to pay for the horse? - No, he said he would pay me, he did not make me any tender.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210077"></xptr>Prisoner. Whether he had not ten guineas tendered down in the watch-house? - No.</p>
               <p>Not by any body? - No; Newman put ten guineas down to go out with the constable and me to find Robinson; he left it in the keeper's hands; this was before the prisoner was brought in; the prisoner was not present in the watch-house then.</p>
               <p>Did the keeper take that security? - Yes, he took it for a few minutes, and returned it again, as Newman did not go to look for Robinson, but gave us directions where to go for him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He put it down to pay for the horse, and they wanted a guinea a piece, did not you ask us for a guinea piece that we might both be at liberty? - No, I am sure it was not so.</p>
               <p>Did not he offer you half a guinea a piece? - No.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I am an officer in Mary-le-bone; the last witness came to me on Sunday morning to serve a warrant on Newman; I went with him to Newman's house, where he lives, and found him in his own apartments, with his wife; Foulger went in first, I followed him close; the prisoner was not there; I took Newman into custody, and saw no horse; on Sunday night I took the prisoner at the Griffin, in Half-moon-street, near Shepherd's-market; the coachman was with me when we went into the house; there was a lamp, or a light that hung up high, and there were several gentlemen sitting in the box: and the coachman hits me on the elbow, says he, I think that is the man that stands there, so, and so; I believe the prisoner saw the coachman, for reasons that I have; we were going into the other room; the coachman went in; I looked round and saw them moving; I stepped forwards to the door, as they were just going; the prisoner came into the second room where the coachman was; I asked him to step into that room with me; I told him, if you will step into this room with me, I will tell you my business; he said, yes, with all his heart, or something to that meaning; and he came into the room with me; talking a little while before the coachman; at last he says, that is the man, that is your prisoner; says I, my friend, you must go along with me, I have got a warrant for you, and he begged me not to say any thing about it, but put up my staff, and he would go with me very peaceable and quiet; I took him in a coach to Mary-le-bone watch-house; Newman I took in the morning first, about twelve; this prisoner I took in the evening between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You did not take Mr. Newman out in the back place of the watch-house, and ask him for a guinea a-piece? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you go out with Newman at all? - I do not know whether I took him out at all; he put down ten guineas in the watch-house keeper's hands, for security for his return, to go with the coachman and me to find the prisoner.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I went to Mr. Mannington's stables, and bought the horse of the coachman, for ten pounds, ten shillings; I told him to bring it to the Golden Horse, and I would pay him for it: when I came to the Golden Horse, he brought the horse there, and delivered him to me; and I told him we would go in, and I would pay him for it; I called for sixpenny-worth of brandy and water; my friend was not there that was to meet me with the money; I told him to sit down, and asked him if he would have a bit of bread and butter, or any thing to eat, for I would go and fetch the money; I went up to Newman's stables, to see if he was at home, and he was not; then I went down to Shepherd's market, to Mr. Belton's, to ask him for the money to pay for it; by the time I got there and back again, this coachman had been to Mr. Newman's stables asking if the horse had come there; that was the same evening, about a few minutes after I had left him; I did not know where Mr. Mannington's house was; I knew where the stables were, but I could not find the groom that evening; Mr. Newman met me at the White-house in South Audley-street;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210079"></xptr>I told him he was not at home and I could not advance the money; he said, very well, he would advance the money in the morning; I staid there and drank two pints of beer, and we went down to Mr. Belton's, in Shepherd's market, and I sold the horse immediately to Mr. Newman for nine guineas, to pay for it, least the coachman should think I wanted to defraud him.</p>

               <p>I am a green-grocer in Shepherd's market; I have lived in the neighbourhood about ten years; I have known the prisoner about ten months, buying horses, and selling them again; on Friday evening the 16th, the prisoner and Newman came to me, and asked me to have something to drink; we went to Mr. Johnson's, the Griffin, in Half-moon-street, and had about three pots of beer; and after we had been there, Newman told Robinson, he had bought the horse too dear, saying the horse was a beggar, and quite out of condition; Robinson says, George, you are a better judge of a horse than me, what will you give me for it? says George, he is not worth more than eight or nine guineas at the farthest; and Robinson asked Newman if he would give him nine guineas for it, as he had not paid for him; for he wished to make the money good to the coachman in the morning.</p>
               <p>Were there many people in the room at this time? - Only Robinson, me, and Newman, and the people of the house frequently backwards and forwards in the same room; it was a public kitchen; I have at different times advanced a little money for Robinson, and always found him honest; I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called another witness to his character.</p>

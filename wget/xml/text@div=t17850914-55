               <p>I was at Mr. Thompson's on the 3d of August, and the prisoner came and asked for a catalogue, I gave him one, he went up stairs and then down into the kitchen again, I thought he had something in his pocket, I desired my fellow servant to look after him, I went into the kitchen, and missed three candlesticks that were below; I went after the prisoner, and met him in Oxford-road, I brought him back, and these are the candlesticks he took out of his pocket; I only found two, they were in the kitchen before; I took him to my master, he asked my master to forgive him, he told him it was the first time.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe these candlesticks to be mine, I will not swear to them, they had this label on them, No. 2, Lt. 7, which agrees with the catalogue.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went into the house, and went down into the kitchen, and the prosecutor followed me, and took me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

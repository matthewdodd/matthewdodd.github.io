That the Prisoner waited for his coming back in St. Paul's Church Yard, and when he had delivered the Message Mr. Needbam had sent, ordered him to go back for the Letter, saying he should not have left it, for it was in the Nature of a Bills he went again to Mr. Needbam for the Letter but he would not give it him; which when he told the Prisoner, he took him to an Alehouse in the Old Change, and there wrote another Letter and sent him with it to Mr. Needbam, which he give him again, but would not deliver the first . The Letter was produced in Court, and Mr. Needbam deposed it was the same the Porter delivered him, and confirm'd what he had said relating to his going to and fro about the Letter. Mr. Needbam's Servant went down the Old Change to the Alehouse to see if he knew the Prisoner, and he and the Porter were both sure the Prisoner at the Bar was the same Person. Collonel Paget deposed the Letter was not of his writing, but believed it might be the Prisoner's Hand, who had lived with him a Year and half; but finding him an ill Servant he had turn'd him off. The Prisoner denyed the Fact, and called Collonel Paget to prove that he had interested him with 500 l. but the Col contradicted him. He also called some others who deposed that he behaved himself very honestly, and always spoke respectfully of Col.

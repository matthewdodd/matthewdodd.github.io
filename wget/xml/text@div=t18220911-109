I left the house about half-past two o'clock, on the 21st of July, leaving nobody there. I caused the front shutters to be closed, and locked the door. I cannot say whether the back door was shut - when I returned it was nearly dark; I found the house had been entered. If the back door was open, they might have got in that way. I missed the property mentioned in the indictment, worth about 30 s.; the prisoners were apprehended next day, and the property found.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoners on the 22d of July, in King-street, Islington, and on James Nicholas Moores I found this property in a a bundle under his arm. I found nothing on the other; they were both coming up the street - I first stopped

I said it was strange; he said his master did not always tell him when he sent him out with a bundle what it was; that his name was Nicholas, and he lived at Islington - and was going to his father with the bundle. James had gone on, and came back and asked what was the matter. I said I had stopped the boy to know what he had got; he said, he did not know. James said,</p>
               <p>"Nor does he know". I said,</p>
               <p>"Is the bundle yours;" he said it was; I said,</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to say, that the property in that bundle is yours;" he said it was - and that he would not have it opened in the street, and wanted me to go to his house. I went a little way with him - he said he was a smuggler, and that the bundle contained silks. I said, I must be satisfied what he had got - he refused; I said, I must be satisfied, or I should take him to the office. I told Woolham and another who were with me, to take the prisoner with the bundle to the watch-house; he refused to give it up, fell on the ground, and began kicking. We at last got them both to the office.</p>

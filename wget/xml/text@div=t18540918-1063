                  </hi>. In 1849 and 1850, I was living in the service of Mr. Hendry, at Leyton, in Essex—the prisoner was living there as coachman, for about five months—he came, I believe, in 1849, and did not leave till 1850—he represented himself as a single man, and paid his addresses to me—I left Mr. Hendry's service in the spring of 1850, and went to reside with my father for some time at Tottenham—the prisoner still continued his attentions to me there—I made some shirts for him, and lent him a sovereign—he told me that he would pay me for making the shirts, and I fully expected that he would do so, but he did not—I remained with my father it may have been two months, and the prisoner ceased to visit me—I did not know where to find him after he had got the shirts—I then went into the service of a gentleman named Heath, at Tottenham, for about nine months, but I did not say anything about that to the prisoner—I did not know where to find him; I sent him a letter or two by a friend to be for<lb></lb>warded,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180136"></xptr>
               <p>but never got any answer—I then went into the service of the Duchess of Cambridge, about Nov. 1850, as still room maid—I was there about twelve months before I saw the prisoner, he called on me about Christmas, 1851, at the Duchess's house, at Kew—that was the first I had seen of him since I had made the shirts for him and lent him the sovereign—I was out when he called—I came home about 10 o'clock, and he told me he had waited two hours; very little passed, as I would not stop to speak to him; I would not have anything to say to him—he made a great many protestations that he was not as he had been represented—I told him that it would be better that he should not come to see me, as there were rumours about that he had been married, and I thought it was since I had lost sight of him—he said it was very hard that I should believe other people instead of him; but this was not on the first interview—I think he only stopped five minutes, then he wanted me to go out with him, and I would not—he called again, it might be a month afterwards, and it was then that I said I had heard that he had been married—he said it was very hard that I should believe other people before him, and he could take his oath that he was not married, and that he never had been—I told him that that was enough, and I believed him—he asked me how I was getting on, and what wages I had; I told him I was having 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week board wages—I do not think he asked me if I had any money—I had about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Bank—he continued to visit me after that, and we were married in 1852, at St. George the Martyr, Southwark, while I was with the Duchess of Cambridge; I had fourteen days' holiday—after our marriage we went down to Brighton—he said he wished me to remain in service three years as I was in a good situation, and that it would be better for us both—I told him I did not like to do that, and that it would be better if we had not married if he could not make a home—I went back to service and remained twelve months and a few days; he frequently came to see me, and wrote to me, but I destroyed the letters at his suggestion, as I received them—in Aug. 1853, I left the service of the Duchess, and lived with the prisoner; he took a beer shop at Coles-terrace, Barnsbury-row, Islington—I had told him that I found he was spending his money in dissipation, and it was quite time that he made a home, and I would not stop in service any longer—I had 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the savings bank, at Tottenham—when I left service my father drew it out for me, and gave it to the prisoner, as I could not go to Totten<lb></lb>ham—I believe there was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as there was interest—we remained at the beer shop about five months, and left because the business did not answer, and I went home to my friends again at the prisoner's suggestion; he wished me to go to service again and save as much money as I could, and then he said he would try to make another home—I went into the service of Mr. Griffiths, 28, King-street, Regent-street, and am living there now—I was there between four and five months before I found out where the prisoner was; and five or six weeks ago I heard that he was at Mr. Rice's, No. 12, Stockwell-common—I went there and saw the prisoner, he asked me how I was; I told him I wished to know why he had not answered the letters I had sent him, he told me that he did not mean to—I then asked him if he intended to allow me anything; he said, "No"—I then told him that I had heard rumours of his being married (I had heard of it since I had ceased to live with him)—I said that his conscience must tell him if it was true or not, and that if it was true, I was not his wife, but if it was not true, and I was his wife, he ought to support me in some way—he made no answer, and I told him that next day I should go to the</p>

Williams said that he was out in the street with some girls, and that a man said, "How can he be such a fool as to be romping with those girls? He knows that he can<lb></lb>not marry them, as he has got a wife already"—I believe it was after I had made the shirts for him, and lent him the sovereign, that I heard that he was married; but I will not swear it—he came to me at the Duchess of Cambridge's of his own free will—I lived there about a year and three quarters after he first came there—he afterwards obtained a situation at Mr. Dawson's, the ship builder at Limehouse, and he wished me to obtain the situation of housemaid there—I applied for it, but did not obtain it—that was before I went to Mrs. Heath's, and a few weeks after I left Mr. Hendry's—it was after I was aware that the prisoner had gone there—I was at that time living with my parents at Tottenham—I was not aware that after he left Mr. Dawson's he went to Mr. Wittin's, at Sydenham—when I renewed my acquaintance with the prisoner at the Duchess's, he had paid me the sovereign, because my father had threatened to summon him in the County Court—I did not ask him for the money for the shirts—it was not my suggestion, after I was at the Duchess of Cambridge's, to get</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fitter, of 23, Waddington Road—on the night of February 23rd, about 11.30, I went into a court in Shoreditch, to make water—a man who was in the public-house came after me—while I stood waiting for my friend he put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, where my watch was, and I put my hand on my waistcoat pocket to stop him from taking it—he ran away into the entry which I had left, and I after him—we met the prisoner, who held me against the wall, and put his hand on my mouth, while the other one, who had been in the public-house, took my purse from my trowsers pocket, containing a half-sovereign and three or four shillings—I called out, and two policemen came up—I did not lose sight of the prisoner.</p>

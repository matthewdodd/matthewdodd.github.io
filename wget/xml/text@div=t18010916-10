Yes, a person with a velveteen jacket on; I told them I had none; he then said, d-n the b-r's b-y eyes, we will have money, or somewhat else; I made answer to him, do as he pleased, and he knocked me down then; then he took a pocket-book out of my right-hand coat pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. That was eight o'clock, five hours after he had been robbed? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it you talked about the reward?- A. Never, at all.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he occupied? - A.We had been occupied in ringing on account of the new Rector, and we employed Otherly to assist us as an extra hand, as we had but very short notice; we went to the Ship public-house about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing there? - A.Drinking, and making merry.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Otherly when he went away? - A. Very much intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it cannot be true, as he has sworn, that he was not drunk at that time? - A. He must falseswear himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been altogether quite good humoured, or was there any altercation? - A. No; in the course of the evening, a little before twelve o'clock, a young man, a bricklayer, of the name of Caney, came in promiscuously, and knowing me, and others of the party, and knowing Otherly, he asked leave to spend an hour with us; a dispute arose between Otherly and him, which could chalk farthest on the floor for a wager, Caney beat Otherly, and he refused paying for it; a great many words arose, and Caney said, rather than have any words he would pay for it himself; and Otherly used very aggravating expressions, and Caney gave him a very severe blow; then Otherly threatened to take the law of him, he would not go to a common Justice, but take out a Judge's warrant; he then aggravated him to that degree that flesh and blood could not bear with it; I, and the rest of the company, told him Caney had served him just right, for aggravating the man as he had done.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Caney and Otherly in company together before that night? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You must have seen it if he had? - A. Yes; I must of course.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - A. I have known him ever since he was a boy in the charity-school, as much as twelve or fourteen years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You never were in company with him and Caney before this time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.But you may have been in the room where Caney and he have been together? - A.Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You know them both; will you swear you have not been in the tap-room, at that public-house, when both of them have been there before? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have not Otherly and Caney been in the same company, drinking with you, before? - A. Not as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Try and recollect yourself? - A. I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear they have not been in company together, at that house, before? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear they have not been in company together, at that house, before? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you undertake to swear, they had not been drinking together, at that same public-house, upon another day? - A. They may, but I cannot say whether they had or not; I understood, from their discourse that night, that they had been in company together at the King and Queen, in Old Gravel-lane.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did you not understand that they had been together at that very public-house, the Ship, in company, on another day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, yourself, that they had?- A. I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Who applied to you to give your evidence here to-day? - A. I cannot say who it was; a gentleman called upon me on Monday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been to the prisoners since they have been in custody? - A. I do not know the prisoners; I saw Otherly on the morning of the 9th of June, about nine o'clock; I asked him how he got home, and he said he got home very well, but by some means, being so very much intoxicated, he had fell in the fields, and very much bedaubed himself; he did not say a single syllable about being robbed.</p>

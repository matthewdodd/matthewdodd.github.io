               <p>Did you know their persons? - I did two out of the three; it was star-light; I had never seen them before; there were lamps opposite, not on the same side of the way; I was a good deal alarmed; I saw one the next morning, and I swore to him at the office; I was sent for to go there; I knew him directly; it is the furthest off, Wiltshire.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you was so much mistress of yourself as to observe him? - I was; he did not take the bundle; he stood with the pistol at my right-hand, opposite; he put the mouth of the pistol to my cheek, it touched it.</p>
               <p>You was very much alarmed? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you see the face of the other? - I did; it was Gillthorpe, I am sure; he took the bundle; he was close to me.</p>
               <p>How long did this last? - Not above ten minutes; I begged for them not to take my bundle; they swore they would have it; I don't know justly who it was: after they had taken my bundle, I went into the Rose and Crown, at the bottom of the road, and gave an alarm that I had been robbed, and described the men; when somebody went to the office, and gave the information immediately, and I went to the office the next morning; they were dressed the same as on the night before; I had never seen them before that night; they took nothing more than the bundle, and the cloaks; they did not offer to search my pockets.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Counsel for Wiltshire. You have told us very fairly that you had never seen the people before; and that you was, as every body in your circumstances must have been, very much alarmed? - I was.</p>
               <p>Before you went to the office, you had been apprised that the officers had taken somebody that was suspected? - I was.</p>
               <p>Gillthorpe's Counsel. When was it you saw Gillthorpe after the robbery? - A fortnight and a day.</p>
               <p>You said you had never seen the prisoners before; Gillthorpe was not taken up by your description, I believe? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>You saw him in custody, but not taken up by your description? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>It was a very dark night, I believe? - Not very dark.</p>
               <p>There was no moon? - It was star-light, and there was a lamp opposite; I am very sure they are the men.</p>
               <p>You was very much frightened, you have said? - I was not frightened before the pistol came; but, by being stopped twice, I had an opportunity of looking at them more.</p>

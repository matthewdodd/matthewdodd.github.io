                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Crosby-row, Walworth, and occupy several adjoining houses; I am a boot and shoe manufacturer. On Thursday morning, 11th Dec., a little before 8 o'clock, I went into my warehouse, and discovered a hole in the roof—two or three rails, on which shoes had been suspended just under the hole, were broken—it appears as if the individual who got through the hole had used the rails as a ladder, as there was damp dirt on the broken rails—the warehouse communicates with my private house, by a short lobby, and is in the parish of St. Mary, Newington—I missed about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property; the most popular articles of the season, those which could be soonest converted into money—they were selected from various parts of the warehouse, which abounds with passages, and has such a multitudinous number of rails, that a stranger would have been bewildered there—the iron bar which had fastened the door next to the garden had been taken down, and the door was half open—I went into the garden, and found marks of cart wheels and horse's feet—such a vehicle had never been there before—a cart had been backed into the garden from the passage, which is behind—I had seen the door safe in the afternoon, and it was not opened afterwards—the hole was in a part of the roof, between two stacks of chimneys—one stack prevents, to a great extent, any one in the private house from seeing the hole, and the other partially covered them from any person going down the side street—the prisoner Thompson had been in my employment—he left a few weeks before—he had been in my warehouse many times, and was conversant with the shoe trade—I found in the warehouse a pair of boots covered with wet mud, similar to that which was in the garden—I saw these boots tried on Thompson, and, according to my experience, they were a good fit—the mark of the toes seemed to fit his toes very precisely—I also missed five or six over—shoe boxes—boots transferred from the warehouse to the shop for sale, receive an additional mark; the selling price is attached to each pair in plain figures, and also a figure representing the month of the year; also, a stamped letter R, and various other marks, by which I know them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a correct sketch of my premises, and of the place where the entry was made in the roof—the hole was about eighteen inches square; it would not admit a very large man.</p>

I live in Dean's row, Walworth-road, and keep a coffee stall in the road, nearly opposite the end of York-street On Thursday morning, 11th Dec, Thompson came to my stall, and had a cup of coffee—there was a female and a wooden legged man with him—the wooden legged man was not in his company—he came in first and sat down, and then Thompson and the female came in, and when Thompson bade me good night, he went across the road and down York—street—the wooden legged man got up about five minutes afterwards, and asked me what time the</p>

I was in the Kingsland-road, by the canal bridge, and saw Hyde; he crossed the road opposite to me—I said, "Halloo, Mr. Hyde! I want you for absconding from your bail;" he said, "Very well; I saw you coming, I am very glad you have got me"—I said, "Why did you go away from your bail?"—he said, "I should not have gone, but the parties who were bail for me haunted me both night and day; I could have no rest for them"—I asked him where Watts was; he said that he did not know; I have been all over London to look for him, and have not been able to find him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness, and live with him at Old Bell Yard, Westminster; we occupy a cottage inside the yard. On Friday night, 12th Dec, about 7 o'clock, or a quarter past, Johnson drove a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> into the yard—I did not see him come in, but I heard him—it was not his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, it was a man's named Banbury; but Johnson used to drive it of a night, and Banbury in the day—I did not notice what was done, because I was shut in the place—I had seen Hyde and Watts before, and I saw Watts that evening after the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came in, and saw that there was another Person there; I cannot say who it was—I lent a candle to Mr. Watts—I saw one person carrying a load across the yard, but only one; I could not discern who it was—I had the care of the key, but afterwards we gave it up to Mr. Watts—he took it to the next door, and Miss Watts brought it to me on the Saturday night—I heard my husband ask Mr., Watts on that Friday night if he should carry the bundle which they took away—I could not see what the bundle was, but I saw Mr. Watts take a bundle down the yard with another gentleman—I never saw who the other person was—I saw the man, but could not discern who it was, as the light was twenty yards from me—on Saturday morning I saw Hyde and Watts in the Bell Yard, it was about 10 o'clock when they came—I could not see what they did; I was in my own place, and they were inside this public house, but I saw them go away, and Mr. Watts had something under his arm, in a yellow handkerchief and I saw the impression of a boot in it—Hyde was not carrying anything—in the after<lb></lb>noon they were both there, and they went out of the yard under the gate-way, each with a bag on his back, with a string over the shoulder—our cottage is eighteen or twenty yards from the gateway—it was not dark; it was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and the days were very short—the key was not returned to me till late, perhaps it might be 10 o'clock at night—I have seen Johnson there since; he was there the whole of the week, up to the Saturday—the police came to me on the next Saturday—I never saw him after that.</p>

               <p>before, Watts had brought some boxes and packages to the Bell Inn; they were put in his stable by this very cowman, but he drove home in a cart—Banbury, the owner of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, stands in the same yard—he did leave, but he has come back again—since my husband has been in prison, I have received money from the police Magistrate; I think it is six or seven weeks, I cannot tell which—I received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. one week, and the other weeks 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my husband was in custody on this charge—he did not show me the boots; I never saw them till to-day—when he came out he received 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the Magistrate; he had it in his hand; he has not had anything since, I am quite sure; not a farthing.</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> The wheel marks were of a smallish cart—it might have been a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, the wheels were very narrow, and were not very wide apart.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">contended that there was no corroboration, except by Lush and his wife, which was no corroboration at all.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">sub<lb></lb>mitted, that Lush was only an accomplice as far as he was dealing with pro<lb></lb>perty recently stolen, and that the evidence he gave to exculpate himself would be evidence against the prisoners.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">considered, that as Lush had not admitted being an accomplice, the question would depend upon whether the Jury considered him so or not.</hi>)</p>

            . I am a chemist, and live in Queen-square, Westminster. On the 25th of June, about a quarter to nine o'clock at night, I was passing the prosecutor's shop; my attention was arrested by a violent crash of the plate glass window - I turned round immediately, and saw the prisoner with his hand within side the window, and in his hand, was among other things, these articles, which I took from him, bloody as they are - I grasped his hand, and they were inside his hand; his hand was, at that time, inside the pane - I drew his hand out, and they came out in his hand; he made no resistance nor attempt to escape - his hand was bloody, being cut with the window - I showed the articles to Brooke afterwards; I should say the prisoner was intoxicated at the time, and stated, his object in doing it was to be transported - it was about a quarter to nine o'clock; it was dusk - light enough to see a man's face.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I received the prisoner in custody at Brooke's shop; his hand was cut and bleeding - as I took him to the station-house, (I neither threatened nor made him any promise) he told me he run his hand through the window to get out the seals, saying, he thought he might run away with them, but as it was, he hoped he might be transported.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You told me next morning, that I said that I could have run away if I liked. Witness. No, I did not; he seemed rather sorry next morning, and wished to see Mr. Brooke - he said he was not so drunk as he appeared to be.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BROOKE. These are my articles, and were exposed for sale in my shop.</p>

All I remember is, I met a few shopmates; I was drinking with them all day, and became intoxicated - in going along, I made a stumble, and smashed the glass with my hand - I knew nothing more<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040008"></xptr>about the transaction till next morning - when I heard Green's evidence against me, I have been a bricklayer for nine years, and got my living by hard work.</p>

               <p>I put it into the post-office at Birmingham, with five other bills, in the whole, to the value of 130 l. 8 s. 6 d. on Saturday the 28th of August.</p>
               <p>How did you direct that letter? - To Messrs. Briggs and Sutton, No. 16, Garlick-hill.</p>
               <p>Was any body with you when you wrote that letter, and enclosed it? - I believe there was no person with me when I wrote the letter, but there were several people there when I enclosed the bills in the letter; I had written the letter before; the prisoner was present when I enclosed the bills.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him what you was about to do? - I told the company in general, the prisoner was one of them, that I was going to enclose some bills to my partner.</p>
               <p>This was on Saturday? - Yes; at about eleven in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>The post, I believe, departs from Birmingham on Saturday night? - I believe it does.</p>
               <p>Did you put the letter with your own hands into the post-office? - I did, and I left Birmingham, I fancy, in about half an hour after; I went to Wolverhampton that night.</p>
               <p>Did you find it necessary, your partner in London missing the bills, to order the payment to be stopped? - Yes; I did. I had sent other remittances from Shrewsbury of the receipt of which I received a letter at York from my partner, and he not mentioning in either of his letters the receipt of these bills, I wrote to my partner to stop the payment of them.</p>
               <p>When did you arrive in town? - The very day the prisoner was taken, which was the 21st, I believe, of September. I found him under examination before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Had you seen Mr. Taylor after you put the letter into the Post-Office? - I saw him first at the Hen and Chickens at Birmingham, on the 25th of August; there were a number of travellers there. I enquired who he was; Mr. Taylor himself told me he was Deputy Archdeacon of York.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - Just as he now is, like a clergyman.</p>
               <p>He had not canonicals on, had he? - No.</p>
               <p>You said you saw him the 25th and 28th, did he stay at Birmingham all that time? - On the 26th, which was the Thursday, he ordered a post-chaise, and came down, dressed in his canonical robes, and said he was going to pay a visit to the Bishop or Dean of Litchfield, I cannot say which; he went and staid the whole day, and I did not see him again till that evening. I arrived on the Wednesday, this was on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Why, a deputy archdeacon is a great character, and carries great respect; did you grow intimate with him? - Yes; on the Wednesday, the day that I arrived, I dined with him in a mixed company, and our conversation was general; in the evening some of them proposed to go to the play; I said I had no objection, and Mr. Taylor went also.</p>
               <p>You was frequently in his company? - I was.</p>
               <p>And you grew great? - Yes; he said he lived in York, and was deputy archdeacon of York.</p>
               <p>And you are a Yorkshireman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I should not have supposed so though by your credulity; did he give you his address in writing? - Yes; but that was on the Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177910200057"></xptr>And you gave him your's? - Yes; upon one of our cards.</p>
               <p>So you were to see one another if you ever came into that country? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your acquaintance continued from that time till the Saturday, till you left Birmingham? - Yes, it did.</p>
               <p>Did he mention any other particulars to you of what he was? - Nothing more than that he had been about two years in York; that he should be glad to see me when I came to York; he said he should be there before I was; I said I should esteem it kind if he would carry me a waistcoat, and a pair of breeches, with some other things I bought at Birmingham.</p>
               <p>And when you came to town you found the gentleman at the Mansion-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You said, I think, that you wrote your letter before the time you enclosed the bills? - I did.</p>
               <p>In your own room probably? - No, in that very room.</p>
               <p>But you do not recollect any body being there at the time of writing the letter? - No.</p>
               <p>That gentleman that has examined you made a little observation respecting your credulity; when you was enclosing six bills, to the amount of 130 odd pounds to your partner in town in a mixed company, what could induce you to tell them what you was about? - One of the gentlemen said Mr. Sutton, what is that? I told them.</p>
               <p>And you was in a mixed company, and some of the company you had never seen before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I am in partnership with Mr. Sutton. I received a letter from him from York informing me that he had sent some bills from Birmingham, which I never received.</p>
               <p>Was this bill ever brought to you? - Never; when I had received information that my partner had sent me some bills; I wrote immediately to our different correspondents at Birmingham, to send an account of what bills they had paid him; Mr. Bird wrote me word of this very bill, in consequence of which I applied to Mr. Cuff to stop payment, but Mr. Cuff told me he had paid it; he described at the same time the man he had paid it to, which answers to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What day was it you went to Mr. Cuff? - I cannot recollect that; I fancy it was the day after I received Mr. Bird's letter, but I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Was it the day the prisoner was taken up? - No, prior to that a fortnight or three weeks, or more.</p>
               <p>Court. You received the letter the 11th from York? - That letter did not describe the bills; I wrote to Birmingham for the particulars of the bills. This is the letter I had in answer; it is dated the 14th at Birmingham; it arrived in London the 16th.</p>

               <p>That bill I think is drawn upon you? - It is on the 2d or 3d of September, as I find by my book and check. The prisoner at the bar -</p>
               <p>Are you certain to his person? - I am. He called upon me for the payment of that bill, upon the 3d of September, I think it was.</p>
               <p>How came you to know that? - From the knowledge I have of the bill's being due according to the one month, but not according to the three days grace; he came in and said he had a bill upon me for twenty pounds; I told him I did not know that I had a bill due that day for twenty pounds. When he shewed me the bill, I said this bill is not due; he said not due, Sir! please to read it, it is one month after date; I said you do not know that there are three days grace if we insist upon it; grace! says he, I thought it was due at the month; I said, I cannot pay it, if you had brought it a month ago properly indorsed, perhaps I might have discounted my own bill for you; he said he came from the other end of the town, it was a long way, and he would be obliged to me to pay it; I said I could not pay it; he said I will make you any acknowledgement; I said no acknowledgement, for time would be necessary; he said he would take it as a great favour; then something more passed about it; he said he wondered they troubled him with such bills;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177910200058"></xptr> he strongly sollicited I would do it, and said he would make me a present of a glass of wine; I gave him a check, which he received, I suppose.</p>
               <p>What did he do upon that? - I gave him a pen and ink and bid him witness it; witness it! said he, he did not know what that was; I said write a receipt, put your name to it; I said it down upon the counter, and gave him a pen; I saw him stoop down and write; I took it up and saw it was not wrote Read. I gave it him again and said write received to it; he wrote the word Recd. over the name W. Wilson, by my direction.</p>
               <p>You are sure the prisoner is the person who received the draught of you? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you attend at the Mansion-house when this man was taken? - I did.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the day? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you may be of opinion it was about the 22d of September? - I should think so.</p>
               <p>By the time elapsed after the payment by you? - No, more particularly by the time elapsed after Mr. Sutton and Mr. Briggs came to me.</p>
               <p>You say this was paid on the 3d of September? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of the day? - The check is my authority, I have no other; and from another circumstance that I recollect paying it a day or two before the grace was expired.</p>
               <p>Then it was three weeks within a day after the payment that you had first seen this man? - It was.</p>
               <p>You did not see the man again to whom you paid the money from the time of the payment to the time of going to the Mansion-house? - Yes; I saw him the same day when he was apprehended at Mr. Matthews's.</p>
               <p>There were three weeks elapsed within a day from the time of first seeing till the second time of seeing the man? - Yes, I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>You attended at the Mansion-house, and gave evidence relative to this transaction? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you not at the Mansion-house, at the first time of seeing this man after the payment hesitate much with respect to his person? - Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Did you not at all doubt? - No.</p>
               <p>The man was with you but two or three minutes when he brought the draught? - No, a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did not you doubt the first time at the Mansion-house, as to this man's person? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Never? - No, never.</p>

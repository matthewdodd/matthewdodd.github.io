I was going away from her; a crush of five or six men and women then came from across the street, and crushed me into a passage; I did not see Bayley then - I was struck three or four times, and was crushed on through a narrow passage into a yard full of carts and waggons; when I got there Hyde struck me through the hat, over the head, I think with his fist; it was a heavy blow; I called out Murder! and got into a corner of the yard; I said, I would blow the first man's brains out who came near handy, but I had no pistol - the Policeman came to my assistance, and Hyde was taken to the station; Bayley was brought in in about two hours, and two or three other women - I had remained at the station, and I recognized her as the person who met me in the street; I had two glasses of gin and water, one at eight o'clock, and the other at half-past eleven, in Mile-end-road; I had been with Mr. Harris, of Morgan-street, and left the public-house at half-past eleven - I had then two sovereigns, a half-crown, a sixpence, and four shillings, in my right hand pocket - I paid one shilling then for two glasses of gin and water, and counted my money - this was half an hour before I went to Wentworth-street; I missed my money in the yard where the carts and waggons were; and I had a memorandum-book cut out of my pocket - I missed my money about three minutes after Hyde struck me; I did not miss my book till ten o'clock the next day, and my right hand coat pocket was cut - I had not been with any other person after I left the station-house; I observed my right hand coat pocket was cut, and the book was gone - I staid at the station-house two hours, and then went home; I was not conscious at the time of losing my money; I was defending myself; I had not spoken to any one from the time I counted my money till I lost it - I was sober.</p>
               <p>Hyde. I was coming down the street and heard a cry of Murder! I went into the yard with a light, and asked what was the matter with you. Witness. He did not come till after the officer came.</p>
               <p>HENRY BOLTON (Police-constable H 87). I was on duty in Wentworth-street, and heard a noise in the yard -I went to the gates; they were fastened - they are rail gates; you can see through them; there is an access to the yard through Mr. Sheen's house; I went through Wass' shop, and found the prosecutor and Hyde there - the prosecutor said, "Take this man into custody for robbing me;" I went into the yard; they were talking, but I cannot say what about - Hyde seemed much exaxperated and endeavoured to strike the prosecutor, which I preveuted - the prosecutor had been drinking, but he walked on before us, and seemed to know what he was doing; there are two houses in the yard - Hyde lives in one of them; the prosecutor could have gone through the passage of Sheen's house, which is open, and they take in lodgers - I found only 1s. 5d. on Hyde - I got a key, and searched his house, but found nothing; I saw some dust or dry dirt on the prosecutor's side.</p>
               <p>JOHN WHITE (Police-constable H 180). I received information from Bolton, and took Bayley at the end of Rose-lane, with two other females, an hour and a half after this happened - the prosecutor said she was the woman - nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>MARY WASS. I am the wife of Leonard Wass - we keep a shop in Wentworth-street. About half-past twelve o'clock I heard a cry of Murder! I went to the door, and Hyde came to me; he went to Mrs. Sheen, who desired him to get a light, and see what was amiss in the yard; he came to me, and I gave him a light; there is a passage through Sheen's house, for the convenience of persons living in the yard - Hyde lives in one; that is the passage which the prosecutor describes as being forced through; my house is a part of Sheen's; I could not hear any one pass through that passage, as there is a tenement between - I went to the yard with another candle, after Hyde; I saw the prosecutor there, holding a bridle, which was tied to the van - his dress was disorded; the Policeman was with him - before I left my house I heard a voice my"Murder! Murder! I will shoot, I will, by G-D."</p>

               <p>COURT to GUY PICKERING. Q. What light was there at the time you were struck? A.There are large gates, with rails on the top - I had my back towards the light from the street; as Hyde came towards me from the inner part of the yard, I could see his face -I am positive it was him; when I cried Murder! he went off directly; he was a minutes or two in my presence before he struck me - I saw him coming to strike me, and I struck to keep him off - I am not mistaken in his person.</p>
               <p>HENRY BOLTON re-examined. Q. Does it appear to you that in the spot in which the prosecutor was he could discover, by the light of the street, the person and features of a man? A. Yes; they are rail gates - there is a gas-light opposite, and with his back to the gates the light would he shown on the face of a person opposite -Hyde had a light.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Hunter. We live in Culford-row, Beauvoir-town, in the parish of Hackney—the front room on the base<lb></lb>ment is a sitting-room—the window of it looks to the front garden—on 15th Sept., a little after ten o'clock in the morning, I went into that room—the window had been left open—I saw the prisoner in the room—a pocket-hand<lb></lb>kerchief</p>

               <p>was on the table—this clock was on it, and the prisoner was in the act of tying it up—the clock had been on the mantelpiece—the prisoner went out, and ran away—I also missed three shillings and three pence—the glass shade was over the clock—I heard that chink, which made me go into the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 17, Culford-row. I heard Mrs. Hunter give an alarm, and saw the prisoner rush from the window of her house along the garden, and run off—I saw him plainly, and can swear to the man—I was sitting in my own room.</p>

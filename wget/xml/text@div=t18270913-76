I remember these dustmen coming to the house - I did not see them come in - I had seen the two kettles about an hour before I saw the prisoners there, and when they were gone I missed them - I went after them to Silver-street, and asked them for the kettles; they were both together, and they said they had only taken one kettle, which they gave me.</p>

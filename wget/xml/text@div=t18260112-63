               <p>HENRY ROACH GIBBON. I live in Portman-street, Portman-square, and am a <rs id="t18260112-63-viclabel358" type="occupation">carver</rs>

On the morning of the 20th of December I met the prisoner under the Piazzas of Covent-garden, about half-past twelve o'clock; I had been at a public-house with some friends; I had a purse in my right hand breeches pocket with 3l. 18s. in it, which I had seen safe about six o'clock; when I left the public-house I paid the reckoning with some loose silver; I am certain the purse was in my pocket about two minutes before I met the prisoner, she persuaded me to go with her to her house, which I did. I awoke in the morning and she was gone - I then missed my money from my purse, my watch, which I had laid on the window seat, and my shoes. I came down and found her on the stairs - I told her I had lost my watch and money; she did not deny having taken it, but grinned and laughed at me. I said I was very desirous of having the watch as it was a keep-sake, and she told a child to go and get it; a woman, who was there, said, if I would go with her she would tell me where the money was deposited; that it was in the hands of a publican. I asked the landlady to let me have a pair of shoes, and went with the prisoner to Pearce, who gave her one sovereign and some silver - I then gave charge of her; I had not given her any money.</p>

On the morning of the 20th of December the prisoner left two sovereigns with my wife - she came some time afterwards with another person, and had a quartern of gin, and changed one of them - she took away all the change except 5s.; she came again with the prosecutor, and I gave her the 1l. 5s. which was then in my hands; the prosecutor wished her to give it to him; she was very tipsy and refused to do so.</p>

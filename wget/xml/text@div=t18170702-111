The watchman came, and said, we must not stand there - We separated, they came up to me again, and talked a minute or two, and the prisoner left me all of a sudden, and the other stopped about a minute and then she left-they ran away very fast - I immediately missed my pocket-book, and told the watchman-the next day, I offered a reward, and fourteen days after, I was sent for to Bow-street, and saw Webb there; up to that time I had never said anything about losing my spectacles.</p>

            . In May last, I lived in Monmouth-street. On the evening of the 13th of May, I was in the Hay-market with the prisoner, Clipston, about twelve o'clock; she spoke to Mr. M'Leish - I came up also, we turned up Coventry-court; she gave me a pair of spectacles to hold, soon after she pulled me and said, "Come along Bet, we are all right," I went with her to Leicester-street, she showed me a pocket-book, and a 50l. note, and we went to Tower-street, Seven-dials; she then changed her bonnet and took me out, and kept me out all night; she lives with the prisoner Argent - He was not at home-she put the book in her box; about seven o'clock in the morning, I went back with her, Argent was then in bed; she told him to get up, and gave him the book - He went out and I saw no more of him. I afterwards gave information.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailmaker of 24, Acorn Place, Rother<lb></lb>hithe—on Monday night, 18th November, I was with another man walking down Trinity Street, towards the Horns; I was sober—as we turned round by the brewery, I was run against purposely, and struck on the side of my head—there were three or four persons, I cannot say exactly—in trying to defend myself I struck one my assailants—I tried to get across the road and was struck at the back of my head and knocked forwards on the ground, and the prisoner Forder held me round the neck—I also received a kick on my back, another on my nose—the heel of a boot skinned my nose—the prisoners are two of the men—my cap lay on one side of me, and Mills took it up and buttoned it in his coat—some of them were kick<lb></lb>ing me at that time from which I am still suffering—I lost 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my right hand trousers pocket when I was on the ground.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was perfectly sober—I am certain Mills picked the cap up and buttoned it under his coat—Dixon did not pick it up and put it on my head—Dixon is a waterman—I bad had been in one public-house at 7 o'clock and paid some men—this took place about 12 o'clock, but I went round to my place to work before that—I just tasted a little rum with my men—I should not be surprised to hear that Mr. Dixon says that I was drunk, and smelt of rum, I am not surprised at any thing now-a-days—I dare say I was in a public-house half-an-hour, I had two glasses of rum and water warm, a third was called for but I did not have it, I knew when I had had enough—I ordered it for myself and two friends—I did not order the last glass, I believe it was the sailmaker of a ship which has gone away—I said "No, I will not take any more, as I have particular business to do on board in the morning."</p>

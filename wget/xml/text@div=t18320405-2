            . I am an officer. On the 21st of February I went to Mr. Owen's house, and traced footmarks of a man from Mr. Owen's attic window, which was open, along the gutters, towards the house where the prisoner lodged - they appeared the footmarks of only one man; I traced them to the third house, towards an attic window there - Mr. Owen's house is at the corner of Blenheim-street and Bond-street; I inquired, and found the prisoner lived at No. 10, Blenheim-street - I found a trunk there, which he acknowledged to be his; in consequence of receiving that information, I went on the next day (Wednesday,) and searched his lodgings, in the presence of Luke Allison, his landlord; I searched a room in which he said the prisoner lodged - I found there a silver fish-slice, two dessert-spoons, two gravy-spoons, a cheese-scoop, a small China box, a pair of spectacles, a coral necklace, four shirts, six handkerchiefs, five pairs of stockings, a coat, three waistcoats, a pair of trousers, a pair of boots, a pair of shoes, and a pair of plated decanter-stands, all of which have been claimed - I have them here; I went into the cock-loft, on the landing of the same floor, and found a large parcel tied up in brown Holland, containing a pair of blankets, twenty shawls, and a large silver waiter; I searched a jacket which hung up in his bed-room, and found a chisel, a picklock key, and a phosphorous-box - I did not apprehend the prisoner; the room was an attic - I looked out of the trap-door the next day, and saw footsteps leading towards Mr. Owen's house; the trap-door leads out on the roof; I traced a man's footsteps from there to Mr. Owen's house - there is a large parapet to get down, which divided two houses.</p>

               <p>MR. OWEN.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written) From an early period in life I have been in the services of gentlemen of wealth and consequence in town and country, and not being able to obtain an engagement for these last nine months. I have been reduced to the greatest vicissitudes, and, as it is customary for young men seeking situations to call at taverns, where vacancies are made known; on my occasionally calling at one of them, I most unhappily became acquainted with a young man, who, being unemployed, frequently staid all night at my lodgings, and by whose persuasions I was weakly induced to consent to become his participator, and I have neither heard of or seen him since my apprehension. Until this misfortune befel me no blemish has stained my character, and the miseries of poverty alone prompting me to listen to the evil voice of deviation from the paths of rectitude; I most humbly implore your merciful consideration.</p>

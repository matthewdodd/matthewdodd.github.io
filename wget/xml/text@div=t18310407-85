On the 8th of March the prisoner came to the shop - she asked for black ribbon, and I served her with two yards; she then asked for some wide net, but did not buy any of that - I had shown her the box, in which the lace and net were - she then asked for some lace-caps, and she bought one of them - she then asked for some lace, and bought three yards of that, out of the box I showed her - she paid me 7s. 1 1/2d. for what she bought, and went away; a short time after she was gone another customer came in, who asked for some wide net - I took down the box, and missed a piece of figured net, I think about three yards - it was in the same box as I had previously shown to the prisoner; I had not shown it to any other person - while I was serving that customer the prisoner came in again; I went to her - she said she wanted half a yard more of lace, the same as she had bought of me, as her sister said there was not enough to trim a cap - I cut off half a yard for her, and while I was doing that I saw her take two cards of lace, and put them into her pocket; I went round the counter, took hold of her and said, "You have taken two cards of lace;" she put her hand into her pocket, took out the lace, and said, "Here is your lace, I don't want to steal it;" we sent for the officer, and she was detained -I gave the lace to the officer then - there are nineteen yards of it, it is worth 19s.; they are Mr. Nunn's property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. Is this a large shop? A. A middle-sized shop; there are three young persons in it besides myself - she had a cloak on; I missed a piece of net from the box, which was the reason I left my customer to go to her - she said she was a widow, and had seven children; she gave it into my hand directly I accused her of taking it - I did not let her go, because we have lost so much - I was behind the counter when I saw her take it; I am quite sure it was in her pocket - she was forced to put her cloak on one side to get it out.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Nunn. I saw the witness go round the counter, and take the prisoner - she took her hand from beneath her cloak, and gave the two pieces of lace to her - I took the prisoner into the back room, and heard her ask one of the shop-women to go and get her umbrella from the shop, which she did, and gave it to her - when the Policeman came the prisoner attempted to get away, and dropped her umbrella - I took it up, and in it I found this piece of ribbon, which I know, from the marks, to be Mr. Nunn's; here is a pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070054"></xptr>vate-mark on it, which we use in the shop - there are thirty-six yards of it, and it is worth 4s.</p>

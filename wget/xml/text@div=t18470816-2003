                  </hi> I am a labourer, and live at Norwood. On the 12th of Aug. I was in the Holly-bush beer-shop there—the two prisoners came up to the door—the man came in, and called for half a pint of ale—he put down a half-crown—the landlord refused to take it—the man paid for the ale with a good sixpence, and took up the half-crown again—he went out-side, and he and the women drank the ale together—I followed the prisoners to Mrs. Cherry's—after looking in at the window, the women went inside—the man stood outside till she was about to come out, and then he went in—when he came out they went on to near the Woodman, to a beer-shop and chandler's-shop, kept by Bacon—the woman went in there, and when she came out they came to Mr. Paddy's—the man went in there, and the woman remained outside—the man bought something there, and when he came out they went away together to Mr. Trundle's, at the Swan—I followed and saw them go in there—I came back, and met the constable—I went with him to the door of the Swan—I went in, and asked Mr. Trundle if his money was right or good—Morrish turned and said, "What do you mean?"—Mr. Trundle said, "I have one half-crown they gave me; I am rather near-sighted, will you look at it"—Morrish took it from his hand, and said, "What do you want?"—I said, "That is a right one, I dare say"—the policeman came in, and he caught Morrish's hand—he threw the half-crown outside the door—two shillings dropped from Morrish, which I took up and gave to the officer the prisoners were taken into the back room and searched by the officer—I spoke to Mrs. Cherry; and she gave me a shilling, which I took to the officer.</p>

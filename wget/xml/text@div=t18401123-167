                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner at the Sailors' Home—I told him the charge, and asked him if those were the shoes he had on—he said, "I suppose they are, I bought them at Liverpool"—he had some difficulty in getting them on next morning when I told him to do so—I found one pair of new shoes among his clothes, which were very small indeed, and did not fit him.</p>

I keep the Ordnance Arms, Barking Road, West Ham—on 26th October my postman, Chandler, said, "This young man" (the prisoner, who was in front of the bar) "has tendered this bad coin," showing it to me; I said, "Where did you get this florin from?"—he said, "I got it in change for a half-sovereign in the neighborhoods"—I said, "Where is the remainder of the change?" he seemed confused, and tendered a good shilling, saying, "I beg, your pardon, I had it given to me; I know it is bad; you may as well let me go, it will do you no good to lock me up"—he tried to get to the door twice, but I stopped him.</p>

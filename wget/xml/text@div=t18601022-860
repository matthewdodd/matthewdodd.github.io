                  </hi>. I am one of the senior clerks in the General Post<lb></lb>Office—the prisoner was a letter-carrier there; he had to deliver letters on 12th October, in Rosamon-street walk, Clerkenwell—on that day I made up a letter, and I enclosed in it a half-sovereign, a two and a half American gold dollar piece, an American silver coin called a dime, and six postage stamps; I marked the whole of them before putting them into the enve<lb></lb>lope—I put some gum paper round the coins so as to prevent them from falling out—I placed them in an envelope addressed to Mrs. Green, 13, Lloyd's-row, Clerkenwell, London—I then gave the letter to Mr. Clare; he was acquainted with the object that I had in view—if posted according to my directions it would have reached the prisoner's hands for delivery about 12 o'clock—the place that I put as the address would be within his delivery—after he had finished his delivery it was his duty to return between 3 and 4 o'clock to the Post Office; he did so that afternoon—in consequence of information I received I sent for him about 4 o'clock that afternoon to my private room—Upfold the officer was with me—I asked the prisoner whether he made the 12 o'clock delivery on that day in the Rosamon-street walk—he said, "Yes"—I asked whether Lloyd's-row was in his delivery—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Well, a money letter, which should have been delivered by you with the 12 o'clock letters, addressed to Mrs. Green, 13, Lloyd's-row, is missing, do you know anything about it?"—he replied, "No, indeed; nothing at all"—I then directed Upfold to search him—I saw him take from his pocket 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and about one shilling's worth of copper money—I then sent Upfold and Clare to Lloyd's-row, while I re<lb></lb>mained with the prisoner—on their return Mr. Clare showed me, in the prisoner's presence, this half-sovereign (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the one I had inclosed in the letter; I find the same mark upon it, two figures of five on the shield, marked with a punch—I then asked the prisoner if he had changed a half-sovereign anywhere that day; he said, "No, I have not"—I then asked if he knew the Hope and Anchor public-house in Lloyd's-row—he said, "Yes, I did change a half-sovereign there to-day"—I then showed him the half-sovereign and said, "This half-sovereign the landlord, of the Hope and Anchor states you changed at his house about 1 o'clock to-day; it was enclosed in the letter which you ought to have delivered, addressed to Mrs. Green, where did you get it from?"—he replied, "The half-sovereign I changed at the Hope and Anchor I saved From my wages since last Satur<lb></lb>day"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186010220038"></xptr>
               <p>—I then directed the officers to take the prisoner to Bow-street and charge him with stealing the letter addressed to Mrs. Green; the prisoner then observed, "Then you will be able to prove tomorrow that the half<lb></lb>sovereign was enclosed in the letter at 12 o'clock to-day?"—I said, "The gentleman who was in the room just now will be able to do so if necessary," meaning Mr. Clare—the prisoner remained silent for a few seconds, then tossed up his head and said, "Four years."</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of my brother, Henry Caswell, a butcher, in Belvidere—place, Southwark. On Saturday afternoon last I was outside the shop, about three o'clock, and saw the prisoners standing at the end of the window-board—there was a rump of beef on the end of the board—I was called to attend in the shop, and when I came back the beef was gone—it was about 32lbs. weight—it was worth about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we sell it at 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb.—I gave information, and afterwards saw the prisoners in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Harrison—I live in Flint—street, Southwark. On Saturday, the 19th of Sept., I was in King, street—I saw the prisoners come from Friar-street into King-street, in a direction from the prosecutor's shop—as they passed I saw Elsworthy bid a large rump of beef under his left arm—I was speaking to a friend—it was covered with a dirty handkerchief, but the tail of the beef hung out—I went on and was passing the prosecutor's shop—Richard Caswell said to me,"I have lost a rump of beef"—I told him what I had seen, and gave information to the police—the prisoners appeared to be in company—Haynes was walk<lb></lb>ing by the left side of Elsworthy—I am quite sure they are the persons.</p>

Q.</hi> King-street is rather crowded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it leads into Friar-street, and up into Union-street—I did not notice any person but the person I was speaking to—I had never seen either of the prisoners before—it was about five minutes' walk from the prosecutor's—both the prisoners had caps on, nearly alike, close caps to their heads—one of them was dressed in fustian—it was a few minutes after three o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Elwood, who keeps the Friar public-house, in Friar-street. Last Saturday I was in the back washhouse, cleaning my pots—the prisoners came in, and Elsworthy produced a dirty handkerchief with about 1 1/2lb. of rump steak in it—I noticed that it was cut some part thick and some thin—it was not equally cut—he asked if I would cook that steak for him—I said, "Yes"—I said, "Have you got some cow-beef?" seeing it was in a dirty handkerchief—he said, "No, it is good rump—steak, it cost me 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound"—they had the steak and eat it, and left the house—they seemed in very great agitation, and came to me three times while I was cooking it—it was about four o'clock—my master's is not more than two minutes walk from the prosecutor's.</p>

               <p>Fryer. She came the 6th of last Month to our Shop at <placeName id="t17460903-19-crimeloc70">Holbourn-Bridge</placeName>

My Mistress said follow her; accordingly I did, but instead of going over to the Upholsterer's Shop, she went up Shoe Lane; she cross'd up a narrow dark Entry: I follow'd her, and ask'd her if she had not got a Pair of Stockings; she said I should search her. Whilst she was fumbling she dropt a Pair of Stockings, so I happen'd to see them. I said here are the Stockings which you took from our Shop; she said they stuck to her Apron, for she did not know how they came there. She was ask'd by my Lord Mayor, what Money she had in her Pocket? She answer'd she had none but a few Half-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she acquainted with your Shop at all?</p>
               <p>Fryer. She has been at the Shop two or three Times; we have two or three Memorandums that we can prove she stole Stockings before.</p>

               <p>Spink. This Man following the young Woman, and overtaking of her, I was sent for; when these Stockings were brought to me, they were a little wet. When she was brought before my Lord Mayor, he said are you not a fine Lady to go into a Tradesman's Shop without Money.</p>

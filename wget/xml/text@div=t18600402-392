                  </hi>. I am a tobaceonist in Lower Marsh, Lambeth—on Friday, 2d March, the prisoner came to my shop for half an ounce of tobacco—he gave me a shilling, and I gave him sixpence and 4 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he then left the shop—as soon as he had gone I looked at the shilling that he had given me, and found it was a bad one—I kept it about two hours, and afterwards threw it on the fire—it melted away from the top of the fire, and fell through the bars—I showed it to several persons, and tried it with my teeth—it was very soft; it bent when I bit it—on the next day, Saturday, about 1 o'clock, the prisoner came again for half an ounce of tobacco—I recognised him when he came in—I served him, and put the tobacco on the counter—he put down a bad shilling—I asked him if he had got another—I said "This is a bad one;" he said, "Is it?" and put another one down, which was a good one—I then said, "You were here last night;" he said, "No, I was never in your shop before"—I told him I should keep the good shilling for the one last night—I then sent for a constable and gave the prisoner in charge, with the bad shilling he had given me—I called my daughter and asked her if she knew the prisoner, and she said, "Yes, that is the man who came last night"—she is not here—when she said that, the prisoner said it was a d----d lie.</p>

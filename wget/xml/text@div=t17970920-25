             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am an officer of the city.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember going to the house of Welchman on the 7th of September, in company with Ray and Armstrong? - A. Yes, and Jacobs went with us; when we entered the house, I think it was between twelve and one o'clock; I searched Jacobs before he went into the house for money, and there was none about him; he had a one pound note given to him by Mr. Powell, to purchase some money, and I marked that note.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Jacobs been in the house before he returned from it? - A. I think he had been in the house ten minutes, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched when he came out of the house? - A. I myself went up to my first man as soon as he came out of the house; I met him, and I took him immediately into the house; at my heels, another officer, Armstrong, came in; I gave him into the hands of Armstrong; he searched him, and I immediately went round the counter to the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you were not the person that searched him, but Armstrong was? - A. Armstrong searched him, and I searched Mr. Welchman, and found the note in his right hand waistcoat pocket, which I had marked before the Jew went in. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the note which you know as having been delivered to Jacobs? - A. It is; there are my initials on it, and there are Armstrong's initials on it; I searched him; I found nothing upon his person but that note; in the shop we found an amazing quantity of halfpence; seven bags I have here, to what amount I do not know; they were in the shop behind the counter, under some seats that were there; we found some done up in papers, in drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. To what amount? - A. There are seven bags; I suppose they weight half a hundred a piece; there was in the shop 130lb. of good money, which, he said, belonged to another person; it was returned to the person that he said it belonged to; we went up to the top of the garret stairs, and and found a vast quantity of counterfeit sixpences,(produces them); I told him we had an information, and after some interogation he went up stairs, and shewed us where they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the sixpences in this condition when you found them, each in a separate paper? - A. Yes; we found it concealed under the top stair, going into the room; it was a sliding stair; in another paper here are eighteen guineas and some half-guineas.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200036"></xptr>Q. There was a great deal of counterfeit money? - A. A great deal indeed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were not in the house at the time that Jacobs gave the Bank-note to Welchman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore that transaction depended entirely upon him? - A. Yes; I was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him so as to be certain that he had no money, did you search his shoes, and every part of his dress;? - A. No, I did not; I searched his pockets, and his body, but did not search his shoes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find vast quantities of counterfeit-money? - A. I did; I found in this bag six hundred and sixty sixpences, nine half-crowns, and fifteen shillings, here is another bag with 836 sixpences wrote upon, "cast unfinished;" here is another bag of sixpences and shillings cast as they came out, in their first state, and here are twenty half-crowns in another.</p>

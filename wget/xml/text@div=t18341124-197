                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Phoenix Gas Light and Coke Company. On the 20th of November I was on the premises, and told the prisoner, who was working there, that I was going to Bankside; in<lb></lb>stead of which I stayed and watched the premises—in about ten minutes I saw the prisoner come out—I watched him into a marine-store shop, and</p>

               <p>collared him as he was in the act of taking money for this copper pipe, which was in the scale, but I had before seen it in his hand—we had such copper on our premises—a scuffle ensued—his frock gave way up to the bosom—he slipped it over his head, and ran off.</p>

            . My husband's name is James Gorden; I lodge in the same house as the prisoner. On a Saturday morning in January last, the prisoner came into my room, and asked me to go for some rum for her; I went and fetched her a quarten of rum for her; I left her in my room; I was gone about half an hour. I found her in my room when I returned; I gave the prisoner the rum; she went into her own room; I was in my own room. She told me she would come into my room again; she did not come; I then had suspicion that she had done something wrong. I went to my bonnet box; my bonnet was gone; I had seen my bonnet in the box that morning. I saw my bonnet in the prisoner's room when the constable came; I went with the constable into her room; I found my bonnet and two handkerchiefs, they were found in a bundle that she had in her room on the table, two caps, two handkerchiefs, a pair of stockings, and two handkerchiefs, she had in her pocket; the bonnet, the velvet spencer, and two handkerchiefs, were in a bundle; all the rest were upon her, they were taken out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The handkerchief you lent me, and a ribbon, and different articles.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I lent you none of these things; I lent you a handkerchief I have in my pocket.</p>

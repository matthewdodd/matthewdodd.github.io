                  </hi>. I am single, and live in the service of Mr. James Mutter, in Warren-street. He has a situation under Government—on the 25th of August, about a quarter past three o'clock, my mistress was going out to spend the remainder of the day—she allowed the little boy to sit on the step of the door while she got ready—I told the child not to move off the step of the door, and I went up stairs—the child called out to its mamma—mistress went down stairs, and I ran out to the end of the street, and saw three persons standing there—I inquired of them, and ran to the next street—I made inquiry, and turned the comer, and ran on till I saw a man in White Lion-street, carrying the cloaks on his arm—I ran after him—he was walking—I called out, "Catch the thief—somebody ran after him, and he threw the cloaks over into the area of a house in White Lion-street—I remained by them, and did not see him secured—he ran off and was brought back—I lost sight of him in turning the corner, but I saw him again in about a minute and a half—I am sure he is the man I saw with the cloaks on his arm—I did not know him before—there were two cloaks and a great coat brought from the area—they belong to Richard Curtis, and had hung in the passage before—the door was open, and the</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Warren-street, and am a lieutenant in her Majesty's navy. I was on my own steps, which are next to Mrs. Mutter's, about a quarter past three o'clock when the child came and caught hold of my hand, and said something about a man robbing the house—I went to the next door and saw Mrs. Mutter, who gave me information—I had seen the prisoner before I got to my own door with the things on his arm, walking very leisurely down the street—I could sec it was clothes he had—after Mrs. Mutter told me what had happened—I ran after him, and immediately before me was Herkless—I kept her in full sight, and in turning into Chapel-street, I caught a glimpse of the man carrying the things, as soon as the young woman cried "Stop thief," I saw him run, and afterwards saw him throw the things over into the area—I still followed, and did not lose sight of him, and in Penton-street I saw the policeman secure him—I do not swear the prisoner is the man—I saw a young man running with the clothes under his arm, but his back was towards me, but when I turned the corner of White Lion-street into Penton-street, I saw the policeman search him—I had lost sight of him in turning the corner—I believe him to be the same man—it is the strong impression on my mind that he is the man.</p>

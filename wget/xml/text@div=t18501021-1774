                  </hi>. I live with my mother, Emmeretta Whitley, who is a widow—we lodged at Gloucester-place, Portland-square, where the prisoner was servant, and moved from there on 11th September to Park-place Regent's-park, on which day my mother left town—on 6th Sept. I missed her ring from her finger—I had seen it there two days before.</p>

I live with my uncle, a pawnbroker, in Upper York-street, Marylebone—about six weeks ago the prisoner and another girl came to our shop—one of them, I do not think it was this one, offered a diamond ring in pledge—I asked her whose it was; she said she had it from a private friend in the country, and afterwards she said she found it—I said I must detain it, and I sent it round by the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 59, Gloucester-place—Mrs. Whitley and her daughter lodged with me—I recollect the ring being lost, and searched the house for it with the prisoner—the prisoner was told that it was lost and was desired to look everywhere for it—her sister has also been charged with this.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 81.) On 19th September I went to 59, Gloucester-place, and spoke to the prisoner about the ring—she said she knew nothing of it—I asked her if she knew any one in Circus-street; she said she did not, she had not got a soul in London—I asked what her name was; she said "White"—I said, "I understand your name is Connolly"—she said, "It is not; it is White"—I told her she must consider herself in custody, and I took her to the station.</p>

I went to Circus-street, and found Connolly there, whom I took on this charge—she took her child, who is between five and six, with her to the station, and the prisoner was produced to her—as soon as the child saw the prisoner, she said, "Here is aunt Ellen"—Connolly said to the prisoner, "Don't you say anything."</p>

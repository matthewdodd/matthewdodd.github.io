                  </hi>. I live at Kent Villas, Lancaster Road, Barnet, and am a signal fitter—on Saturday night, the 14th July, a little before 12 o'clock, I was in the Euston Road, near the Midland Railway Terminus, when two persons came up to me—the prisoner was neither of the two—I walked on, and in the course of two or three minutes three more persons came up to me, amongst whom was the prisoner—they were talking and laughing—I had, before I met them, a watch in my pocket, which was taken from me—directly I missed it I caught hold of the prisoner—it was quietly taken—no malice whatever—I missed it whilst he was within 10 yards of me—nobody else was near me when I missed it—I had looked at it a few minutes before—I have not seen it since—I went after the* prisoner and asked him where my watch was—he made no response but struggled to get out of my hold—I took him to a policeman dose by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had had a glass or two—I had been to the Victoria at the corner of King's Cross—I had got my wages and started from home at 5 o'clock—they were all together when they decamped—I did not go up to the prisoner and say "Were not you one of those men near me?"—I said "Where is my watch?"—I was as sober as I am now.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody—I told him the charge—he gave me his address, which I found to be correct, and he told me he was working at Maple's, Tottenham Court Road, which I also found to be correct—the prosecutor was sober.</p>

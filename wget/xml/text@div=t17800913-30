               <p>I am servant to a pawnbroker. The prisoner brought me this watch; there were three or four other persons with him; it was on the 26th of July; I believe it was delivered to me by one of the others; it was offered to sale. I had seen it advertised in the Hue and Cry. I asked to whom it belonged? The prisoner said it is mine. I immediately took him into custody.</p>

               <p>(The watch was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am a countryman; I came to town one day; a man told me he had got a watch, we were at work at Paddington; I saw him talking to a man a little way off; he said he bought this watch for fifteen shillings; I gave him seven shillings and sixpence for half of it; when the other man went away then I went up to a gentleman's at Paddington and gave him seven shillings and sixpence more for it, and bought it all. I met a bricklayer near St. Giles's, he said if I would give him a gallon of beer he would help me to work. I said I had no money, I had only got a watch. We went to a publick-house, he called for a gallon of beer to drink; the bricklayer made me leave the watch there for it; he was to call next morning to carry me to work; he did not call. I never released the watch from the publick house, but the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130035"></xptr> lieutenant did. I told them the watch was mine; the lieutenant would not let me have it.</p>

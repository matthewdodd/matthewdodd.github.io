I was very much bruised and confused, and my nose and mouth bled considerably - I have not yet recovered from the effects of it.</p>
               <p>MR. EDMUND SEXTON CALVERT. I was in St. James's-place, coming from my uncle's, about a quarter after six o'clock; I saw two men scuffling at a distance, walked up, and saw the prisoner hit Mr. Vaughan, with his hat, on his head - I am certain he is the man-it was Mr. Vaughan's hat, the prisoner had it - He ran away - I pursued. I saw no other man. When I got up to him he threw the hat behind, and fell down, I picked it up, and gave it to Mr. Vaughan; on turning round again I saw the prisoner getting up - He ran off. I overtook him, and secured him. I took him to the watch-house, with assistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not drunk - A. When he was on the ground he appeared dead drunk, I did not perceive it before. I do not think he was drunk, he pretended it. He was not two yards from me. He ran up St. James's-place, towards the Park, the gates were locked, and he could not get out. I lost sight of him, but will swear he is the man.</p>
               <p>GEORGE NATHANIEL TENNANT. I am servant to Mr. Hobson, of St. James's-place. I was opening the door, about a quarter after six o'clock, and saw the prisoner strike Mr. Vaughan, with his right hand, in the face, Mr. Vaughan staggered and fell - I heard him faintly call out, stop! the prisoner struck him again with his hat about his head; Mr. Vaughan called out murder several times. I ran after the prisoner towards Lord Spencer's house; he could not get out, the gate being shut.</p>
               <p>Q. When he ran up St. James's-place, did you see any person come in from St. James's-street - A. Yes; when murder was called. If the prisoner had ran towards St. James's-street he must have been stopped; he was not intoxicated. When I ran up he had fallen down, and Mr. Calvert stood over him. I saw a hat on the ground about the time that the blows were given, but I do not remember seeing the prisoner pick it up. He struck Mr. Vaughan with his fist.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You never lost sight of him - A. I did not see him throw the hat away; Mr. Calvert was before me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking, and got intoxicated; as I was going home a man pretended to assist me, and put his hand into my pocket, I ran after him, mistook Mr. Vaughan for him, and struck him - I found out my mistake, and ran off.</p>

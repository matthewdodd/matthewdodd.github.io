                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live in Grafton-street, Soho. On the 26th of Sept., between twelve and one o'clock at night, I was in a pub<lb></lb>lic-house in Little Earl-street, and had this handkerchief in my right coat pocket—I missed it suddenly, turned round, and the prisoner was behind me—I challenged him with the theft—he ran towards the door—I seized him, and threw him down—his bat fell off, and my handkerchief was in it—this is it.</p>

Q.</hi> Are you married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I had a female with me who was sick—I was standing close to the bar, which is at the far end from the door—when I challenged you with the theft every part of the house was closed except the door—you were standing close behind me, against the counter, you ran towards the door five or six paces from the counter—the lady was standing near the counter, not outside the door—she had not the handkerchief—I am positive it was in your hat when it fell off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The lady was very tipsy, and the gentleman rather so; the lady had the handkerchief wiping her face with, as she was sick, and went out into the street; I turned to look at her, and the gentleman turned round and knocked my hat off; it ran towards the door, I ran after it, and as I stooped to pick it up, the gentleman threw himself upon me, and said,</p>

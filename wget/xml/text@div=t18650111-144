                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and reside at 15, Princes-street, Mile-end-road—on Saturday night, 26th November, I was proceeding to my house, about half-past 11, going along High-street, Whitechapel—when I got about five doors this side of Osborn-street, the prisoner and four others came up to me—the prisoner took me by the throat with his right hand, and passed his left hand right round the back of my neck, and so throttled me by pinching my throat to such an extent that I could hardly breathe—while he had hold of my throat, another one came and rifled my right hand pocket—two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and a little silver was taken from it—I felt a hand in my left hand pocket—I had in that pocket, a silver watch tied up in a pocket-handkerchief—I immediately grasped that hand with my left hand—two of them immediately came; there was a signal given; a kind of whistle, the two immediately took hold of my left arm by the wrist, and completely screwed it round—I felt great pain, so much so, that I was obliged to go to the hospital—the prisoner let go his hold, and ran away—they all ran away up George-yard—immediately I recovered myself. I made a communication to the police-inspector—I gave him a de<lb></lb>scription of the prisoner—on the following Friday, I went to the police-station, Leman-street, Whitechapel—I there saw the prisoner amongst seven or eight other persons—I immediately went round and took him by the collar, and gave him in charge as one of the men who had robbed me on the Saturday previous—I have no doubt whatever about his being the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Whereabouts were you robbed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Close by George-yard—I did not pursue you; I was unable to do so—you all ran down George-yard—I did not see you exactly at the time—I don't know the distance between where I was robbed and George-yard; perhaps thirty yards—I could see you run down George-yard from where I was standing—George-yard runs out of High-street—I was robbed between George-yard and Osborn-street—the description I gave of you was about five feet ten inches high, dark hair, cut rather short, a slouched cap on, and a pocket<lb></lb>handkerchief round your neck.</p>

I received some information from the prosecutor—he gave me a description—on 2d December, I went to the Northumberland Arms public-house, in Fashion-street—I saw the prisoner there—I told him I should take him into custody for being concerned, with others, in robbing a gentleman on the Saturday previous, in High-street, Whitechapel—he said, "The gentleman might have been robbed, but I know nothing about it"—I took him to Leman-street station—I placed him among eight or nine other men, and sent for the prosecutor—he identi<lb></lb>fied him immediately.</p>

I am bar-maid to Mrs. Leech, who keeps the Three Cranes, Fashion-street—on the night of the robbery, the prisoner was not out of that house from 10 o'clock till the house was closed at 12—I am speaking of the 27th November, the Saturday night the robbery was committed—I only know the date by what I have been told by the papers—he had on a large white American hat, and a large white rough coat.</p>

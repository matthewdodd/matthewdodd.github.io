             sworn. - I am a lighterman: As I was going down Norfolk-street, between five and seven in the morning, I saw a barge belonging to the prosecutors; there were two men on board moving the sacks about, and taking goods out of the sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were those two men? - A. It was not quite day-light, and it was a goodish distance, but I think it was the prisoners; they laid down the sacks again in their places as they were before, and covered the tarpaulins over them; I went away round to a public-house in Milford-lane, and had half a pint of purl, and came back again, and about half past seven Mr. Whitbread's miller, Mr. Garner, came down and Messenger fetched him on board the lighter in a skiff; Mr. Garner took some malt out of several sacks to carry to the brewhouse for a sample, and then Messenger brought him on shore again; then I overtook the miller in the Strand, and I told him I thought there was something on board of that barge that was not right; then I went down as far as Queenhithe to the Meter's-office with him; from there I went back again over-right the barge; I saw the two prisoners go ashore with a dish under their arms with some victuals to have their breakfast; then I went to Bow-street, and gave information, that there was something not right, and an officer was set to watch where it went to; two officers were sent down, Ruthven was one, and, I think, Jones; they looked to see if any thing was gone out of the barge, while I went to the Corn-market; I told Mr. Toosley, the malster, that the malt belonged to, what had happened, and he told me I had better go and see whether they carried any on shore any where, and then the miller and another gentleman came to have it measured, and they found a deficiency.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You were in Norfolk-street at the time you saw this? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you think these barges were off? - A. They laid off the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not beyond the middle of the Thames? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not 300 yards from you? - A. No, nor 200 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was on the 26th of November? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark? - A. It was moon-light.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not distinguish the features of the people? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not light enough to see their faces? - A. No, I saw the two men at day-light.</p>

            There were a good many other barges between you and this barge? - A. There were two failing barges and another barge.</p>
               <p>Q. What mark could you see by which you could tell which was Mr. Earl's barge? - A. Mr. Earl's barge was as long as two of the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, that with those barges between, you could distinguish which was Mr. Earl's barge at that time in the morning? - A. Yes, I say it was Mr. Earl's barge, but I cannot swear positively to the men's faces.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you could distinguish that to be Mr. Earl's barge at that time in the morning? - A. I could see a good way, it was moon-light; there was no other barge there with malt in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could see at that distance that it was malt? - A. No, I do not pretend to say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were not the other barges loaded? - A. They might have something in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not loaded? - A. I did not take particular notice whether they were or not.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all covered with tarpaulins, were they not? - A. No, all of them were not, because one of them was a London barge, that had nothing in her.</p>
               <p>Q. One of these prisoners is your own brother-in-law, is he not? - A. No, he is brother-in-law to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been some disputes, I believe, between you and him? - A. Yes, but I did not come here to argue about that.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days before this was it that he summoned you to Waterman's-hall? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not summoned you there? - A. Yes, a good many times; every time he saw me at work I had to pay twenty shillings, because I am not a free waterman.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is no good will between you? - A. No, I do not think there is much.</p>
               <p>Q. In case this man had appeared against you, when was he to have appeared against you? - A. On the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. And when was he taken up? - A. On the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. He had summoned you, how often? - A. A dozen times, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have arrested him, I believe? - A. Yes, and a good right I had so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Faulkner Carpenter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you say to him that you had received a summons from Horwood, and you would have a runner and take him to Bow-street? - A. I told Carpenter, if ever I caught<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050027"></xptr>him at any thing, I would do what I could, for he was punishing me every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Carpenter that he had summoned you, and you would have a runner and take him to Bow-street? - A. I do not know that I did this time, I may have mentioned it to him often.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have mentioned often to him, that you would get a runner and take him to Bow-street? - A. Yes, I have.</p>

             sworn. - I am a miller at Messrs. Whirbread and Co's. On sunday, the 25th of November, the prisoner, Messenger, came to me for a bill of assignment of four hundred quarters of malt that were on board Rose and Galley's barge; two hundred quarters belonged to Mr. Toosley, and two hundred to Mr. Harris; I went on Monday morning on board the barge to take a sample; I took the samples, and, in returning, just before I came to Temple-bar, John Gillet overtook me, and, from the information he gave me on the Monday, I ordered the malt up to the brewhouse on Wednesday morning; Gillet came on the Tuesday evening, and in consequence of what he said, I stopped the proceeding of the malt. I attended on Wednesday morning, sent for a meter, and had it measured; the sacks that laid at the top we found to be very deficient; in the six quarters of Mr. Harris's there were wanting thirty quarts; we then measured one quarter of Mr. Toosley's, and that wanted five quarts, and one sack of Mr. Toosley's was measure.</p>
               <p>Q. How much should the sack contain? - A. Four bushels.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How these sacks were filled by Toosley, the proprietor, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe six quarters contain seven hundred and sixty-eight quarts? - A. I cannot say, I have not calculated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. There are one hundred and twenty-eight quarts in a quarter.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many bushels are there in six quarters? - A. Forty-eight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Does not malt suffer a great deal of deficiency on account of weather? - A. The weather was in favour of the measure, it was wet weather.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you measure it? - A. On Wednesday morning I saw it measured.</p>

               <p>Garner. The meter meant to state, that if I had received these two hundred quarters at the brewhouse, wanting five quarts upon what he measured, I must have received the whole bulk as wanting five quarts upon each quarter.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Would that measure have been made by the meter, if it had not been for the information you received? - A. Yes, it is always measured by the meter before it is unloaded.</p>

               <p>CHRISTOPHER JONES sworn. - I am a conductor of the patrole belonging to Bow-street: we had an information on the 26th of last month of some people plundering some sacks in a Kingston barge; we went with the person that gave information to watch the barge that same evening till about nine; we quitted then, and came about six in the morning; the barge laid in the same place at that time, and in the evening dropped down to Brown and Boville's wharf, Milford-lane; we continued there till about the same time as we did the night before; we came again the next morning about eight o'clock; the barge was then close in under the wharf; about ten o'clock we went into Brown and Boville's accompting-house, we then saw the meter and miller coming to re-measure the malt, and after that we had an information from the same person to apprehend the two prisoners; I went under the tilt, and Messenger was eating; I then took Messenger into custody, and delivered him to one of the other officers, and then, in consequence of an information, I went and looked under the tilt again, and there found a sack covered with some of their bedding and some empty sacks; they were both bargemen on board the barge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You took them on board their master's barge? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Gillet? - A. Yes, I had three summonses to give to him from Horwood; as soon as I gave them to him, he swore, d-n his eyes, he would have a runner and take him to Bow-street.</p>

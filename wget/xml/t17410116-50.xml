               <p>Job Rowe . On the 19th of Dec. the Prisoner came to my House, and staid about a quarter of an Hour, and while my Back was turned, he took an Opportunity to take this Money out of a Drawer in the Room where he was. Soon after he was gone, I missed my Money, and I am positive no Body but he was there that could take it, I followed him to the Ship in Broad-street, and there took him, and charged him with robbing me. I saw the String of my Bag hang out of his Pocket, and then he own'd that he had chang'd some of my Money for Gold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were we not together all the Morning?</p>
               <p>Rowe . Yes, he was at my House in the Morning, and went with me to several Places, but he had the Money then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had he not a Quarrel with a Man in Lincolns-Inn Fields?</p>
               <p>Rowe. Yes, I had some Words with a Man there.</p>

            . My Brother sent for me to Broad-street, and then the Prisoner acknowledged the Fact, and return'd both Money and Bag into my Hands; there were two Guineas, and an 18 s. Piece, and I return'd him 18 d. back because he own'd it.</p>

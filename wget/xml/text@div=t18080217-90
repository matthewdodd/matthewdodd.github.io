On Thursday the 28th of January the prisoner came up to me for half a shawl; I told her we did not cut any; I pushed her of one side with the yard, telling her to stand off; soon after I saw the prisoner go past the window; I had a suspicion that she had something; I immediately jumped over the counter and went after her; I overtook her in the Old Bailey, brought her back, and took her up stairs; soon after she went up stairs she dropped a piece of shawls.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her. - A. Yes, I saw her drop it of her right side; I immediately sent for a constable and gave charge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop besides this young woman. A. A number of customers.</p>
               <p>Q. Then some of them might see it done for what you know. - A. They might, for what I know; she told the magistrate that two girls gave it her, they were in the shop, and she was to meet them in the Old Bailey, and they would pay her handsomely for it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is yours the shop to which so many people are thronging to purchase goods. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were in the shop. - A. I suppose fifty.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you suspect her. - A. She had a red cloak on; she went round the shop rather quick.</p>
               <p>Court. How many serve in the shop. - A. Eight or nine; there is only one person that attends the shawls, he is here.</p>
               <p>Jury. I believe your floor is usually strewed with goods. - A. There are some on the counter, but none on the floor.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Messrs. Harvey and Lamming.</p>
               <p>Q. Which department are you in. - A. The shawl department. On Thursday the 28th of January, our shop was very much crowded with customers; and the counter was very much crowded with goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Some on the counter and some on the floor. - A. None on the floor as I know of; I was at one end of the counter serving a customer; I observed this woman at the other end crowding upon the people. I do not recollect her speaking or asking one for any thing. I only recollect her face among the crowd. I saw the prisoner brought in by the last witness, she was taken up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it was that woman. - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know how you could know that if there were fifty or sixty people in the shop; supposing you was serving me, you would not look at the other end of the shop - A. I can speak to you just now, and I can see the jury.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you look at one end and the other at the same time. - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are a clever fellow. - A. She had a scarlet cloak on; I knew her face very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How many customers in scarlet cloaks had you on that day. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that you recollected her face; was there any thing particular. - A. I cannot say any thing particular that I recollected her face by; but taking her face altogether, I recollected her; there was eleven shawls which I saw up stairs were said to be found upon her; I did not see them found upon her.</p>
               <p>Jury. I suppose you can tell us within some hundreds how many customers you had on that day. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not confine you to two or three hundred; had you a thousand persons in the shop. - A. About six hundred,</p>
               <p>Court. And can you remember the face of every one of them. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither do I know how you can recollect the face of a person, the shop being so thronged; had she a bonnet on. - A. I think as far as I can recollect she had a straw hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Pulled over her face; how long is the counter where you stood. - A. So far as from me to you.</p>
               <p>Q. So then the distance that she was from you was as far as from you to me. - A. Yes, thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing particular called your attention to her. - A. No more than persons in red cloaks excites suspicion. - Q. I do not know that red cloaks excites any suspicion; they are fashionable; or that a straw hat excites any suspicion. - A. I would rather suspect a person in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you should have more reason to suspect a woman in a genteel dress. - A. Perhaps that is the case.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to buy two yards of cloth; I knocked at the door, there came two women, they asked me if I had knocked at the door, I told them; I had, they knocked at the door and got admittance; I might stay I dare say a quarter of an hour in the shop; I went out; soon after they called to me and asked me whether I would take a parcel into the Old Bailey; I disputed taking it because of taking my husband's tea; they told me they would pay me; I took it and waited in the Old Bailey five minutes, when the gentleman came up to me and asked me what I had got,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170053"></xptr>I said it did not belong to me; he gave me a violent blow, with that I dropped the parcel down; he took it up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

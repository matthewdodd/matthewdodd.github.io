               <p>Q. Did she tell you his Christain-name? - A. No; he came on the Saturday night, and went away on the Sunday morning following; I have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Court. It is impossible to go on upon this indictment; the prisoner is charged, as a single woman, with having robbed her ready furnished lodgings; the fact is, that Hickson coutracts with her as a married woman, and therefore the contract is with the husband, who would have been answerable for the rent.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived in Union Street, Lisson Grove; I am married, and have been for nine years—I am not living with my husband now; this has been the cause of our parting; I have not seen him for three weeks—on Whit Monday, 1st June, I was going from my house to my husband's mother's, about half past 2 or 3 o'clock—as I was going along I saw the prisoner standing by the railings of No. 14; she lives at No. 13, and my mother at No. 18—I went up to her to speak to her about what she had said about me, that she had seen me come out of a bad house with a man—I asked her if she was not ashamed of telling such a wilful lie of me—she said, "I do not want to have any talk with you"—she backed to the door; she had two keys in her hand, and she struck me over the eye with them—<hi rend="italic">Patsy</hi> King, a man that she lives with, was with her, and he came and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me—I told him not to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> me—while he was <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> me she came and struck me at the side of the head; I do not know what it was with—the blood came—she struck me over King's shoulder; my face was not towards her, I did not see her coming—I became senseless from the blow—I was afterwards taken to the dispensary in the New Road; they dressed my head as well as they could there, and then I was taken to St. Mary's Hospital; I remained there a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 34, Stephen Street. On the night of 1st June, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I was in Stephen Street, and saw the prisoner and Mrs. Lamb; Mrs. Lamb was talking to her and asking her questions, something regarding her character—the prisoner was standing against the door, and as Mrs. Lamb was asking her the questions she went back till she got to the edge of the passage—she then said, "I do not want to say anything to you," and then she said, "Yes, you b—w—, I can prove it," and she struck her with a key that she had in her hand; I only saw one key; the blood flowed directly she received the blow—King came out and pushed the prisoner behind into the passage—she then rushed out into the passage with a chopper, and hit Mrs. Lamb with it over King's arm; the chopper was whipped out of her hand by a person, but who it was I cannot say—she bled most furiously from the blow—the blow was on the side of the head—I have never seen the chopper since; I believe it was something that they chopped wood with—I could not say the length of it; I saw the end of it as she lifted it up—after the chopper was taken out of her hand, the prisoner went backwards again, and then brought forward a brick, and threw it, I believe to hit Mrs. Lamb, but it hit a young girl named Mary Welch, and cut her—it was holiday time, and I cannot say but what the women might have had a drop of something to drink which might have caused them to be in this anger.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 21, Stephen Street, Lisson Grove.

"I went to Stephen Street, and saw Mrs. Lamb and Welch bleeding; Mrs. Lamb had a great deal of blood upon her, her gown was completely saturated—I went into the back parlour, and found there the prisoner, King, and another woman—I told the prisoner she must consider herself in my custody—King made answer, and said it was his place, and I had no business there—I was turned out, and knocked down—when I got up, I saw the prisoner getting out of the window on to the tiles—I got a ladder, and got on the tiles after her, but I was pulled back by the leg by some one, and she got away; she was taken afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital. On 1st June Lamb was brought there—I found an incised wound about an inch long, and about half an inch deep, on the right side of the head down to the bone—a chopper would have done that—there were also two abrasions on the forehead; they were not serious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

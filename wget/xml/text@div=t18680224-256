                  </hi>. I live at 203, Waterloo Road, and am traveller to Yates &amp; Co., of Birmingham, iron merchants and jewellers—on 11th July I went to Cox's shop, in Cambridge Heath Road, and enquired if he could do anything in my line—Smart, who was there, called me back, and said "I can do something in your way if you can sell reasonably; I am a builder and shipping agent, living at Notting Hill, and I require a lot of iron bed<lb></lb>steads to send out to New Zealand; if you will call on me at Notting Hill I will let you know what I require"—I said, "If we do business it must be for cash"—he said, "I do nothing hut cash transactions;</p>

               <p>no one calls on me twice for their money"—I then gave him patterns, and he wrote an order on the samples—Smart returned the samples directly from Birmingham, marked—I sent the order to Birmingham, and they sent the forty-eight bedsteads from Birmingham, amounting to 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less discount, leaving balance 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on that account—on 18th July he came to me and said, "I cannot understand this," and produced a note from the railway company at Camden—I said, "If you are a business man, that is easily understood; the goods have been delivered at your address at Notting Hill, and no one has been there to take them in; if you will write to the railway company they will re-deliver the goods, charging a small amount, which we will arrange and settle"—on showing him out, his attention was drawn to some samples belonging to Thomas Yates &amp; Co., which I had in stock, iron bedsteads, and he wished to become a purchaser of those—I said, "We will settle one transaction first, for, to tell you the truth, I have no faith in you; I seem to be credit<lb></lb>ing you against my own conscience, and we made an arrangement—he then agreed to a price for these goods and 1 cwt of glue, all to be paid for on 22nd July, 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—he bought the goods, and sent a man for them on 22nd July; they were consigned from Birmingham on 11th July; I do not know what day they were delivered—I went there afterwards on 19th July, and received this cheque on 20th July from the hands of Smart—I saw Turpin give it him; he called him out at the door—it is on the London and County Bank, and is signed "Robert Talfrey;" it was afterwards returned; I got no money on it—on the Thursday following, 20th July, I went to the house and found it closed, and no one there—there were no symptoms of bedsteads or furniture—I put myself in communication with the police, and in consequence of something I heard went to Barnes's oil and colour shop, 156, Brick Lane, on the 29th—I saw him in the presence of two persons, and asked him if he was Mr. Barnes—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I see you are engaged, I will call again"—he said, "There is no necessity; you can speak your business here"—I said, "In the presence of these men?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Do you know Robert Talfrey?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Do you know who Thomas Yates &amp; Co., merchants, of Birmingham, are?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Do you know you have got some goods in your possession belonging to Thomas Yates &amp; Co.; iron bedsteads?"—he said, "I purchased them from Talfrey"—he after<lb></lb>wards said, "I have lent 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them"—I said, "You have just said you do not know Talfrey"—he said, "Who are you to cross-question me like this?"—I told him who I was—he said, "What are those men outside my shop?"—I said, "They are police officers"—he said, "Do you expect any violence?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I am an honest tradesman"—I said, "Well, you look like one, and if you are, you will assist in capturing the swindler Talfrey"—he said, "I am willing to give up these goods if you will give me the money I have advanced on them"—I said, "If it is an honest transaction, will you show me your purchases?"—he first objected, and then he said that he would, and produced the original invoice which was first consigned to Talfrey from Birmingham for twenty-four bedsteads—he held it like this, and did not let me see it—this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Talfrey to Barnes was not shown to me at all; I never saw it till to-day—(<hi rend="italic">This was an invoice of twenty iron bedsteads, at</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">bought by Barnes of Robert Kitson, July</hi> 17, 1867, <hi rend="italic">discount</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 19<hi rend="italic">l. signed</hi>,</p>

I took a place at St. Ann's Road, Notting Hill, in the name of Robert Talfrey, on 22nd June, and shut it up about 25th July—Before that I had lived at Bromley in the name of Gibbs, and at 12, Wapping Wall, and from there I went to St. James's Gardens, Notting Hill; to Camberwell in the name of Wilmot, and to Grove Place, Battersea, in the name of Wilmot—I have known Barnes three or four years—he did not know me at Grove Place—I had not been at home much while I lived there—he knew me at all the other places, and at Hoxton as well, in the name of Stephens—I also went by the name of Smart—he knew me in all the names I have mentioned—I knew keeves when I lived at Hoxton, in 1865, and from then until he was taken in custody—he knew me by those different names, and also as Turpin—I have known him six years—my proper name is Sidney Giles, I am usually called <hi rend="italic">Sid</hi>.—In taking the place at St John's Wood I saw the traveller to Yates &amp; Co.—I was with Keeves and met Mrs. Cox—Keeves said "Here is a gentleman with whom I do a deal of business, he has just paid me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," showing her the money in a bag which he opened—he asked if she had a card in her pocket—she said, "No, you know my address"—she wrote it down and gave it to me, 20, Cambridge Heath Road, five doors from the arch; and I went there and gave an order—while I was there I saw Mr. Kitson, and ultimately gave him an order for patterns of bedsteads, and afterwards for the bedsteads, which were delivered in two lots, forty-eight from Birmingham, and fifteen or sixteen from his house, also one hundred weight of glue in a bag—the first twenty-four came in about the 14th or 15th—I went to Kitson's to say that they had not been delivered, and then they delivered the twenty-four, charging me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. extra—I gave Mr. Kitson this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which Turpin wrote in the presence of all four of us, including Barnes, in the kitchen, on the Saturday morning as the things came in on Saturday</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Marquis of Granby, at Ratcliffe-cross. I have known the prisoner three or four months, by his coming to the house—about May I had some expectation of letting my house—the person was to take possession on the 8th of May—on the 24th of April I hired a room of the prisoner, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-week, in Caroline-place, Commercial-road—he told me he had been out of employ some time, and I told him to take my goods to the room at his leisure—after the 24th I removed two feather-beds, six boxes and hampers—in a hair trunk was a piece of New Orleans cloth, some gowns, and other apparel, some linen, and a pair of sugar-tongs—I have an investory of what it contained—the person did not take my house, and I determind to bring my things back—I told the prisoner I wanted these things—he said, "I will go and speak to my wife; the people in the house are religious people, and Sunday is not a fit day to get them back"—next morning, the 15th of May, I went myself, and found all the things gone, and the prisoner absconded—I could gain no intelligence of him—these boxes did not nearly occupy the room—I told him to make use of the room if it was of any service to him—he came and offered me a key—I said I did not want it—I received imformation, and found the prisoner's wife at Stratford-marsh, at her mother's—I went to No. 1, Alfred-street, Stepney, on the 19th of May—I went into the room with a policeman, and found nearly the whole of my property—I have got nearly the whole, except a bed, which had been pawned, and a few other things—on the 25th of May I found the prisoner nearly opposite the Thames Police-office—he told the officer he had pawned the bed—he did not say any<lb></lb>thing to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you discover that the things had been removed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 15th—he did not come and tell me he was starving, and I did not say, "If you want it you may raise it by pawning the things"—I asked if he Wanted money I would give it him, but he said he had got some work just then—I did not tell him I would take good care my creditors should not serve me as they did Beckett—I have heard such a man lived there, but I did not see him—I took the house of Booth—I did not afterwards ask the prisoner to remove a tool-chest and a sofa—he did not tell me he had consulted a friend, who advised him to assist me no more in my villany—he did not ask me for money—I did not say, "You are no smuggler if you can't make some"—I met him one day as I was going with my wife to the Thames-tunnel, and gave him a pint of ale—my wife did not say in my hearing, that she would come and fetch some things she wanted out of a box in church time, as persons would not notice her—church was over—I did not afterwards meet the prisoner in New Gravel-lane, and he did not ask me why I did not come to Alfred-place—I did not say I could not find the place—he came one Sunday night,' and went away a little after eleven—he did not tell me he must go in the</p>

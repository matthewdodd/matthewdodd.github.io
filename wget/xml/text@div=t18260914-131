            . On the 8th of July, at eight o'clock in the morning, I was standing at the end of Homer's-row, and saw the prisoner and two other boys walking sharp up the road; I suspected they had something - the other two then sat down - I followed the prisoner into a pawnbroker's, and asked him what he had got - he said he had bought those shoes of a Jew, and he was going to pawn them for the purpose of getting something for his breakfast; I found 6d. in his pockets - I took him to the office, but I could not find the owner, and he was discharged; on the Saturday following he came to demand them - I had then found the owner.</p>

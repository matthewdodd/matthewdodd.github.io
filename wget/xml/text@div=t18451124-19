                  </hi>. I live in Union-court, Holborn, and am employed to mind the carts in the Old Bailey, while the owners are at Newgate-market About eight o'clock, on the 14th of Nov., I was in the Old Bailey, and saw the prisoner with a dead pig on his back—I asked him what cart he wanted; he said, "Mr. Morgan's cart"—I said there was no such name there—I saw the tail-board of Mr. Brown's cart down, and put it up—I saw the prisoner go up, Newgate-street, and watched him down Warwick-lane, into St. Paul's Church-yard—Ispoke to a policeman there—I went up at the same time and said, "Was you not asking for Morgan's cart?"—he said, "Yes"—I told the police-man not to let him go—he then said, "I am going to Old Change with it"—I found Mr. Brown, who claimed the pig.</p>

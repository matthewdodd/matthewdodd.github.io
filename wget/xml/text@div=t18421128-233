                  </hi>. I am a marine-store dealer, in High-street, Shad well. The prisoner had been to my shop to sell things—a little after six o'clock, on the 29th of'Nov., some one gave me information, and I missed a Guernsey bag, made of sugar bags, containing about 20lbs. of canvass rags—it was safe about three in the afternoon—the prisoner had been in my shop about eleven—he came again about seven for a pair of shoes he had left in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I gave him in charge—this is the bag; and the rags.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 35, Simmond's Place, Portman Square, and am a gentleman's servant out of a situation—about 11 o'clock p.m, on 19th June, I was in Hyde Park, near the Marble Arch, when the prisoner accosted me—he walked part of the way and talked to me—he said "It's a fine evening"—I said "Yes, it is," and he snatched my watch and chain and took me by the throat—I asked him what he meant, and he said "That is what I mean," and he put his leg between mine and threw me down, he falling uppermost—he put his hand in my trousers pocket, took out my purse and a bunch of keys—I had a half-crown and a sixpence, I believe in my purse, and some coppers loose in my pocket—he got up and struck me over the top of the ear with his fist or a stick—a stick was found there next morning—he then struck me a violent blow on the mouth—I asked him to give back my watch and chain, and said "You are welcome to the money"—he said "You have more money on you, and I will have it"—I have not seen the watch and chain since—this is my purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is nothing in it now—the keys were not found—the prisoner walked towards the police-station, and I followed him—he started running, and I said "Whichever way you go, I follow"—he then turned round and struck me twice, and took up his belt and swore he would knock my b——y brains out if I followed him—I followed him some distance and he got away, and the first person I saw was another soldier and I made a communication to him and to a policeman—the number of my watch was 22,631.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to Mr. Amhurst, a pawnbroker, of 32, York Street, Westminster—on Wednesday, 20th June, the prisoner offered a watch and chain for sale—I saw they were valuable, and I asked him whose it was, and he said it was his <hi rend="italic">old man's</hi> and he had had it about twelve years, and that it cost about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the foreman directed me to go to the barracks with the prisoner, and I handed the watch to the Sergeant-Major—Venables, a soldier, who was had up at Marlborough Street, and dis<lb></lb>charged, and was in the shop when prisoner brought the watch in—he overtook us in the Buckingham Palace Road, and said if he had the watch instead of Jordan, he would have got it away from me and given me a good thrashing and would not have allowed me to go before the sergeant-major—I did go there and the prisoner said it was his, and he had given a civilian 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I did not see him produce any document—I took the number of the watch and the name—" Wachtholder, Hull, 22,631."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant-major of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards—we had a battalion at Chelsea Barracks at this time, which has since been at Aldershot—the prisoner and Rawlings came before me on the afternoon of 20th June—Rawlings told me that the prisoner came to his</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer B</hi>). From information I received from the pawnbroker I went to Chelsea Barracks with the pawnbroker—the sergeant-major sent for the prisoner, and I told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of stealing a watch and chain in Hyde Park—he said "I didn't steal it; I bought it of a man at the Grapes public-house for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I asked him to produce it; he said he had sold it to a man outside a public-house, but did not know him or the public-house—I asked if anybody was with him, and he said "Yes, Venables, the man who was with me when I went to pawn it; he saw me sell it"—after the prisoner was confined in the guard-room the sergeant major sent for Venables—I told him who I was, and that I should take him in custody for being concerned in disposing of the watch—he said he had nothing to do with the watch, and had only been with the prisoner when he went to pawn it—he went before the prisoner and made the same statement, and the prisoner didn't deny it—I searched the prisoner and found this purse, which I laid down in the guard-room—I asked him how he came by it, and said "How long have you had it?" and he said "About nine mouths"—I took them to the station and sent for the prosecutor, who identified the purse and the prisoner—the charge was read over, and he made some statement about buying the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you got to tell us about the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Paterson. There were three women drinking, and said I, I will go up stairs and take a nap of sleep .</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a publick house you lodge in?</p>
               <p>Paterson. No it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many women were there?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904110020"></xptr>Paterson. There were either three or four ; I just came in at the door and went up stairs to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Paterson . About half an hour after six, I wanted to take a nap before night. She came up and asked me for a handkerchief ; she call'd me husband , and said I was her property, and what I had belong'd to her: she wanted a handkerchief of me, and I told her I would pay for a handkerchief if she would go down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go down stairs ?</p>
               <p>Paterson . No, she would not go down stairs: but the same time I was asleep she took my watch out of my fob .</p>
               <p>Q. How can you tell that, when you say you was asleep at the same time?</p>
               <p>Paterson . Because people can witness it down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively she took it when you was asleep?</p>
               <p>Paterson . Yes, I will; the people ask'd what a clock it was, and I went to look, and it was gone; she went away with the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you awake when she came into the room?</p>
               <p>Paterson . Yes I was?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me the watch to be concerned with me.</p>
               <p>Paterson . I never kiss'd her lips.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her the watch?</p>
               <p>Paterson . I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she on the bed with you?</p>
               <p>Paterson . No, she was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know when you was asleep?</p>
               <p>Paterson . How do I know, how do I know, how do I know, because she had got hold of my shoulder as I have got hold of this gentleman; [taking hold of a person that stood by him.] she hawl'd me up from off the bed; I was half fuddled, please your worship.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your watch again?</p>
               <p>Paterson. Yes I have.</p>

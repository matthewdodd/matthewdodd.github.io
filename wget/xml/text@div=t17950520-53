             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a single woman. On the 23d of April I had my parcel snatched from me, as I was walking along in <placeName id="t17950520-53-crimeloc313">Newgate-street, just at the end of Butcherhall-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had you a diaper napkin, gown and callico? - Yes, I had been fetching it from the mantua-maker's in Red Lion-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going? - To Sun-court, Threadneedle-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you before he took it? - No, he made a spring and snatched it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let it go or make any struggle with it? - I had not time, it was snatched in a moment; another person immediately pushed me down and the man ran down Butcherhall-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not pushed till after the snatch? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any lamps near the place? - I did not observe; I scarce did see him before the bundle was gone from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man who robbed you, a round hat on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not have sworn to his face till after he was brought back? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was robbed, had you time to discover the colour of the man's coat, or his dress? - No, not till after he was taken. I shrieked out immediately, and a young man that see him snatch it, seized him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the young man here? - He called on me a week afterwards, and said, that he was going to Canterbury, to work at his business; I wrote to him last Tuesday, and he never came.</p>
               <p>Q.When the prisoner was brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200159"></xptr>back, was the bundle in the possession of the prisoner, or what? - It was in possession of the constable.</p>
               <p>A CONSTABLE sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the property in the prisoner's possession? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you get it from? - A young man. I was in the lane when the cry of stop thief was.</p>

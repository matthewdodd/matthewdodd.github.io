               <p>Touyn. About six weeks before these things were missing, which was the 20th of April when we missed them. We sent to Mr. Brown, a pawnbroker in Marybone street; we discovered eleven parcels at different times.</p>

            . I am constable in St. James's parish . I was sent for on the 20th of April to the Major's. The prisoner at the bar was in Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904110003"></xptr> Knott's house, they charged me with her. I took her into the watch-house; she confess'd to me that she had pawned two shifts and an apron in Swallow street; I went there along with her, there the things were delivered to me, which the Major has sworn belonged to his daughter. After that I went to Mr. Brown's, where I had several other things, which he can inform the court of.</p>
               <p>Nathanael Brown. Upon hearing the Major had been robb'd, I had a suspicion of the servant's being the thief. I sent to know if they missed any spoons, which they did; then I examined my book, and sent over to know if the other things, brought by the prisoner, belonged to him. There were parcels brought at several times; there was an apron, a tea spoon , 2 clouts, 2 napkins , one apron, one neckcloth, which she confess'd belonged to the Major.</p>

               <p>There were two persons spoke well of her as to her former character; and the Major said she came to his house with a very good character, and he hoped she would meet with some favour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and am a dress-maker. The prisoner is a baker—he was paying his addresses to me—he told me the banns of marriage had been published, and we were to go to church—on the 27th Oct. I went with him to a coffee-house opposite to Paddington church, to wait till the time appointed to be married at that church—I was to have gone to his lodging, but he said he did not want me to go to his lodging—when it came to within twenty minutes of half-past ten o'clock he said he would go and fetch my brother—we had had breakfast at the coffee-house, and he said, "Will you pay for it?"—I said, "Yes"—I took out my purse, and laid it on the table—he took it up and paid for the breakfast—he then said, "Now I will go and fetch your brother"—he went out, took the puree with him, and never returned—he asked me to wait in the coffee-house—I said, "What shall I do with my shawl?"—he said, "I will leave it at Mrs. Taylor's"—he took that and my brother's hat, which I had, and my scarf—he took them all away—I had bought the wedding-ring, and had it on my finger—he said, "You must take that off"—I took it off—he took it, and went away with it—this is my purse and shawl and scarf—I afterwards found him at a dance, with this scarf round his neck, and gave him into custody.</p>

On Wednesday evening, the 29th of Oct., I went to the Jews' Harp, in Regent's-park—I saw the prisoner there—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>, I want you"—he came out, and said, "It is no more than I expect"—he had this scarf on his person, this purse in his pocket, and this hat on his head.</p>

The money was to have been received on the Thursday as she took me on the Wednesday; she came to me that morning, at half-past seven o'clock, to go out for a day's pleasure; we were to meet her brother and a young lad at Paddington: the scarf and hat she gave me to wear: she lent me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that was to go towards paying for an agreement. She gave me the breast-pin and a new waistcoat to wear.</p>

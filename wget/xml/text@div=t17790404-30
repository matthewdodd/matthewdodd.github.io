On the Saturday night my wife was informed that he went away with his pockets full. I looked to see if any thing was gone, and missed a pair of gentleman's dressed shoes, which stood before him. On the Wednesday following, the 17th of March, as he was going to breakfast I saw one of his pockets stick out; I laid hold of him, and asked him what he had in his pocket; I found this pair of shoes (producing them).</p>
               <p>Was he willing to be searched? - No; he said he had nothing; I insisted on his pulling it out, whatever it was; they are a pair of womans callimanco shoes which were made for a customer. I charged him with robbing me the Saturday night before; but he denied it. I sent for a constable and then he said he had taken another pair, and if I would let him go, he would fetch them; I said it was too late then, and took him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040049"></xptr> the Rotation-Office; and the constable and I went and searched his room, and found the men's dressed shoes; he had blacked the heels where they wer e stitched, and worn them a day, I suppose; and we found likewise two pair of women's callimanco shoes.</p>
               <p>(They were produced in court by the constable, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oilman, and live at Newington-causeway. On the 6th of January the prisoner came to my shop, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and presented a written order for a gallon of sperm oil—I did not know him before—he directed me to be sure to send it to Mr. Churchill—this is the order—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"One gallon best sperm oil. <hi rend="smallCaps">W. CHURCHILL</hi>, timber-merchant, road, Lambeth."—Mr. Churchill was not a customer, but I knew him—the prisoner said I was to be sure to send that afternoon, as Mr. Churchill wanted to light up a meeting that evening—I told him I would be sure to send it—I was entering the order in the book, and as he was leaving he turned round suddenly and said, "I may as well pay you for it, if you can give me the difference of this cheque; it will save me the trouble of going into the City"—I said, "Very well," and made as if I was going to get the change: instead of that I went out the back way, and came In at the front in company with a policeman—the prisoner was waiting in the shop for the change—I said to him, "How long have you been with Mr. Churchill?"—he said, "About six months"—I said, "I doubt it; I must detain you"—he said, "I hope not," and attempted to go—he said he hoped I would let him go this time; he was in great distress; that he was publishing a book, and wanted a little money, and when he had sold his books he would have called and paid me again; I should not have lost my money—I asked him whose</p>

                  </hi>. I am a timber-merchant. I have known the prisoner many years as a boy at a school with which I was connected—I have not known what he has done lately—he was in an office in the City, but has been out of employ latterly—he applied to me in April for the loan of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I lent him—this cheque is not my writing—I keep cash at Fuller's—I never authorized the prisoner to put my name to any cheque.</p>

Q.</hi> Are you at all acquainted with my handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, by receiving letters from you—I have got the last I received from you in my pocket—it is dated the 3rd of May, 1839—I had sent you that day a letter enclosing a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the cheque produced is not signed as I sign mine.</p>

In attempting to conduct my own defence in a charge of so serious a nature, I am sure you will all admit I have under<lb></lb>taken a task of no ordinary difficulty; but I am relieved under the con<lb></lb>viction that I am perfectly safe in the hands of his lordship and a British jury. The only evidence affecting me is that of Mr. Churchill, who swears he possesses a perfect knowledge of my writing, from having received letters from me; the date of the last letter is the 9th of May; I would ask whether a person's handwriting would not undergo some considerable change in that space, and how could a person, looking at that, say it was the offspring of my pen? He said before the Magistrate, that such was the fallibility of human evidence on hand-writing, that he would not be able to swear to his own writing two hours after he had written it. He admits it is like my writing, and not an attempt to imitate his. I leave it in your hands to say whether a charge of forgery is established.</p>

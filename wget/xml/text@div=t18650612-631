                  </hi>. I was solicitor to the defendants in the suit of Cath<lb></lb>rill v. Jeffrey and another—my father was a solicitor, and was employed by the late Mrs. Saunders—he prepared several wills for her—I was then articled to him, and knew what was done in his office—I found amongst the papers in the office the "scripts" which have been exhibited in the suit—I found the exhibit K; it is a letter requesting the preparation of a will, dated 26th October, 1854—script L contains instructions for the will of 1854, and is in Mrs. Saunders' writing—it is of the same date—the executors appointed are John Jeffrey and Samuel Kiddle—the residuary estate is left to Samuel Kiddle and his wife, Mary Kiddle—there is a legacy left to the prisoner Cath<lb></lb>rill of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a will was prepared in accordance with those instructions—I do not find it among the deceased's papers—Script "P" contains instructions in Mrs. Saunders' writing for a will dated 9th November, 1855—the same executors are appointed—the residue is left in the same manner, and there is the same legacy to the prisoner Cathrill—Script "Q" relates to the same document—Script "S" is dated 31st July, 1856; it contains instructions in Mrs. Saunders' writing—the same executors are appointed—the residue is left in the same manner—Cathrill's name is omitted from that will—Scrip "U"</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not the deceased at one time leave the residue of her fortune to Emma Coe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My recollection is that she did—that appears by one of the early exhibits—in exhibit "J" the residue was left to Kiddle and his wife, and then "my niece, Emma Coe," is written over—that is the will of October, 1854—in the will of June, 1854, it was origin<lb></lb>nally left, to Emma Coe, and then altered to "Kiddle and his wife"—exhibit "H" is not the will actually executed; it is a paper of instructions in Mrs. Saunders' writing, which were carried out by a will being prepared and properly executed-exhibit "J" is not that will, but is the draft of it as altered—the alterations are in my father's writing; copied from some other document, I presume—he is not living—"J" is really the copy of a will after<lb></lb>wards executed upon the instructions of "H"—there are a great many alterations, in it—J. W. Hurst and Mr. Eales are appointed executors, then they are struck out, and "Samuel Kiddle" put in—that is in the will of Octo<lb></lb>ber—Mr. Jeffrey's name is left—he has a legacy of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the will of June, 1854—in the will of October, 1854, he was to have in addition twelve shares in the London and Westminster Bank—I do not know what they were worth then—they are now worth from 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—Exhibit "G" is a list of the legatees and their addresses—that is not instructions for the will of 23d May, 1854—Cathrill's name does not appear there for eighty-four shares in the London and Westminster Bank, and eight Great Western Railway shares—the sums and shares are not there mentioned, nor have I any former document in which they are—I do not know anything of the history of that document—I think it very likely that the will of June, 1854, would carry that document into effect—I have not compared it to see—that will is the first one in which the residue is left to Kiddle and his wife—Scrip "E" is a draft of the will of 13th August, 1850, and serving by alteration for draft of the will of 30th October, 1851—the red ink I resume to be the alterations—in neither of those wills is Kiddle an executor—in both of them Jeffrey has 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left, and in the latter of them there is an addition of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him and Joseph Hurst as executors—Mrs. Kiddle takes a larger interest under the first than the second—it was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and then reduced to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not see Mr. Kiddle's name there at all—there is no date on the earliest exhibit—I cannot tell you for what will it was the instructions; it was a very early will; I know by the address on it—Mrs. Saunders changed her residence very frequently—she was then living at East-place, Lambeth—the first will we made was in 1850—those instructions must have been for a will subsequent to that one—Mrs. Saunders was living at St. Paul's-place then—I have produced all the wills in the office—I have referred to the books, and that is the first occasion we had a will-transaction—her husband had only died the year before—he died in 1849—in the scrip Jeffrey's name is struck out in red ink and Mr. and Mrs. Kiddle are put in—I find a residuary bequest, but there is no name, and there is a note in my father's handwriting, "to whom? in pencil—in that will, Jeffrey and Joseph Hurst are executors—it is then altered, and Jeffrey gets nothing,</p>

               <p>though he is left executor—it is evidently incomplete—Scrip "B" contains instructions for a will—I cannot be sure that those are the instructions for either of the wills I produce—she was still described as of East-place, widow—by that will there was a legacy to James Whalley, Christopher Whalley, and Eleanor Whalley; and Jeffrey and Mr. Jan-ell are residuary legatees and joint executors—there is no date to that scrip—I cannot find any document that I can identify as the will made from those instructions but the will where the like legacies are left—I think I have known Mrs. Saunders personally from the date of the first will—there are several documents among the "scripts" in her writing, but none on the earliest—I see by a note in my father's writing that I attested the will of June, 1854—the draft of it is in my writing—my father took the instructions from the old lady for the will of 1850—I only visited her with my father as her professional adviser—I cannot give the number of times when I have been there for the purpose of taking instructions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How recently did you go before her death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can only say I went to her when in Albion-place, and she died there—I believe she lived there two years—I do not think that was about taking instructions for the will of March 14th—it was to take a letter, stating that we had removed—I cannot recollect that I saw her—I have heard she died in Feb. 1863—I cannot tell whether I went there after the will of 14th March, 1859—I should say we did some little business—I can't say whether I went to the house—I do not state that from recollection, but from looking at the books—I did not go to the house after her death, nor when the will was read—I acted for Jeffrey and Kiddle in the Probate Court—I was consulted on the will of 23d of March being propounded—all the scripts did not come from my office—some came from the executors—I cannot tell which—the majority came from us—there is only one original will among them—the signature is cut off for cancellation—I do not know what has become of the wills, of which I produce the drafts—at the time of her death Mrs. Saunders lived in apartments—I know nothing of her papers—I have seen her write on the occasions on which she signed her will—I do not know of any other—I did not correspond with her—if I had not referred to the other documents, "I could from my recollection have stated that the signature to the will of 23d March was not Mrs. Saunders' writing—I should have formed an opinion upon the propounded will of 23d March, because it is unlike the general character of her writing—I do not think she always signed in any particular way, but she always signed very boldly, so far as I recollect—she usually wrote with a quill pen—I cannot say I ever saw her write with any other—her usual practice was to sign wills with "Eleanor" in full, but instructions and so on, she signed, "E. Saunders" only—I never saw her sign, "Elnr. Saunders," because I never saw her sign anything but wills—it is quite likely she may have done so—there were peculiarities in her letters—I cannot mention them with out the papers before me—the "n" in Eleanor was peculiar, perfectly formed, but in a peculiar way—to the best of my belief the will of 23d March is not her writing—I do not reject the possibility of being mistaken—I am not an expert, and have not studied handwriting.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a surgeon practising in Lambeth—I now reside at Clapham-park—I knew Mrs. Saunders, the testatrix, intimately for about seventeen years—I had attended her closely as her medical man—I was also personally intimate with her—she became a widow two years after I first attended her—I knew her husband—he died in 1849—she lived in Lambeth the whole time I knew her—I did not know my co-executor, Kiddle, until my knowledge as executor—that was when Mrs. Saunders lived in China-place—I would not attempt to fix the time, but somewhere about 1854 or 1855—I knew him by name, but did not see him—he was on intimate terms and had married some relation of Mrs. Saunders—she requested me to be her executor—that was about the period I mentioned—she said she wished to associate me with Mr. Kiddle, of Salisbury, on account of the high opinion she entertained of him, if so doing would be agreeable to me, and she would make an appointment for him to come to town and take luncheon with me, so that we might be introduced, and it was her wish I should keep the address, so that we might obtain him whenever we required him—I was aware when she made the will of 14th March, 1859, that she was about making a will—she referred to her will on many occasions, and on one occasion particularly, when she was ill, she gave me custody of the will—I do not remember when that was, but it was about eighteen months before she died—at any rate, it was considerably after 1859—she died on 2nd February, 1863—she was then very ill, and took her will out of the bureau—it was unsealed, and I declined to receive it unless sealed; she then sealed it and handed it to me—I had it for about a month, when she requested it should be returned, and it was returned—it was then sealed—I have since Been it in the bureau where she kept her money—that was up to the time she became incapable—that was a few weeks before she died—I am not able to say whether that was the will—I did not read it until her death—it was sealed when I received and when I returned it—it was in an envelope—I never saw the will itself, but she pointed it out as being her will—after her death I looked in the bureau—I found the will produced there—I com<lb></lb>municated with Mr. Kiddle before her death, at her request—he and I attended the funeral—the persons named in the will were all there—after all came from the funeral they partook of refreshment, and then without moving the will was produced and read—Cathrill was present—before the will was read, a question was put to the company generally, asking if they knew of the existence of any other will—I believe Kiddle put that question, but I am not certain whether he did, or I did myself—I am perfectly certain one of us did, and that Cathrill was present—they all remained</p>

Saunders and John Henry Saunders, father and son—I did not notice Cathrill speaking to them—it was in the passage of the same house that I saw him, the same evening—there were about a dozen present at the reading of the will—there was no talking while the will was being read—my knowledge of Mrs. Saunders writing is derived from the letters; that is all I know of it—I do not remember any of the letters in which the signature is like that to the will of the 14th March—I believe that is a genuine signature—I believe the</p>

                  </hi>. My maiden name was Eliza Andrews—I was in Mrs. Saunders's service—I lived with her ten years, up to the time of her death—I knew that she made wills from time to time—I knew Mr. Hooker and his son coming—I was in constant attendance upon Mrs. Saunders—there was another servant who stayed a short time with her while I was there—that was in Walnut-tree-walk, but not at No. 3—she had a house on the opposite side which was No. 2, I think—then she came to No. 3, and that is where she made the will—she had no other servant there—I was always at home—when I went for a few minutes, I asked the lady of the house, Mrs. McArdell, if she would see to Mrs. Saunders—I know Cathrill—he used to come to see Mrs. Saunders about once a month—sometimes she was very agreeable and pleasant—I believe she was so always, but I do not know what passed between them, as I could not see—I did not hear what took place—my mistress has told me that she should not leave him anything—that was at the time we were living at Mrs. Brown's—it was after March, 1859, that she told me she should not leave him anything—she gave no reason at all—he was not admitted to her always—I have denied him several times, because Mrs. Saunders did not wish to be troubled; she was too ill—I had orders not to admit him—Cathrill asked me once about the will, and whether she had left him anything—I should think that would be about a month or six weeks before Mrs. Saunders's death—I said, "No, she has not"—he said, "Blast her," and stamped his foot—I knew of her making her will two or three times, from Mr. Hooker coming—I have never seen Dresch—I never knew Cathrill to come with any one during the time I was living there, except that his wife came once—I am certain that he could not have brought two men and occupied ten minutes with them without my knowing it—when she made the other wills Mr. Hooker and his son were always there—I know Mr. Jeffrey; he was constantly there—I know also Mr. and Mrs. Kiddle—they all came from time to time, and were on very agreeable terms—I was at the funeral, and heard the will read; everybody could hear it—I heard Mr. Jeffrey and Mr. Kiddle ask if they knew of any other will—the answer was there was no other will but that one—I could not say who said that—Cathrill was there—I did not hear him say anything—I have heard Mrs. Saunders speak of her will—I cannot say I heard her speak of Mr. Jeffrey and Mr. Kiddle as executors after she had made it—I know my mistress's handwriting quite well—I have heard her say Mr. Jeffrey was to have the entire management of the funeral and of everything—she very often spoke of Mr. Kiddle as her executor; I am quite sure of that—she said every<lb></lb>thing was to be settled by Mr. Jeffrey and Mr. Kiddle—I should not think the signature to this will is my mistress's—I never saw her write like it—it is a different hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver and printer, and have paid a great deal of attention to handwriting, in examining it—I have seen the signature to the undisputed will—I have also made myself acquainted with about 150 other signatures—in my opinion the signature to this disputed will is not in the handwriting of Mrs. Saunders—I am clearly of that opinion be<lb></lb>cause there are at least ten characteristics or conditions which will always be found in a genuine signature of Eleanor Saunders, and not one of them will be found in this disputed document—the signature to the genuine docu<lb></lb>ment appears to be freely and boldly written—there is not the slightest hesitation about it, except at the beginning of the "E"—there is a little hesitation as often happens from the condition of the ink in the pen, by reason of the ink not flowing at once—the signature to the other one is full of hesitation, and broken up, and the pen has been lifted in places where the testatrix never lifts her pen, and letters are joined where she does not join them—some of the lines have been gone over once or twice in parts, and this magnifying glass makes it more clear—if you look at the top of the "1," there is something of the nature of a break—I made these diagrams for the purpose of illustrating my evidence upon it—the "1" in Eleanor when magnified appears to have had the pen lifted off, and not put down very accurately—it is very difficult to do it—it may be done so as to deceive the eye, but under the magnifier you can see it—this diagram was copied by my own hand—the signature which I believe not to be genuine, I think has been done piecemeal; for instance, the letter "a" considerably changes in directions, terminating at every point—another part of the "a," instead of being a smooth loop, is chopped up—it is done in several pieces, as though copying or drawing from something, and nothing of the kind can be found in Mrs. Saunders's writing—you can trace it distinctly with the glass, and you can see every stoppage of the pen—the letter "a" appears to be made in two halves, which the magnifier discloses—it is not a natural way in open writing—that indicates to my own mind that it has been copying—then another thing is, that between the "a" and the "n" there is a little junction, showing that it has not been written off like Mrs. Saunders's was, and though the "e" is always below the "a," and if it does join it will be joined near the bottom of the "a," I do not find one instance where she has joined the "e;" but if it has been done it must be at the bottom of the "a"—in the forgery, it is joined quite high up—I would also add that there aie certain points existing in the forgery which never can be found in Mrs. Saunders' writing—in the letter "n," where it joins the "o," it is finished so low, that if it did join the "o," it would be at the bottom of the "o;" but in the forger, it is a little way up—one of the most important differences is in the "r"—in the forgery you will find there is an up-stroke line, but in Mrs. Saunders' signature there is not an upstroke to the "r"—that is in the word "Eleanor" more particularly—I am not speaking of the "r" in the word "Saunders"—there is a different characteristic there—then both the "n" in "Eleanor" and "Saunders" finish with an upstroke, while it is very rare indeed that an upstroke can be found in Mrs. Saunders' writing, or it is exceedingly short—in the word "Saunders," in the letter "a," there is a large space between the to and the l, in all Mrs. Saunders' writing it is quite close, and there is no room for any space—in that respect the forgery is more free than in Mrs. Saunders'—in my opinion this will is a very clumsy forgery, and one easily detected—I believe the signature which purports to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186506120085"></xptr>
               <p>be 'Eleanor Saunders' is the same writing as the body of the will, and written with the same pen and the same ink—the difference in the signature I attribute to the attempt to copy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you go so far as to say they were written at the same time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe so—I lay stress upon the up-stroke in the "r" in "Eleanor," so far as I have seen—I have examined 150 genuine signatures of "Eleanors"—I was occupied some hours on several occasions; I cannot tell how many—I think I was first engaged at the latter end of last year by Mr. Hooker, the solicitor for the defendants in the probate suit—he wished me at first to go to Doctors' Commons, and asked my opinion as to the signature to a will—I was entrusted with the documents, and I took away the letters home—I think I must have known then that Mr. Hooker was solicitor for the defendants—I cannot tell how long I was engaged upon the signatures; perhaps sometimes from 10 to 12 at night, as I could spare the time—that did not include the time for making the diagrams—I was in attendance at the Probate Court, and the diagrams were ready—they were prepared for the purpose of clearly explaining my views to the Jury—(<hi rend="italic">a letter was produced, in the body of which "Eleanor" occurred</hi>)—as to the up-stroke in the "r," I was speaking of a "signature"—I do not see one there—there is the word "Eleanor," but there is no up-stroke—there is a blurring over the paper there, and it is an accidental up-stroke—I do mean seriously to tell the Jury that she would write her name differently in the body of a letter to the mode of signing at the bottom—I invariably do it myself—when a person is signing his name he has a particular way of dashing it off—I think that from the constant habit of writing a signature persons would write it alike—Eleanor Saunders's signatures are remarkably alike—there will be some little difference between the name in the body and the signature at the bottom of a letter, but not in the characteristics generally—it affects the size a little, and the shape of the letters—this letter (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) I should say, is a genuine letter of Mrs. Saunders—the "n" in Walnut joins—I say the "n" does not join the "o"—I was engaged in the case of Nuttal's wills—I was on the last trial, but not on the others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live in great Windmill-Street, Haymarket. The prisoner has cohabited with me between four and five years. On Friday, the 27th of November, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I sent her to Bowling-street, Westminster, with a pair of shoes—she was absent about two hours and a half, or nearly three hours—when she came back she appeared rather the worse for liquor—William Delabertouche lives in the next room to me—he had a wife and daughter—when the prisoner came home she desired the bed to be let down—she then make use of very abusive language to Delabertouche and myself, while I was at work—after she had gone on a long time, I began to remonstrate with her for her conduct, and she got up off the bad, and gave me a severe blow with the poker on my left-arm—I arose up to take the poker from her; but before I could get to her Delabertoucher took me into his room, out of her way—I was in his room about half an hour to the best of my recollection—I heard the prisoner say to Delabertouche's daughter that she wished to sell some things—some plates and dishes and things, or something of that of kind—I can't tell exactly what—they were my property—I went into the room where the prisoner was—she put her fist in my face, and tried to aggravate me to strike her—she used a good deal of aggravating language—I did not strike her—I shoved her away with my bands, and went to my bench to work—as soon as I got to the bench, she followed me—she took a knife off my bench, where I was at work, and before I was aware of it she plunged it right into my thigh—It was a knife used in my business—Mr. Delabertouche was in the room. and wrested the knife from her, and threw it on the floor—the prisoner then took another knife up and attempted to stab Delabertouche—he asked here if she knew what she had done, that she had stabbed me—the said the did not care, she would cut my throat before the morning—I was then upon the ground—I had fallen off the chair, the blood flowed so from the wound when she plunged the knife into my thigh—I don't remember any thing further, for I fainted away, through the loss of blood—I had en<lb></lb>devoured to raise myself up, but could not—my thigh bled violently and I kept my bed for three weeks and better—It happened on the 27th of November—I can't rightly say how long I kept my bed—I don't remember the day I went before the Magistrate—I was up a little for three days before that, but not the whole of the day—the doctor has left me about a week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told my Lord you had been in bed for three weeks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well; I was flurried when I came into the place—I cannot say how long it was before I went to the Magistrate—she was committed on the 9th of this month—that was after I had walked to the office—I cannot any when I went—I do not think it was so soon as ten days after the occurrence—Deliberation took me away, that I should not injure her—that she should not injure me—the heat of passion might make me ill me her—I had not beaten her that night—I do not remember beating her for a month before—I will not swear that I had not beaten her within two days—I had not beaten her on that very occasion—she came home in liquor, and had drawn 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which she ought to have given me—I did not see a farthing of the shilling—I cannot say whether Mrs. Deliberation had the sixpence—I told the Magistrate that I heard her speak about selling plates and dishes, and it was read over to me—I told the Magis<lb></lb>trate that I heard her say she would sell something out of the room to Delabertouche's daughter—I went back into the room to see what is was—not to have another scuffle.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the same house with the pro<lb></lb>sector. On Friday, the 27th of November, I hear him send the prisoner out with a pair of shoes, about five o'clock, or a little after—I was in the room when she returned—she seemed a little the worse for liquor—she ordered the bed to be let down, and laid down on it—she used all the abusive language that ever came out of a woman's mouth—she laid down for about twenty minutes, using this abusive language, then got up deli<lb></lb>berately, took the poker from the fire-place, and used it on the pro<lb></lb>secutor—he received the blow on his arm in stopping it from his head—he then got up and went to resent it—I parted them, and took him into my room—a scuffle ensued between them—I parted them, to prevent fur<lb></lb>there mischief—he was in my room for twenty minutes, or half an hour and then the prisoner was going to take some things out of the place to sell—we overhead her speaking to my wife—the prosecutor then went into the prisoner's room, and I followed him—a scuffle ensued between them, close to the seat that he works by—the prosecutor wanted to stop his things from going out—she went to strike him, and he wanted to guard to blow off—I did not notice her take any thing off the seat, till the wound was inflicted—not till I saw the knife in her hand, and I rescued it—I saw her strike him, but did not see what it was done with till the blow was done, and then I saw the knife in her hand—I saw blood flow—I rescued the knife from her hand, and went to assist the prosecutor, who fainted away in the corner—they were both scuffling together when she plunged the knife—the prosecutor was standing up at the time the blow was inflicted—I did not see the prisoner at that moment, as I went to assist him as he fall into the corner, with his neck up—the prisoner seized another knife off the seat directly, and swore she would stab we as well—I immediately left the pro<lb></lb>secutor and ran up to her, seized the other knife, and succeded in getting that from her—I went to the prosecutor, and said to the prisoner, "See, are not you ashamed of yourself. seeing you have stabbed the man"—her answer was, "B—him, I wil; cut his b—throut before the night is over—directly afterwards, while I was assisting the prosecutor, she put on her bonnet and shawl, and ran down stairs—I instantly pursued her—the</p>

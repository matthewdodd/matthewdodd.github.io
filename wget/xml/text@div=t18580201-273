                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Brunswick Square, Camberwell, and am a horsekeeper—On 2d Jan., between the hours of 12 and a quarter to 1 o'clock in the night, I was standing opposite the Bull's Head, Camberwell, and the prisoner came up and asked me for a lucifer—I said I have not got one—he said <hi rend="italic">Liz</hi> is over the way—that is the prosecutor's wife—he asked me who was with her?—I said "George"; that is her husband—the prisoner went across towards them—he went to the bar to them—they had a few words, and Batchelor got his jacket half off—it was put on again, and I saw him make an attempt to strike at the prisoner, but whether he hit him or no, I cannot say—the landlord opened the door and told the prisoner to go out—(I was not close enough to hear the words they used)—the prisoner went out, and waited outside till Batchelor came out—Batchelor said "You want a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with me"—I did not hear the answer, but Batchelor took off his jacket, <hi rend="italic">squared</hi> at the prisoner, struck him, knocked him <hi rend="italic">agin</hi> the shutters of the grocer's shop, and then Batchelor got hold of him again, struck him about the legs, and threw him on the stones, tripped him over, and fell on him—I then saw a knife in the prisoner's hand, and saw him stab Batchelor with it three times in the neck—I was lifting Batchelor off him, or else I should not have seen it—a constable came up and pushed me on one side, and asked me what I did there?—I said "Look at him; he has been sticking him with a knife"—when they got up, they were both smothered in blood—Taylor tried to hit Batchelor, but I cannot say that he did, for Batchelor knocked him against the shop—when Batchelor came up I believe he spoke first, but I did not hear the words.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver. I was at the Bull's Head on this night—I went with the prosecutor at 12 o'clock, or a little before, to have something to drink—at half-past 12 o'clock, the prisoner came to where me and the prosecutor and his wife were standing—Taylor looked hard at Batchelor when he came in, and Batchelor said "What are you staring at?" they then began to quarrel, and call one another all sorts of obscene language—Isaid "Do not let us have any noise inside here—you had better <hi rend="italic">drop</hi> this altogether"—the prisoner said "You shall not have her," pointing to the woman; and Batchelor said that he would see him d—before he should have her—Batchelor was then in the act of taking his jacket off to fight, and I stopped him, and told him to put it on again—the landlord came and ordered the prisoner ont of the house, and he went—about ten minutes after<lb></lb>wards Batchelor went out and I directly after him; the woman was with him—the prisoner was waiting outside by the trough—I do not know who spoke first, but they began quarrelling, and Batchelor asked me to hold his jacket—I did so, and then he struck the prisoner, who returned it, and they closed and fell to the ground together, Batchelor at the top; he caught hold of him, as anybody else would, to throw him—I saw nothing of the knife, but I saw them both punching one another—a policeman came and took Bat<lb></lb>chelor off the prisoner, and then I saw blood, but did not know who it was from—the prisoner walked away about forty yards—he had nothing in his hand—he did not come back—the policeman had got Batchelor, and the woman caught hold of the prisoner and held him till the constable came up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Flowers, a surgeon, of Camberwell Green. On 2d Jan., about a quarter to 1 o'clock in the morning, I was called to the police station, and found Batchelor bleeding profusely from five wounds, two in the back of the neck, one of which penetrated to the bone, one on the right ear, and two on the right cheek, one of which was about half an inch deep, cutting through the cheek—they were clean cut wounds, such as this knife would inflict—if he had not been of a good constitution, and in good health at the time, erysipelas might have come on, and terminated fatally—I have attended him ever since, and shall have to do so, probably, a fortnight longer.</p>

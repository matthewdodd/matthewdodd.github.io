On Friday evening, the 16th of October, I went to my tea-caddy and found the prisoner's hat on it - I took it off and felt it was very heavy; I lifted up his handkerchief, which was in it, and found a phosphorus-box and a newspaper - I sent him up stairs, and called in a person who saw what was in it, and we sent for Mr. Clark; in about half an hour we searched his box, which he opened himself, and found in it one phosphorus-box, two snuff-boxes, two snuff-canisters, and a book, which are mine - these are the articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. COLLVER. Q. The prisoner expressed no reluctance to open his box? A. No; he did it by order of Mrs. Clark, his mistress - he is not my apprentice.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARK. I was in the shop while they went up stairs to open the box; the prisoner said he did not know how he came by the things; he knew they were Mr. Piaget's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you said any thing to him about being prosecuted? A. No; I told him as I had found him out in so many things, I would certainly go to the full extent of the law; he was apprenticed to me, but used to do a few things for the prosecutor, who is single; he has been a good boy till lately, when he has got some bad companions.</p>

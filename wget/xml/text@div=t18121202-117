            . We are assignees. I only know that the sashes were fixed in the window.</p>

               <p>JOHN KILBURN. I am a carpenter. I made the sashes.</p>
               <p>- CARROL. I am a watchman. On the 23d of November, about seven o'clock, a gentleman told me the prisoner had some sashes; he did not think the prisoner came by them honest. I went after the prisoner, and asked him how he came by them sashes. I sprang my rattle. He ran away, and left the sashes with me. A watchman brought him back, and at the watchhouse he said he got them in that house.</p>

            . The prisoner was brought to me at the watchhouse. I found on him an instrument for getting sashes out, a knife, and a key. He denied his name. He would not say who he was, nor where he came from.</p>
               <p>Q. to Kilburn. Where were these sashes taken from - A. They were taken from Kilburn-place; there is my writing on them. I wrote that on them before they were taken to the house. I am sure they belong to the building. I made them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The sashes were standing at the corner of a street; a man told me if I would take them to a public-house he would satisfy me for my trouble, and as I came along he told the watchman to stop me. I do not know any reason for it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). On 16th Aug., about 9 o'clock in the morning, I saw Lawrence; he had a pony and chaise, and drove from Upper Thames-street to Rutland-wharf, Mr. Green's warehouse—I watched him, as I had done previously, and saw him back his cart under the archway of Mr. Green's warehouse—I then saw Barnes go on to the mill floor, and shoot through the ceiling three parts of a sack of corn—I saw him take the sack, wheel it up to the post, and empty it through the shoot into another sack that Stiles was holding underneath; he then fetched another sack partly rail, and shot the contents of that also through the shoot into the same sack, which made the sack full—Stiles then tied it up, lowered it into the cart, and Lawrence got into his cart and received it—another man in Messrs. Green's employ then came out of the mill, which is another part of the premises, and brought a sack half full, which he handed up to Lawrence in the cart; his name is Randall, he is not to be found—ten minutes after<lb></lb>wards I saw Lawrence at a public house in Earl-street, with two other men, not the prisoners—after they had been there five minutes they came out; he turned his cart round, and went up Rutland wharf again, with two more men of Mr. Green's—when he bed got some distance, I and May stopped him—I said, "We are police officers, and I want to know what you have in those sacks "—he said, "Only some sweepings, Sir, from Messrs. Green and Sedg<lb></lb>wick's"—I said, "Let me look at it"—he opened the sack, which was half full, and I found it contained sweepings mixed with split beam—he then opened the other sack, and that I found contained oats, but the mice had got into it, and apparently eaten it—I said, "What did you give for it?"—he said, "I gave 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the sack of oats, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the men to get some beer with, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for this bit of stuff," meaning we smaller sack—I said, "Who did you pay?"—he said, "I gave Stiles 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave Randall four sixpences"—I then took him to the station—about a quarter past 10 o'clock went to Messrs. Green's, and Stiles was sent for into the counting home—said to him, "We are police officers: what account have you to give of the sacks of corn which you have sent away by the man Lawrence?"—he said, "I only sent away a sack of sweepings, for which I received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—Mr. Green asked Stiles, in my presence, if he had received any other money—he said, "No"—he asked him if he had received any money for beer—we said, "No"—Barnes was afterwards sent for—I told him that we were police officers, and said, "You have been assisting to send away some sacks</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Green and Sedgwick, corn mer<lb></lb>chants, of Rutland-wharf. Barnes and Stiles were in our employ for some years; we placed great confidence in them—we have sometimes sweepings in our warehouse—the prisoners have a right to sell them, and pay the proceeds to the clerk, which is entered in a book—we had some oats in our warehouse, no person had any right to sell them—I have seen this corn and sweepings; we had such corn in our warehouse, and I believe it to be our's—the sack of oats was bitten by rats, but was of considerable value—the oats found in the sack are worth 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the sweepings, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is an entry on 16th Aug. by Stiles, "1 sack of sweepings, Lawrence "—the clerk does not come till 9 o'clock, and when he comes, Stiles would hand over the money to him—we had split beans in the warehouse; he had no right to sell them as sweepings, not to the extent that they are there—here is more than ordinary, there should be only one fourth—my impression is that these must have been split beans placed pur<lb></lb>posely there—there was scarcely a handful of sweepings among the oats, it was scarcely to be called sweepings—I told Stiles that Lawrence had been taken to the station house, and that some oats were found in his possession, which I examined—he first said that they were sweepings and were on the floor, but I told him I had seen them, and examined them, and should give him in custody of the police; he pleaded very hard for forgiveness, regretted that things should come to such a pass as that, and begged roe to look over it—he said that Lawrence gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for beer—I then told Barnes that Stiles was taken into custody on a charge of stealing the corn—he first said that he did not deliver anything; then he said, "Only just a little;" then he said that he delivered more, and pleaded hard for mercy—they had both been in our employment sixteen or seventeen years.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). I went to Lawrence's house, and in an upper room found some corn mixed with sweepings—it was oats, beans, and</p>

               <p>other things; six sacks of it—I learned, after he was remanded, that he lived at No. 120, Vauxhall-wharf, but had got a house on Eyre street-hill—I saw his father there.</p>

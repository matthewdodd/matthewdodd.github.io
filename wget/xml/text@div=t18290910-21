About twelve o'clock on the 1st of August, the prisoner and another came to ask the price of a book; I went into the street to see which book they meant, and while I went out the prisoner took this book and went away - when I went in I missed it; a man pursued him; I observed him in the shop, and am able to say he was one of the persons; I saw it at the office again in about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you came to the office did you not say you did not miss the book? A. No; I missed a book; my son came in directly after and I told him - I could not leave the shop myself.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner at she top of the Haymarket with another - the prisoner looked into several shops, and then I saw him go into the prosecutors and bring out the book; he put his handkerchief over it, and put it under his coat - I followed him to she top of the Haymarket, and was going to take him - he dropped the book - I took it up; I still followed, and saw him taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You saw me came out of the shop? A. Yes; and you turned and went up the Arcade; I was close to you - I was behind a pillar when I saw you go into the shop; the other did not come out of the shop when you did; I have not been a witness here above twenty times; I am often walking out on business, early and late.</p>
               <p>GEORGE AVIS. I was sent by order of Mr. Dyer of Mr. Jeffery's - he said there was a book missing from there, but he did not know what book it was.</p>

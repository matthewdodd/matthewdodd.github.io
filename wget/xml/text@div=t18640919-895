                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Heath, and reside at 62, Barnsbury-road, Islington—on 7th September, I was going along Old Change, and my dress caught in a packing-case—I had my portmonnaie and watch in my hand, and as I was extricating my dress with my umbrella, the prisoner caught hold of me, and took the purse and watch from me—I caught bold of his hand, and he dropped the things on the pavement—a gentleman then caught hold of him and gave him in charge—this is my watch and port<lb></lb>monnaie (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my chain did not catch in the packing-case—it was a short one, attached from my brooch to the watch.</p>

On 7th September, I was on duty in St. Paul's Churchyard, and was called by a young man, who said there was a pickpocket in Paternoster-row—I ran there, and saw the prisoner, and two gentlemen, one on each side of him—they said, "This lad has picked the lady's pocket of her watch and purse"—the lady then gave him into custody—he was searched at the station, and a pocket-knife and an old comb was all I found on him—he gave me an address, which I found correct—I saw his father and mother there.</p>

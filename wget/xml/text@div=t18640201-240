                  </hi>. I carry on business at 28, Newgate-market—Thomas Hales of Woodstock-street, is a customer of mine—on 28th November, about half-past 11 or 12 o'clock, the prisoner came and said, "I have come for some shoulders of mutton for Mr. Hales"—I said, "Do you mean Mr. Thomas Hales?"—he said, "Yes"—I delivered eleven shoulders of mutton to him, and he took them away—he afterwards came back, and said that he wanted twelve—I put them in the scale again and weighed them; they weighed 115 lbs.—he said, "That will do," and took them away—I saw him ten days afterwards, and said, "Have you found those shoulders of mutton?"—he said, "No"—I said, "You must go to Mr. Hales"—he said that he had been, and could not make out anything about him—I never saw him again—I believe I had seen him before in the market—I delivered them be<lb></lb>cause I believed he came from Mr. Hales.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in Woodstock-street, and occasionally deal with Mr. Foskett—I never authorised the prisoner to go there for any mutton, nor did he bring me any—I never saw these shoulders—I may have spoken to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was sent by a butcher, who came up in a cart for twelve shoulders, in the name of Hales. He gave me only eleven; there were six first, and then five. I went back and said that there were only eleven. I fetched them, and they weighed the same as if there were twelve.</p>

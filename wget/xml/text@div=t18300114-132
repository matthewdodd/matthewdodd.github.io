               <p>WILLIAM TILLING. I am a Police-officer. On the morning of the robbery I saw the prosecutor, the prisoner, and another young woman, against a coffee-stand in Holborn, about two o'clock; one of them got off the stool, and let the prosecutor into the mud; the prosecutor gave me notice of the robbery the next day - the prisoner has been in the habit of walking Holborn, but I missed her for a fortnight - when I saw her again I took her, and she denied it.</p>

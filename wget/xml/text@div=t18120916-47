I was speaking to a young woman; I had missed my road I wanted to know the name of the street, and the nearest way to Drury-lane; and while the young woman and me were talking together, Griffiths and his companion came up to me. Griffiths said, you must not answer, if you do you will be served; so he pushed me against the wall, and put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, and took from thence a snuff-box; there was nothing in it but a little snuff.</p>
               <p>Q. What might it be worth - A. Six-pence; it was a tin-japanned box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Griffiths before - A. Never; when he got away the box, he turned from me. I said you have robbed me of my box. He said, no, he had not. I replied you have; and if you do not deliver it up, I shall call the watch. He turned round, and threw the snuff-box away under a gate-way. He said to his companion, strike him; his companion directly up with his fist, and knocked me down. Griffiths struck me six or seven times after I was down I called watch, and his companion ran down the street, and Griffiths ran under a gate-way. The watchman came up; I told him I had been knocked down and robbed. I described the prisoner. The watchman found the prisoner up the gate way; up the same gate-way he had chucked the snuff-box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him run up the gate way - A. Yes, and told the watchman. I saw he was lame as he ran away. He was without hat or coat.</p>

            . I am watchman in George-street. I heard the call of watch; I ran immediately, I saw Hill; he said he was robbed of a snuff-box. He said the man that robbed him was lame. I went into the Phoenix yard. I found the prisoner there; he had no coat or hat on. He is lame, and I found the snuffbox just under the gate-way. I afterwards took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence The prosecutor states of my having assaulted and robbed him; whereas I was only passing by near where this unfortunate accident happened. I wish to ask the watchman, whether he has not known me as a quiet inhabitant of that place.</p>
               <p>Lane I have known the prisoner two or three years; I never heard any thing against him until this time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

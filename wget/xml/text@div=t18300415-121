            . I am under gardener at Holly-lodge. On Monday, the 15th of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, I discovered that the conservatory window had been slided back, and the door communicating with the yellow drawing-room was forced open by cutting the wood away from the lock - I observed footsteps outside the conservatory just under the window which was drawn back, and just within the conservatory on the border was another footstep; that was about two yards from the yellow drawing-room door - I went to the kitchen and told Snow, who accompanied me to the spot.</p>

            . I am a broker and appraiser, and live at Brentford; I have known Plummer several years. On Monday, the 15th of February, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the parlour of the Halfway-house between Knightsbridge and Kensington - my horse was at the door; Mrs. Brain and lvemey were also there - while I was there the prisoner Plummer came in; he said he had taken the liberty, seeing my horse at the door, to come in and inform me of some articles he knew of for sale - he said they were the property of a gentleman who had been speculation in the funds and was ruined; that an acquaintance of his, who worked for the family, had the selling of them, and they were to be sold a great bargain, and if I would give him two guineas be would take me to where they were to be sold - he did not mention what the things were; he said they asked 10l. for them - I then left my horse at the door, and went with him to the Lamb and Flag, James-street, Oxford-street; he left me in there while he went to see if the person was at home, as he told me - he returned in three or four minutes with the prisoner Oakes; I had never seen him before - he introduced him as the person who had the selling of the things; Oakes said he had the selling of the articles - that they were the property of a gentleman who had been speculating in the funds and was ruined; that he lived in a square close by - he took me to his house, in Gee's-court, and showed me two vases and a clock; the clock had been taken to pieces; two of the glass pillars were broken, and it was in such a state I could not ascertain whether it was all there - I asked where the glass shade of the clock was; Oakes said it was kept by the gentleman, to prevent his disposing of his property being noticed, and he had put a figure of Hercules under it; he said there would be a set of mahogany chairs, and two feather beds to he disposed of by the same gentleman - we returned to the public-house, and he then asked me 10l. for the two vases and clock; I told him they were not worth it, and declined buying at that price - I hid him 5l. and went away - I returned to Knightsbridge, and had got within one hundred yards of my horse when Plummer overtook me, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150066"></xptr>said they had been to the gentleman, who was very much in want of money, and if I would give him the two guineas I was to have the articles for the 5l. - I told him I had been considering of it, but as I was not satisfied the whole of the clock was there, I would give him 10s. then and 1l. if it turned out to be all there; we then returned to the public-house in James-street - Oakes was there; he agreed to take the money, and we went to Gee's-court; Plummer stopped behind to mind my horse, which I had taken with me to the public-house; I and Oakes went into his house, in Gee's-court - he lent me a basket and some wrappers; Plummer then came and I packed them up - I told him I must have a receipt for the money - they got a stamp and Plummer wrote the receipt for Oakes, as he said he could not write; Plummer asked him if his name was not Langston; he said Yes, and Plummer wrote that name; here is the receipt - (read) "February 15, 1830.

Oakes made the cross to it; I paid the money, and took away the articles; I put the money on the table, Oakes' wife took it up, and said he had better leave it at home, as he was going to return to the public-house - Plummer went with me to Oxford-street; I changed a sovereign, gave him 10s, and went home - I applied to Trail, a watch and clockmaker, at Brentford, to repair the clock for me, and on the Saturday I pawned the clock and vases for 6l. with Mr. Butcher; I heard nothing more till a Police-officer applied to me on Wednesday, the 24th, while I was out; I went to the Castle, at Brentford, by Butcher's direction, and met the Duke of St. Alban's steward - a gentleman who had repaired the clock, and Curtis, the officer, came in; they were the persons I expected to meet - Curtis took me into custody, and made inquiry of me; I went with him to Oxford-street - I rode my horse and Curtis drove a gig; we went to Oakes' house, in Gee's-court, and the first person we met was Plummer, at the door, just going out - that was before we had got into the house - I said,"Oh, you are the man I want," he then endeavoured to escape - I seized him, and called for the officer to come up, and gave him to the officer; we then went into the house, and found Oakes laying on the floor in a blanket - there was a female there; they were playing together, and I think he was rather in liquor - I told him I wanted him; he asked what for; I said "The clock you have sold me is stolen;" he denied having sold me a clock - Curtis came up. and I gave him in charge; Plummer was in hearing at the time - Oakes said he had never sold me a clock; we took them into custody - I went before Mr. Swabey, at Union-hall; Curtis said I was still to consider myself in custody, and the Magistrate remanded the case; I was kept in custody till the Wednesday following, when the case was proceeded in - Mr. Chambers set me at liberty, and bound me over to give evidence.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it true that you took Oakes to the Police-office? A. I took Plummer; I seized him first; I might have gone away myself if I had liked, for I was in my cart, and took Plummer in it - I considered myself with the officer, and in custody certainly; he said, I must consider myself in custody - I remained in custody a week all but a day; I have been a broker all my life - I have been in business thirteen years; there were some persons in the room at the Lamb and Flag, but not that I knew - I should think they were near enough to hear our conversation; the young man at the bar saw us together - I am not aware whether he could hear our conversation; his name is Greg - he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you in the conversation not to ask what the things were you were to buy? A. I deal in every kind of articles; he described them as articles which he took me to see - I did not ask what they were; I bought them to sell again, and I considered I was giving the fair value for them in their then state - the clock was repaired before I pawned it; Plummer said he had not the money, or he would purchase them himself - I have not got the account from the clock-maker for the repairs; I did not tell him where I got them - he asked me no questions on the subject; Oakes was rather tipsy when he was taken, but not to be stupified; I do not know where the Duke of St. Alban's lives.</p>

The works of this clock have been in my care - it was then all to pieces; in the state it was I should not think any body could ascertain whether it was perfect or not - I had it on the 15th of February to put the stand together, and set the works in a going state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you the chrystal work? A. No - I afterwards fastened it on the chrystal work; I have no idea of the value, never having seen one of the description - I never asked Kilsby where he got it.</p>

            . I was in the service of Kilsby, and accompanied him to London when the prisoners were taken - I was present when Plummer was being conveyed to Union-hall, and on the road he said he did not know what he was taken for, or what he was going upon; Kilsby told him it was about the clock - he said he did not know what clock, he had had nothing to do with any clock; and afterwards, as we were going down Regent-street, he said, "I had nothing to do with it, you know, I only recommended you - I did not know it was stolen, any more than you did; you gave me 10s., and the other one gave me a crown;" I asked him if he meant the man in the other gig - he said, "No, don't swear any man's life away, I did not say he was the man;" I said, "No, you did not say so - I only asked you if he was the man" -Kilsby, Plummer, and myself were in one cart, Curtis, his man, and Oakes in the other; there was no officer in our cart - Plummer said if it was perfect when it was put together, Kilsby was to give him 1l. more.Cross-examined. Q. He said this openly before you? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am servant at the Lamb and Flag, Oxford-street. I saw Kilsby at Martin's house - there were two others with him; I know Plummer to be one, but cannot say whether Oakes is the other - I did not hear their conversation; there were other people in the tap-room, but whether in their company I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CURTIS. I am an officer. In consequence of information of this robbery I went to Brentford, on the 24th of February, with Mr. Harrison, the Duke's secretary, and Mr. Smart - we went to a glass-shop, and from there to Butcher's, and found the clock and vases; I went to Kilsby - he was not at home; we went to the Castle, and Kilsby came there - I told him he must consider himself in custody; he accompanied us to Gee's-court, Oxford-street - we there found the prisoners, and took them- Oakes asked what he was apprehended for; I told him for selling a stolen clock - he said he never had a clock and never sold one, and that he was not worth 18d. in the world.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he sober? A. He was the worse for liquor, he was tipsy; there is a marine-store shop at the house in Gee's-court.</p>
               <p>Plummer's Defence. I am totally innocent; I never saw the things till they were in Oakes' shop, and never had them in my possession - I met Kilsby and told him I had seen such articles for sale, and 20l. was asked for them; Oakes told me it was left at his shop for sale by some people - I was not present when it was sold, nor when Kilsby bargained for it.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and lodge in Gee's-court, in the same house as Oakes. I saw him on Saturday, the 13th of February last - I think it was about a week before he was taken up; I saw him on Sunday, the 14th, about half-past twelve o'clock, when he left the house to go to dine, as he generally dines out on Sunday at his mother's - he slept at his own house on the Saturday night, for I saw him at half-past eleven and twelve o'clock that night, and again about eight in the morning, at his own door; he came in on Sunday night, about half-past eleven o'clock - I let him in; he had nothing with him, I am certain - I saw him go into his own room; I saw him again about half-past seven in the morning, but I spoke to him about seven o'clock, and he answered me from his bed.</p>

            . I am married, and live at No. 9, Waterloo-road. I lived in New-cut, Lambeth, on the 13th of February. I was in company with Oakes on Sunday, the 14th of February, from four o'clock in the afternoon, till half-past ten a might - I was at his wife's mother's, No. 9, Prospect-place, St. George's-fields, and took tea with her; he was there the whole time.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been acquainted with him? A. Twelve years - he was in my husband's employ eight years out of that time; it was not the last eight years - he was our ostler: since that I believe he has been in the bird-fancying and brokering trade; we lived at Bath, and let out carts to fetch coals and things; he carried on the bird-fancying and brokering in Westminster-road some part of the time, and I believe he was in the same capacity in Oxford-street - I have been at his shop in Gee's-court: there is no shop of his there now; he sold birds there - I have seen birds and cages; he dealt in ironmongery, I believe, there - my husband has been dead fourteen years; since that I have lived with my father in the New-cut; he was living in Waterloo-road, and is a broker - I always understood Oakes to be married.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was at his wife's mother's? A. The wife, her mother, myself, and Oakes, those were the only persons there in the course of the evening - I believe he had dined there; he usually dines there on Sundays - I was told he had dined there; his wife's mother is not here - I have not seen her this fortnight; I believe she was well when I saw her.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You dined at two o'clock? A.

            . I am the last witness' husband, and Plummer's brother. On Sunday, the 14th of February, he was at my house, and on Monday morning I left him in the house, about nine o'clock, when I went out.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had he lived in your house any time? A. From about the middle of December; he occupied part of my house till he could get a convenient shop - he was looking out for a shop; he had quitted business, except going to different sales - I am a broker and appraiser; he carried on the business of a green-grocer and coal-dealer, at Chelsea - my name is not over my door at present, as the house has been repaired; the name never has been there - I only went there the beginning of December; I have the lease of the house - I could not begin business there till I got my premises repaired; I do no business at home, but attend sales - I opened a shop about a fortnight back; there has been a calamitous fire opposite my house, and four people burnt to death - the children lay at my house, and my time has been taken up with them, and the gentlemen of the parish, who are making a collection for the sufferers, and I have not been able to attend to business; I have sold a few articles in my shop - I expose goods outside and inside; the house has only had one coat of paint - if I had not been waiting for the decision of the fire-office, about the paint being damaged, the name would have been over the door; the fire was last Monday fortnight - my brother and I were very good friends till five or six days previous to his leaving my house, which was on the Friday after the 15th; he had then suited himself if with a house in Thomas-street, Oxford-street - I did not know of his having an acquaintance named Oakes or Langston; I never knew my brother live in Gee's-court - I know Gee's-court; it is full of old iron and broker's shops - I do not know one in particular; I did not go before the Magistrate - I heard my brother was in custody two or three days after it happened, and went to Union-hall, to state that he was at my house, but was prevented by an officer from going in - I told him I came as a witness, and Mr. Malham, a broker, at Chelsea, was there; he is an acquaintance of both of us; he went with me to prove he knew him, and Mr. Butt, a broker, was there, merely to prove he knew him - my wife did not go; we dined by ourselves on Sunday, and my brother, his wife, and children by themselves; I dined about half-past one or two o'clock, and had a loin of roast pork, and my brother had a roast or baked leg of pork; he supported himself by disposing of some of his property till he could get a shop; he had carts and two horses, and sold one horse while with me, to a butcher at Chelsea, I believe - we had quarrelled on the Friday evening, and did not dine together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whose hand-writing is that (the body of the receipt)? A. I cannot say; I have seen my brother write; I will not swear it is not his hand-writing - it is something similar to his writing; he writes very bad - if I could see the name signed I could tell whether it was his;(looking at the signature) - I cannot say whether this is his writing; it is very much blotted; the J. appearslike his, but as for any other letter I cannot say; the most I have seen of his writing was signing his name - I do not believe the body of the receipt to be his writing; the name Jouathan seems like his writing, and I believe it to be his - I never heard him mention the name of Langston.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Plummer. When I was asked to write the receipt there was another person in Oakes' shop, who I considered I was writing the receipt for.</p>

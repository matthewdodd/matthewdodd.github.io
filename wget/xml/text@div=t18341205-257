                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe-maker, and live in High-street, Shadwell. The prisoner was six or seven months in my employ, making women's shoes—on Saturday evening, the 29th of November, he brought home four pairs—I examined his work, and saw one particular pair among them which I doubted whether he had made—I said I never saw a pair in my life so much like Wallis's make—he said they had been on the last the whole week—I paid him part of his money, not having suffi<lb></lb>cient silver, and he went away—he came again about nine o'clock the same evening—he had half-a-crown in his hand, and said he had brought me a customer—I looked round, but could see no one—he then said Mrs. Stephen wished to purchase this pair of shoes, and she had already tried them—I refused to sell them, and told him I considered he was a guilty man—some customers then came in, I attended to them—I said to the boy, "Put those shoes aside"—the prisoner then went through the shop, saying she had better come herself—when the prisoner was gone, the shoes were missing—they had been where the customers could not reach them without being observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean by saying he was a guilty man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he must have taken these shoes from the shop, and brought them in again—my charge relates to both the first and second taking.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you demand payment of the prisoner for the shoes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I refused to sell them to him—he said Mrs. Septhen wished to pur<lb></lb>chase them, and I would not sell them—he lived in lodgings—I used to give him work, and he made it and brought it home—he did journey-work—he has no stated wages.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many pairs had he to make? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eight pairs—he brought in four pairs then—I have not seen the others since he was taken up—he had not brought in that pair before: they had been brought in by another man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever said they may be in your shop now for what you know? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but he said he had not taken them—we</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to the prosecutor. I remember the prisoner bringing in four pairs of shoes—he came again and talked about buying one pair for Mrs. Septhen—my master told me to put a pair on one side—I took them off the counter and put them on the little table in the parlour—I came out—I did not see any one go in—I thought the girl was there lighting a fire, when I put them in—they were missed soon after—I did not see any one go into that room—I do not know whether the prisoner saw me go in with them—he was in the shop, and was nearest to the room—there were customers in the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was the prisoner when you put the shoes on the table? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a yard from the parlour in the shop—I saw him go out in a few minutes after I put the shoes on the table—I did not see him have any thing with him—there were four or five customers in the shop trying on girls' boots—there was one woman, two men, and two or three children—I went past the prisoner to go to my mistress, whom I was helping to serve the customers—she is not here—she was about two yards from the parlour door—the prisoner came again about eleven o'clock, and asked why his character was disgraced at Mr. Forty's—he might have asked for his wages, but I did not hear him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Forty. The prisoner worked for the shop—I was coming from the stairs to the little parlour that night, and saw him in the shop—I was then lighting the fire—I did not see Darby go in with the shoes—I did not see the shoes in the parlour, but I saw the prisoner in the shop, within half a yard of the little parlour, with a pair of shoes in his hand, pinching the toes—they were a pair of woman's leather slippers—I turned to get a light, and saw the prisoner go out of the shop with the shoes in his left hand—the shoes were missed in four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You never saw him in the parlour at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw him distinctly with the shoes in his left hand—his back was to<lb></lb>wards me—any body could see the shoes in his hand if they were not en<lb></lb>gaged—this was about nine o'clock—he came back again about eleven o'clock—I heard my master say to the boy, "Where are the shoes?" and the boy said, "They are not there"—I then said, "I saw Swift go out with a pair of shoes"—Swift never went into the room—he was near the door—I might have been making up the fire when the boy was in the room—I did not see him—the table is about a yard and a half from the fire.</p>

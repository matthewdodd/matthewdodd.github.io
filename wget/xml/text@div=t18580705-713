I last saw them safe on 31st May—I spoke to Simkins several times about it, and inquired whether any one had been in the place and taken it away, but could get no information from him—I afterwards saw four of the handkerchiefs at the station, a scarf at his mother's house, and four more were given to the policeman by his mother; I also saw some at some hawkers that I went round to with the policeman.</p>

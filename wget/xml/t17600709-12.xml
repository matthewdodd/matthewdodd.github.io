Then I heard the cry of the children, increased my suspicion; when he was as near me as he chose to come. I said, Hollow, you sir, you have robb'd the children, very loud; he turned short from me; I pursued him; he made up to the wall of the reservoir, to the fouth part of it: I kept so that he should not get to London. I said, Hollow, I shall have you; when he came to the wall he put his hand under his coat, and pull'd out this bundle (producing a bundle in paper) and went to throw it over the wall into the water, it hit against the wall, and fell back again; then he took it up again, and throwed it over, where it was found: then I was convinced he had robb'd the children, and I call'd out stop thief. I pursued him to the corner of the now road. Mr. King was amongst his sheep, he came to my assistance, and we secured him; and the children came and said, that man (pointing to him) had robb'd them. We took him to Hicks's Hall, there justice Wright committed him.</p>

               <p>I overtook the girl about 30 yards behind the boy; at last I overtook the boy; he asked me, if that was the way to the new road. I said, I will show you the way, it is straight forward; I went into the field in order to ease myself, and saw him run back to his sister; when I had done I got up, and went, and made the best of my way to where I was going, which was to Noble street, by Goswell street. I found this bundle in the grass I took it up, I did not know any thing about it, presently I heard the sound of crying; I made the best of my way to that gentleman, Mr. Crump; he turned and made towards me; said he what are you. what have you got there? as I understood. I said, nothing of your's, nor no body's else, as I know of; said he I'll have you; so with that I made an attempt to throw the parcel over the wall, it fell down, I took it up again, and throw'd it over.</p>

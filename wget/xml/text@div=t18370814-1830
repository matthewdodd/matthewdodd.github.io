I have a copy of the register of a marriage—I examined it with the original—I know Eliza O'Neal, to whom the prisoner was married—I have seen her alive within this month, or thereabout—she is the same person who was married to the prisoner by the name of Eliza O'Neal, on the 24th of July, 1820, at St. James' Westminster.</p>

                  </hi>. I was married to the prisoner at the parish church of Mylon, in Ireland, fourteen years ago, in 1822—was separated after Christmas last—I was in no situation, when he married—I lived with my father and mother—the prisoner told me he was a widower—I separated because I heard that he had another wife—we had a family of four children—one is alive, the others are dead—I instituted this prosecution—the prisoner obliged me to go to the Magistrate—he said he would not give me a penny to buy bread—I had no property except a house of furniture which my father gave me, and I have worked at making worsted shoes.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see Richard Wyatt before you prosecuted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I found the prisoner had a wife better than six months ago—I tried him every way before I would punish him, and he would not support me—I found he had a wife because she drew his money—he is a pensioner—I found that out before Christmas—I knew he was a married man better than two years ago. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at Chelsea, on the 12th of July.</p>

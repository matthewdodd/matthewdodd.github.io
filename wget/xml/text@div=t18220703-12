On Wednesday, the 9th of June, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the Coffee-room, and had a glass of rum and water, he had a tea spoon with it. In about ten minutes the waiter intimated his suspicion - I watched the prisoner through a window which looked into the Coffee-room, and saw him looking very intently into a large cupboard in the Coffee-room - he then walked up and down the room twice; I sent for Smith, the officer, who waited in the room, and in about half an hour the prisoner came out; I told him, after what I had seen, I must have him searched, and gave him to Smith. He wanted to return to the Coffee-room, but I prevented him. I saw the officer find a table spoon in his side pocket - there were table spoons placed in different parts of the room. It had the letters R. A. on it, which are the initials of a person who kept the house formerly. He said nothing.</p>

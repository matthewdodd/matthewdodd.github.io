                  </hi>. I am in the Royal Artillery, at Woolwich. I had a medal, which was given to me by the Royal Humane Society—I saw it safe on the night of 22nd Oct.—it was attached to the same coat I have on now—I did not miss it until it was brought to me by the police-constable—I had not been wearing that coat—I had no occasion to wear it until the police<lb></lb>man brought the medal, on 25th Oct.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—between Sunday, the 22nd, and 25th Oct., when the medal was brought to me, my coat was on a shelf in the barrack room, kept for that purpose—the prisoner belongs to the same battalion—he was frequently in the room where the Coat was—duty called him there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, living in Monkford-street. On Wednesday, 25th Oct., I was in the shop of Mr. Wightman, Wellington-street, trying to sell him some clothes—the prisoner came in—he put his foot on mine, and gave me a wink—I went out, and waited a minute or two—then the prisoner came out, and said, "I have got something to sell"—I said, "Let me look at it"—we went towards Wellington-street, when, next door to a silversmith's shop, he took the medal produced out of the sleeve of his great coat—I thought it must be wrong, and asked him how much he wanted for it—he said, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—to find out how he got it, I said, "I will give you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I afterwards offered 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he went into the silver<lb></lb>smith's shop, and asked what it was worth—the man said, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said to the prisoner, "I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, no, he would take 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I would give no more, and he agreed to take 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him to give me change for a half sovereign—he could not—he went into a shop to get change—I spoke to the man in my own language, and said I did not want change—I then asked him for change—he refused to give it—I said to the prisoner, "Wait a bit; I will get change"—I went to the police station, and brought a policeman with me—when the prisoner saw the policeman with me he ran away—I did not see him again till he was in the station house, the same evening—the policeman pursued him, but did not catch him—I was sure at the station that he was the person.</p>

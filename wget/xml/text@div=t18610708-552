                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Stanley, of 41, Booth-street, Spitalfields—on 15th June, I went out about half-past 10 o'clock, leaving the two ground-floor rooms locked up—I returned in less than ten minutes—I had left no one in the lower rooms, but there were people in the rooms over me—I left the outer door open—that opens into a passage, not into a room—we have two rooms—I locked the outer one—it had been forced open when I returned, and the room was full of our wearing apparel strewed about; I could not get in for it—I saw a man there—I cannot say who; he knocked me down at the door, and I saw him go over me with two coats on—he ran out at the front-door—I called, "Police"—I missed two coats, worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; one was my husband's, and the other my son's—I cannot swear to the prisoner; he looked stouter by having two coats on—the man was about his height.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GENT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he leave the house-door open when he went out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Both doors—the gas runs up against my door—the blue pilot-coat had a cloth collar, and the other coat a velvet collar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fancy-box-maker, of 46, Booth-street; the prosecutor's house is No. 47, and the numbers run straight. On Saturday evening, 15th June, I was standing two doors off Mrs. Stanley's, and saw her go out—I saw her go in again, and saw the prisoner knock her down as she went in—there was another old lady there, and he jumped over her and ran down the street; he came by me and I tried to stop him—he was three or four yards from me—there was an old lady in the middle of the road; he ran</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186107080014"></xptr>
               <p>against her, knocked her down, and fell himself—he ran as far as the Bull's Head public-house; I ran after him, and saw him run into a policeman's arms, he then pulled off his coat and put it over his arm—the policeman took him back to Booth-street, to the old lady who he had knocked down last; but she said that she could not swear to him, and the policeman let him go—I went close to see what was going on—the coat was a dark-blue pilot-coat and had a velvet collar; it was an over-coat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I ran and tried to stop him, and caught hold of his coat—that was when I saw him knock down the first old lady—I knew it was Mr. Stanley's coat, because I have seen him wearing it; but did not know that the prisoner had stolen it—I ran after him with another young girl—when the prisoner took off the coat, the policeman asked him whose property it was, and he said that it was his own—it was three-quarters of an hour between the policeman taking him and letting him go; he took him again when he heard of the robbery—I was only about five minutes in the presence of the policeman and the prisoner—I said nothing about the other old lady—the prisoner did not run very fast; I was able to keep up with him for about twenty-five yards, and was close to him when he went into the policeman's arms.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GENT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mrs. Stanley appear to identify him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; after he was taken the second time, I made a communication of what I had seen—the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 185). I was in Booth-street about half-past 10, and saw the prisoner running and a lot of boys and two or three females behind him—I caught him in my arms; he wanted to know what it was for, I said, "You are the first to come up"—I asked him what it was—he said, "I have just knocked a female down in the street"—he had two coats on; the under one was black cloth and had a velvet collar buttoned over, the other was a loose pilot-coat—he had got that over the other; he wanted to take it off, but I would not let him—a female came up to me, and I went in search of the prisoner, and took him a quarter of an hour afterwards at the Bull's Head—I charged him with striking and knocking down a woman, and taking two coats—he said that he knew nothing about it—he had two coats, one with a velvet collar and one without.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there 200 or 300 people surrounding you! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and there were fifty or sixty boys and girls running after him—I cannot say whether the prisoner had three coats, he had the under one buttoned all down—scarcely five minutes after I had let him go a woman in black told me to take him—it was not the prosecutrix—I went to the house before I took him the second time.</p>

On the 30th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I saw a man and woman in the shop - the prisoner served them with a piece of cheese; I passed by them, and saw the woman had a half-crown laying on the counter - I went to the door and heard the half-crown taken, and change given, but I did not hear it drop into the till - I turned back; the prisoner was shutting the till - I saw his right hand was closed, and I judged the half-crown was in it; he went to the back of the shop, and took up a book - I asked what he was looking for, he said he was looking for an entry - I said I would look for that, and told him to go and serve a customer; he still had his right-hand closed - he could not serve, and he put his hand into his inner coat pocket, and took it out open - I called him and another young man into the parlour, and asked him to allow me to put my hand into his coat pocket, which I did, and found this half-crown in it - it was his duty to put the money immediately into the till; he ought never to put it into his pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where is the till? A. We have two; the one he ought to have put this into is farthest from the door: he then went to the desk, was turning the book over, and looking for some entries he had no business with; money that is taken is never entered there - I will not swear I said, "You have a half-crown," but I think I did; I believe I told him he deserved to be kicked out, and he ought to be ashamed to rob me in that manner - I cannot swear I did not order him to leave my house; he said his boxes could be searched, and there was nothing there of mine.</p>

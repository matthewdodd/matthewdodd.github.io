                  </hi>. I live at 40, Down Street, Soho—on Saturday, 21st July, I was in Old Compton Street at about 11.50 when the prisoner staggered against me three times—I said to him "You ought to go home like a decent man and not insult people in the street"—he said "You go borne or I will knock your head off"—he then flung me down—I had my hand in a sling—I missed my gold Albert and locket from my breast, which was quite safe before I saw the prisoner—I said when I got up "My Albert is gone"—I have seen is it since—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were about 100 people about—I was near some shops—a crowd formed directly—the prisoner went away—I had drunk a quartern of gin at a public-house, or perhaps two or three, not more, and two pints of ale and a drink of water with my supper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a joiner—I was in Old Compton Street on 21st July, about 12 p.m.—I saw a crowd and saw the prosecutor and prisoner fall together—the prisoner when on his knees was attempting to put an Albert in his left trowsers pocket, but he did not succeed—some one took hold of his left arm—I said "He has got your Albert"—I did not see any more.</p>

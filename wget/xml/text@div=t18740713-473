                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Rogers Herbert, the Royal Academician, and live with him at the Chimes, Kilburn—I received this letter marked "A" with the postmark, March 25th—I opened it and read part of it, and then gave it to Mr. Herbert—I also received this second letter, marked "B"—I opened that, but I did not read it at the time, because I saw it was for my husband.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gross-examined.</hi> I have known Mr. Pugin a great many years, since he was quite a boy—I knew his family also, quite well—the prisoner has always been a man of extremely excitable temperament—I remember going down to Ramsgate before the house, the Chimes, was built, and a conversation with reference to it took place there, but I did not hear much of it—the house was finished, I think, at the end of 1868—it was commenced in the beginning of that year—I always understood that a man named Hodgson was the builder—I Lave heard something about an action being brought against my husband by Mr. Pugin in May, 1873—I don't know whether, prior to that, there had been a proposal to refer all matters in dispute to arbitration—I heard about arbitration, but I don't really know—I did not know that after the house was finished, Mr. Pugin offered to buy it back—I have heard something about it lately in some of these extraordinary letters that he has written—I have heard that the estimate for the building of the house was very much less than what it cost to build, but I don't know it as a fact—I don't know what it cost to build the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor at Lincoln's Inn Fields, and I was engaged as solicitor for a gentleman who had some dispute with Mr. Pugin—I defended the action—I know Mr. Pugin's signature—I received</p>

               <p>this letter marked "C," which I opened and read—I gave Mr. Herbert a copy of the letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not brought any charge of libel against Mr. Pugin—I was advised as long as the letters were personally abusive that I should put up with them, and I have done so—I have known Mr. Pugin by sight for many years, but I did not know him except as the plaintiff in the action I defended—I have seen him excited, but I am excited myself sometimes—he has persisted in writing to me, and I told him and his then solicitor that any letter he chose to write to me I should not answer—he has persisted till yesterday and the day before—these are the letters—I was the solicitor for the Rev. Mr. Molloy, of Hanley, in an action brought against him by Mr. Pugin—that action went on for some years; I think nearly three years—he claimed commission as architect and as builder also—the action ultimately went to arbitration, having been in existence nearly three years—there were an immense number of items—the case was called on for trial about 3.30, before Mr. Justice Brett, and when he saw the items he said he thought it had better go to arbitration, and it was referred to Mr. R. E. Turner—the particulars delivered in the action were about 138 folios—I don't consider that that arbitration was decided in favour of Mr. Pugin—we had to pay the costs of the whole of the action, but let me explain how it was—we had certainly to pay the costs of the trial, that follows from <hi rend="italic">the</hi> award—my clients had to pay their own costs of the reference and one-third of the plaintiff's costs—Mr. Pugin recovered 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the commission on his contract.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I considered that was a successful termination for my client—I defeated Mr. Pugin's claim to the extent of nearly 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the award of 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the action carries the costs—97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of his claim was disallowed—we desired a full inquiry in open Court, and the judge referred it—there was not much delay in the reference.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Chimes, Kilburn—I am a Royal Academician—I have known the defendant since he was a boy—I knew his father perfectly well—he was a friend of mine—I was desirous a few years ago of building a house for myself at Kilburn—I said to Mr. Pugin "I wish to build a house; I have bought some land, but," I said "I don't want an architect, I want the house to be an expression of my own mind, and if I make the drawing will you see to the construction of a portion of it?"—he said "I shall be only too happy"—I made drawings of my own idea, and Mr. Pugin acted as my architect—the drawings were my own, and he was not to alter them, but to keep to them strictly—he superintended the building—he made some drawings, all of which failed—Mr. Hodgson was the builder—afterwards, when the house was built, disputes arose between Mr. Pugin and myself—I had expressed myself with some disgust before it was finished—he afterwards brought an action against me, and upon the action being brought I consulted my solicitors, Messrs. Field, Roscoe, &amp; Co.—I told them my story and put the matter in their hands, and they have had charge of the legal proceedings from that time—I received these letters of the 12th, 17th, and 19th May—they are all signed by the defendant—I have no doubt about it—they are not written by him, but are signed by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Pugin is a man of excitable temperament from various causes and his natural condition of life—the building was begun, I believe, in 1868—the first conversation did not take place with reference</p>

               <p>to it at the Grange at Ramsgate, his father's house—that was, after he had made copies of drawings which were useless and then they were abandoned, I saying when he made the first failure "Pray, Edward, write to me what I am in your debt and I will send you a, cheque by return of post," and when the second set were sent I said to him "I am sorry you did not let me pay you on the first failure, pray do now and I will send you a cheque by return of post"—he said "I will not allow you to pay me one farthing," because at that time he had caused me inconvenience and the annoyance by his departure from my wishes—there were tenders sent by persons of the first drawings which were abortive and which he said he would lay aside—; they were dismissed by himself as well as by myself as being of no use—the tender on the abortive drawings was not 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was much more and for this reason, it was about double the price that he said the house would come to—the first tender for the building as it was afterwards carried out was certainly not from a man of the name of Jackson—there were some: plans originally prepared which afterwards proved abortive-amongst the other tenders there was one by Jackson and it was abortive because it was three times the cost—Mr. Pugin told me the erection of the building would be 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the estimate the builders sent in was something like 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or any sum you please—Pugin told me it would cost me 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the builder said it would cost from 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the ultimate estimate was 2,403<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was a tender made by Mr. Hodgson—they were not pretty much the same drawings as had been originally sent in—Mr. Pugin abandoned the first drawings and withdrew them and" refused to let me pay, and then he drew the plans from my own drawings of the house which cost so much less, and the tender was 2,403<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—during the time the house was building, I was not constantly requiring extras to be added, on the con<lb></lb>trary said "Make no change whatever, keep strictly to the drawings"—it is not correct that I continually required windows to be made very nearly double their size—probably the doors were made a little larger than the specification required—there were two windows which I said "Make six inches wider if you like"—I required a chapel to be erected, but that was in the original drawing—there was no specific tender made by Mr. Hodgson for the chapel—it was a room and not more than a room, and I had to put the altar in it—I have paid the contract short of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and, indeed, I thought I had left much more, because I was warned not to pay so much—I did not know that Mr. Pugin was under guarantee to Mr. Hodgson that if the cost of the work exceeded what he had tendered for he was to make it good—I know that now—he states that he has paid 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of that guarantee to Mr. Hodgson—an action was brought against me by the defendant, and he has been delay<lb></lb>ing it from time to time—I don't recollect the dates at all—I placed them in the hands of my lawyers, Messrs. Field, Roscoe &amp; Co.—I don't remem<lb></lb>ber that the claim he made against me was in respect of money he had paid to Hodgson—the action has been delayed by him ever since it has been going on—I heard that the defendant had fled to America, and I made application at Judges Chambers, requiring Mr. Pugin, as plaintiff, to find security for costs—I made an affidavit in respect of one of those appli<lb></lb>cations to the effect that he was going to leave the country—I swore that John Powell informed me that Mr. Pugin was about to leave the country and go to America, where it was his intention to reside for eighteen months or two years—I also swore that he was altogether without means, and would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187407130022"></xptr>
               <p>have to be supported by his friends whilst absent in America—I swore that because I had been told that by his brother-in-law—I did not know as a fact that at the time I swore that affidavit that he had gone to America, he was going, and I made an affidavit that he was going, and it was to get security for costs before he fled—from the time I dismissed him as architect he has sent me messages calling me a liar, and stating that I had defrauded him—the first of these letters is March 25th, but I had received letters before that, and they annoyed me enormously before that—I am a man of peace, and therefore would not feel disposed to commit an assault upon him—of course I am not ignorant of the number of times he has been before Police Courts, and I must feel that he has stained his father's name, and I do feel very strongly although I don't express myself so—I have not said that I was in possession of material that would send him to Portland and the bulks—I was dining with a friend of mine and a French friend, and after dinner we were talking together upon the subject, and I said I had consulted an eminent lawyer who said that the affair would be sufficient to send him to prison—I did not use the words, my lawyers "regard it as a fraudulent attempt to get money from me for which he ought to be sent to prison"—I have not said that I would prevent him from getting any work from Government, certainly not—I said his own acts stood in his way, and it was his own acts that would deprive him of them and not mine—I did not say that I would call the attention of those in power to his work, and he would not get work—I did speak to Mr. Gladstone about the extreme worry and annoyance I had gone through, but I said nothing to Mr. Glad<lb></lb>stone which would affect him as one who he would receive public work from—he was a competitor for some work, but there was not one who said "We can trust him," and they would not put him on—I am sorry to say that—I did not say that to Mr. Gladstone—I don't know that there was any conversation about this matter at all—I told Mr. Gladstone that he had given satisfaction, being an architect and builder too.</p>

                  </hi>, M.P. I have known Mr. Herbert for 20 or 30 years—he paid a lengthened visit to my brother-in-law's residence during the winter, and we had much conversation upon many subjects; amongst others he once or twice I think spoke to me of Mr. Pugin—I should say very confidently that he said nothing to me which would have prevented his getting any of the public work—I do not retain the details of his conversation—the subject matter was altogether painful, and one which excited my concern—Mr. Herbert is a very old friend, and Mr. Pugin one I had known less, but of whom I had heard in a general rather than in a particular respect—the conversation was certainly to the effect of describing to me the sufferings and annoyance which he had endured, and which he said had gone beyond all measure, so that he felt himself bound to resort to the law—I am morally certain if he had spoken to me a syllable on any such subject as the capacity or noncapacity of Mr. Pugin to receive public employment I should have remembered it, and I should say, with very great confidence, he never said such a thing—I may say that the office I held did not make it necessary for me to select archi<lb></lb>tects</p>

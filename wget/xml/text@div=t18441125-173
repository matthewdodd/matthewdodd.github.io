In the morning of last Saturday week I went with Dalby and Ratcliff to No. 56, Wickham-street, Vauxhall—Ratcliff went up stairs and brought the prisoner down—I staid below—I then asked him to accompany me up stairs while I searched his bedroom—I found nothing there—the prisoner said, "It is no use looking here, you will find nothing; if you don't look into the box that is down in the back room I will give you a sovereign"—I went down stain where Dalby and Ratcliff were placed, and found a box there—it was locked—I asked the prisoner if that was his box—he said it was—I asked if he would be so good as to unlock it—he said he had not got the key—I said I should break it open—I did so, and found three large pieces of brass tubing, which I produce, and some drills and a screw-wrench were taken out of the box by Dalby—I then took the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18040912-62-defend681 t18040912-62-deflabel373"></join>, on the 2d of July, I sent her out, to change a seven-shillings piece; she brought me back three shillings, four sixpences, and some halfpence; I laid them on the dresser where I was ironing, in the kitchen; when I had done ironing, I took up the money to go up stairs, and found there were two shillings wanting.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not parted with any? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had not observed the pieces of money so as to know them again? - A. No; I rang for her, and told her there were two missing; she said I must be mistaken, it could not be lost; I told her very likely, but I had not got it; she said that could not be; she observed that there was nobody in the kitchen but herself and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that true? - A. Yes; no one came in, and I never stirred out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Then nobody, in point of fact, did come into the kitchen, after she delivered to you the change? - A. No, she persisted in it that I must be mistaken, and I persisted that I was not; I looked again, and there were no more than one shilling and four sixpences, and when she put them down there were three shillings and four sixpences; I had not laid them from my hand at all, when I took them up and went into my chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the money again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself go down into the kitchen and make search? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct her to go down and make search? - A. I do not remember that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be possible that in the action of ironing you might have misplaced those two shillings from the ironing-board to the floor? - A. No, I put the money on the dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose she was doing the work of the kitchen? - A. I observed her removing some basons, there was no occasion for it; I saw her at the dresser, but I did not see her take the money.</p>
               <p>Q. So I presume you never desired her to go down and look for it? - A. I was convinced that she knew where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. That is what you thought; is that all you know respecting the money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn her away that day? - A. No, she staid several weeks after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there missing four bottles of wine the same day as the silver was missed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it will be necessary for me to ask which you have the strongest proof of, the money or the wine? - A. Sir, I am certain of the two shillings.</p>

             sworn. - Q. There are in the indictment two distinct charges, because they were taken at different times; you must select which is the strongest case against her? - A. I think the wine.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Jury.) Then, gentlemen, you must discharge all this about the money.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Reeves.) Do you know whether you have missed any wine? - A. Yes, I have missed wine for several months.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, during the time this woman lived with you, you missed to the amount of four bottles? - A. Yes, a great deal more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing particular yourself about the wine? - A. I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever charge her at any time of taking your wine? - A. I told her somebody must go to my cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this wine secured? - A. In a cellar, under lock and key.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the key? - A. The key was in a closet; no person could go to it without they went to the closet, where the key was hung up.</p>
               <p>Q. You kept the cellar constantly locked? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you kept the key that closet was locked with? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any occasion to send this girl to that closet? - A. Sometimes she used to go and take out the tea and sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever miss the key yourself? - A. I cannot say that ever I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever send her for wine? - A. Never, I made a practice of getting it myself, or Mrs. Reeves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her box at the time you discharged her? did you find any bottles? - A. No, I searched her box, and found no bottles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cause her to be taken up in your service? - A. Yes; when I searched her box I found a great many clothes that she bought with my money.</p>
               <p>Q. That only strengthened your suspicions, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120064"></xptr>induced you to have her taken up; when did you have her taken up? - A. About a fortnight or three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a good character with her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has she lived with you? - A. Two years and five months.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is she? - A. About twenty; my suspicions have been alive a great while.</p>
               <p>Q. You still kept her? - A. I could not prove any thing against her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in her box, that would open your cellar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>MARY TODDEL sworn. - I saw her take two bottles one morning, and two in the evening at another time; Mr. Reeves lodged in the house with the family that I lived with.</p>
               <p>Q. What family did you live with? - A. Mr. Coombe, in King-street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Reeves's cellar is separate from Mr. Coombe's? - A. Mr. Coombe had no cellar for wine, it was Mr. Reeves's cellar she took the wine from.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you see her do this before she was taken up? - A. About two or three months before she was taken up, I observed her with two bottles; I did not observe what was in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Two bottles at one time coming from the wine-cellar; did you see how near she was from the wine-cellar - A. When she had the two bottles she was coming out of the wine-cellar door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the key of that wine-cellar door - A. Mrs. Reeves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not make any observation to Mrs. Reeves about it? - A. No, not till I was going to leave my place.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you told Mrs. Reeves of her coming out of the wine-cellar? was the time you saw it done at the time you left your place? - A. No, about a month or six weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you tell Mrs. Reeves of it then? - A. Mrs. Reeves had lost her comb, and that made me speak, because it was laid upon me; I was going to leave my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Who laid it upon you? - A. She came down stairs, and said it must be one of you that has taken my comb, and I was going away the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you told Mrs. Reeves what you had observed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not before that? - A. Not before that.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had not been for this dispute about the comb you would not have told? - A. She begged me not to mention it; I thought she had some money that was not her own.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that she begged you not to mention it? - A. When I was going away.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that wine; how was it used? - A. There was wine drank in the house; I partook of some wine while I was in the house; she gave me a glass of wine now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not an extraordinary thing for servants to have wine in the kitchen? - A. She informed me that her mistress gave her some.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood that her mistress did not give her these two bottles; did you ever ask her mistress about that; you never would have told, if it had not been for this quarrel? - A. She confessed herself.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before the Justice? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Reeves.) How is that? - A. When she was taken up, this young woman told me she had seen her take wine twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the young woman at the bar it would be better for her to confess? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the other young woman would never have told you, only for the dispute about this comb; do you keep any thing but wine in this cellar? - A. Yes, spirits; brandy, wine, and shrub.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what was in these two bottles? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all the evidence you have? - A. Yes.</p>

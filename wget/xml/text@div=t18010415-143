In Edward-street, Surry-road, Blackfriars; Mrs. Gray let him in; I was in the front parlour; after she let him in, he came into the parlour, I asked him what he wanted; he said he had come on a very unpleasant piece of business; he said he had a warrant for taking Mrs. Gray into custody for shoplifting.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did he produce any authority for so doing? - A. He produced a warrant, and said that was his authority for so doing; he then put the paper into my hand; I told him I believed she was very innocent of the charge; he said, he believed it too, but she must put on her cloaths, and go with him; he then said, he thought he could get her discharged from that warrant, if we would give him something; I asked him what he required; he said, as she was so lately discharged from one prison, in consequence of her having a great family, if I would give him two guineas, he would get the warrant discharged; Caseby and I then left the house, and went towards Guildhall; we went to the <placeName id="t18010415-143-crimeloc793">sign of the Paul's Head, close by Guildhall</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did he, either the first or second time, shew you any badge of office? - A. No; when be returned from the Paul's Head, he asked me for the money for getting the name of Mary Gray erased out of the warrant; I gave him a guinea, and told him I would give him the other the first opportunity, then we parted; the next time I saw him, he came over to my house again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. Yes; I always considered him as an officer of the City of London.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he represent himself? - A. As a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. And he produced no authority, except this bit of paper? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep an open shop? - A. No; I travel as a licensed hawker, and have a license to deal in plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you brought up to this business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you deal in before? - A. I followed the profession I was brought up to - a musician.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, will you give me that answer again, from the time of your serving your apprenticeship till within these two years, will you repeat it to that Jury, that you have got your living as a musician? - A. I will tell you, to save you a deal of trouble, for I know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had advice? - A. I have for a considerable time lived very honest and upright - for six or seven years since I have been in England.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence, I suppose, I may conclude you were not perfectly honest before? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. There were some little irregularity of morals? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been transported? - A. My Lord!</p>

               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. That I am sure of; and in consequence of my unfortunate situation, is the reason why this man.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't want a fine speech from you upon your unfortunate situation? - A. I must claim his Lordship's protection.</p>
               <p>Q. His Lordship will give it you the moment I ask an improper question - Then you have been transported but once? - A. I have been convicted but once.</p>

               <p>Q. How often have you been in custody? - A. Once since.</p>
               <p>Q. Only once, I suppose? - A. I have been in custody twice since, upon no charge whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you have been in custody only twice for the last seven years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times before the last seven years? - A. I don't choose to answer that question.</p>

               <p>Q. Then I shall apply to my Lord, that you may be in custody once more? - A. But once on a charge of felony.</p>
               <p>Q. On any other charge? - A. What I have had the pleasure to be acquitted for.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you charged for on that occasion? - A. No charge at all.</p>

               <p>Q. State, distinctly and loud, what took place? - A. He said he had got a warrant, to take me up; he produced a warrant, which I saw; he said, he brought it to take me before the Lord-Mayor, for shop-lifting. I told him it was a thing I knew nothing at all of, but if he insisted upon it I would go with him; I said I would put on my bonnet and cloak to go; he said it was a very hard case, but he thought it might be settled for a trifle of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or Barnesley, say any thing upon that? - A. No; he stopped and had breakfast with us; he then said there was no occasion for me to go, Barnesley and himself could settle it; he said something about two guineas, and, I think, Barnesley gave him a half-guinea then, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any more of the warrant? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a flag flail and twenty-five pounds weight of Malaga plumbs? - Yes. On the first of February, Saturday night, I lost them from my shop, No. <placeName id="t17940219-42-crimeloc234">9, Snow-hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was there three, two in the shop and one at the door? - No. Afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190102"></xptr>the other woman that was in company with her went out to the door, I was serving behind the counter, and I see her from the counter, and I seized her by the arm immediately across the counter, and as soon as I could get over the counter, the other woman was off with the plumbs. I only secured this woman, and sent for a constable; the plumbs were in the flag flail, what the Malaga plumbs comes in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the plumbs in the shop belonging to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the man, and there was no woman with me, my husband then laid a dying, and he has been dead since I was in goal; there was no woman with me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I laid hold of her arm while she was handing them out to the other woman.</p>
               <p>Jury. Where were the plumbs? - On the further side of the shop, near the door, about two yards from it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Wesleyan Times</hi> newspaper. The day of its publication is Monday—on Monday, 26th Dec., the three prisoners were in my employ, as packers and folders—the paper is printed in the Strand, and brought to my office about 12 or 1 o'clock—on Monday, 26th Dec., some papers were brought to my office, and taken into the folding room, and some coven were taken for the papers of the London district—the covers are previously directed by a clerk in my em<lb></lb>ploy, and these are what the papers are to be folded and wrapped in—no papers ought to come out of that folding room except those directed for the customers in that way—I observed Bell come out that day with a bag of papers in a post-office bag, and in consequence of information I requested him to put that bag in the front office or shop, and immediately after leav<lb></lb>ing it there the three prisoners went out; while they were gone I had the bag opened in my presence, and found in it this quire of papers (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>); none of these papers ought to have been in that bag in this state—on the prisoners' return they went into the folding room again—Baldwin</p>

               <p>and Bell came out of the folding room (Rowan was in the back premises), Baldwin and Bell brought out more papers, which they put into the bag which Bell had left previously in the office—this quire of papers was then on the top of the bag, and they must undoubtedly have been seen by Baldwin and Bell—I then directed Bell to take the bag to the post-office—he did not take it, but Baldwin did, and Bell went back into the folding room to Rowan.</p>

I am in the employ of the last witness, he is the publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Wesleyan Times.</hi> On the 26th Dec., Bell asked me for the covers for the district, the twopenny district, as we call it—I gave him the covers for all within the twelve miles circuit—I afterwards saw some papers in quires taken in the room—about 12 o'clock that day, in consequence of some communication, I opened the leather bag from the post-office—there ought not to be in that bag any papers except in the folded state—I found this quire of papers, in a quire—my brother directed Bell to take this bag—that was after the prisoners had all been in the folding room, and had had some conversation—Bell did not take the bag, but Baldwin took it on his shoulder, and I received directions to follow him—on proceeding up White Friars-street, he ought to turn to the right to go to the receiving house for the post-office—he did turn to the right, and immediately he got past the window he turned and went back to the Boar's Head public house, which is two doors from White Friars-street, on the left—I followed, and said to him, "Take this to the post-office first," he did, and I followed him—he put down the bag in the receiving house, and I said, "I think I will have this bag brought back, you may want it this evening"—I asked the person in the receiving house whether I might have it back; he said, "No"—I said, "Then I must have it opened"—Baldwin made to the door, and I said, "If you don't stay and see the bag opened, I will send for a policeman"—he made away, and I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

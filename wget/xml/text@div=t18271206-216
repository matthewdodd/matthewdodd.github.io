               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - Were my own feelings my guide on this melancholy occasion, I should intrude a sentiment that would trespass upon your valuable time; but, being advised by my most anxious friends, I beg your attention to my present unhappy feelings. I assure you, Gentlemen, that to account a reason for my conduct is not in my power; but from having very recently been deprived of a very affectionate wife, and of having met with many misfortunes since in circumstances; and that, together with the cares of a family of five young children, being in most wretehedly distressed circumstances; my mind was overcome in a moment, when to guard against the temptation was not thought of by me, or its more unhappy consequences to my family anticipated. - My Lord and Gentlemen, I will beg your commisseration in my present situation, and hope that as this is the first act of crime I ever committed, and of my being at the time I did so misconduct myself in a way of total absence of thought, never contemplating such a crime, that you will in your compassion once more afford me my means of earning an honest and industrious livelihood; and of working for the support of my unhappy family.</p>

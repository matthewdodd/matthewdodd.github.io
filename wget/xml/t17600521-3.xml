            . About the hour of 12, in the day, on the 10th of this instant May, Allen and Wardley came to my house with a pottage pot and cover, and stew pan to sell; my man bought them of them. I was out, I soon after returned; after which they came again with another pottage pot, which I bought of them. Allen vouch'd for Wardley's character; Wardley said it was his own property, and that his wife us'd to wash in it, and she was dead, so he would sell it, having to use for it. I gave him as much or more than any body else wou'd. I set it out at my door amongst other things to sell, and soon after Mrs. Lee came and own'd it. I said to her, if that is your property, I fear I have got more of your things, which I bought of the same persons.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. After these things were stolen, I went out with an intent to have them advertised; as I was going along, I saw the pot standing at Mr. Lion's door. I said it was mine. Then they said, they were afraid they had got more of my things, having bought more of the same persons, and if I had come about an hour sooner, I might have seen the men there. She show'd me the other things, and I own'd them.</p>

               <p>I was drinking in a public house, between 11 and 12 o'clock, my comrade Wake came and asked me if I would go with him, and fetch some goods that he had bought; I said, can you not let it alone till morning. He said, he could not go in the day time. I ask'd him where they were; he said, he would not tell me till I came there. When I came to the place, Williamson went up and said this is the door, and went into the yard, and brought them out; I was not in the house; nor nigh it.</p>

On the 8th of January last, in the present year, about seven in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came to the house of Mr. Swainson, and was shewn into my office; he said he wanted a quantity of vegetable syrup, and begged to know what was the price of the medicine for exportation; I told him the allowance of the medicine, when exported, reduced it to eight shillings a bottle; he then demanded what would be the amount of two dozen when packed up? I told him, nine pounds, eighteen shillings; he then paused a moment, and said as it was to go abroad, at least a considerable part of it, he would have twice tha quantity, and asked what would be the amount of that? I answered, nineteen pounds, sixteen shillings; he then said that he wanted two bottles left out for the use of a lady who had received a paralytic stroke; and desired it might be sent to his house on the following morning, before nine o'clock; he was going out of town, he said, precisely at nine o'clock, and he would take them in his carriage; I then asked him his address? his reply was, Captain

               <p>"It does not signify, I am going to spend the evening at the Cocoa-tree, and shall get change directly." From the mention of that house, and knowing none but real gentlemen could resort there, it removed in some measure the doubts of my mind, which I had previously entertained, but to farther convince myself, I stepped out to a neighbour's house, to ask his advice; but he not being at home, I returned in a minute, and gave him the change for the note, first desiring him to put his name on the back of the bill, which he did, by the name of

               <p>Mr. Schoen, Prisoner's Counsel. This transaction happened on the 8th of January, at about eight in the evening. Where did you happen to be when the person who first called on this business came? - In the compting-house.</p>
               <p>How does that happen to be situated? - On the right hand passage.</p>
               <p>Was you called out of this compting-house at this time? - No; it is the practice of the house, to shew any one that comes, in to me.</p>
               <p>This person came then in to you? - He did.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - He had on a drab-coloured coat, boots, and a round hat.</p>
               <p>How many candles do you usually sit with in this compting-house? - I should imagine I had two; sometimes I have one, and sometimes I have two.</p>
               <p>This transaction could not have taken up a long space of time? - It might take up five or ten minutes.</p>

               <p>Then, in course, the person, whoever he was, could not have been above seven or eight minutes in the room with you; and now, can you be sure from this transient view you had of this man, and by candlelight, you can swear to his person? - I could wish I had the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>It was not a long view? - No, it was not; but I must do it in point of conscience.</p>

               <p>Have you ever been in the prison with the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed respecting this note? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>When did you go to the prisoner? - Two days before I received this paper.</p>
               <p>What passed? - He wanted me to put a padlock on the door of the two pair of stairs, which a gentlewoman had taken.</p>
               <p>Was that gentleman with the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>At the time you went into the prison, what passed between you and Mr. Kelsey? - Mr. Kelsey desired me to put a padlock on the door; and I told him I had the plainest objection in the world to the doing of that, as he had not taken the room, nor had I ever seen him in the house.</p>
               <p>On what door did he want you to put the padlock? - The door of the room which the gentlewoman had taken.</p>
               <p>Who was this gentlewoman? - She was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Never enquired her name? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see her at Bow-street? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never see the prisoner after you had received this paper? - Never, only at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Clarke at any time come to your house? - He might, for what I know.</p>
               <p>Did any body come to your house after you had seen the prisoner in prison? - Not afterwards.</p>
               <p>Had you then before this, seen any thing taken away from his room? - They took away something in a coach, but I do not know what.</p>
               <p>Look at the trunk that stands before you: did you never see that trunk? - No, never; I was not at home when they took it away.</p>
               <p>At Bow-street, these papers were delivered to you; was any thing said about these papers; what passed about them? - I was asked if I had received these papers from Mr. Kelsey? I said I received these papers, and understood that they came from him, but I could not swear it.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner, or did he not, make any answer or observation on your saying it? - On my oath, I cannot recollect it.</p>
               <p>What became of your papers? - On that, Mr. Clarke took them.</p>
               <p>Were they read? - I believe they were.</p>
               <p>In the presence of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner make any observations? - I cannot recollect he did.</p>
               <p>What has become of the rest of the goods at your apartments? - The person who took the apartments, came and slept in the house; and since that, I believe she has disposed of the goods to some broker; and they were moved the last week.</p>
               <p>You do not know where the lady lived? - No; she paid me, and removed the goods.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Clarke. Was you there at the last time the witness was speaking? - I was.</p>
               <p>Was this paper produced, we have been speaking of, at Bow-street? - It was, and

               <p>Was this notice read in the presence of the prisoner? - It was, but I do not know he said any thing.</p>
               <p>Court to E. Saunders. When you was before the magistrate, at Bow-street, you was examined, and your examination taken in writing, and signed by you; now be careful what you are about. Did you at any time say when you was at Bow-street, that the prisoner at the bar had told you that the woman who had brought the goods, was an imprudent woman, and that he wished to take care of the goods for himself and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130019"></xptr>her? - If she was his wife, she did not tell me so.</p>
               <p>You said some woman left goods at your lodgings; did that observation apply to the woman that left the goods? - I should imagine it applied to her.</p>

               <p>Was you talking about any body else, or to any body else? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen to Mr. Clarke. I think you said, that as to that note, when it was read in Bow-street, you did not recollect the prisoner said any thing about it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Schoen to Mr. Clarke. That trunk was found in Warner-street, not at his lodgings? - In Warner-street, where his wife took us to the lodgings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is that the box that was taken from the prisoner's apartments in Warner-street? - It is.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Camberwell. At half-past three o'clock, on the 30th of January, I was near Wellington-street, Strand—I had a handkerchief in my pocket—I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—a witness saw him throw it over a fence, among some work-people, and we have not found it—I could swear to it, as it was a very particular one—several persons were near me when I felt the tug, but I turned sharp round, and saw the prisoner with it—he took a direction across the road, between the line of <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>—I ran, kept him in view, and cried "Stop thief."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It is quite false—I was crossing, and heard the cry of "Stop thief," and I turned back directly. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, he did not turn back.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It is quite false—the gentleman said, "Come back with me," I came back, and there was no such thing there—there were a lot of tradesmen at work, who said they had not seen it—the foreman was there, and he denied any handkerchief being thrown over.</p>

            . I asked the prisoner to help me draw beer, and assist in the house. On the 13th of October I asked him to lend a hand in making the beds, and clean the room out; my clothes were in my box; he went out in the afternoon unknown to us, I did not see him till about eight in the evening; then he had his regimentals on; I said, John, you look very fresh in the face, you have been drinking; he swore he had not; a little after we heard somebody up stairs; then my mistress called to me, and said, there was somebody up stairs; I went up and found him in his own room, laid down; he had pulled off his regimentals, and put on a blue coat; I found my best blue coat under his bed; I told him I had been a good friend to him, and he had requited me very badly for it; I left the clothes as they were, and went and called my mistress up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your clothes before?</p>
               <p>Clark. They were all in a box, except one coat; I went and examined my box, and found it was broke open; I had in it a crown piece, half a guinea, and some halfpence; I tried to open another drawer, and the lock was broke all to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your money?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, it was all gone, except one farthing; the prisoner before he came in, met Mr. Green, he keeps company with his daughter; he went from this up in the Strand; when we took him he would not confess any thing; lifting up his arm, four shillings dropt out of his sleeve; then he confessed the fact; he offered me these four shillings, and he told a gentleman that was in the kitchen, that he would give me 4 s. and a note of hand to receive 3 s. a week, till all the money was paid that I had lost.</p>

            . The prisoner was in liquor; he disowned having any money about him, but putting his hand up the four shillings dropt out of his sleeve; he acknowledged he had the crown piece, and had changed it, and that he was willing to make satisfaction, by giving him a note, to take his wages of the paymaster serjeant.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he say he got the money?</p>
               <p>Dye. He did not confess he broke open the box, but he said he had robbed him, and that he was drunk, and did not know what he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same day he took it?</p>
               <p>Dye. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk?</p>
               <p>Dye. Yes, but not so far but he understood things very well, he knew what he was about.</p>

               <p>I did not take any waistcoat out of the room, not did I own taking the waistcoat nor the coat; I had no crown piece, that four shillings, I received of a serjeant the Saturday before; I was in liquor, and do not know that I said any thing about it.</p>

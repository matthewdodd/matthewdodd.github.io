            . I live in Exeter-street, and deal a little in the brokery way: the prisoner married my wife's sister. I have known him about three months: since this affair happened I have enquired into his character; when I first knew him, he was a farmer's man; his master gave him the character of a very industrious man. We expected him to have been tried at Oxford, or he would have had a great many to appear in his behalf. I never heard that his character was stain'd before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Shepherd and Flock-court, Coleman-street. I am nine years old—I know I shall go to hell if I do not tell the truth—about four o'clock in the evening of the 31st of October, I was at Moorgate—I had five linen shirts which belonged to a Mr. Mitchell—I was taking them home to my mother's—I met the prisoner—she clapped me on the shoulder, and said, "You are a nice little boy, what is your name?"—I told her—she said, "I know your mother, and I know you since you were three years of age; you are a nice little boy; if you will come to my house, I will give you a horse and cart"—she took me up to Ropemaker-street, and showed me a gentleman standing at a door—she said, "Do you see that gentleman?" I said, "Yes"—she said, "That is my uncle, do not let him see you"—she gave me a halfpenny, and took my bundle, and said she would go into that place for the horse and cart, and she was coming to see my mother—she pointed to a place then, and asked me if I bad any thing to put the horse and cart in—I said, "No"—she said she would put it and my bundle in a basket, and carry it home to my mother—this was about four o'clock—I met her again that night in Fore-street, about eight o'clock—my aunt told me to take a good look at her, to see if that was the woman—she was dressed as before—I am sure she is the person who took the bundle.</p>

            . I live at Norton, in Cambridgeshire. I came to town on Thursday, the 18th of September, in a waggon, went to Leadenhall-market, and sold some ducks and fowls, and took about 4 l. there; I had other money about me. When I left the market I had about 20 l. in two purses; one contained eight sovereigns and eight 1 l. country bank notes, and in the other was upwards of 4 l. in silver, that was in my right hand pocket, and the other in my left. I left the market between eight and nine o'clock, and went to Billingsgate, and from there to the Catherine Wheel, Bishopsgate-street, and had a bason of tea and a glass of rum in it. I had had half a pint of beer at five of o'clock. I was then going to Whitechapel; I went up Brick-lane, missed the turning, and got into <placeName id="t18211024-5-crimeloc31">George-street</placeName>

I gave Davis 1 s. and she sent this woman to fetch the liquor; she went out for it, and returned with two other women - there was then four women there, when they came I wanted to go, but they insisted on having 1 s., for the room, and bolted me in, I took out my purse of silver, and threw down 1 s., on the floor - Davis tried to snatch it out of my hand, but I got the better of her, and put it into my left hand pocket, at the top of the other purse - they all four surrounded me, and held my back against the table, so that I could not stir, they held my arms, and bent my back over the table, and took my purse away, one of them said, "Have you got it?" another answered in a vulgar manner, that she had got it, and said let him go. I ran out of doors without my hat, they went up stairs, and threw my hat out of window to me, and I got it again.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the women held your back, were you struck by any of them - A. Yes, I was beat very sorely about my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240006"></xptr>forehead by Steel. I am sure she is the woman, while they held me over the table Steel came in, and I think another woman, there was then six of them, she struck me at the time they were getting my purse away, she came in before the question "Have you got it" was asked. When I got out of the house, some people came by, I said I would give them 5 s., to fetch an officer, and I would keep the door the while, I could get no one to go, a boy wanted the money first - I went up the street, and applied to an officer who was not at home - I was sent to Westley who came, we found Steel at the corner of the street, where I had been robbed, she was taken, and told the officer of two more. Davis was taken a fortnight after. My purse contained above 3 l. 10 s.; I went into the house between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner DAVIS. Q. Can you look me in the face, and swear I am the woman who picked you up - A. On my oath, she took me to the house. I would say so on my dying bed.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor came to me, and complained of being robbed; he appeared perfectly sober; his head was very much bruised on the temple, and the cheek bone, the skin was broken, and it bled. I went with him to find the house, he did not know how to find the place again, we met Steel at the corner of Wentworth-street, he said he was robbed just by there, and pointed to Wentworth-street; we went there, and saw Steel standing at the corner of the street. I told him to be cautious in fixing on any of them, without being sure - I stood at the door of the Two Brewers, public-house, he ran over to her, seized her, and charged her with being the person, I took her - he described Davis to me. I mentioned it to another officer. She was taken a week afterwards. I found nothing on Steel.</p>
               <p>STEEL'S Defence. I never saw Davis till she came to prison, nor did I see the prosecutor till he took me.</p>
               <p>DAVIS'S Defence. He is swearing my life away innocently, he said he bit me in the arm.</p>

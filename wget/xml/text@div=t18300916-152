            . I am a school-room maid at Lord Somerset's; my window looks into this place. I saw several girls playing on the chains, and one swinging - I heard the sentinel call to them two or three times to go away; they all went away but one - I saw the sentinel cross the yard towards her; I do not know whether he ran or walked - I saw him strike at the little girl with his hand; she was then getting from the chain - I think he hit her on the shoulder, but cannot be sure; I did not see him use his foot; I saw the child fall on her head - some workmen helped her up, and took her away - the sentinel went back to his box when she fell; I did not particularly notice him, and cannot say whether the prisoner is the man - there is never more than one sentinel on duty there; I did not see him near any other soldier.</p>

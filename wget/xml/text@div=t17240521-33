               <p>The Prosecutor depos'd, That as he was going along Newgate Street, on the Day mention'd in the Indictment, he met with the Prisoner, who had formerly been his Neighbour, having dwelt the next Door to him about 3 Years, that asking her how she liv'd, the Prisoner told him, she liv'd in Service, and wrought hard for her Living, and ask'd him to make her drink, that he consented so to do, and went to a Publick House, and sat in the publick Room, and having drank till the Reckoning came to 14 Pence, he pulled out his Bag of Money, and paid the Reckoning, and putting his Money up again, and sitting a little after felt for his Money and it was gone, that he immediately charg'd her with having his Money, but she deny'd it, that then he required a Constable to be sent for; that she persisted still in denying that she had it, and resolutely refus'd to be search'd before she was carried before the Justice; that she being carried before the Justice, she was there search'd, and the Bag and Money were found about her.</p>
               <p>The Constable depos'd, That he being sent for, the Prosecutor charg'd her with having picked his Pocket of the Money mentioned in the Indictment; but she deny'd it, and refus'd to be search'd; that then he committed her to two Watchmen, bidding them not to let her have her Hands at Liberty, and to observe that she did not throw or convey away any Thing, as she went along; that when she came before Justice Hewet, she refus'd to be search'd; but the Justice bidding him to search her by Violence, if she would not permit him by fair Means; he attempting it, she pull'd out a clasp'd Knife, threatning to stick him if he did attempt it. That then the Justice ordered them to get some Women to search her, and he did so, and they found the Prosecutor's Bag and the Money he had before described to be in it about the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>The Women that search'd her depos'd. That they found the Money thrust between her Shift and outward Clothes, upon loosening them.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner in her Defence pleaded, That nothing was freer than Gift, and the Prosecutor had given her the Money; that he had before been acquainted with her, and meeting her in Newgate Street, fell into Discourse with her, and ask'd her to drink a Glass of Wine with him, that she consented, and they went to the Sign of the <placeName id="t17240521-33-crimeloc172">Dean's Head in St. Martins le Grand</placeName>

This her darling Maxim, Nothing was freer than Gift, she often repeated, and with more Confidence and Levity, than became one under her dangerous Circumstances; and as to the Service by which she pretended to merit the Prosetor's Money, she was call'd upon to bring Proof of it, either by the Person of the House, or of whom she bought the Rods, but not producing any Evidences, it appear'd to be but an extravagant Sally, designed to render the Prosecutor ridiculous.

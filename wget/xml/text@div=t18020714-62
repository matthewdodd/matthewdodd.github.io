             sworn. - I am the wife of the prosecutor: On the 5th of July, I went to Robinson's and Brown's, Shoreditch, to buy some cloth and other articles; I then went to Mr. Lewis's, to buy some stockings; while I was bargaining for the stockings, I missed my bundle; I suspected the prisoner, as Mr. Lewis had found stockings on him which he had missed; he said, if I would go with him to the Pewter Platter, I should have my bundle again; he had it not about him; I asked him to deposit money for the cloth; he came back, and brought me the cloth, and demanded his money; I let him go; by that time he was taken into custody; he stood in the shop all the time I was bargaining for the stockings; there was another man with him; the other went away.</p>
               <p>- LEWIS sworn. - I saw the man bring the linen back; another man came with him, stopped a minute or two, and went away.</p>
               <p>- MESSENGER sworn. - I took the other man into custody first, and afterwards this man, about four o'clock in the morning.(The cloth was produced, and identified by Mrs. Norris.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to buy a pair of stockings at Mr. Lewis's; my neighbour followed me quickly, and was immediately gone; I denied knowing any thing of the cloth; she desired me to deposit the money for the value of the cloth; I pursued the man, and said to him, it is time to take back the cloth; I thought no more of it.</p>

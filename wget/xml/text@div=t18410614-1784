                  </hi>. I am a waiter at the Barrack Tavern, at Woolwich. The prisoner slept in my room—I had a box in the room, containing two sovereigns and two shillings—I saw it safe on Saturday night, the 15th of May, at eight o'clock, and missed the two sovereigns on the Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing about one—no one else had been in the room but the maid servant—the prisoner came in on the Saturday night at very near twelve o'clock, and I went to bed a little after twelve—I got up the next morning a little after six, and left him in bed—the maid generally comes in between nine and ten—she was living there nearly twelve months—I spoke to the prisoner about this—he said he knew nothing of it—he had slept with me on the Friday night.</p>

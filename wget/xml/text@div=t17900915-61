               <p>There were several other counts laying it in different ways.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Counsel for the Prosecution, informed the Court, that, after a very accurate attention, he found he could not support the present indictment, and that there was another indictment presented, and found for a misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Baron. I must take notice of a circumstance which has now twice occurred in the course of this sessions, that is, of indictments being preferred at the same time for a capital offence and for a misdemeanor; I do not think it is a proper course; I think it may produce many inconveniences; I think the capital case should always be entirely disposed of, and that the question, whether a conviction should be founded afterwards for a misdemeanor, should depend a great deal on the sense and judgment of the court; but to have them both found at the same time is abominable; the jury cannot with propriety find two at the same time, and I desire that the officer will understand, that as far as my judgment goes, bills for capital offences, and for misdemeanors, on the same case, should not be prepared at the same time; and I desire notice may be sent to Hicks's Hall, that the Court has taken notice of such practice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. They never can be properly found to be sure.</p>

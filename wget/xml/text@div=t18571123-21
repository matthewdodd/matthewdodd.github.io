                  </hi>. I am a sub warder of Cold Bath Fields Prison. I was on duty at a quarter to 7 o'clock on Wednesday morning, 11th Nov., in the gallery passage; my duty was to see the prisoners pass down the respective wards, and prevent them communicating with each other—I saw the prisoner leave his cell—he had his cell pot in his hand, in the usual manner—here is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are all made on one scale—as he passed by me, I took no more notice of him than I did of any of the other prisoners, neither he of me; but on passing me on my right hand side, he took the pot up in his hand as if he had nothing in it, which is a very rare occurrence, and hit me a very severe blow on my forehead: it caused me to stagger, and I was caught by several other prisoners—after striking the blow, the prisoner ran down into the yard—I have not been able to return to my duty since—he inflicted the wound which you see on my forehead—I was obliged to go to bed—I was taken up into the infirmary; I had a very severe fit through it—it bled a great deal; the blood streamed down my arm—I had reported the prisoner on the previous day—I saw him talking, and I spoke to him; he owned to laughing, but he made a laugh of it, and the second time I told him of it he said he was doing me no harm; I said, "No, but you are breaking the rules of the prison"—I reported him, and he got two days' cell and bread and water from the governor—when the blow was struck, I had my cap on, and it was cut through; the leather is four times doubled, and it cut through that, and then inflicted the blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon at Cold Bath Fields Prison. I was sent for to see Aldous; he was in the infirmary, on a bed—he had a very severe wound on the forehead, which had bled considerably—it was between two and three inches long, and it had been cut down from about a quarter to an eighth of an inch, almost to the bone—it must have been a very heavy blow—I have every reason to think that if the warder's cap had not</p>

               <p>been on, his skull would have been fractured, or there would have been such a severe concussion that the consequences might have been fatal—I have attended him from that time to the present—he has had two threaten<lb></lb>ings of erysipelas on the scalp, in consequence of the wound—such a wound as I saw would be likely to be inflicted with this pot—I have examined it; it is bound with iron—it weighs 3 3/4 lbs., I think.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger. On the 29th of April, just as we were lighting candles the prisoner came in for two ounces of the best Dorset butter that came to two-pence farthing; she gave me a shilling, I looked at it, and put it in the till. I know the shilling that I took of her by a stamp in the middle; she went out, and I had occasion to go to the till; I saw the two shillings and the sixpence, that they were all bad; she came in again, she said she wanted a nice rasher of bacon; she tendered me a shilling, it was a bad one; my neice came in and said that is the woman that passed a bad shilling and sixpence. I sent for an officer. he searched her and found good money upon her. This is the first shilling that I took of her.</p>

               <p>Q. First look at that shilling - A. It is counterfeit; the two shillings and the sixpence are counterfeit also.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I get my living by selling fancy flowers, and it is probable by changing. I might have a bad sixpence ; it is evident that I had good money, and the reason that I kept halfpence frequently when I called at private houses I had to give them change.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hudson. Should you know the shilling and the sixpence again - A. Yes, this is the shilling and sixpence I received of her.</p>

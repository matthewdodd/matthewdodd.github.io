             sworn. - I was in company with Cook and two others; we went to the house of Mr. Peake; he keeps the sign of the Bird-cage, in Bird-cage-walk, Bethnal-green.</p>

It may be two miles; I found these pictures there on the 23d of October, about eight in the morning,(produces them); I found them in the one pair of stairs bed-room; they were hanging up over the chimney-piece; we had a search-warrant to search for other property; we did not search for these; I asked him and his wife how they came by these pictures; the lady told me her brother was a miniature picture painter; I told her, we were not satisfied, and we should take them away with us.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find an owner for them? - A. On Wednesday, the 27th of October, I went to No. 6r, Red-lion-passage, which I saw written on the back of one of the pictures; and in consequence of what passed there, I went to Mrs. Sharpley's; she described the pictures, and I shewed them to her; she attended at the office on the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You went there in consequence of some information respecting some pistols? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Four months had elapsed between? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In public houses, I believe it is customary of a Sunday, when they are full, to put there company into every room in the house? - A.Not a bad room, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Lethbridge). Are you related to the prisoner or his wife? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I had lately taken a public-house, and I understand, from all the enquiry that I can make, that my wife has been imposed upon by some person who has called at our house with these things, and produced, as I understand, a very high miniature, being a striking resemblance of a boy of mine, about four years old; she was imposed upon to receive them, and she lent a guinea upon the whole of them; I learned that my wife was imposed upon, from observing that the locket was not gold; she had been told it was; Brown has said, that my wife told him, her brother was a miniature-painter, and had delivered them; I did not here her say so; I was in another room with Cook. My Lord and Gentlemen, I rest myself, under these circumstances, satisfied that you will do me justice. <rs id="t18001203-24-verdict128" type="verdictDescription">

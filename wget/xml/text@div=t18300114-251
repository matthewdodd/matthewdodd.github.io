               <p>- RAWSON. I am Cross' son-in-law. On the 6th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw two young men trying the shop door; the prisoner was not one of them - one was fitting a key to the door; Ghrimes, the officer, came by, and they ran away; I told him what I had seen, and concealed myself - they came back just after the people were gone to church, about seven o'clock, with the prisoner; they opened the door with a false key - they were all at the door together; the prisoner went in, and shut himself in - the others remained outside; I gave an alarm - the prisoner opened the door, rushed out, and ran about fifty yards; I knocked him down, and stood over him till the officer came.</p>
               <p>- GHRIMES. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody, and found a jemmy on him, five skeleton-keys, a bit of candle and a gimblet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through the market, and saw two men coming from the shop - on the step were these things; I took them up, and went into the house, thinking something was wrong.</p>

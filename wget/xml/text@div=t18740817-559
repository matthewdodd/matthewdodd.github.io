                  </hi>. I live at Beaufort House, West Ham—on the even<lb></lb>ing of 23th July I went to bed about 11 o'clock and shut up the house in the usual way—the dining-room window was closed, but I am not certain whether I fastened it—I came down about 5 o'clock on the morning of the 26th and found the dining-room window open—a cruet stand and the opera glasses and a lady's case were gone from the dining-room, and an umbrella from the hall—I had seen them safe the day before—I afterwards found the cruet stand in the front garden—any one could have put the lady's case and the opera glasses in their pockets.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K R</hi> 39). I am stationed at West. Ham—on the morning of 26th July, about 3.30,1 was near a house called the Cedars, which is about three-quarters of a mile from Mr. Needham's, I saw the prisoner and another man—I did not speak to. Them there—I saw them again at 4.30 in the Romford Road, that was about half a mile from Mr. Needham's—when I first saw London he had no umbrella, and when I saw him the second time he had one—I said "Where have you been this morning"—London said "I have been for a walk"—I said "Where have you been for a walk?'—London said "Round the Cemetery"—I said "Where did you get the umbrella you are carrying?"—he said "I gave 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—this is theumbrella—I said "Have you anything else about you?" and I made an attempt to search and the other man said "Come to Jack, you fool," and he went away—London said "I will go, sir"—I said "All right, you will"—I took him to the station—the prosecutor's servant came to the station and identified the umbrella.</p>

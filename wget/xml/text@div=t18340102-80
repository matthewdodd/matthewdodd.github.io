               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written)."Ann Glasscock had her hearing at Edmonton, charged with stealing a few potatoes from her employer, and a small quantity of flour, which she positively declares she had given to her; but states at the same time, she cannot bring any other person into trouble. My Lord, Ann Glasscock says, I have been working for my prosecutor nearly five years, and can solemnly declare, during that time, I never took anything from him, and never was in any place of confinement before, having always had an honest character - the case was, the pigs had been amongst the potatoes - the bit of flour was likewise given to me for a pudding at Christmas."</p>

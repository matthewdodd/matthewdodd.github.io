                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Edwards, of Feltham. My husband had some fir poles—I missed them two months ago—they went one or two at a time—I saw some of them safe on the Thursday before they were taken, the 23rd of December—they were at the back of the house—I marked them on that day, and missed them on the Monday following, the 27th, about a quarter before ten o'clock at night—I found the two I had marked in Mr. Cromwell's yard—I have seen the pri<lb></lb>soner before.</p>

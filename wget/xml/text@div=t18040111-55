             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. Q. What are you? - A. An apprentice to Mr. Bryant, a smith; he does the smith's work for Mess Goodwin's brewhouse: On the 5th of January the prisoner and I left Mr. Bryant's shop in Wapping, about ten minutes before four o'clock on Thursday last with some work; we went to Mr. Goodwin's brewhouse; the prisoner had a bar of iron on his shoulder, and I had a hammer in my hand; we were going to fit some work on some brass cocks at the brewhouse; when we got there, there was a screw which prevented his trying the work; he had a candle alight in his hand, and we went up some stairs, and he called me after him; I went up to the top of the stairs to a little warehouse door, and he called me again by my name; then I went inside the place, and he told me to pick up those articles that lay there, and put them in my pocket, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they articles like either of these? - A. I cannot say whether they were like these or not; as soon as I had put them in my pocket I came out, and Mr. Hodsell caught me about five or six yards from the door; the prisoner made his escape, and ran down some stairs; he ran towards the gate where the watchman was; Mr. Hodsell came down the same stairs; when he got to the yard he called out to the watchman not to let that man go out, but he was gone out; Mr. Hodsell took me to the gate; Mr. Scriven came, and ordered Mr. Hodsell to keep me there; then as I was going to the Office, going through Nightingale-lane, there was the prisoner; he had been stopped by a press-gang.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Symonds. Q. He found a screw in the way, so that he could not fit the work on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not go up stairs to get something to fit his work on with? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation passed in the room? - A. He told me to pick these things up.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body was in the room, must they not have heard this conversation? -

            He did not speak very loud to me.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you lived with your master? - A. I have served four years of my time.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Hodsell.) Did you hear the prisoner tell the lad to pick up the things? - A. I heard something said, but I could not tell what it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. (To Brown.) Where did you pick these things up from? - A. From the ground; there was no part in a basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any boxes? - A. The prisoner was at the boxes, and what he took was out of the boxes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe these articles to be the property of Goodwin and Company? - A. This washer I can swear to, by a small dent in the top of it, and a roughness in the inside, which we do not expect in these sort of things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Symonds. Q. When did you first observe that dent? - A. On the 24th of December; I took it into the store-room from the accompting-house.</p>

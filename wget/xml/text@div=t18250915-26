I was in the yard at the back of their house on the 6th of July - there is a cellar door which comes into that yard; it was not open when I went out, but soon afterwards I saw it open. I watched, and saw Sharp, who was quartered in the house, come out of the cellar - he appeared to be tipsy, and had two bottles in his hand, full of a liquor which looked like gin; he went into the tap-room, where the other two prisoners were; they were also tipsy. I went and told Mrs. Beane what I had seen; she went to the tap-room, and asked Sharp what he was doing with the two bottles he had brought out of the cellar - he said, "I have none, search me;" the two bottles were found on White.</p>

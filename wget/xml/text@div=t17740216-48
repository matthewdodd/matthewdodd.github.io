               <p>On his cross examination, he said he went to his lodgings about an hour after the robbery; that he did not apply to any watchmen that night, the maid let him in that night, and he told her of it; that he saw the prisoner and several more of those that robbed him, at the public house ; that he returned to the public house with a constable in half an hour after he f irst quitted it, and found the prisoner as the house; that he took him up and another; that he knew some others, but only took up the man who had his knee upon his breast.</p>

               <p>On his cross examination, he said the prosecutor told him the whole account of the robbery; that he had no hat on, or money when he came to him; and said the prisoner behaved very impudent when he was taken up.</p>

               <p>Tilsdon. It might be about a hundred yards ; he says he was in Church-lane; it is not twenty yards from my house to the corner of Church-lane.</p>

               <p>Grubb. About half an hour after eight o'clock; the magistrate was rather doubtful of the prisoner; he desired I would go to his mother's, as he said he lay at home all night, to search his lodgings, to see if I could find his hat; she said he came home about eleven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160034"></xptr> o'clock; he knocked, but she would not let him in.</p>

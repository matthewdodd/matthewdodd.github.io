               <p>I am a constable; I went to the house of Collins, the prisoner's father-in-law, to search for some fowls, and I found sacks in a box in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in that box? - A sack with about half a bushel of flour in it, which box I was informed was the prisoner's at the bar; I took it to Bow-street; Mr. Smith attended there, and owned the sack; the sack is here.</p>

               <p>I live at Hornchurch, in Essex; I have the malt mills, at Bromley; I was sent for to look at a sack at the magistrate's; it was my sack, and this is the sack; I asked the prisoner how he came by that sack? he said he found it; I asked him where? he said, in the Gravel-pits, by the side of the New Cut, going down from Bromley to Limehouse; I asked him if he did not know that sack belonged to me? he said, he neither knew me not the sack; I asked him how it came in his box? he said, he carried it home from where he found it, and put it in his box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever employ him? - Never. I told him. I wondered he was not seen to carry it through Bromley, where my mills are; he said he put it in another sack to prevent it being seen.</p>

               <p>Q. Had any body else access to his box? - Nobody that I knew of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. About three weeks ago I found two of Mr. Killicks sacks, in the river, and took them to his mills, and he said why did not I keep them, they were not worth above's pot of beer, and he gave me half a pint of small beer when I asked him for something to drink; and I was going down to Limehouse Cut, and I found this sack in the gravel pit, with the flour in it, I did not know whose it was, and I took it into our barge, and took it home, and I found a piece of wood and put in it and took it home to my mother, who is blind.</p>

I am cashier at the Stratford branch of the London and County Bank—Mr. Robert Dickenson keeps an account there—this cheque was presented at the bank on 22nd August as it is now, I believe by the prisoner—when I saw the signature was correct, I asked him the usual question "How will you take it?"—he replied "Gold; I want it for change"—I paid him in gold—I should think he was under my observation about two minutes—the ledger-keeper called my attention to the cheque a little after 3 in the afternoon, and I communicated with Mr. Dickenson, and afterwards with Messrs. Cleaver—I went to Messrs. Cleaver's premises on the morning of the 23rd—the prisoner came in about 9.50—I identified him then—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge, except when he was at the bank—on the afternoon of the 22nd a gentleman handed me some cards which he took from the front of the counter, at the place where the man stood who presented the cheque—these are the cards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

Cleaver's while I was there—the cheque was presented, as near as I can say, after 12 and before 12.40—I left the bank at that time—it was not presented later than that—when my attention was called to the cheque, I saw there was something the matter with it—I said before the Magistrate it was between 11 and 12.40—I have since referred to my book, and find it must have been between 12 and 12.40—I had a few other cheques presented that morning, but it was the last entry but one I made before I went to dinner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable in the service of the Great Eastern Railway Company, and live at 10, Type Court, Chiswell Street, St. Luke's, in the warehouse of William Burgess—my bedroom is on the ground floor—at a few minutes past half-past five o'clock I had been in bed two or three minutes, and found the room exceedingly light—I looked up and saw the prisoner looking into the room over the curtain, with a baker's cap on—I slipped out of bed and saw him move a jug and pull a scarf with a gold pin in it towards him, which he got to a broken window—I suppose he saw me looking at him, for he pulled the window down and said, "I want to speak to you, governor"—I had my trousers on; I slipped on my boots, and put my coat on as I went along—the prisoner went up a court, turned round, and came back as if he had come through—I said, "I want you, young fellow," he said, "What for?" I said, "For opening my shutters and window, and attempting to steal my hat, scarf, and pin"—he said, "I know nothing about it; look at my hands, I go to work"—I said, "What are you doing up at this time?"—he said, "I have been to call two or three fellows who work with me"—I gave him in custody and said, "If you will tell me the names of the persons you went to call up I will fetch them as your witnesses"—he said, "I never said anything of the kind."</p>

You said that you worked in the City Road—I said that that was not the way to go—you said, "I always take a walk for half an hour of a morning"—you were going the other way from where you live, in Golden Lane.</p>

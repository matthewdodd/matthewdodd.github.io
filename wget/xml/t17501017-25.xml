                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175010170019"></xptr>Brown. I happen'd to carry some linen to the prisoner's to be mended; and she said there was a letter of attorney to be made to her; so she desir'd I would go along with her, to see it done; Harrison and she had been together before; and he was to meet her there, with a blank. There were several people in the publick room when it was done; but I don't know the names of any. I did not know the name of Williams, but by my seeing him write his name. The letter was put into his hand, to find the name Williams. There was no such name upon it.</p>

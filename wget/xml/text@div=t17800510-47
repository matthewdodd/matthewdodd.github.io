On the 13th of April, between twelve and one in the day, I heard a rustling in the passage. I saw the prisoner just going out at the door with a bundle in her lap; I called to her, and asked her where she had been; she said to a gentlewoman up stairs; she said she must go up to her again. She went up and knocked at the door, and the gentlewoman who lodges there (

I desired to see it? She opened her apron, and immediately dropped them. I locked her and the lodger together into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100062"></xptr>dining-room, and went down and sent for a constable. The things mentioned in the indictment were the things she had in her apron. She had taken them out of my two-pair-of-stairs room. She said before the justice, that she bought them of a Jew.</p>

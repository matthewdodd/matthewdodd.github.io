               <p>niece on Sunday, 14th Jan., at Limehouse Church. After the wedding festivities were over, we were returning by a boat from Limehouse Hole Stairs—I could not exactly tell the time, but it must have been after the time of shutting up—Daniel Hurley, the father and mother, and the sister of the young woman who was married, accompanied us to the stairs—when I got on the stairs, I met the prisoner—he said, "Halloo, Timmins"—I said, "I don't know you, you have got the advantage of me"—he said, "Oh, I know you"—I said, "Are you going over the water?"—he said, "Yes"—I went into the boat and said, "Hand my mistress in, if you please"—he helped my mistress into the boat, but she and he got into the water first—we were then ferried over the water—we got out of the boat, on the Surrey side—the prisoner got out first, my wife next—I stopped, and paid the waterman the fare for all—we went down the alley, and turned down the street, making our way home—the prisoner laid hold of my wife's arm sometimes and sometimes he let it alone; my wife walked behind us two—as we got about ten yards from my house I said, "Well, my man, which way are you going? I am at home"—I was just going to say, "Good night," and at that moment my foot was kicked from under me, and he laid hold of my guard—he kicked my leg; I was obliged to go to the hospital—he snatched my watch out of my pocket; I saw it in his hand afterwards—he ran away; my guard was a silver one—it had been broken before, and was sewn together with black thread—I cannot tell where it broke, whether on the thread or where it was broken away from my neck and nothing left—when he kicked me I was <hi rend="italic">obligated</hi> to fall; I had no power to help myself; my wife ran after the prisoner—I got up again as quickly as I could, and got to the top of the alley—he went round the Seven Houses, I saw him pass the top of those houses; I gave the alarm, "Stop thief!" as loud as ever I could, and ran after him as well as I could—my watch was silver, it cost me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had been drinking some little at the wedding—I have no recollection of seeing the prisoner before that night—I have no doubt he was the man who accosted me, and did this to me—I saw him again, when the policeman brought him to my house the same night—I should think about half past 1 o'clock—he was dressed exactly in the same way as he was when I saw him first.</p>

I said, "You have got the advantage of me"—he said, he had known me at the Commercial Docks twelve months ago, and he had worked for me (I was foreman of the Commercial Docks twelve months ago)—I said to him, "Are you going over the water?" and we all went over—I understand the waterman is here who took us over—he was examined before the Magistrate; he did not go before the Grand Jury—I should think my house is half a mile from the river—we met very few per<lb></lb>sons; one old man, I think—when I called, "Stop thief!" I made a great alarm; there were plenty of people round—I do not think I saw women, but there were men—my watch was gone; I have never seen it since.</p>

               <p>husband attended the wedding of my niece, on Sunday, 14th Jan.—we were returning home to Limehouse Stairs about 10 o'clock, but I cannot say to a minute or two—some friends accompanied us to the stairs—as we got near the stairs, I saw the prisoner; he made very much of my husband, and called him by name—when we got to the stairs my husband got in the boat first, and he asked the prisoner to hand me into the boat—he took bold of my hand to hand me in, but instead of that I fell into the water—we were ferried over the water, and when we got out on the other side, we went to the stairs—the prisoner got out first, I followed, and my husband staid in the boat to pay the boatman—we went to Rotherhithe, where my husband lives—as we got near the house, my husband said, "Where are you going, my boy?" and before be spoke the word, the prisoner knocked his feet from under him, and took his watch and guard—the prisoner ran round the Seven Horses—I ran, and called, "Murder!"—I caught him by the breast of his coat—he knocked me down on the pavement—I was all out to pieces—I saw a policeman, and showed my face to him, about half past 1 o'clock, when the prisoner was brought to our house—I did not see anything of the prisoner from the time I was knocked down, till the policeman brought him—I had not seen the prisoner before 14th Jan.; I have no doubt he is the person who accosted my husband, and acted in the way I have described—I had not been drinking—I was sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long would it take to go from there to Limehouse, including the chance of getting a boat immediately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say five minutes to cross the water, and about five minutes to get to the water—that would depend on the state of the tide, and whether you could get a boat directly—if you went as quickly as you could to the river side, and jumped into a boat immediately, it would take about ten minutes; but if the tide were against you, and you could not get a boat immediately, it would take a longer time.</p>

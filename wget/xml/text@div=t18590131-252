                  </hi>. I am single, and live with my brother at 2, Windsor-terrace, City-road, St. Luke's; it is his dwelling-house—on Tuesday night, 4th January, about ten o'clock, I was sitting up for him in the front parlour and heard the street-door opened with a latch-key—the parlour-door in which I was sitting was closed—I directly after heard the back-parlour door open, it creaks very much—I went into the passage and saw the street-door closed but not shut with the latch, merely put to—I rang the bell and the lodgers, who were in bed, came down, and the prisoner opened the door of my room and came out—I asked him what he wanted there, he said, "Nothing, it is all right, let me pass," and tried to pass; but I held him till the lodgers came down—they were not dressed, but they held him till I called a policeman and gave him in custody—the doors were shut half an hour before, and no one had gone out or come in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an umbrella-maker, living at 38, Sloane Square, and occupying a shop in Sloane Street—on the evening of the 2nd March, I locked up my shop as usual, from the outside, and proceeded to my residence for the night—about 7 o'clock the next morning I found that it had been broken into—the front door was open, two bolts had been burst off, and the place was in disorder—all my umbrellas and parasols had been taken from the windows—the drawers were open, and the umbrellas which had been brought to be repaired, were missing also—the thieves had sat in the parlour and out off the silver collars from about two and a half dozens of canes—they had spoiled about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of paragon ribs—there was a lantern with a light in it, and evidently they had had supper there, for there were fish bones and potatoe parings all over the place—the value of the stolen property was about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the umbrellas were of English manufacture, and some of them bore my name—about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of dog collars an missing now, as also other of the property—I have recovered about 860 umbrellas and parasols—the property which was sold to Mr. Theodoredi for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was in value from 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., many of the umbrellas being of the very best quality—Mr. Theodoredi came to my place on the 9th, and after<lb></lb>wards I saw Mr. Nardaud, I believe—I had received an anonymous letter before then, and had been with the police to Mr. Theodoredi's place, in New Broad Street—the bulk of the stolen property was found in Mr. Theodoredi's private residence, at Battersea, and a portion at his shop in New Broad Street—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an interpreter, living at 35, Wardour Street, Soho—on 4th March, as I was going to the City, by boat, from Hungerford Pier, about 3.30 in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner, who showed me two silk umbrellas, one a gentleman's and the other a lady's, and said that he</p>

               <p>had received a quantity from Paris, and wanted to sell some of them, so as to raise money, to send the same evening, in part payment of what had been sent—he said he was going into the City to meet somebody who was about to sell them for him—I said that I could introduce him to a gentleman, who, I hoped, would buy them—nothing was said as to quality or price—I believe he said he had 340 umbrellas altogether, namely, 200 gentlemen's and 140 ladies', all silk—I took him to Mr. Theodoredi's, in New Broad Street; but there was no bargain made at first between them—Mr. Theodoredi was out at the time—when he returned I told him I had brought him a party who had some umbrellas for sale—Mr. Theodoredi wanted to see the bulk when he made any arrangement as to purchase—prisoner said that he could bring the bulk, and then he left—I went out with Mr. Theodoredi to a place in Water Lane, and when we got back to his office, about 11.30, the umbrellas were there, and the prisoner and another man waiting (<hi rend="italic">looking at a prisoner named Edward</hi>) that is the man—I asked the prisoner who the man was, and he said that he was his landlord, and a friend of his—Mr. Theodoredi looked at the umbrellas, and found that some of them were not quite new, and he asked the prisoner how that was—the prisoner said it was a job lot, which had been purchased by his landlord, for whom he wanted to sell them—a price was named, and the prisoner agreed to accept a lump sum of 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the whole of the property—the money was to be paid that evening; but, as it was late, Mr. Theodoredi gave the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and he wrote out a receipt—there is only his sig<lb></lb>nature on the stamp—the body of the receipt is in the handwriting of some<lb></lb>one else; I think a friend of Mr. Theodoredi's wrote it—I was there the next morning, about 11.15, and the prisoner was there, too—a cheque for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was given—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner went away, but returned in about an hour and a half afterwards, and received another cheque for the balance, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he wanted to have some profit out of the trans<lb></lb>action; but, by arrangement, he was to give his friend the cheque for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as he himself had had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before—I was to have a commission of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my trouble, and the prisoner gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Edwards 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., besides.</p>

I live at 16, High Street, Bloomsbury—on the 4th March I was in a coffee-house in Rupert Street, and the prisoner and four or five foreigners were there—the prisoner told me he had about 300 silk umbrellas for sale—I said there were plenty of people in the City who would buy them—he asked me if I would accompany him there, and I did—at the boat pier we met with Nardaud—I did not go into Theodoredi's the first time, but waited outside the office—when the prisoner came out again, I went with him to the same coffee—shop I had seen him in in Rupert Street—I then went with him to Cranbourn Street, and waited for him about half an hour—when next I saw him he was inside a cab, No. 2332, with three men—there were boxes and things in the cab—then we went on to Theodoredi's—the prisoner and Edwards carried the umbrellas into the place—I saw Morieau the next day—he told me he had only 284 umbrellas, 180 silk, and 100 alpaca—I said they did not look like English goods, and he replied that his landlord had just received them from Paris.</p>

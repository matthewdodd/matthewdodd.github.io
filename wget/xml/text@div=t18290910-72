               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you know whether there are any other persons interested in the property? A. No - Mr. Knight is the King's attorney; it is a house with two rooms and a small kitchen - only the prisoner, and a woman who lived with him, lived in the house, that I know of; Mr. Knight pays me for looking after these houses - I have a written authority.</p>

            . I am a chimney-sweeper, and live in Moffatt's-court - the prisoner lived in that court. About a quarter before four o'clock one morning, my little dog awoke me - I saw the prisoner go into a shed, get a ladder, and put it up against the house, No. 2, Moffatt's-court; in about half an hour he went up the ladder, pushed up the sash, went in, took a knife out of his pocket, and began to cut the strings of the sash - then he went down stairs, and broke the shutters; he came and put the sashes down under the window - he saw me, and said, "Halloo, Jack!"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where were you? A. Partly in my father's room, and partly in the garden; I had one leg inside - I did not say at one time that he looked up at the house for half an hour, and then that he went up instantly; I said he stopped half an hour before he went up - I do not think I ever said he went up instantly; he opened the gate, and went in - I then came out, went up - I do not think I ever said he went up instantly; he opened the gate, and went in - I then came out, went back, and went to bed; I did not call my father or give any information till eight o'clock.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received notice to examine the house - it stands in a very peculiar situation; I went to the prisoner's house, and found some wood burning in the fire - here is one of the fellow-sashes which had not been taken; the pieces of sashes which were found seemed to match in every respect - the prisoner was not at home; he came in, and said his wife picked them up.</p>

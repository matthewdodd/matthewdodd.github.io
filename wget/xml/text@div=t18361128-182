                  </hi>. I live at No. 10, Upper Bryanstone-street, and am an ornamental painter. I caused an advertisement to be put in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> on the 3rd of September, offering a <hi rend="italic">bonus</hi> to any person who could procure a situation—I have not got it here—I received a letter on the 5th in consequence of that advertisement—I now produce it—in consequence of that I waited on the prisoner, at his office, 41, Devonshire-street, Queen-square, Bloomsbury, and on an interview with the prisoner, I told him I called in answer to the letter he did me the honour to address to me on the previous day—I produced the letter to him (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"41, Devonshire-street, Queen-square, Bloomsbury, September 5th, 1836.</p>
               <p>"Sir—In reply to your advertisement relative to a situation, in the <hi rend="italic">Chron<lb></lb>icle</hi> of this morning, I beg to inform you that if you will favour me with a call to-morrow, between two and four o'clock, I make no doubt of being enabled, in a personal interview, to furnish you with what you require, through my connexion with influential parties.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> On producing this letter, the prisoner informed me he could procure me a situation in the Treasury, at a salary commencing at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., per annum—I am sure he said that—he said he was an agent in the transaction, but previous to the negotiation being opened, I must deposit 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as a sort of cement to the bargain—I cannot swear he used that word, but that was the idea—I told him I was disinclined to pay any thing—he informed me if I did not deposit the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that nothing could be done—I left him, and told him I would think it over, and he said if I would call the following day, at twelve o'clock, his clerk would draw up an instrument, which he called a letter of agreement—he used the word instrument—I called on the following day, and saw the prisoner, and he produced a copy</p>

               <p>of an agreement, which I hold in my hand—he gave me the original paper, which I have lost—this is a copy of it—I read over the paper, and told him I would think of it—on the 13th of September I had an interview with him—I deposited 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and signed a paper similar to this—he told me on the 13th, if I would meet him on the following Thursday, he would bring a petition to the Lords of the Treasury, which I was to sign—I met him on Thursday the 16th, and he produced a petition to the Lords of the Treasury—I have not got that—he then produced a paper—I signed it, and he took it away with him, to send it, and he asked me for an advance of 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to go to Bury St. Edmunds, to get the paper signed by his patron—I advanced the 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and we parted with the promise that he would meet me on the following Monday, at the Delaware Arms, at the corner of Portman-street, in Oxford-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone; but he sent his clerk to say he should not be able to meet me, but I saw him afterwards—he said he had been to Bury St. Edmunds, and had seen his patron, and he had signed the paper, and it was sent in to the Lords of the Treasury—I am not cer<lb></lb>tain whether he said his patron, or he had sent it in—I had a subsequent interview with him, which tended to nothing; but on the 23rd of Septem<lb></lb>ber, he sent me a letter by his clerk, whom I had seen at his house—he was the person that introduced me to the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I met the prisoner the same evening—I told him I had received a letter by his clerk—I told him that Mr. Edge had called upon me—he said, "Yes, I sent him with a note for an advance of 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>"—I told him I hoped he was not deceiving me in any way, and he declared to his God that he was not—I told him, under these circumstances, I could depend on him as a man of honour, and I would advance the 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on the following Monday morning—I did so, by way of loan, at this office—I lent it—I told the clerk so at the time—it was so understood between the prisoner and myself—he offered, on a subsequent occasion, to give me an I O U for the money—I cannot exactly say the date—I had several interviews with the prisoner—I was to pay him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by instalments—that was said wen I signed the agreement—the prisoner gave me this copy of it on the 31st of October as a substitute—he gave me this as a copy of the other, as near as his clerk could draw it out—I saw it signed by the prisoner himself—I saw his clerk draw of the body—I had lost the former one (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—</p>
               <p>"Memorandum of agreement made and entered into this 13th day of Sep<lb></lb>tember, 1836, between Mr. W.

But in case the said Mr. Mutch shall fail or neglect to procure the said appointment by the time specified, then and in that case the said Mr. Mutch agrees to refund the said deposit when thereto required; but in case the said Mr. Baker shall refuse to accept the said situation when appointed thereto, then and in that case the said deposit shall become forfeited; and it is further agreed upon by the said parties, that the balance of the said sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shall be paid to the said Mr. Mutch by quarterly instalments of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. until the whole shall be liquidated.

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I certainly thought the prisoner could do what he undertook under this agreement—I was deceived—I paid him the first 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 13th of September, and in all 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including the two payments of 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I have not got the situation—I told him that I thought I was unqualified for it—he replied, "There are greater fools than you in the Treasury"—I signed a paper on the 13th of September, and delivered it to the prisoner—I believe it to be a copy of the one which he gave me on that occasion, except that my signature was to the one and his to the other—he was to keep the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I got the situation, and have 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more.</p>

               <p>"Oct. 4, 1836.</p>
               <p>"Sir,—I beg to inform you I have received an officer of an engagement for five years from Mr. Morrant, painter of Bond-street, as the enclosed letter will show; and as I feel at full liberty to close the negotiation with you, according to the time specified in the agreement, namely, fourteen days I have accepted Mr. Morrant's offer conditionally, that is to say, if I do not receive the appointment before five o'clock on Saturday evening next, I shall return you the agreement; but in case you can procure the appoint<lb></lb>ment before that time, I will thank you, if you can so manage matters that I shall not be called upon to enter on the officer before the next quarter, namely, the 25th of December, 1836, as I then shall be better qualified with my pen. My not entering before December will not in any way inter<lb></lb>fere in the money matters between us.

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Richard Attenborough, a pawnbroker in High-street, Shoreditch. On Friday night, the 4th of June, I hung a counterpane and bed-furniture a little way from the door—I saw them, safe about eleven o'clock that night. On opening the shop-door next morning I found a square of glass in the fanlight, which bad been broken, was broken more, and the counterpane and bed-furniture gone—that now produced is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a weaver, and lodge up stairs in this house. On this day fortnight I was at home—I do not recollect the day of the month—I was going down stairs, to go to the back yard, and saw the prisoner, a female, and another boy in the entry—the boy had a basket with him—he asked for Mr. Sharp, and asked if he might leave a parcel there till Mr. Sharp came home—he did so, and then went away—the prisoner took it in—I could not say whether this bed-furniture was in the parcel, but I really think it was.</p>

On the 26th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was at the parlour door, the prisoner came into the shop, and put his hand on the coat—I turned round, and asked him what he wanted—he said, "Have you any apartments to let"—I said, "Yes"—he said "Never mind, I will call again"—about half an hour after another man came in with an umbrella, and asked if I wanted to buy it—he put it down and ran away, and immediately after a coat was missing from near the parlour door.</p>

I saw a man come in with an umbrella—I was in the parlour—the man opened the umbrella out, and while he was doing so, I saw the prisoner take the coat off the horse, and run out—I pursued him, calling, "Stop thief"—he threw it away as he turned the corner—I saw him stopped—I am sure he is the same person.</p>

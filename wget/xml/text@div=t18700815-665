I occupy two parlours, at 34, Rowland Street—on the morning of 11th August, about 3.30, I heard the bell ringing—I went down and saw the police—from what was said I searched, and missed six coats, four pairs of trowsers, three jackets, a waistcoat, and a tablecloth, worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, from the front parlour—they were all safe the night before, when I shut up—when I went to bed I left the parlour window a little way open at the top—the lower window was shut down—this property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine.</p>

About 2 o'clock on the morning of 11th August, I saw the two prisoners in Howland Street, and Samuel was carrying a bundle—I followed them to 20, Union Street—they stopped there, and Samuel put down the bundle he was carrying—I asked them what they had got, and they said "A bundle of old clothes"—I asked where they got them, they said "At the King's Head public-house, Bow"—I asked if they knew the person they bought them from—they said they could not tell me—Samuel said they gave 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I took them to the station, and George said he gave 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I found a knife on Samuel, and a latch-key on George.</p>

In April last I belonged to the Alfred barge, which laid in the West India docks; the prisoner was a boy on board the same vessel, and had a brother on board - on the 26th of April I saw him and his brother fighting; his father was a mariner on board the barge, but was not on board at that time - I interfered and parted his brother and him twice; they were fighting both times in the cabin - when I parted them the second time I took the prisoner away; I held him in the cabin, and told his brother to go on deck - the prisoner struggled, but I held him till his brother went on deck; I then released him, and he took up a quart pot to heave at me, or hit me with it - I took it from him- he then took up a poker, and said he would knock my brains out with it; I took the poker from him, and then he said he would go on deck and chuck the young b - r overboard - his brother is five or six years younger than him; I told him he should not go on deck to throw his brother overboard - he said he would be b - gg - red if he would not; he was going to pull me out of the scuttle down into the cabin to go on deck - I pushed him from me down the ladder into the cabin to prevent his going; he did not fall in the cabin - he sat down - he had offered to fight me before this; I said I would fight him if he would go on shore, but I would not fight on board - he struck me when he offered to fight, but I did not strike him again, but held him down in the cabin; his brother was in the cabin at that time - it was before I had separated them, and before he attempted to throw the pot at me, or strike me with the poker.</p>

               <p>Q. Then this happened when you were parting them the second time; after the brother had gone on deck you let the prisoner go? A. Yes, and then he wanted to go up to throw his brother overboard; I stood in the scuttle, and said,"Jack, you shan't" - he wanted to pull me out, but I pushed him down into the cabin; he sat there a minute, then pulled out his knife, and said, "You b - y b - r, I will cut your guts out" - he got the knife out of his pocket, and opened it; he struck at me, and I fell on the locker in the cabin - he kept hitting at me; I held up my feet to defend my body from the knife - I kept him off with my feet; I jumped up and caught hold of his left hand instead of the right - he caught hold of me and stuck me in the thigh, just above the knee, and after stabbing me in the thigh he had the knife up ready to hit me with it; I caught hold of the hand which held the knife, and held him till he was secured - he only struck me once with the knife; I drew the knife up through his hand till I got it - I did not cut his hand in so doing; the Policeman came in then, and took him - a doctor was fetched; the officer has the knife.</p>

            . I am one of the Thames Police-officers, I went on board the Alfred barge; I went into the cabin. found the prosecutor lying on the locker, and the prisoner standing very near him - the knife was then in the hands of some other person; there were several in the barge -I asked for the knife; it was handed to me - I asked the prisoner if that was the knife he had done it with; he said, Yes, it was - I did not make him either threat or promise; I said, "Is it possible you have been stabbing with this knife?" he said, "Yes, I did" - there was a medical gentleman there who had just done the wound up; it was not bleeding then - the medical man is not here - the prosecutor was sent to the hospital by his direction; I asked the prisoner if he was using the knife for any purpose, or if he had opened it on purpose to stab him with - he said he had opened it on purpose.</p>
               <p>JAMES LIGHTFOOT. I received the wound right in the bend of my knee; the knife entered the bone - the doctor said so; it was a deep wound - I was five weeks in the hospital, and have been at home not able to do any thing till now; I feel a stiffness in my leg now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I first went into the cabin I slapped my brother's head, for striking a light to light his pipe, when no lights are allowed in the docks - he struck me and knocked me down on the locker.</p>

            . I struck the light myself - his brother did not strike one at all; he came and called over to his brother, and said he would give him a d - d good hiding - I said, "What is the use of quarrelling? you are always quarrelling directly your father goes on shore;" he took the tinder-box and flung it about, then went to his brother, and his brother begged me to take him away; I am sure I never struck the prisoner - I pushed him down, and held him down while his brother went away.</p>

I went to bed on the evening of the 28th of September, about nine o'clock, as I came home very tired- I looked round the house before I went up stairs, and it was all fast; the kitchen was fasted by a long bar across the shutter, which is inside the casement, so that I could not see whether that was fastened - it is an old fashioned casement; there is a French window to the drawing-room, and to the hall - the door was barred and locked, and had a bell on it; about two o'clock Mrs. Choppin awoke me, and said something; I listened, and heard something drop in my dressing-room, which is next to the bed-room; I burn a rush-light in my room - I got out of bed, lighted a candle, and Mrs. Choppin lighted another; while I was lighting the candle Mrs. Choppin said she dare say it was the servant getting up to make the butter - I immediately opened my bed-room door, and called Mary! some person immediately said "Hush!" softly - I looked forward, and two men rushed down stairs; they came out of the left-hand room, which is my boy's room, and went before me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180007"></xptr>as I stood at my bed-room door I could see them as plain as possible, by the light behind me, which was on my bedroom drawers, opposite the door; I turned round to Mrs. Choppin - she put up the window, and called for help; a carter got over the yard gate and came in; I went down stairs directly, and found the glass door or window leading from the hall into the garden open; that was fastened the night before with a bar, and had a bell to it - my wife and servant had followed me down stairs, and when I got down I looked round, and saw lots of things in the hall; there were cruet-stands, clothes, brandy, and wine - two cellar or cupboard doors, in the hall were broken open, where I keep wine and other articles - the locks were broken right off; I then went to the drawing-room - the door was open- the drawer of the table had been taken out, and the plated snuffers, with silver edges, taken out, and put on the table; I then went into the kitchen, and found the door open, which had been shut at night; it had no lock, only a catch - I found the window shutters wide open; they had been opened by a piece six or eight inches square being cut out by a centre-bit - it was large enough to put through a hand and remove the bar, which was moved; a pane of glass was taken out of the leaden frame, which enabled them to open the casement, and bore the shutter: they had entered there, I have no doubt, and retreated through the hall door, as the bar and bell laid against the garden wall outside; I went from there to the parlour sideboard, and found all the silver tops off the pepper, mustard, and sugar-stands; the sideboard drawer was broken open - my writing-desk was broken open, and a very handsome silver pencil-case and a gold seal taken away; my wife's writing-desk was broken open, but nothing missed from it, and the bookcase was broken open, but nothing missed - the cupboard door was broken open, a tea caddy opened, and a silver spoon taken out; two salt-spoons and silver sugar-tongs were left on the table - some brandy and gin had been drank, which had been taken out of the cupboard; I told the carter to go on the road and give and alarm at Stamford-hill - we have no guard nearer then there; just as I was going to let the carter out, a man stood there, who I spoke to - we looked round the house, and went to bed; this was between two and three o'clock: I got up about seven - my brother-in-law came in, and Pye, the constable; we examined the windows, and found some chips and oil, which the tools had been greased with, and there was one piece of tobaccopipe, three or four inches long, with the bowl to it, and another piece; two little round phosphorus-matches, both of which had been lighted, and there were three or four more little bits of pipe - Pye took possesion of them, and one bit of pipe was left on the ground; that was a bit of pipe without the bowl; I rode up the London road, and at the turnpike I got information, and in the evening the carter came back, and about five o'clock a Policeman came down - I went over the premises with him, and when we got to the kitchen window I saw him pick up a bit of a tobacco-pipe, which I had thrown down in the morning - he put it into his pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your maidservant here? A. No; she remained below about two minutes after I went to bed, to bring up some hot water, which she brought into my room; I wished her good night, and she then went into her room - I heard her go into her room, and shut her door; she might have gone down stairs after I went to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you made some exclamation to the maid when you was alarmed, as to whether she had admitted any body into her room? A. As the man said Hush! I turned round to Mrs. Choppin, and said, "Why it ayn't right;" I said nothing to the maid about a sweetheart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was it in the kitchen you threw down the tobacco-pipe? A. Outside, in the garden; I could see where it fell - it was in one piece, about an inch long, broken off the bowl; it was part of the pipe, which the bowl belonged to; Pye had taken away the bowl with the tobacco in it; there were about three inches of pipe to the bowl which he took away; I found one bit with the bowl, and one broken bit - Pye took away one piece, and the other dropped down again, and the officer afterwards took it away with him.</p>
               <p>Martin. Q. How did the carter get an entrance into your house? A. He got over the yard gate, not the garden gate; the garden gate was never unlocked - I let him out at the yard gate: they are both front gates - there were footmarks at the garden gate; I examined your shoes at the station-house on Sunday, to see if there were nails in them; there were no nails in the footmarks - the robbery was on Friday morning; I believe there had been rain between those times - the garden had been dug up the day before the robbery, and there were no footmarks before; it was the marks of two or three shoes - I cannot swear how long they were; I said one was long: Pye measured one with a rule, in my presence, and said it was about eleven inches long, and the other was a very short foot - he did not measure the short one.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the footmarks on the gravel or on the bed? A. One the bed, by the side of the footpath; the footpath is gravel and drift - it was hard, and would not take an impression well.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS: Q. Did you not apprehend them in the public highway? A. Yes; it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180008"></xptr>ten or eleven miles from the prosecutor's house; I examined Jones' person accurately.</p>

            . I am a Police-inspector. On Friday morning, about six o'clock, I was on duty at the Kingsland station, and observed the three prisoners coming along the road, in company together, towards town, in a direction from Eufield; I had heard of a robbery at the time, and told some of the men in the station to apprehend them, which was done - I asked where they had been; Smithers said they had been to Hertford; that was in a direction from Hertford; I detained them; and next day,(Saturday) at the Police-office, I searched Smithers, and in his coat pocket found this bit of a tobacco-pipe - I have had it ever since - I compared it with some other pipe before the Magistrate, in their presence; I compared it with a piece Williams produced, and it corresponds with it; the two ends fit as broken - it is not broken straight off, but dove-tailed; I afterwards went to the prosecutor's house, and observed they had removed a small pane of glass from the back kitchen window, and opened the shutter by a center-bit - some chips laid about under the window; I observed three or four footmarks in the garden - they were quite distinct; there was not more than two impressions which could be measured fairly - I did not remark whether they were large or small feet; I afterwards received the shoes of all the prisoners, and delivered them to Mellish.</p>
               <p>Martin. Q. How long after the robbery did you go to Choppin's house? A. The next day, about four o'clock in the afternoon - I went in at the front gate, but not where you got over; I saw no footmarks at the gate I went in at- they were close to the gate leading to the front of the house, not where the servants go in - I found no footmarks any where else.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I received three pairs of shoes from the inspector, and took them to Mr. Choppin's on Sunday, the 30th; I went into the garden, and saw two footmarks against the front gate of the garden - they were near the gate, in the garden; I tried the shoes to the impressions, which were quite fresh - I found one shoe, belonging to Martin, correspond with one of the footmarks near the gate - it was in the mould, which was soft; the impression was distinct, except a small piece on the heel - a small part of the heel had caught against the box border; it seemed as if the impression had been made tip-toe; the toe was deeper - it was close against the fence, and appeared to be done by a person jumping down - I have no doubt whatever but the impression was made by that shoe; there were only two footmarks which I could compare - the other was so slight, I could not compare any of the shoes with it; in another part of the garden, near the hall window, I found another footmark, and tried Smithers shoes to it, and found one of his shoes corresponded exactly with the mark; it was a shoe without nails- there was nothing particular in the impression; it was a small shoe of the left foot - there was only the impresssion of one foot; a person stepping off the gravel path on to the border where the mark was, would reach the window with one foot, and the footmark pointed as if going to the hall window.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance from the fence was the mark which Martin's shoe matched? A. About a foot; I have no doubt whatever that the impressions were made by Martin's and Smithers' shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. On what day had the house been broken open? A. On the Friday; I have not heard Mr. Choppin examined - I believe there had been rain between the Friday and Sunday, but the rain did not at all interfere with the footmark, as it was shaded by a laurel tree; there had been very little rain at Enfield, I believe, though there had been a great deal in London - I only know that by inquiries I had made.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the mark of Martin's shoes towards the house or from it? A. The side of the footmark was towards the house.</p>
               <p>MR. CHOPPIN. I do not recollect that there was much rain between the Friday and Sunday; I think not - the impressions were not altered in the least; the garden had been raked over the day before the robbery - the descriptien given of the footmarks is very correct; one of the men I saw had gilt buttons as he went down stairs, and the other had dark clothes, and at the office Jones had gilt buttons; he has a mark on his face.</p>

On the Thursday previous to the robbery I started to look for work - my father gave me two sovereigns, and a letter of recommendation to go to Cambridge; I proceeded as far as Hertford, and finding I had lost the letter, I thought it useless to proceed - I returned, and by the station-house was taken into custody; had I been guilty I might have escaped several times - I was not handcuffed.</p>
               <p>Smithers' Defence. I was out of work, and went into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180009"></xptr>the country - I found I could get none, and thought I would return to town; I came as far as Kingsland, went into the Brill, and was there about an hour, and had some beer and a pipe, and that is the pipe I gave the Policeman; when I came out of the public-house, which is about one hundred yards from the station-house; I was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Martin's Defence. I beg to call your attention to a few remarks; I have no friends to speak for me - at the first examination the prosecutor said he called in a carter, who jumped over the fence - now he must have made footmarks; the Policeman measured the footmarks, which were eleven inches, and my shoe measures longer; the Policeman did not fit them till three days after the robbery - I call your serious attention to this part of my case.</p>

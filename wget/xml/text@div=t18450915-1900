I had a pair of boots hang<lb></lb>ing on a horse inside my shop—I saw them safe at eight o'clock in the morning, and missed them at half-past four in the afternoon—these produced are them—the prisoners came to my shop together about three o'clock that afternoon—I had never seen them before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Davis, a pawnbroker, at Woolwich. On the 8th of Sept., about four o'clock, Watson brought these boots—no one was with her—she said at first they were her own, and then that they belonged to Mrs. Smith—I saw nothing of Coleman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Coleman's Defence</hi>—(<hi rend="italic">written.</hi>)—"On 8th Sept. I met Watson. She asked me to go with her to purchase a pair of boots. I refused first, and told her I could not, I was rather in a hurry: and she requested me so, and told me she would not be long; however, I went with her. I was only acquainted with her about six weeks; when she went into the shop she never asked for the boots. I was rather surprised; she made an excuse, by looking at some second-hand dresses. I told her I could not go any further, if she did not mean purchasing the boots in that shop; it was the last of my thoughts to think she had got them in her possession at the time; when she got a short distance from the shop, she told me she had stolen them. I was glad to leave her company as soon as I could, so I wished her good afternoon. I had been at home about two hours, when, to my surprise, a policeman knocked at the door, and asked for me. I came down stairs; he said he wanted me, and asked me if I knew any<lb></lb>thing about the boots. I told him the truth. I went to the station-house, and asked Watson her meaning, for trying to get me into trouble; she said she did not think the policeman would take me, and she did not know what to say; therefore, to clear herself, she has got me into trouble; and I declare solemnly I am innocent; she told several different tales at the station-house."</p>

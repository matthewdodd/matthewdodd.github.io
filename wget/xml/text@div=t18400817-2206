                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside in Crossfield-lane, Deptford. On the 9th of July I received 6 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes at the Bank, on the 11th of July I went by the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi> steam-boat from London-bridge to Gravesend—I had with me four of those 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, which I put into a black satin bag—the notes which I received were Nos. 59223 to 59228, inclusive, and those I had when I went to Gravesend were 59223 to 59226—the other two notes I have now—I put also in my bag thirty-eight sovereigns, nine half-crowns, and three pence—I put the bag in my left-hand pocket—I had it safe when I left my house, and I never put my hand in that pocket again—when I got on board the steam-boat I went into one of the cabins on the deck, and remained there during the whole time I was going to Gravesend—when I first went into the cabin I saw a gentleman and a lady there—the gentleman left, and the lady remained in the corner on my left-hand side—she was dressed in black—a gentleman came into the cabin just before the voyage was finished—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner come into the cabin once or twice; and what first attracted my notice was her conversation with the person who sat on my left-hand—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "It is a shocking thing, I hear he was found dead in his bed," and the female said, "Oh, no, he was not found dead in his bed, he died either in his mother's arms or his sister's"—the female in black then said to me, "Did you know Mr. Forrester, Ma'am?"—I said, "No"—she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184008170209"></xptr>
               <p>then said that he had died the week before, that he was one of the theatri<lb></lb>cals at Gravesend, and that he was the friend for whom she was in mourn<lb></lb>ing—after that the prisoner went and sat on the other side of that female, the further side from me—I should think she sat there a quarter of an hour—when I was giving my ticket to go out of the steam-boat, I put my hand down to my pocket and missed my bag—that was before I left the boat—the notes and money were all gone—they had been tied tightly up in the bag—I returned to London and gave information of the robbery—I saw the prisoner again on the 31st of July—she was then dressed in a dif<lb></lb>ferent manner, and from her not having on a black bonnet, which she had on board, I was not positive that she was the person who was on board, till she had on a black bonnet, which she had at the second examination—I am quite positive she is the person.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say you were positive that the prisoner was not the person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never said that—I have seen it Mr. Taylor, a hair-dresser—the pri<lb></lb>soner lodged at his house—the officer had some conversation with Mr. Taylor, but I do not recollect speaking to him—I never said to Mr. or Mrs. Tay<lb></lb>lor, or to any one, that the prisoner was not the person—I said to Mrs. Taylor that I believed, from the position in which the prisoner sat in the cabin with me, that she was not the person who took the property from me—the woman who was in black sat on my left hand, and the prisoner was in conversation with that woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After you had seen the prisoner, did you go to see if you could identify another party as being the person who took your money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—as a person recommended by Mrs. Taylor—that was Mrs. Hayward—I said in her present dress I could not swear to her—the person who sat by me on board the steamer had a thick black veil on, but I could see her features.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I live in Old-street. I remember Saturday, the 11th of July, because I went up to make a remark to the prisoner between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and I saw her at home—she was in and out that day—she came to warm half a pint of beer in the evening, about nine o'clock—I went up stairs between ten and eleven o'clock that day, because a lodger was about moving out of a room, and she objected to move out till twelve o'clock at night—I had let the room—I went to the prisoner's room, and made a remark to her.</p>

ESPINASSE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know it was between ten and eleven o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because our water comes on at that time—I went up to apprise the lodgers of the time I wished them to go, because the person who now occupies the room had brought a table—I know I went up be<lb></lb>tween ten and eleven o'clock, because it was the time the water came on—I do not look at a watch to know the time it comes on, but I go and fill my butts—the prisoner had lodged with me from May last—she was ra<lb></lb>ther back in her rent when she commenced the willow bonnet business, and I said, "You are playing with my money,"—she said when she had sold her bonnets she would pay me—when she was taken she owed me going on for a fortnight, but she had sold her bonnets, and settled with me—she sent her little girl down to my daughter with a week's rent—she did not pay me on the 11th, but on the Tuesday following—that was after she had sold her bonnets, she paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I know Mr. Shackell, the in<lb></lb>spector—I went to him about my rent after the prisoner was in custody, and he, knowing me so long, said if I had got any property I should keep it till I was paid—I had got some willow shapes—nothing was said about any 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes at any time—I only asked Mr. Shackell if I could detain any property, and that was some willow shapes—her clothes would not fetch 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say you were sorry that the officer did not apply to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did certainly, for he went to my neighbours, and asked if the woman could scale the wall, and said I had a thief—I went out, and said, "What can be the cause of this?"—from eleven o'clock in the morning, when he first came, the woman could have moved before seven in the evening, when he came again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say that you could have put him upon them, that they were a bad lot, and a set of swindlers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I said, "Why did you not take the daughter and a young man?"—I meant a daughter that the prisoner had there, and Mr. Selwood told me that her daughter was a pros<lb></lb>titute, and walked the Surrey theatre—I said I had heard by the officers that they were a bad lot and a set of swindlers—I might have said that to Shackell—the prisoner generally wore a light-coloured bonnet—I never saw her with any other—Mrs. Hayward lodged in my front-room, and left me on the 17th of July—she wore a widow's bonet—she is a widow, and has three daughters—two of her daughters were obliged to go out, and they wore any clothes—they had black bonnets.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time was the quarrel between your journeyman and you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no quarrel—Mrs. Jones and my journeyman were rather familiar, laughing and joking, and I might not like it—I never want any lodgers to interfere with my journeyman—I had no words with the journeyman that day—I did not scold him, I had nothing to scold him for.</p>

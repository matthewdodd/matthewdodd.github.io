                  </hi>. I live in Clare-street, Clare-market. The pri<lb></lb>soner lived in my service—on the 20th of October I caused her box to be searched, and found one apron only, and in her bed-rood, which was locked, we found two pairs of stockings of mine, and in a bundle, two towels—these are them—these shawls were found, in consequence of some duplicates in her box—I found these nine ale-glasses at Mr. Clime's, Liquorpond-street—I cannot swear to them.</p>

               <p>with the bar—not to serve—I found these stockings in her room, which was locked—before I could enter, she had to unlock the door—they were very dirty; there would be no harm in her taking them into her room till they were washed—the towels were in her bundle, in her possession—the bundle was composed of a gown and a handkerchief of her own—she might have taken these towels to fetch her gown in—the apron was in her box—she might have put it in the box without intending to deprive me of it—I never should have sent this case to the Magistrate, unless she had admitted the taking the glasses from me—I could not have sworn to them—I found the duplicates in her box—I certainly do take blame to my<lb></lb>self for giving her that liberty—I am an unmarried man, and do take blame—she was in the nature of a wife, in every thing else but money matters.</p>

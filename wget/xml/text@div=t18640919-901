I am a ticket inspector in the service of the South-Eastern Railway, stationed at Deptford—on Sunday evening, 28th August, about half-past 11, I was on duty at the station, on the Greenwich Railway—I was in uniform—while I was there the three prisoners came to the plat<lb></lb>form—Nagle asked me for the next train to London—I told him the last train had gone, but if he proceeded to the New-cross station, he might catch the last train there—he then produced a third-class return ticket and asked me if it would do for to-morrow—I said, "No, return tickets are not available on this line"—he then began to use most offensive language, and they all began to be very violent—they were then on the top of the landing—I called to the police-constable to remove them, and he came—one of the Flynns laid</p>

In consequence of information, on Saturday the 6th Jan., I went to Mr. Murray's house in Rutland-gate—I found the prisoner living there as butler—I told him I took him on suspicion of felony—he said he knew pretty well what it was about—I asked him to go down stairs into the pantry—I sent for Mr. Murray, who came, and cautioned the prisoner not to answer any questions, or say anything that might criminate himself—he then pointed out a large trunk, a carpet-bag, and a hat-case, as his property—I took them with him in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the station—on the way he said his wife often said she would do for him, but he never thought she would keep her word—in the trunk I found twelve knives, a carving-knife, a fork, and a steel, two pairs of socks, and twelve duplicates—in the carpet-bag I found shoes, and other things, the prisoner's own property, and four plate brushes—I went the same day to George-street, Foley-plase, where the prisoner's wife lodged—I found there a pair of plated candlesticks, a snuffer and tray—the wife gave me thirteen duplicates and eight wine glasses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Robert Keate, Albemarle-street. The prisoner was butler there about three months—he quitted his service on the 28th Dec.—I know a person named Bridget Mullins, by sight—she was h the habit of calling on the prisoner—she never came farther than the street door, except three times—the first time the prisoner had met with an accident, and he said, "If my laundress comes, ask her down, I want to see her"—another time she came to inquire for the prisoner, he was out, and my fellow-servant insisted on her coming down till he came in, which she did, and was shown into the housekeeper's room—I saw her come in and go up—on the last time, when she went away the prisoner went out with her—we did not know she was his wife—she always came in the character of his laundress—she did not give any name till New Year's-day, which was the third time that was when she came to tell me she was the prisoner's wife—he was gone then—these are Mr. Robert Keate's candlesticks—I had seen them occasion* ally in use—I believe these knives to be Mr. Keate's and such as were in me—here are some of the same pattern to compare them with—these socks and carpet-bag are Mr. Keate's—the prisoner's wife had no opportunity of taking anything while I was with her—I did not lose sight of her when she came in January—I think these plate-brushes were there when the prisoner came into the service—here is a shirt, and a table-cloth, with Mr. Keate's name on them—this china vase is Mr. Keate's, and was always kept in the pantry cupboard—when the prisoner's wife came she brought linen to him and took it away to be washed, and with the single exception of that time when she waited in the housekeeper's room, she was not out of the prisoner's company—he came in and they went out together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you seen his wife since he has been committed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at the office—she used to tell me tales about him—she had a child at the breast, which she called his child—Mr. Keate has eight servants—my duty generally takes me up stairs three or four hours every day, and then the butler attends to the door—there is an area gate—while the prisoner was there he and I were the only persons in the house, except for six weeks—during that time. I was in the country, and then another female and the pri<lb></lb>soner were in the house—he had charge of the place, and access to the cup<lb></lb>boards and plate chest—while I was in town I kept the key of the cupboard and the linen—when I left I gave them to Mr. Keate—these are common plated candlesticks—these knives were in parlour use—this shirt was kept in Mr. Keate's drawer.</p>

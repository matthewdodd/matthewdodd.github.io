               <p>of August, I saw the prisoners together, near, the House of Lords' door—I noticed Beard put a handkerchief into his breast-pocket, and somebody behind said, "There they are on it"—in consequence of that I followed them to Parliament-street—they spoke together and I saw Day try several persons' pockets—they stopped opposite Langham-street and there I saw Day stand behind the prosecutor, and he put his hand into his pocket, as the Queen's carriage passed—I seized him by the wrist, with the handkerchief in it—the prosecutor turned round and said, "That is my handkerchief"—Beard was behind him—their clothes touched each other—I was by the side, so that Beard did not conceal Day from me—he saw what Beard did—he looked at him at the time—I seized Day, and took the handkerchief from him, then turned round, and seized hold of Beard—he resisted, and the constables who were in uniform passed through the crowd and took him—I took the handkerchief from him, which I bad seen him put into his breast-pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Jacob Samuel Bowling, in High street, St. Pancras—he sells china and glass—the goods were on a table outside the house under a portico. On the 1st of June in the evening the prisoner and another came to me as I was outside, and the other person asked me the price of the ornaments—I told him—he then asked me the price of an ale glass—I went into the house to inquire, and while I went the prisoner went off with the ornaments—the other then said, "Never mind," but as soon as he was gone I missed the articles—I went and overtook them both in High-street—I ran up against the prisoner, and felt something hard in his pocket—he then turned up York-street, and asked me which was James-street—I told him it was in the Hampstead-road—he said "No, this is the way"—I went on a little way before him and then he began to run—I called the policeman, and he was taken in Grove-street—I have since seen the ornaments in a broken state and the glass salt, which is not broken.</p>

I was in Park-street on that evening, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—the prisoner passed me running—I followed him to Grove-street, and he was stopped at the corner of Warren-street—I said I took him on suspicion of stealing some things at Mr. Bowling's—he said he knew nothing about them—I took him to the station-house, then went to Grove-street, and took up these broken ornaments in the direction in which he had run—I did not see any other men running.</p>

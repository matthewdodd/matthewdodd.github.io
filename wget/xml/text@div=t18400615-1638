On Monday afternoon, the 25th of May, I went to meet my husband in Bishopsgate-street—I went home with him—it was then about five o'clock—I then went out and staid till eleven o'clock it night—I then came home and went up-stairs—the door was fastened, and I broke it open—my husband was in bed—he got up when I broke the door open—there was no light in the room—my husband was in liquor<lb></lb>he came and <hi rend="italic">banged</hi>the door against me very heavily, and I think he cut my head a little—he did not hit me more than once—I afterwards fell down-stairs, which made it much worse—I had some blows on my arm with falling down-stairs—when he cut my head, I just put my hand to it, and then I flew at him to hit him—I ran away and fell down-stairs—I bled a little from the cut, but not so much as from the fall—it was nothing hardly before—I do not know what he hit me with—it was quite dark—I really think it was with the door—it could not have been with the poker—the poker was bent twelve months ago.</p>

I went to bed before eleven o'clock—I afterwards heard a noise over-head, at the back-room door, as if some one was kicking against the door, and forcing it—I heard screams and the cries of "Murder" several times, which, according to the sound, came from the prisoner's wife, who was up stairs on the landing—I heard a fail from the top to the bottom of the stairs—I dressed myself and went to the door—I saw the prisoner's wife with her head towards the kitchen door, and her heels on the second stair from the bottom—the police<lb></lb>man came soon after—I did not see the prisoner before his wife fell down.</p>

                  </hi>I am a police inspector. The prisoner was brought to the station-house—I told him to be, cautious what he told me, as I should have to state it in evidence before the Magistrate—he said his wife came home drunk about eleven o'clock; that she kicked several times' against the door, and burst it open, and in so doing she fell down stairs; that he never struck her in his life, nor raised his hand against her—I found some blood on his right hand, and on his shirt also—it seemed fresh—I went to the prisoner's house, and found a quantity of blood at the foot of the stairs, a large quantity of blood on the top of the stairs, and on three or four stairs from the top, and some blood on the last stair—I went into the prisoners room, and saw his wife—her head had been dressed—I saw some blood about that—she was sober—it is impossible that a person standing by the prisoner's door, and fulling, could have cut their head by the fall, for it is three feet from the stairs to the prisoner's door, and the passage is two feet and a half wide—the clotted blood was within two feet of the door, so that it appeared to me that was just where his wife had been standing—if she had fallen from the door, about her middle would have come against the edge of the stairs,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150126"></xptr>
               <p>and the blood would have been on the centre of the stairs, or at the bot<lb></lb>tom—I measured the pool of blood on the landing, it was about twelve inches each way, and that at the bottom was about the same size.</p>

                  </hi>I am a surgeon.

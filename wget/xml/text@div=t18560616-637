                  </hi>. I am one of the partners of the firm of M'Arden and Co.—the prisoner was in our employ, and had charge of the petty cash—we gave him money, and he had to keep it in his cash box supplied to him for the purpose, and he was to pay out of it the petty disbursements of the office—he had a book, and it was his duty to enter in it the money he received, and the payments he made—on 15th May I had occasion to refer to the prisoner's petty cash book, which is here—I found he had not added up either the debtor or the creditor column on 31st Dec.—the ordinary practice of the office is that the petty cash is balanced every month—I added it up myself, and found there was a balance of 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which had not been brought forward to the following page—the 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was money that he ought to have had in his hand, which should have been carried forward to 1st Jan., and that is not done—I also found that he had not brought forward his balance from April to May—the balance was struck in April, and is 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that ought to have been carried to 1st May—that does not include the 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when the prisoner came in the office, I told him to add up his book, and he did—I showed him the Dec. account which I had added up—between the Dec. and April, balances had been struck regularly every month, without taking in consideration the 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him to add up his book, and we would strike a balance, and the total deficiency was the 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 208<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I asked him what had become of the money, if he could give any account of it—he said he could give no account of it at all, and it was a very serious thing for him—he sent for his mother—she came to the office, and he then stated (I held not the slightest threat or inducement to him) that he had taken out of the petty cash 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or a sovereign at a time, and that he might have taken to the extent of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my partner then spoke to him, and he said he might have taken 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or perhaps the whole amount.</p>

               <p>know who kept the book while he was away—the book was kept in the safe—Mr. Gordon kept the key of the safe—when I sent for the prisoner's mother he did not appear to me to be agitated—he did not say that other clerks might have paid—I asked him if he could accrue any clerks in the outer office, he said no, he could not—he said he might have omitted to make entries—he never mentioned Mr. Gordon's name—the other months have the balance struck—every month is balanced by the prisoner—there is no mark of Mr. Gordon's that he had looked at the book since Oct—there is then the mark W. A. G.—during that time I have never looked in the book, as we had that confidence in the prisoner and Mr. Gordon—there were three clerks in the same office with Mr. Gordon and the prisoner—I used to go in and out of that office—I saw the cash book on the desk—Mr. Gor<lb></lb>don could have access to it—the prisoner bad the key of the box—there was no other key.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber and painter, in Cleveland-street, Fitz<lb></lb>roy-square. On Saturday, the 24th of Jan., I lost some lead from the roof of the workshop and back parlour—on the following Wednesday, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's house, in Warren-street, St. Paneras, in the neighbourhood where I reside—I saw the prisoner—I asked him if he had bought any lead—he said he had—I asked if he could give it to me—he said he could not, as it was melted down and sold—he said he had bought it of George Henry Wallington, whom I took with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You received some communica<lb></lb>tion from Wallington? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he told me he had stolen it—I told him, if he would tell the truth with respect to it, I would deal mildly with him—I had lost a tremendous lot of things—the prisoner told me he had bought some lead of that boy, and it was melted and gone—he concealed nothing from me—he behaved with the greatest possible openness—I did not give him into custody—he walked with me to the police-office, he was admitted to bail, and surrendered—I have had a good many communications with Wallington since, and I think he has told a good many untruths.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Cowthard, we keep a general shop. On the afternoon of Wednesday, the 8th instant, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was sitting in my parlour adjoining the shop—I had my attention attracted to the ahop by the jingling of money, like silver—I went into the shop, and saw the prisoner with his hand in the till—he was leaning overihe counter, taking the money out of the till, and putting it into his pocket—he ran off with his hand in his pocket—he had money in his pocket—I had seen the till safe about two minutes before—there was then about twenty-five shillings in it—after he had gone away I found in it twelve shillings—I got my bonnet and ran after him—I am quite, con<lb></lb>tain the prisoner is the person—I saw him again the next day.</p>

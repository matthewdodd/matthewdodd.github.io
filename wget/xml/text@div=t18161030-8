There was no stage erected; they fought on the ground; there were a great many spectators on the ground. They fought an hour and twenty minutes; each had his seconds to see fair play. I saw the whole of the fight; it ended in Curtis's being quite exhausted. He lay on the ground; in the conclusion of the fight, he was thrown; in that throwing there was nothing that was unfair. Curtis would have continued fighting longer, had it not been for his seconds, who brought him away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner take any unfair advantage - A. No; I observed very much like forbearance towards the latter end of the fight on his part. When Curtis was very much beaten, about ten minutes before the conclusion of the fight the prisoner for bore very much. While Curtis was lying on the ropes, the prisoner several times could have struck him violent blows, but he held up his hands, and left him as he was; he held up his hands to the public, to see that he would not take any advantage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in Turner's conduct, which marked a cruelty of temper - A. By no means, very much the reverse; I was present when Curtis was taken off the field; he was carried to the Red Lion, at Hampton. I was with him until he died. I knew the man by sight very well; I was not present when the doctor was there. I found him in bed when I went over. I omitted telling one thing; that in the third round, before the battle finished, having a knowledge of Curtis; I went to him, and begged of him to leave off fighting. He told me there was nothing the matter with him, and he could win the fight then. The men that were seconding him, took him in their arms and carried him between the ropes, and set him on his legs; he then ran into the ring again and began fighting. His seconds had meant that he should not fight any longer; but he got under the ropes again, and would fight again, and then it ended in three rounds afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. GRIFFIN. I am a surgeon, of Hampton. I was called into the Red Lion, at Hampton, to see this young man, between seven and eight in the evening, of the 22nd of October. I did see him; he was in bed when I came; I examined his body; his head was very much swollen, so that you could scarcely distinguish a feature; there were several bruizes on his body; but none that I should conceive would be mortal. I attended him for about twenty minutes. Upon my first seeing him, I apprehended serious danger; he was perfectly in a state of insensibility; he had not the power of speech, nor the act of swallowing. I learn that he died about four hours after I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300012"></xptr>saw him; I was not present when he died. I recommended that he should have some leeches; but without much hope. I certainly thought he would die. I did not open his body; I was not surprised at his death; I conceived his death arose from the bruizes undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentleman of the jury, deeply impressed with the great peril to which I am exposed, under the present heavy charge against me, and with the great difficulty I necessarily experience in substantiating my innocence. Owing to the great danger to which the most computent witnesses of the transaction would be exposed, were they to be examined. I must request your most serious attention to such facts as I shall be enabled to lay before you, by which I trust not only my natural disposition will appear, but that, on this occasion of the present sad catastrophe imputed to me, I was goaded into a consent to fight the deceased,[ who was a prize fighter] and with the greatest reluctance I entered the ring, after having been assaulted and abused with the most unremitting virulence; and when I did so, as soon as I ascertained my superiority over my antagonist, I forbore on very many occasions to avail myself of such advantages as presented themselves, and with the greatest reluctance I continued the combat, until the unfortunate event which I must ever deplore and lament, and which has placed me in my awful situation; and I must beg to state that my pursuits in life are honest, and my aversion to prize fighting great, never having before fought a pitched battle, nor should I on this occasion, but from the great aggrivation, which it will be proved I received. I assure your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the jury, that I am wholly innocent of any intention to seriously injure the deceased, and that there never existed in my mind the smallest particle of malice towards him; I trust my character for humanity and forbearance on this accasion, will have its due weight.</p>

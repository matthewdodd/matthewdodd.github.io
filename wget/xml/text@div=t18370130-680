                  </hi>. On the 18th of January, I took my horse and cart to Messrs. Shaw and Paradise, in Tooley-street, Borough—I had no one with me—I got out of the cart, and went into the shop—it was a very quiet horse, and would have staid there till next morning, if it bad been let alone—it had come fourteen miles without being out of harness—I arrived there about half-past four o'clock—I had been going about to dif<lb></lb>ferent places until then—I remained in Shaw's shop about two minutes and a-half—the cart was then safe—I went in again, and while I was speaking to Mr. Shaw I turned my back, and in a minute and a-half the cart was gone—the mare was a brown one—the cart contained the property stated—I met Savory at the corner of King-street, Borough, about half or three quarters of a mile from the shop—I had been looking about for</p>

               <p>Three quarters of an hour then—while I was speaking to him, I saw the two prisoners driving the horse as fast as they could up King-street—they were both in the cart, and Ring, I think, was driving—I pointed the horse and cart out to Savory, and he stopped It—it was going at the rate of five or six miles an hour—the horse was tired—the direction on my cart was "Thomas Haslett, Keston, Kent—common stage cart"—that was written behind as well as before—they were coming up King-street, from Ber-mondsey-street, into the Borough—that is the way I should have gone to Keston if I had been in Bermondsey-street, but not the way I should have gone to Tooley-street—the way the prisoners went would be out of the way a good deal from Tooley-street—nothing had been taken from the cart when I recovered possession of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was standing at the corner of King-street, Borough, on the 18th of January, a little after five o'clock—the prosecutor gave me information, and I saw a cart coming down King-street from Bermondsey-street, and turn round towards St. George's church—both the prisoners were in it, and Ring was driving—it was rather dusk, but the lamps were lighted—I ran into the road, and stopped the horse, and asked the prisoners where they were going—Ring said, into Kent—the direction they were taking would lead them to Kent from where they were, but it was not the direct way—they should have got up to the Bricklayers' Arms, which would have saved half a mile—I took then into custody, and at the station-house both of them said a man at the Angel public-house, in Snow's Fields, asked them to drive it on for half a mile, and he would overtake them—the Angel is at the corner of King street.</p>

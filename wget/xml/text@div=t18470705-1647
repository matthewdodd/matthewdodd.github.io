                  </hi> I am a cow-keeper and carman, and live at No. 19, New-street, Brompton. Smith was my carman—I have lost a great quantity of corn lately—I have two horses, and I found them very poor and out of con<lb></lb>dition—they are five year old horses, and young horses will do better on a small quantity of corn than old ones will—I set a person to watch, and found that corn was taken from my premises to the Seven Stars—I put forty pieces of paper amongst the corn with my initials on them—on the 23rd of June the constable came to me—I have examined the oats that are here—they contain the papers I put in them—I am able to swear it is my corn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith. Q.</hi> Did you ever miss anything before, or know me to be drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never knew you drunk, but I think you are as <hi rend="italic">big</hi> a thief as ever was tried in this Court—I put out the corn into a basket for my horses—it was your duty to give it them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much did you put? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> More than half a bushel—it was one of the Dutch currant baskets full—I put it on the bin at half-past eight o'clock on the night before—Smith ought to have given part to the horses that night, and part the next morning—I never suffer any corn to go out at all—no corn has a right to away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith.</hi> When I came that morning, did you not tell me to go after the cart, and say, "<hi rend="italic">Jem, Jem</hi>, you will be behind?"—I said yes, I should; it was near five o'clock; I put the corn in the nose-bags because the fowls were scratching about the place; you have not always put the corn out for me: there was one horse your son used to feed every day; you ordered me to go after the horses, and take corn with me; I gave it the horses at the same time that I ate my breakfast, because I did not like to see them without their breakfast; I always looked after your horses.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 43) In consequence of information, I watched the prisoner Smith, about six o'clock in the morning of the 22nd of June, to the Half-Moon and Seven Stars, at Starch-green, which is about three miles from the prosecutor's—he drove his cart up to the front of the house, took a nose-bag off the cart, and shot a small quantity of corn into the trough in front for the horses—in the mean time Redknapp came up—they talked together, and then Smith carried the nose-bag of corn into the yard of the back premises of the public-house, and closed a pair of large blue doors after him—in about a quarter of an hour both the prisoners came out in front without the nose-bag—I remained till Smith drove away without it—I did not interfere at that time.</p>

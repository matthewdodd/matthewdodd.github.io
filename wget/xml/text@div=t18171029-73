On the 27th of September, between five and six o'clock in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290028"></xptr>the evening, the prisoners came to our house, asked if we did not let lodgings, and desired to look at them. I said, I did not like to shew them at night, but they might see them in the morning. Between twelve and one o'clock next day, Watts came, and I shewed them to him; he said they would do very well, and asked if they could come in that evening? We came down to my husband-the prisoner, Watts, said they were carpenters, and had got a job for four months, in the Curtain-road.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the lodging to be taken for the two - A. Yes, it was a joint taking. My husband said he was very particular who he let them to, and asked for a reference - He referred him to George-walk, Vauxhall. My husband said it was Saturday, and he could not go there that day. Watts said, he was going there on Sunday, and they could walk together. He said he would bring a chest of tools in, which would satisfy us for more than a week's rent-my husband agreed to take them in. They came between eleven and twelve o'clock that night, I let them in - They had each a bundle; I gave them a light - They were to pay 5s. a week-my husband was not at home; the windows were all shut. About eight o'clock the next morning, my child was coming from over the way, saw the windows were open, and the curtains blowing about-my husband went up.</p>
               <p>JOHN ALLFORD. I am the husband of the last witness. I saw the prisoner, Watts about the lodgings; he referred me to Vauxhall; we were to go there the next morning together - I agreed to let them. I came home about twelve o'clock, and fastened the door. The next morning I received information, went up stairs, and tapped at the door; no answer was made. I went in, found the window open, the prisoners gone, and the articles stated in the indictment - They never returned. I saw Martin at the watch-house at one o'clock that day. About three weeks after, Watts was taken.</p>

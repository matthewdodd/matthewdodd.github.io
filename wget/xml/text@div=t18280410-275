On the 27th of February, when I came to business in the morning I looked among my legs of pork in my shop, which is opposite my dwelling-house in <placeName id="t18280410-275-crimeloc1479">Rose-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the paper here that was on them? A. No, it had been tucked into the fat of the meat, and was so rumpled, that if we had attempted to dry it, it would have melted almost; but it was a sty hog, which carries the mark with it almost; the man is not here who killed it - they were sent to me to be sold - the paper was put into them by some of my people - I cannot say whose writing it was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could a person acquainted with pork be able to swear to a piece as belonging to a sty hog. A. Yes.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. On Tuesday, the 26th of February, after the market was over, I took in the legs of pork which were not sold - the next morning there was a report that a man was taken up for stealing two legs - I looked into our shop, and two of my master's were gone; this was about half-past seven o'clock; an officer afterwards came to my master's shop - I described the legs of pork to him, and about nine o'clock, I saw what I believe were Mr. Taylor's legs of pork, in his possession - I have not the least doubt of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was your master's name on them? A. No; there was a note on them, and two cuts, which I had made to hang them up by, at the sinew of the legs, and they had a black mark in the thick part of the leg. I have seen this man about the place.</p>

            . I am keeper of the watch-house. I was with Gibson and saw the prisoner stooping down in London-house-yard; I asked him where he got the pork; he said "If you go to the Cap and Salutation tap. they will give you particulars;" Gibson went there, returned, and said the publican said he had been there, but had left about ten o'clock; the prisoner then said if I would go to one Smith, who worked with Mr. Fisher in the market, he would give me another answer; I went there, and they were shut up; I then asked the prisoner where he lived; he said "Go to old Price;" I left them under his care; I went there and he said he had not - I went back and told the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you enquire the next mornign of Fisher? A. Yes; I went and found Smith, his foreman, he told me he never sold him any such thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell Smith you were an officer? A. Not till afterwards, but they pretty well knew it; I said "I am an officer, and if you sold them to Jones you had better come up to the Hall."</p>

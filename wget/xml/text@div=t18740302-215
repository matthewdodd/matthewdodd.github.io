                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Howard Street, Strand—a Chancery suit had been going on for some time between my brother and the executors of my father's will—I am the solicitor for my family; Mr. Hemsley for the executors—the prisoner was Mr. Hemsley's clerk—he conducted the business as regards the suit—there were some houses at Greenwich, making part of my father's estate, the rents of which were collected by the Rent Guarantee Society, of which Mr. Stone is the secretary—he gave me this letter, which he had received from the prisoner—it is in the prisoner's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "5th October. Dear Sir,—I am in receipt of the accounts. Please send cheque for the balance; if convenient, one for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, in favour of W.

Mr. Stone also gave me two cheques, which are produced—this is a cheque payable to W.

Vallance and Vallance—before I was admitted, Mr. Hemsley acted for the family in the administration suit—the accounts were brought in to the Court of Chancery from time to time, I believe—I conducted the suit after I had been admitted about four months, and I was admitted in Michaelmas Term, 1871—early in 1872 I acted for all the beneficiares, leaving Mr. Hemsley to act for the executors—there was some ill-feeling between myself and Nash, on account of his bad conduct—I did not take out one hundred and forty summonses in the Court of Chancery before the chief clerk—there were a great number of summonses where I appeared for the beneficiares, and he appeared for the executors, and he complained that we were putting the estate to unnecessary expense—he complained very frequently of that before the chief clerk—it is not a fact that as many as twenty-four sum<lb></lb>monses out of thirty failed and were dismissed; not one was dismissed as</p>

On 20th Nov., about quarter-past one o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Aldersgate-street with Mr. Jowett, who was very tipsy—I followed them till they came to a court near Gray's-inn-lane, and after remaining there some time the prisoner left him, and was running away—I went towards her, for the purpose of stopping her—she ran back to the prosecutor, and began pressing him to come along with her, catching hold of him—I told her to leave off, and she said, "What, have not I a right to speak to my husband?"—I told the prosecutor I suspected she had been robbing him, and asked him to see if he had lost anything, and before he could understand, the prisoner began catching hold of him, and put her hand towards his breast-pocket—I saw something in her hand, took hold of her, and asked the prosecutor again to see if his money was all right—he said it was all right; and I asked him if he had a watch about him—he felt again, and said he had lost his watch; and while he was examining his pocket, I saw the prisoner put her hand to her pocket—I seized it, called another constable, and took this watch(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of her pocket, which I showed to the prosecutor, who said it was his—at first she said she had no watch; and when it was found, she said the prosecutor had given it her to take care of—I took her to the station.</p>

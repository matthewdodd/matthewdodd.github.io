            . About half an hour past twelve o'clock, fourteen weeks ago to-morrow, the prisoner was pretending to read something at a door at the Plaisterers-Arms, at the end of Savile-row, and as I was going by, he asked me where some lady lived. I told him I was a stranger there, and that I knew no such person. He said, It should be near Cavendish-square. I was going that way, so he desired I would direct him the way. Going along, he said he had a townsman sent to him to help him to a place. I said I was out of place; if it did not suit him, it perhaps might me. When we came into <placeName id="t17690906-105-crimeloc555">Tyburn-road</placeName>

Here is a public-house, where I think I can get intelligence. I believe this is the house; but seemed not to be sure. We went in, and called for a pint of beer. He drank once, and went out, and then came in again. He said he had seen the man's wife. Presently came in two men; he asked them what they would drink; said they, We will have some grog. He went out of the room, and brought in some grog in a bason. Then the prisoner proposed hiding under a pint pot with another for six-pennyworth of punch. I said, If you are not going, I'll go and leave you. I pulled out my watch to see what o'clock it was. He asked me if I would sell her. I mentioned five guineas. They all looked at her, and said she is a very pretty watch. Then the prisoner said, She is a very pretty watch, I'll buy her of you; and if you will go along with me a little way, I'll pay you for her. He kept the watch in his hand. We went on till we came to the sign of the city of Hereford. He delivered it to one of the others, and they delivered it about to one another. They made a shift to get away from me with it, and I never got it again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you deliver it to the prisoner for?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. For him to look at it. He at first went by the name of Pinwyre. I took him some time after, at the foot of Westminster-bridge, and charged him with my watch. He denied ever seeing me before, and after that he said my watch was pawned.</p>
               <p>This not being a felony, he was <rs id="t17690906-105-verdict556" type="verdictDescription">

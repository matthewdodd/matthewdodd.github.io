On 12th April, about twelve o'clock, I was in Clifton-fields—I met Luscombe in Pomeroy-street—I remember the people turning out from the Victoria public-house, and among others the prisoner—we were then standing on the other side of the street—the prisoner crossed over, pointed to Luscombe, and said, "That is the b—that took me to the station; it would take forty b—policemen to take me there to-night; if ever you put a hand upon me again it will be worse for you," or "I will do for you"—Luscombe told him that he had nothing to say to him, and said, u Why don't you go away home?"—a man then came out of the public-house with some beer; he asked for a drink—he said, "Why don't you drink and go home?"—the prisoner said, u The police<lb></lb>man did more than his duty last night;" and he said that he would keep in the street all night if he liked—I then went on my beat, and left Lus<lb></lb>combe to go on his—a few minutes afterwards Crutcher called me—I went up the street, and found the prisoner in Luscombe's custody—Luscombe was staggering back, and said to me, "Look out for the knife"—I made a catch at the prisoner to catch hold of him very quickly, and I received a blow from him on the side of my head with something very hard; I believe it was not his fist—I did not see anything in his hand, but I think there must have been something beyond that which nature gave him—a stone in a handkerchief would produce such an effect as I felt; I was knocked down Benseless—two or three minutes after I came to myself I found that Lus-combe had taken the prisoner—I followed them to the station, and found Luscombe bleeding from the back—I saw the prisoner at the station, and found on him this stone (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was done up in this handkerchief in the way it is now; there was a knot tied above the stone to keep it there—the prisoner was charged with stabbing Luscombe—he said, "You have not found the knife"—that was all he said—he had been drinking, but was not drunk; he knew what he was about.</p>

I had seen her several evenings when I went patroling, in company with a man, and other evenings in company with the same man. She was going into different shops, waiting for an opportunity, as I suspected, to thieve something. I watched her: she went up to 126, I saw her go up; the man was walking by the side of her; she walked by the shop two or three times, looking into the shop. The man took her to the window, as I thought he was shewing her something in the shop lying on the counter. I went on the opposite side, watching them. The man he fell back to the left hand side of the door. She stepped forward and very fast, She threw herself across on the counter; I could see her bring something off the counter. I took it out of her hand the moment she came out of the the shop. She crossed to the opposite side of the way, where I was watching her. I took hold of her hand, and took the handkerchiefs out of her hand. I gave her to Mr. Newton, the constable.</p>

               <p>Mr. NEWTON. I am a constable. The patrole delivered the prisoner and the handkerchiefs into my hands. These are the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>BRIANT WARD. These are my handkerchiefs. I saw them in my house about fifteen minutes before they were produced to me as stolen by the prisoner. They cost me four pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The man was going by; he desired me to pick up these things, they were outside of the the door. I did so.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of November I was in Edgware-road, and saw the prisoner with a basket in his hand, about five o'clock in the evening. I stopped till he passed us, and asked what he had, he said glass, that he brought from Mr. Smith's to do some work at Chapel-street, Paddington, that he brought it at night to save the trouble of going for it in the morning. We were near Chapel-street; he said he could not tell the house he was to go to, and afterwards said Mr. Peters's foreman of Park-street, gave it him, saying it was glass out of old coach sashes. He had twenty-seven pieces of glass.</p>
               <p>JOHN WITH. I am foreman at Messrs. Smith and Maberly's, builders. They were employed at Mr. Peters's manufactory. In November last the prisoner was working there. I saw the glass at the office; I cannot swear to it positively. I ordered two men to cut glass out of old<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040040"></xptr>sashes, and place it in a room in the house, of which the prisoner kept the key. I missed some, and this is of the same description. I never gave him leave to take any. He bore a good character.</p>

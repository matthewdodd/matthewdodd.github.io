                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker and jeweller, and live in Broad-street, Ratcliffe. On Friday, the 3rd of November, about twelve o'clock in the day, I was in Schoolhouse-lane—I had fetched a clock from a customer, and had it with me—the prisoner Kain came up to me—I turned round, and saw Nugent with him—they were together—Kain said to me, "Don't you know me?"—I said, "No"—he said, "You must recollect me from what took place last night"—I said, "No, what was it about?"—he said, "You must recollect"—he said that I had indecently used him—he said, "You took hold of my person"—he did not mention what part of his person—I told him he was mistaken, and to go about his business—he said he was not mistaken, I was the man—and he said, "Give me some money, or I will expose you"—Nugent was close to him during this—I walked on—he said that the one who was with him was his witness—Nugent must have heard that—I walked on toward my house, which was about two hundred yards, or more than that—they continued to follow me, but I did not look round—they followed me to the bottom of the lane, and then Kain said, "Come, come, stop"—I stopped, and asked him what he wanted—he said, "You have used me in a s----way" and asked again for money—I told him to come on to my house, and explain—he said, "No—I am as b----<hi rend="italic">wide awake</hi> as you"—I walked on till I got to my house—they continued to follow me—I went in doors—I called my wife into the shop—they must have heard me call her—she was close to the shop in the passage—the front door of the shop opens into the street—the prisoners did not go into the shop, they stopped at the door, but I opened the glass door, and told them to come in, and they both came in to the outer door—I then asked them what they wanted with me—Kain said he wanted money—he said, "Give me some money, and we will say nothing about it—if you do not, we will expose you and punish you"—my wife asked them what they wanted the money for—I repeated to her, that they had accused me of an indecent assault, and wanted money for it—I refused to give them any money—they frequently said they would not go away without they had some money—Kain said that Nugent was his witness—he said that loud enough for Nugent to hear—my wife appeared</p>

               <p>to be very much flurried, and said in their hearing, that she wished me to give them money to get rid of them—I refused at first to do so, but seeing her state of mind, and being much agitated myself, I said, "Give them some," and she gave them 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I directed her to do so, in consequence of the threat that had been used—after she gave them the money, she said, had they not better give a receipt, or they would come again, addressing herself to them—Kain said, "Yes, we will give a receipt"—I think my wife gave the money to Nugent, but they both stood close together—I was very much intimidated by the accusation, before I directed her to give them the money—I wrote the receipt—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—my wife put a slip of paper into my hand—I said, "What am I to write? "—Kain said, "Clear of all charges"—I asked him his name—he said George Jackson—I then wrote the receipt and gave it to Kain—he handed it to Nugent, who looked at it, and signed it on the left-hand corner—he then returned it to Kain, and said, "Make a mark," and Kain made a mark—I wrote this "George Jackson"—that was the name he gave me—this is the paper—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "Nov. 2, 1837, "<hi rend="italic">George Jackson received</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and begs pardon for this unfounded charge. George Jackson, ✗ his mark, and Nugent"</hi>—after this, my wife said, "You will not come again?"—Kain said, "This is clear of all charges "—just at this time my servant, Elizabeth Lowitt, came in—next morning before twelve o'clock, I went to the Thames police-office, and got a warrant—about six o'clock in the evening I had a policeman at my house—I saw the two prisoners at the shop window—I went round directly and opened the door—Kain said, "A'ynt you going to give us something?"—I asked them both to come in, and they did so, after some hesitation—I then closed the door, and Ellis the constable, directly took them into custody—he tied each of their arms together, and Kain said to me, "This is as close as we were under the bridge"—I never had any communication with the prisoners in my life, until they attacked me the day before in the street—I never gave either of them a watch—I have three children, the youngest is six months old to-morrow—I have lived in my present house since 1823, and within a few doors of there since 1818.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, was it not because your wife was fluried that you gave them the money, and not from any real fear that a charge would be made against you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was from fear in my own mind as well—we were both very much flurried, and I was flurried in the street—I objected to give them money in the first instance, knowing they were trying to rob me—I certainly continued to object for some time, but I was nearly as anxious as. my wife to get rid of them, my flurry was so great—I refused to give it them at first, as I thought they would perhaps go away when they found me obstinate—Kain appeared the principal person—he spoke the whole time—all that I heard Nugent say was, "Make a mark," and he wrote his name first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the Thames police. In consequence of Mr. Harrison having come and made a complaint at the office, on Satur<lb></lb>day, the 4th of November, I received a warrant to apprehend the prison<lb></lb>ers, and went to the prosecutor's house with it, about four o'clock—I remained there till six o'clock, at which time the prisoners came—I asked what they wanted with that gentleman, pointing to Mr. Harrison, who was behind his counter—Kain said, "He knows very well what we want; we have come for some money"—I immediately took them into custody, and fastened them together—on my doing so Kain turned round to Mr. Har<lb></lb>rison, and said, "This is as close as we were when we were under the bridge"—I conveyed them to the station-house, and on the way there Kain said, "Oh, Harrison is a guilty man, or else what made him give us the money and watch"—I asked Kain how much money—he said, "8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and we have given a receipt for it"—this was said in Nugent's hearing—they were fastened together at the time—I asked Kain how long ago it was since he first saw Mr. Harrison—he said, "About three weeks ago, in the Ben Jonson's Fields"—he said that Mr. Harrison came up to him, and said he wanted * * *—he then said, "I went under the bridge with him"—he did not say when—he said it was three weeks ago when he first saw him—he said he went under the bridge, and there Harrison * * *—I said, "Did Harrison give you any thing?"—he said no, bat Mr. Harrison was going to charge him with a robbery, and he turned round and ran away—he said, "I have never seen him till last Friday, and here is my witness"—I asked Nugent what he saw of the case-he said he followed them over the fields, and saw them go under the arch of the bridge to<lb></lb>gether * * *—they neither of them said what day or week this was—I did not ask them to fix the day.</p>
               <p>

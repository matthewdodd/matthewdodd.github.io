                  </hi>. I am a plumber, painter, and glazier, and live at Millwall, Poplar. On the 15th of September two persons came to me about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and I went to the station—I there saw some lead—the prisoner had been in my service for a week previous to that, as a plumber—he was laying the gutters of houses—the lead was such as would be used for that purpose—it resembled a piece which had been cut off that day—it was mine—I had seen it safe between one and two o'clock—I went to the roof of a house the next morning at six o'clock, where the lead was that resembled mine—I compared the lead, and it fitted the place—I had other lead like it on my premises—two pieces were missing, and some more remaining.</p>

I saw the prisoner go into a tinman's and brazier's shop, at the corner of New—street, Limehouse—I heard a man in the shop say, We don't buy such stuff as this"—I went in and found the prisoner with this lead in his hands—I asked him where he got it from—he said it was his own I asked him where he worked—he said for Mr. Tossy, on Mill-wall—he afterwards said he had been fitting up a beer-engine on Mill-wall—I went with Mr. Tossy on the roof of the house, and saw him compare this small piece with lead that was on the roof—it fitted the corner of a gutter which was cut off.</p>

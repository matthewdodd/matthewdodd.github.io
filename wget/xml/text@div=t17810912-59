               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Eaton. On Saturday, the 21st of July, between seven and eight in the evening, the prisoner came into our shop. I was serving a lady with some boy's brown thread stockings. The prisoner said he was in no hurry, and wanted to see a pair of silk stockings which were in the window, which he shewed me. I took them out, and told him they were fine silk. He said, he thought they were silk and worsted. I then told him we had some spun silk that would look well, and come cheaper. I turned my back, to get the bundle down. As I was coming down, I saw the prisoner shuffle with his hand in his pocket. I went to reach down some more; and, turning round, I saw him shuffle with his hand again. I came round, and missed the stockings off the counter. I looked very stedfast at the prisoner, and then at the stockings. He ran out of the shop. I jumped over the counter, and ran after him. He was pushed down by a man coming along: I then came up to him, and took three pair of stockings out of his pocket (producing them); they have my master's mark on them.</p>

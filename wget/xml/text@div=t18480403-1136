                  </hi> I live in Bloomfield-terrace, Pimlico, and am a car<lb></lb>penter. On 10th March, about half-past eight o'clock, I was taking a walk round Green's-field—I have a gate there, that encloses my timber-yard—I saw a horse and cart there—Sabine was about five paces from the horse—I looked into the cart, and found it partly loaded with iron=Sabine said he was loading it with iron by order of my foreman, and one of my men was helping him—I said, "Where is he?"—he said, "Come, and I will show you"—he took me to a closet, and there I saw Hurley—I said, "What are you doing with the iron?"—Hurley said, "I have nothing to do with it; I only come here to go to the closet"—I told them to wait till I sent for my foreman—I went out of the yard, and heard them unloading the cart—Sabine followed me, and I asked him to wait—he would not, and I gave him in charge, while I sent for my foreman, who was in another yard, 300 or 400 yards off—I went up the yard, and found an iron column about 200lbs. weight, and several more pieces of iron—I saw two more columns which had not been in the cart.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 200.) I was on duty about eight o'clock that morning, in Commercial-road, Pimlico—Mr. Newson gave Sabine in custody—he said he found him in his yard, with a horse and cart, loading iron—Sabine said he had no iron in his cart—I went into the yard, and saw five bars of iron knocked about—I saw no iron in the cart—Mr. Newson gave Hurley into custody for being in his yard, and a party concerned—Hurley said that Sabine had iron in his cart, and he went into the yard and pointed it out to me—on the road he told Sabine not to say anything against him to hurt him and to get him out of his employ.</p>

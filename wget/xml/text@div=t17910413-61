               <p>Are you sure that you had this guinea and silver when you first went along with this man? - I am.</p>

               <p>Of course then your having been found in such a place, it is necessary you should give such reasons as you have mentioned, to satisfy your husband; you say there was an attempt to commit a rape? - There was.</p>

               <p>Then you cannot tell whether this agitation was from the hurry she was in or from liquor? - No.</p>

               <p>I met with this woman at Billingsgate: we had a quartern of gin, and three or four pints of beer with half-a-quartern of gin in each: after we had parted the mackarel, we took a coach in Cheapside to Drury-lane, and I paid the coachman eighteen-pence; then we went into a house together, and were there for two or three hours; and when she came down stairs, she said she had lost her money, and that she would follow me, which she did, to Bow-street, where the clerk desired me to go about my business, and not take any notice of the drunken woman: on this I went into the house, and she followed me, and said that I had robbed her; and so I was stopped till I went before the justice: there was a girl of the town with her, that desired her to swear a rape against me; she mentioned it so in my presence: that is the whole truth.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

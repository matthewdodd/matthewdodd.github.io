                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at 48, Milk wood Road, Brixton—on Monday morning, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I laid down to rest on a couch, in the shop parlour—my wife (the prisoner) was upstairs in the bedroom—I was awoke between 3 and 4 o'clock by a blow on the head, and found myself covered with blood and my wife standing beside me—I did not see anything in her hand—I sent for a doctor, who came and attended to me—my wife remained in the parlour—she did not appear to be conscious of what she had done—she had been drinking freely for the last three weeks—seven or eight days before this she had given me a slight hit on the head with a ginger-beer bottle—after she had done this she said, "What is the matter, Tom? what have they been doing to you?"—she was very strange for some time past—we lost a child a few years ago, which I think preyed on her mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The child died in 1871—that has preyed on her mind on different occasions, or else a better wife could not be; she has never shown the least ill-feeling towards me—this arose from excitement through drinking spirits—she would never have done it if she had been in her right senses—she is very penitent, and says she will never touch a drop of spirits again—I earnestly appeal on her behalf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bargeman. On the 14th of August I had some boats lying along Mr. Ashley's wharf, at Isleworth—on Monday night, the 14th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner came on board as I was in my bed place—he took my hat off the steerage, and walked off with it—I said, "Don't take that away, it belongs to me"—he took a hat off his head, and said, "Take this hat, if this belongs to you"—I said, "No, I only want what is my own"—he then pulled off in a boat with both hats.</p>

No—Beech came on board and said that somebody had got his hat—I have seen the prisoner several times saun<lb></lb>tering about the barges, but not working—he came on board next morning, and abused me—he did not say that somebody else had got his hat, and he had got Beech's—I said nothing to him about Beech's hat—I did not give him into custody—he did not say that he had a hat of Beech's.</p>

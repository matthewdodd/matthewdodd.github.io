                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Bowerman, the prisoner's brother, and live in Belvidere-road, Lambeth. The prisoner came to reside with us three or four months before the 1st of July—I had no reason to sus<lb></lb>pect that she was in the family way—on the morning of the 1st of July, about half-past eight o'clock I went out for some salts for the prisoner, as she told me she was not very well—I did not recommend her to take medicine—she told me her sister had given it to her when she was ill—I was gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at the outside—I had a key and let myself in—I found the prisoner standing at the foot of the stairs—I observed a great deal of blood in the passage and on the stairs-—I told her 1 thought she had been delivered of a child—she positively denied it and said she had not, that</p>

               <p>it was the regular course of nature—I have a child myself—I advised her to go to bed, but she would not—I went and fetched my husband—I was absent I should say nearly an hour—shortly after my return a policeman came to the house—I saw nothing of any child—I do not know whether she had prepared any linen—there was plenty of mine about.</p>

                  </hi>. I worked for Mr. Patrick at the time in ques<lb></lb>tion and live in the Waterloo-road. On the morning of the 1st of July, when I was going to work down to my master's yard, I saw something lying just outside the gate of Mr. Patrick's yard—there are two gates, and this was the inner one—it is a wide road—there are two yards within one large gate—the wall of Mr. Bowerman's house runs down by the side of the gate—I did not know what it was, but on going near to it I thought it was a child—I communicated what I had seen to a person named Glaire—I went quite close to it—I thought it was a child—it was naked—it was lying about two yards from the wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of Mr. Patrick's labourers. On the 1st of July I received a communication from Moody, in consequence of which I went into the roadway leading to my master's premises, and saw a new born female child—I picked it up and put it in my apron—the navel string was exposed, and through that I observed its not being many moments born—on the way to the doctor's I looked at it, and it was foaming at the mouth—I observed a lump on the side of its head, and the shoulder very much dis<lb></lb>figured—I took it to Dr. Carruthers's shop, by the York-road, Lambeth—a policeman was sent for—the child was alive.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the surgeon of Lambeth workhouse. On the 1st of July a messenger from the workhouse came to fetch me—I went, and saw the child—it was in the possession of a nurse—the head appeared very much contused, the bones of the skull appeared fractured, and the back of the child was bruised very much—it lived about two hours after I saw it—an after-birth was also produced to me, I think by Hart—in my judgment, the bruise on the head caused the death—the other bruises were not of a very serious nature.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know the age of the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe she is about nineteen—the head is the first part that makes its appearance in the world, in a confinement—I should think the bruises were not such as would arise from the child striking its head against the stairs, if suspended from the mother—striking the head against the stairs, or any hard substance, would produce the appearances I saw—the loss of blood, if the mother deli<lb></lb>vered herself, would very much affect her mind—it might affect the brain, so as to produce almost frenzy—I should say a mother so young as seventeen or eighteen would have great difficulty in delivering herself—it is very doubtful how long it would take for a girl of her age to deliver herself, it depends on the obstacles met with—supposing the pains of labour had not come on, I should think it would be impossible for a person to be delivered under some hours—I cannot say—I examined the person of the prisoner when she came into the hospital, about two hours after I had seen the child—there were symptoms of her having been delivered.</p>

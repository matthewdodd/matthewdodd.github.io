                  </hi>. I am a painter and glazier, and live in Great Titch<lb></lb>field-street. On the 1st of June I was working at the Assembly-room, Kentish-town—I went into the kitchen there about half-past six o'clock in the evening, and the prisoner was there taking a pint of porter—he asked me to take a sup, which I did—I called for a pint myself, and when it was brought I asked him to take a sup of mine, which he did—I have not been drinking now—I am very nervous, and have had a fall since the rob<lb></lb>bery, which hurt me very much, but I am not at all intoxicated—I took out my purse to pay for my porter and his too—I had 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—the prisoner saw I had money—he said he was going to his barracks, and we walked from the assembly-room house together—we then went to the Nag's Head, and had two pints of porter, which I paid for—we then came on to Kentish-town-bridge together, and when we got there the prisoner pinched hold of my throat with one hand, and put the other into my pocket, and took out all my money but a halfpenny—he ran away immediately, and was not taken till the 4th—I went to Portman barracks then, and saw him in the guard-room with four or five more—I went straight up to him, and said he was the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I have seen the prosecutor in the course of the day—he has been drinking—I consider him the worse the drink—I went over to the public-house opposite this morning, and told for landlord not to let him have any more, as I saw he was getting in that way—he speaks differently to what he usually does—I consider him tipsy.</p>

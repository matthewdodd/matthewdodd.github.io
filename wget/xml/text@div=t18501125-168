                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Rose, in Tower-street, Waterloo-road, Lambeth. On 7th Nov. I met the prisoner going out at my back-door as I was coming in—I said there was no one there—he said he wanted to go backwards, and I suffered him to go—I had observed that my skittle-ball was safe when I came out of the yard—I had laid it down myself, and about eleven that night I missed it—I went after the prisoner and found him next door to a coffee-shop in the Waterloo-road—he said he knew nothing about it—I gave him in charge, and from some informa<lb></lb>tion I went the next day, between one and two, to Mr. Butcher's, at the Great Britain—I went into his skittle-ground and saw two skittle-balls—one of them I was confident was mine—this is it(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is a mark on one side and one on the other—I told Mr. Butcher it was mine, and he told me where he bought it—I went to Mr. Lockett's, at the Crown and Anchor, and asked him how he became possessed of it, and he told me.</p>

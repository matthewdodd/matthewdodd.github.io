            ; on Saturday the 30th of January, I lost the articles mentioned in the indictment; I was busy, and the washer-woman brought home my things, and put them behind me, upon a potatobin; I saw the bundle after the washer-woman was gone; the prisoner was waiting for some coals, and wanted to pay for them before they were delivered; the insisted upon paying for them directly, and I went round the counter to take the money; she would not give me money enough for the coals, and then she went away; after she was gone, I went round the counter, and missed the bundle; the things have never been found.</p>
               <p>HANNAH WILLES called. - Q. How old are you? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-36-person502">A. </persName>
            Eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever at school? - A. Yes, my Lord, I have been taught at school.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been told, if you tell a lie, or a story, how you will be punished - were you ever taught your catechism? - A. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How are naughty girls punished that tell lies, or tell stories - have you never been taught that? - A. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you been told that you will be whipped if you tell stories? - A. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been told in what way you will be punished if you tell lies? - A. Yes, my Lord, I shall go to a wicked place, (sworn;) I saw the prisoner come in on the Saturday night, between nine and ten o'clock, she was standing behind the counter; I saw her take the bundle from the potato-bin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to stop her? - A. No, I did not know but it was her own bundle; when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170042"></xptr>my mother asked me, I told her I saw a woman take a bundle up, and go out with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner before? - A. Yes; she came once before, when my mother was up stairs.</p>
               <p>The WASHER WOMAN sworn. - On Saturday, the 30th of January, I carried home these things to Mrs. Willes, about half-past nine o'clock, they were wrapped up in a coarse cloth, I put them down near where Mrs. Willes stood.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HATCH sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Queen-square; I took charge of the prisoner at the watch-house; she was brought there by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Willes. When I came home, my wife informed me what had happened; she shewed me the prisoner, nearly opposite my house, and I took her the same evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to order half a sack of coals, and desired them to be sent only across the way, where I was at work, and finding they did not come, I went over again, and then Mr. Willes laid hold of me, and challenged me with taking the bundle.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character. <rs id="t18020217-36-verdict191" type="verdictDescription">

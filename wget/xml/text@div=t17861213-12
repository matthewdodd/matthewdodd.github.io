             brought me this watch about the 22d of September, to raise what money I could to pay his rent; I shewed it to several people to sell it; I put it into a little drawer in my bar; and one night while I was in my cellar, between eleven and twelve, the prisoner conveyed the watch out of the drawer; I missed it about the 21st or 22d of September; however, it was within three days of the time he brought it to me; I could not tell who to lay it to; I saw it the day before, and shewed it to some people; this passed on for about six weeks; this prisoner was amongst the coaches, and about our house, and picked up what he could, and he went on errands; about five weeks after I lost the watch, the prisoner was brought to my parlour by some people, and he confessed he had robbed a man of some money, and there I heard him confess he had taken the watch, and pawned it in Whitechapel; the next morning he went to the pawnbroker's, and they produced the watch.</p>
               <p>Donaldson. I can swear to the watch any where; I know it by the string which I put on, and the key, and every thing; he said when I was gone down in the cellar, he put over his hand into the bar and pulled it out; I made him no promises; I heard none made about the watch, and what promise was made in the parlour about the money, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Is any of these people here? - No, I did not know they were required; the Magistrate said me and Donaldson were enough.</p>
               <p>Who was the Magistrate? - Mr. Girdler.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They promised me if I would tell them where the watch was, that I should be done nothing to; one was Mr. Brown a coachman; I have not a friend in the world, but God and you.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. What may the value of the watch be? - Two guineas.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you ever offered two guineas for it? - Yes.</p>

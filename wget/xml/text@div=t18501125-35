                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-proprietor; I have stables in Worship-street, and in Wheeler-street. The prisoner was my horse-keeper for about six months—he had to look after a mare pony in Wheeler-street—I missed him on 1st Nov.; the last time I saw him was about one o'clock that day, he was taking a sack of oats to feed the horses, from Worship-street to Wheeler-street—I saw him next morning in custody at the station in Spital-square—he ought to have come to Worship-street on Friday, and he did not—I went to Wheeler-street about three in the afternoon, and he was gone, and the mare also—we did not work it—I had seen it in the stable that morning—I saw it again on the Saturday afternoon in the possession of a person named Johns, in Drury-lane—it was worth from 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I have the management of some advertising vans which go about the street—I saw the pony on 1st Nov., in the stable in Wheeler-street, from eight to nine o'clock—I went to the stable again between six and seven in the evening, and it was gone—I saw the prisoner about nine, outside the stable-gate; I asked him if he had brought the pony home; he told me no, that it had thrown him off its back in the Mile-end-road, and had run away, he did not know where—I told him to wait while I fed the horses, and I would go with him and look for it in the Green-yard—I went in, and fed the horses, leaving him at the gate; when I came back, in about five minutes, he was gone.</p>

Signed "George Shepherd, Thomas Johns")—he said if he did not fetch it on the Saturday, it was my property—he left the pony with me—I put it to a friend of mine, Mr. Ashford, a wheelwright, 57 1/2, Drury-lane—the next day Mr. Cotton came with the police-sergeant, and claimed the pony.</p>

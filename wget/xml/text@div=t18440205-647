                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Hancock; I am servant at the King William the Fourth, King William-street The prisoner and her husband were living there—he was assisting my mistress in moving from King William-street to Vauxhall-road—on the 27th of Dec. while he was at the house I missed the articles stated—I missed the print after I had taken the box away, when I was in lodgings at Bedfordbury, but the other articles be<lb></lb>fore—the print was safe on the Thursday, and I missed it on the Tuesday—I had left my box behind me at the King William the Fourth, and left the prisoner there—this is the printed cotton—it was all in one, and it is in pieces now—I am quite sure it is mine—I have not seen any of the other things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at the King William the Fourth. On the 26th of Dec, I saw the prisoner in the kitchen—she brought a piece of print like this down under her arm, and put it under the dresser—my mistress came down directly after—she took it away, and put it into a meat-screen—when my mis<lb></lb>tress went up stairs the prisoner pulled it out again, and said that she had a piece of print that Mrs. Beeston wanted, and she did not see why she should have it, would I have it—I said I did not particularly want it—she wanted 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I said, "It will only make two aprons; I have got 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; will you take that?" which she did—I succeeded the prosecutrix as servant—she left her box there—when I got to the house I had the room she used to have—I saw the prisoner, on Christmas-day, on her knees at the box, pulling the things up, with some letters in her hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you not been discharged by the landlord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was my own wish to go; he wished me to stop—I did not give him warning—I only stopped to oblige him till he got a servant—I was never stop<lb></lb>ping there as servant—I never had a word of complaint on his part—I had a word with the bar-man—I never saw the print before—I was not intimate with the prisoner—we have been for days together backwards and forwards—she had pretty well all her meals in the kitchen, and took her tea with me that evening—the first time I spoke to any one about the print was about a week after I bought it—I was at work at it—a friend came in, named Brown; he knew the print, and asked where I got it—I did not tell him at first that I bought it of the prisoner—he did not tell me I was to sit down and consider.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

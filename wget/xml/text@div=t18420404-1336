                  </hi>. I am clerk to Benjamin Worthy Horne and Wm. Chaplin, carriers, and live in Hart well-street, Hampstead-road. I attend to their business at the railway-station, Camden-town—the prisoner was a carrier in their employ for about a month—it was his duty to go out with the cart and deliver goods, and receive the money for them—he took a book with him, in which entries are made of the goods he took out, and the amount he receives on those goods—he enters nothing himself—a clerk is employed for the purpose—the clerk does not go with the cart—he delivers the book to the prisoner—he carries the book with him with the entries ready made, and the person he delivers the things to signs that they have received it—the entries of the goods are made by the clerk—on Monday afternoon, the 28th of March, he went out with goods to deliver, and the book—I do not know what he had to deliver, except from the book which I have here—he had to go to Brixton-road—he ought to have had a ticket delivered to him—there was a carman with him named Crook—it was not the prisoner's duty to pay money unless for tolls or any thing like that—when he received money for the things he delivered, it was his duty to pay it to me when he came back—he came back that even<lb></lb>ing about eleven o'clock and delivered me this book—I find on the 28th of March, that there was an entry of 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. l1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but it has been erased—</p>

               <p>here is the remains of it—it was for the carriage of a crate of crockery from Stafford—that entry was made by Shelly the clerk, whose business it is to make the entries—I know his handwriting—the prisoner ought in have received the money, and accounted for it to me—when he came back the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was erased—I asked him if he had received the money on this crate—he said, "No"—I said I was certain he had—there was al<lb></lb>ways a charge on these goods, and if he did not pay me, I should give him in charge to a policeman—he denied it—17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the right charge we made no charge of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that has been added by some person—we received a good character with the prisoner from Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of James Scott, who keeps a china and earthenware shop in Corner-place, Brixton-road. On Monday afternoon, the 28th of March, the prisoner brought a crate of earthenware to our shop—he gave me this ticket, on which 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is marked, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. cartage—I gave him a sovereign, a fourpenny-piece, and a penny—he gave me this book to sign my name to it, and I did so—my name is here now, but not the sun—the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. lid. was where I signed my name—he went away, returned in about twenty minutes, and said I had not paid him—I told him I had, and the way in which I had paid him—he asked me to return the ticket to him—I said I would not return it, as it was a proof of the payment—my father came in—the prisoner said at first he thought he had lost the money, but he recollected I had not paid him afterwards—he said he had a hole in his pocket—he pulled it out and showed it to my father—it was in his left-hand pocket, but he said he did not put it in there—he came back after<lb></lb>wards, and staid an hour and a half—he said we wished to defraud him of the money, and said a great deal, and made a great noise—I am quite sure I paid him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employ, and live in How ard's Green, City-road. On Monday, the 28th of March, I went out with the prisoner as carman—I went to Mr. Harvey's, No. 4, Webber-street, Blackfriars-road, and the prisoner went down the London-road—in the meanwhile I delivered a trunk at Mr. Harvey's, and received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—Mr. Harvey signed the book, and I gave the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the prisoner when he returned to me—he was the person to receive the money—I afterwards went with him to Mr. Scott's, in Brixton-road—the prisoner took in a ticket with him—he came back to the cart and took his book in with him—on his getting into the cart I heard something rattle-what it was I cannot say—he stooped, picked something up, and said to me at the time that it was three halfpence—he got into the cart, and went through the turnpike, just by Kennington Cross—when we got there, he said all of a sudden, "I have lost my money"—I said, "You can't say that"—he said, "I have"—he searched the bottom of the cart, felt his pockets, turned his left-hand trowsers pocket out, and there was a hole in it—he left me, saying he was going back to Mr. Scott's—he was gone about three quarters of an hour—I waited against Horsemonger-lane at a public-house—before we got there he said he would return again to Mr. Scott's—I said, if he did, I had a long round to go, I must go on without him—we went into a public-house and had some beer, and staid there five minutes—while we were drinking the beer he said,"Do you think it would be the best way to scratch it out?"—I said, I was sure it would not, and if he talked about that I should start without him—I went, and</p>

On the 4th of December the prisoner came in the shop in company with another woman, I served her; she asked to look at some mazacine sarcenet; I shewed two pieces of sarcenet, she bought an eighth of a yard, it came to eight-pence, she paid me for it; there was no person in the shop but me and the woman and a carpenter that worked at the bottom of the shop, he was at work, he had no concern with the business of the shop; there was no one serving in the shop but myself that night. After she had bought the eighth of a yard the two pieces of sarcenet were left on the counter, the prisoner and her companion both asked me to let them look at some white sarcenet; I had to fetch the sarcenet four yards from them, and had to turn my back on her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they converse together all the while they were in the shop - A. Yes. I got the white sarcenet for the other lady, she took a quarter of a yard and paid me for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other customer in the shop while these two women were there - A. No, there was not. After she had paid for the white sarcenet the prisoner passed the other woman and they went out together, only the prisoner went out first. I did not perceive that any thing was taken by the prisoner or that any thing was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this - A. A quarter before five, after the candles were lit. In about ten minutes afterwards Lee the officer brought the prisoner in.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you have no doubt of the person of the prisoner - A. No doubt at all. She pulled off her bonnet in the shop; I am confident to her person. When Lee came in the shop he asked me if I had lost any thing. I told him not that I knew of; he produced a piece of silk that he took from under his coat; I knew the piece of silk, it stood near half a yard from where I was serving the prisoner within her reach; it was twilled sarcenet, I had not shewn that to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the constable say that he had found that piece of silk - A. He said he had taken it from the prisoner's clothes; I believe she said, for God's sake let me go and take the piece of silk.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity of the silk - A. Fifty-four yards, worth fifteen pounds, it cost us that; I am sure that piece was on the counter, within half a yard of her when she was served by me this small quantity of silk. The other woman I have not seen since.</p>

            . I am constable and street keeper of Holborn. On the 4th of December, about a quarter before five I saw the prisoner and another woman go into Mr. Compigne's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her person - A. I did, and the persons of them both. In consequence of their going into the shop I placed myself behind a coach to observe their conduct; I observed them both come out of the shop, the prisoner came out first.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lamplew. The other shopman was not in the shop nor the master were they - A. No, the other shopman was in the accompting-house with his back to the shop; it is in a back-room adjoining the shop, he was writing at the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came in, at that part of the accompting-house could he observe the prisoner at all - A. It was not in his view at all.</p>

               <p>Q. to Lee. You said both of them came out of the shop, and the prisoner came out first - A. Yes. As soon as they had shut the door they turned on the left up Holborn, and I observed the prisoner had got something by the aukwardness of her walk. I followed them nine doors, they turned about four yards up King's Head-court, both together. I then observed the prisoner endeavouring to take something from under her clothes; she had got a brown great coat on over her clothes; she was stooping and taking it from under her clothes; her back was towards me; I saw her pulling it out of the lower part of her dress, under her coat. As soon as she had got it under her coat she turned to the right, and I believe she then saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge that she knew you, and what you were - A. Yes, I am certain of that. She passed me quick, and ran across the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to occasion her to run - A. No. I thought of laying hold of them both; I pursued her, and as soon as she got her foot on the curb on the opposite side of the street, I caught hold of her coat, and felt the roll inside; I then said, holloa, what have you got here; she said, take it, Lee, for God's sake, and let me go; I said, you shall go back to where you had it from. I took the roll of silk from under her coat, and put it under my coat. I took her and the silk to Mr. Compigne's. The other woman ran up King's Head-court, it is a passage into Fetter-lane; I have not seen the other woman since. When I took the prisoner into Mr. Compigne's shop the last witness was at the left hand counter, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040049"></xptr>other gentleman at the right-hand counter; I asked the last witness if he had lost any thing; he answered, not that he knew; I asked the next witness, neither of them knew anything was gone. I then took her into the accompting-house at the back of the shop and produced the silk; the silk was claimed as Mr. Compigne's. I then searched the prisoner, in her left hand pocket I found these two pieces of sarcenet rolled in that paper; I have kept the roll of sarcenet ever since, and likewise the pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lamplew. Look at that roll of sarcenet, are you quite sure that it is Mr. Compigne's - A. I am certain of it, and it was on the counter when I was serving of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper which Lee said he took out of her pocket - A. These are the two pieces that they bought of me when they were in the shop, I put them in that paper and the prisoner took them away. This roll of sarcenet is worth fifteen pounds.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the gentleman's shop to purchase a bit of silk, the young woman was in the shop before I went in, and came out before me, and when I came out she said, young woman lay hold of this while I tie my stocking; she crossed the way and I crossed after her, when I was immediately taken into custody.</p>

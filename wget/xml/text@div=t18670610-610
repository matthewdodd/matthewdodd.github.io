I keep the Eight Bells—I saw the prosecutor asleep on a form—I saw the prisoner and another woman trying to wake him, about seven o'clock, but they could not—I pulled him up from a seat, and put him in a corner—I had occasion to leave the house for about twenty minutes, and when I came back he was there, but his coat was gone—I gave information to the police, and went with a constable to the prisoner's house and found her there; she said she knew nothing about the coat.</p>

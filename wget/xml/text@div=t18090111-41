               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed on the night of the 24th of December - A. Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure your door and windows - A. This was about six o'clock in the morning; we all got up together, the prisoner, I, and two more lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any money in the house - A. I had eight guineas belonging to myself, and seven guineas and fourteen shillings belonging to my three lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any money belonging to this man - A. Not above two or three shillings when his way was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep this money - A. In a box by the bed side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sleep in the same room with you - A. No, in the next room, on the same floor; we had separate doors.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your door fastened when you went to bed - A. It fastens with a latch; sometimes I fasten it and sometimes I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before this had you seen this quantity of money of your's - A. I had seen it in the evening before; I went to the box to get money at five o'clock, it was safe then; when I went to bed I took my shirt out to put on in the morning, it was safe then.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body sleep in the same room with you - A. My wife and little child.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box locked - A. I think it was, I am not certain. This prisoner, my wife, and I, went to mass at six o'clock in the morning to Duke street, Lincoln's inn fields.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you did not know that you had lost the money - A. I was sure that I had not lost the money. When I went out to mass the prisoner went as far as Lincoln's inn fields with me, then he left me; it seemed to me as if he stopped to draw water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at chapel - A. No; I went home a little after seven, I found the door wide open, and the box removed from the place where it had been; there was not a farthing of money in the box; somebody had removed it from the bed side to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that the prisoner had been back to the house - A. I did not see him till nine o'clock. There was one man remained in the house all the time; his name was Macdaniel.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that the money was in the box when you went to mass - A. I really believe it was. I suspected Macdaniel then, because I had left him in the house; I sent for an officer, Wensley came, he searched Macdaniel and found nothing on him; I heard the prisoner was drinking; I went to the public house to him; I saw he was getting drunk; I give a dinner to my lodgers, it is customary on Christmas day, I brought him home to his dinner; after he had ate his dinner I sent for Wensley, he came and searched him, he found nothing but sixpence farthing in copper on him; we let him go. At night he came in dead drunk, and throwed his clothes on the middle of the floor; I got up in the morning, I took hold of his coat, I found it weighty; when he got up I said John, I suspect you have not been at work to get money; he said he would go to his brother; he ran down stairs, I ran after him and threw him down; I said he should not go. He threw a letter on the ground as he was running away, I picked it up; I caught hold of him by the handkerchief, I found there were money there; I took him to Wensley's house; he took the handkerchief off and found two guineas and a half. The prisoner took the handkerchief off and put the money in his pocket in spite of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know how much money he took out of the handkerchief at that time - A. No; when the constable got up he searched him, he found two guineas and a half in gold, two shillings, and some halfpence; he said it should be decided by the law, he would make us all sorry for robbing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose none of the money that you had in your trunk was marked - A. No; but the half guinea I think I should know, it was crooked on the harp side.</p>
               <p>Q. That is common - A. It is. I knew the letter that he threw down; that was in my box, with two guineas and a half in it, the night before; I have the letter here, it was addressed to me, it came to me from Ireland.</p>

            , Holborn; I was sent for to search the prisoner, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; I told him what I searched him for; he said if I found any more money upon him than some copper, I might do as I liked with him; I found only six penny-pieces and a farthing in copper in his pocket; he had no other money about him; I let him go; the next morning the prosecutor brought him down to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not come down till the man had taken off his neckloth - A. No; he was struggling to get away from the prosecutor; when I came down on searching him, I found in his breeches pocket two guineas and a half in gold, and two shillings in copper in his waistcoat pocket; I observed to the prosecutor that there was a crooked half guinea; the prisoner said it was his own, and threatened us with law for taking his money from him; the prosecutor afterwards delivered me this letter; it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at the half guinea - A. I remarked it being crooked at the tail of the harp.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that you always kept the box locked - A. I am; my wife kept the key.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you look about for this man at the chapel - A. I did; I thought he was along with me; I stood at the door while the people passed out, and if he had been there I must have seen him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was Macdaniel in the house all the time you went to mass - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not lock the door when you went to mass - A. I bolted it inside, and went out of the window; when I came home I found the door open.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you seen that letter in the box that night - A. Yes, it was in the dimity pocket with my money, and the pocket book in my box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bolt the door and go out of the window - you speak so fast I cannot understand you - A. I went out at the door, put my hand in at the window and bolted the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How could the prisoner come in - A. The same way I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Macdaniel say he saw him come in the house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he up when you returned - A. No, he was in bed when I came.</p>

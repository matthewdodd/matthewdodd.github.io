                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 193). On Monday morning, 3rd Dec., I was on duty at the London Docks—I went to a shed on the East quay—I noticed a case there, which had been broken open—I called the attention of the dock constable to it—on 7th Dec. I took Mullaly, and told him he was charged with breaking a case on 1 st Dec.—he said he never was in the docks that day, and knew nothing about it—on the way to the station he said, "I will tell you all about it; I was there that day;" that Ballard asked him what was in the case, and he said he did not know, and he took it to another shed, and opened it, and took out a fishing-rod and some other things, and then he went out of the gate, and threw the things under the gate—Ballard was in custody then.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185001070021"></xptr>
               <p>I found by the side of it a garden rake, a razor-strop, and some prints—I went to Mullaly's house, in Cooper's-court—I asked him if he was in the Docks on 1st Dec.—he said, "Yes, I was there, but was turned out by a police-constable"—I asked him if he knew anything about any fishing-rod—he said, "No"—I asked if he knew Mr. Child, the pawnbroker, in Shadwell High-street—he said, "No"—I took him to the pawnbroker's; he was not identified there, and was discharged—this was on 5th Dec.—on 22nd I took Ballard at the Docks—I asked him if he was at the East quay on 1st Dec.—he said, "No"—I asked if he knew anything about any fishing-rod—he said, "No"—I asked if he knew Mr. Child's, the pawnbroker—he said, "No"—I took him there, and saw the foreman—I said, "Do you know this man"—he said, "Yes, he is the man that pawned the fishing-rod, I have no doubt about it"—he was then taken to Lemon-street station—about two hours afterwards he returned, and said to me, in the presence of Mullaly, whose proper name I believe is Gannon—"I did pawn the rods; I was asked to pawn them by Gannon, who told me, he had taken a case from a shed on the East quay, broke it open, and took out the rod, and he got them out under the brandy quay gate."</p>

I met Mullaly, whom I call Gannon—he was alone, and was going towards Shadwell High-street, away from the Docks—I spoke to him—he had nothing with him—I saw him again afterwards, with Ballard—Ballard had a fishing-rod in his hand—they were in company, but not close together—I said, "Halloo! Gannon, are you going fishing?"—he said, "Hum"—I walked with them to the Match-walk; I then left them, and went to King David-lane—when I came back, I saw, both the prisoners standing facing Mr. Child's, the pawnbrokers.</p>

I saw him come out, and followed and spoke to him about this case; he had not time to say much to me; he said he would meet me next day in the Docks.</p>

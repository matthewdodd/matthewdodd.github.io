                  </hi>. I am a meat-inspector at Newgate-market, and hare been so about ten months; before that I was a salesman in Newgate-market—I am well acquainted with meat—I know the defendant; he is a sales<lb></lb>man of Tylor's-market, adjoining Newgate-market—on Wednesday, 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. October, about 6 in the morning, I went to his shop—he was not there—I saw four quarters of a cow hanging on the hooks inside the shop—I examined them and found they were four quarters of a cow, which had been suffering from lung disease; the flesh was wet, and was highly inflamed—it had been stripped on both sides of the ribs—the meat in between the ribs was highly inflamed, and the kidneys very much enlarged—I should think they were twice the size of an ordinary animal's in full health—the ribs were skinned; that is not done when an animal is killed in a proper state of health—when adhesion of the lung has taken place it is stripped off to hide the appearance of disease—the inner surface of the ribs had been rubbed over with warm fat; that would have a tendency to conceal adhesion to some extent—any person at all acquainted with the trade must have seen the state the animal</p>

               <p>was in—in my opinion it was totally unfit for human food—I noticed it on that account—I saw Mr. Wood about 7 or half-past on that morning—I told him he should not have had such meat brought up to market—he said be had not seen it, he was not aware it was bad, or he would not have had it brought there—the first thing he said was, that he had not seen it since it was dressed—I saw him next morning about 8 or half-past, near the shop—he made the remark then, that it was a very bad job, he was a poor man and had a large family.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that in reference to this affair? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I don't think I spoke to him at all—he volunteered that statement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of the City of London—on 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. October, I was called upon to examine the four quarters of a cow; the three inspectors were there at the time—the meat was in a very bad state from disease—it was emaciated, charged with disease, serum, as they term it, wet—the animal had suffered from inflammation of the lungs and pleura at the time of death—the person who had dressed the meat, had removed the diseased portion as far as he possibly could; that is the pleura lining the ribs—the surface had been smeared with warm fat, which gives it a some<lb></lb>what smooth appearance, resembling the natural condition of the pleura—the meat was not fit for human food—the diseased state of the animal was, in my opinion, perceptible to the eye of an experienced person—it was condemned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was the matter with this cow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Inflamma<lb></lb>tion of the lungs and pleura—the kidneys were very much enlarged; that arises from many causes—it arises from congestion of the kidneys—I have noticed that cows which have been kept in cow-houses, and fed on uncom<lb></lb>mon food, have very great enlargement of the kidneys—from the emaciated condition of the animal, I should say that inflammation must have lasted a week or ten days; an active inflammation resulting afterwards in very severe appearances—I believe the cow had been killed.</p>

               <p>Wheeler—I did not take notice of the conversation—I saw Mr. Wood skewer the cow's <hi rend="italic">dug</hi> or udder; it was dressed at that time—I did not see any of the parts that were taken away—I did not say a word to Mr. Wood with reference to the cow, nor about the state in which it was, nor did he say anything to me about it—that was between 11 and 12 in the day—the cow was hanging in the slaughter-house—it is lofty and well lighted—I was about a yard and a half from the cow—I said it was a very bad one; it was a bad one—I mean by that, that in my opinion it was unfit for human food.</p>

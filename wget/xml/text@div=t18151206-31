At about twelve o'clock in the day time of the 4th of November, I fastened up the house, and went out, and left nobody in it to my knowledge. I was absent till nearly half past two; when I returned, I sent my servant in first; she is not here. When I returned, I saw the drawer of the dresser in the kitchen had been very ill used; there was little bits of wood knocked off by the keyhole; it had been broken open; every thing was taken out of the drawer, which had been in it; there were seventeen yards of linen cloth, worth two and sixpence a yard; there were four tea spoons, and two table spoons; the table spoons are worth ten shillings a piece, and the tea spoons were worth two shillings a piece; the girl's shifts was taken out of her box, but these did not belong to me. There a gown of mine, worth seven shillings and sixpence; also a waistcoat, worth one shilling and sixpence. When I returned to the house, I did not at first find the prisoner, but I looked about, and found him in the pigeon loft; that is over the coal or hen house; when I discovered him, he dropped down, and I went and took him; he was laying in the pigeon loft as if he was asleep, and as soon as he saw me, he dropped down into the coal house, on the coals. He did not attempt to make his escape, nor did he make any resistance whatever. I said, John, you are a very bad boy. I was acquainted with him before; he said, if I would let him go, he would go to sea, and I should never see him any more. I took him into the front kitchen, and sent for my servant man, his name is

He had tied them all up in a handkerchief. I did not find the house, nor the doors, not windows broken at all, on my return. I only found the drawers broken open.</p>

We went backwards with her to look out the Wood; he soon began his impudent Tricks, and went to put his Hands under her Coats for all we were there. Then he brought the Wood into the Shop and saw'd it, and she paid him 8 d. for it; and all the while he kept talking his impudent lewd Discourse about lying with her, and where would be the harm of it if he did, and such kind of Stuff, but all in such gross Language, that I cannot repeat it. I and my Sister got out first, and were gone but a little Way from the Door, when we heard her scream out, and call Molly, Molly.

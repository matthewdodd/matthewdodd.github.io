               <p>An Information coming to Sir John Fielding's office of this burglary, and some robberies; the prisoner Massey and another were taken into custody, as they passed up Bow-street, and were carried into the office and examined; the other prisoner followed them in; and having followed them in, and being in their company, something having been found upon Massey, which led us to believe that Massey might have been concerned in this robbery; Kelly was also searched; and we found upon Massey two parcels of ribbands; and upon Kelly a pair of cotton gloves; (the ribbands and gloves were produced in court).</p>

               <p>I can swear positively to these cotton gloves; they are Mrs. Hopkins's property; I mended them, and there is my own mark upon them; as to the ribbands I cannot undertake to swear positively to them, but there were two such parcels of ribbands in the bureau at the time the house was broke open; and I believe from that circumstance, and the appearance of the ribband, that they are the two pieces of ribband.</p>

               <p>MASSEY's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>If the ribband be measured, it will be found they have each a yard less than the lady says. I bought these six yards of ribband of a pedlar in my own lodging that very morning; when my wife died I had a young woman to make my bed and clean my room; I told her I would make her a present of a ribband or two, and I bought these to give her. I bought it for six yards, and gave him half a crown for it, at the sign of the Queen's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290018"></xptr> Head in the Strand, about eight o'clock in the morning; there was nobody in the house but a little boy that is gone away. I have not any body here; the landlord and his wife are very ill; I have been formerly a gentleman's servant, after I was out of place I learned to dress hair; I have been lately down to my own town; I have no friends here at all.</p>


               <p>KELLY's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I lodge likewise at the Queen's Head in the Strand with my wife and family, and have for about a year and a half. I came down stairs at about eight in the morning to read the news-paper; a woman came in with a large bundle, she seemed like an old clothes woman; she offered me some stockings and handkerchiefs to sell. I told her I wanted no such things; then she shewed me a pair of gloves. I said I never wore such things: the boy said your wife does. I asked the price; she said 2 s. I bid her one as I did not want them. I at last said I would give her 18 d. for them; she said if she took my money she would drink with me. I said she might drink the beer I left; I went out, going along Covent Garden I met this young man that stands by me and the other; we were going to Lincoln's-Inn-Fields to see a match that was going to be played at fives. Going up Bow-street, Massey said this was the nearest way; when we came to the Brown-Bear door, Jealous came out and stopped Massey; I was thirty or forty yards behind; he said there was an information of a robbery, and by the description he was one; and he said to the other young man, I believe you to be another. I said, do you want me? Jealous said no; we have no notice of you, nor description of you. I said I may go about my business then I suppose; he said yes, I might; but I said I would stop and see what was their fate; I was afterwards stopped and searched. If I had been conscious of having any stolen goods upon me, I should not have gone there: there was a person who was present at the time I bought these mittens, who sat in a box opposite me, but I never could find him out; the landlord and landlady would appear, but they are both lying at the point of death. I am now a waiter, I have been mostly in the tea gardens lately.</p>

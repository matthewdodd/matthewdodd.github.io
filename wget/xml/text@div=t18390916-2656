On the 16th of September, about half-past seven o'clock, the prisoner called and said he had come from his master, Mr. James, who resided at the Hermitage, at Brompton and wanted two bottles of sherry, such as his master used to have, and that be was gone to reside at No. 102, Sloane-street—I supposing him to be Mr. James servant, who had dealt with us, allowed him to have let him he had not told me he was Mr. James's servant I should not have let him have it—it was on the faith of his being the servant of Mr. James at the Hermitage that I let him have it.</p>

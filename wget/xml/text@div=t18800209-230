                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 8, High Street, Shoreditch—my shop was broken into at 1 a.m. on the 29th of January—I fastened up the window securely about 9 o'clock the previous night—the window was unbroken—I went into the back parlour—at 11.45 I went to turn the gas a little higher, it being a foggy night—I then went to bed—I was aroused by a constable at 1 o'clock—when I came down there were two or three constables at the shop window and a young girl—the window was com<lb></lb>pletely smashed—it is a large plate of glass 8 feet 8 inches by 8 feet 10 inches—I missed three pairs of trousers, an overcoat, a length of cloth, a pair of trousers and vest, all articles which I had left in the window—I next saw these goods at the station—it is a portion of my property—there are railings 6 inches in front of the window, about 3 feet 3 inches high from the pavement.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 28th January I was in Shoreditch, about 12.40, near Mr. Nathan's shop—I heard a smash—when I got a little farther I picked up a canvas bag—I took it towards a lamp to see what was on it, and before I could see it there was any name I had a blow in the face—I put my hand up and found my tie smothered with blood—I halloaed for a policeman—when I looked round the prisoner was standing behind me—I saw three men at the windows as I went past, and then I</p>

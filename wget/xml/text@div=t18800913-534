I am a basketmaker, Manton Street, Old Kent Road, and am the trustee appointed to the debtor in this matter by the Court—I attended the first meeting of his creditors on the 20th February, 1880, when the debtor was present—Mr. Neary produced a proof for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; we asked the debtor what it was for, and he said it was for his uncle, Mr. Challender—we thought it rather strange that his uncle should lend him so large a sum of money, and he said it was perfectly true—he withdrew the proof, and I was nominated as trustee—he was asked how much he could pay in the pound, and he named 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he had no security, and did not know when he should pay it—he said he had had a fire, and a lot of his goods were consumed—that evening I went to 14, Star Corner with Mr. De Martelaar, where I took an inventory (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that shows what was on the premises on that day—I saw the father and mother of the defendant on the premises that evening—he was not there—after I had taken the inventory I gave instructions to the father and mother, and on the 6th March I again went to Star Corner, and took a second inventory of what was on the premises on that day (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which shows some stock missing between those dates—I then left a person in possession of what there was there—I subsequently sold what was left on those premises—I went to see the defendant, and asked him several times whether he did not have anymore goods stowed away somewhere, because</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188009130103"></xptr>
               <p>I knew he ought to have had a larger stock than he had—he said he had not—a few days after, the 6th March, I was in the act of crossing Black<lb></lb>friars Bridge when I saw a van going along which I recognised as the defendant's—it was full of baskets, and I stopped it and took possession of it, and sold the goods—after that I received some information, and made inquiries in the neighbourhood of Wands worth—I applied to the Bankruptcy Court to examine the debtor, and got an appointment for a private sitting, and he was examined on the 18th March, when I was present—in consequence of that I went with Potter to Garret Lane, Wands worth, where I saw Mrs. Steele, and had a long conversation with her—her husband came in; I had some conversation with him, and the result of it was that I went to the back premises, were they showed me a lot of cane baskets worth about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had them taken away the next day—the defendant had never up to that day made any allusion to any of those goods, and they are not included in the inventory made by me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 52, Parkett Road, Rotherhithe—I am clerk to the defendant's solicitor—at the time of the liquidation I received from the prisoner his statement of affairs—he said he owed a bill for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was coming due, that he had had a fire upon his premises which had consumed the best part of his, stock—I received an account of the salvage—three cartloads of cinders were taken away, and I think I saw some<lb></lb>thing like 20 dozen of clothes-baskets half-burnt—I asked him for a list of his debts, and he gave it to me—he said, "I do not know how much I owe uncle" (<hi rend="italic">Challender</hi>)—I said, "It is not for you to say how much you owe him; what do you think?"—he said, "About 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "It is not what you put down; if you do not owe it he will not prove for it," and that amount was put down—it was never sworn, and there was no proof—I instructed the defendant's father to go down to where Challender lived, but as the prisoner's father was no scholar, and challender an ignorant man, the proof was brought back unsigned, with the statement that Challender would come up and do it—then the shoot was handed to Neary, who was appointed chairman of the meeting—the proof was given to Neary by the prisoner's father—the proof was not filed nor sworn—Challender did not come up and state what the debt was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not employ Neary—I saw him appointed chair<lb></lb>man—he produced a sheet unsworn—he produced no proxy—he was a perfect stranger—he had no affidavit of debt—you can call in anybody from the street and make him the chairman of a liquidation meeting-Neary was not there with my concurrence at all—I was there to represent the debtor only.</p>

Bell and Black, the match manufacturers—I have been for many years—I know William Pateman, the prisoner's father—I am his son-in-law—in the beginning of September last he asked me if I could stow some goods for him—I live about a mile from Battersea—I give him permission—my wife and I were not then on good terms with the prisoner—goods were sent down to my place at different times extending over a month—on the 3rd April I saw Bremerkamp, Packer, and De Martelaar at my place—Bremerkamp was speaking to my wife—she is here—he asked me if I had any cane baskets to sell—I told him I had none for sale—he drew a paper from his pocket and said "This is what I am"—I saw his name—I said "You had better come and look at the goods," and he took stock of the goods—the following morning Packer came and took the goods away—I was present—he said he came from Pateman—I understood him to mean the elder Pateman, and that they had bought the goods, and so I parted with them—I first heard of the liquida<lb></lb>tion on the Saturday morning when they took the goods away—I then asked Packer when the goods were loaded if he would give me a note—he then informed me that the goods were claimed on behalf of the trustee.</p>

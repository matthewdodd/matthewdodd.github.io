            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 20th of May was twelve months, the prisoner pledged this with me, (producing a table-cloth,) it was during the time she was Miss Elliot's servant; she pledged it as the property of Miss Elliot.</p>
               <p>Miss Elliot. This table-cloth is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give the prisoner directions to pledge it?</p>
               <p>Miss Elliot. No, I never did, to pledge any thing of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. to Priestman. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Priestman. I live at the corner of Compton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. As you knew the prisoner lived there, how came you to take it in?</p>
               <p>Priestman. She made a genteel appearance, and she had pledged things before in Miss Elliot's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there no other Miss Elliots besides this Miss Elliot here in court?</p>

               <p>Court. You said Miss Elliot's name was in your books.</p>
               <p>Priestman. Miss Elliot's name never was in our books as I know of, but on the account of what this prisoner had pawned for her; there was another servant told me she came in Miss Elliot's name, but they were all redeemed before this time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I frequently went to that pawnbroker; the first thing I ever pawned was my mistress's pair of buckles and rings, to the value of six guineas; I lived with her almost three years; the next thing I pawned was her diamond solitaire for ten guineas; the next was a cross and a pair of diamond ear-rings for five guineas, these were all pawned to Mr. Priestman; I have pawned them diamonds more than once or twice either; the last things that were pawned at his house were a gold necklace, some ear-rings, and a cross, for 30 guineas, about twelve months ago, since the table-cloth was pawned a great while; I pawned the tablecloth for Miss Elliot's use, as I did all the other things; she ordered me to make money of something, and I did not know of what to make it; I pawned that for a guinea, very often we had nothing better in the house, without it was linen; I cannot positively say whether I gave her the guinea whole, but she had it; she never made no odds, when I had money she had it, and when she had I had it; the thirteen huckaback towels belonged to the man I lived with, named W. Langley; I don't know how he came by that marked with the letter H and a coronet, nor that marked E 6. I had a sister lay in there, and I took care of her the time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Priestman. Do you remember the prisoner pawning buckles and rings to you for six guineas.</p>
               <p>Priestman. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her pawning a diam ond solitaire for ten guineas?</p>
               <p>Priestman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her pawning a cross and a pair of diamond ear-rings for five guineas?</p>
               <p>Priestman. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her pawning a gold necklace, some ear-rings, and a cross, for thirty guineas, after this table-cloth was pawned?</p>
               <p>Priestman. I do not remember she pledged them, whether they were pledged by the prisoner, or who.</p>

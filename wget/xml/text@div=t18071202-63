               <p>Q. You knew the prisoner, I believe, for a length of time - A. Yes, he carried on a serge manufactory. On the 13th of March this year I saw Mr. Tucker at Mrs. Crouch's at Exeter, between ten and eleven o'clock. I was there, the prisoner sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance may Mrs. Crouch's be from the prisoner's house. - A. I suppose a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the name of Greenway mentioned by the prisoner while you was there. - A. Yes, he said he had received a letter from his brother Jonathan in London, saying that he had seen circular letters from Greenway begging for time; he said it would be impossible for him to go on, that he, Mr. Tucker, must stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you about any person being about to look after him there. - A. He looked at the window frequently and pointed out from the window several persons whom he called bailiffs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing said by him or you on the subject of an arrest. - A. Not on that day; on the 20th of the same month there was, at Wellington; in Somersett, he sent to me to come to Wellington; when I saw Mr. Tucker at Wellington, I asked him what made him go away in that sort of a way, I told him he was very muck talked of; he then said, that d - nd rascal Hutchins thought to have arrested him in the castle yard. Mr. Winter and myself advised him to go to Honiton, to transfer some collateral securities he had at the house of Messrs Smith, Brookes, and co. which he had in contemplation some time; he replied that he should be liable to be arrested at Honiton. I replied, not if his friends knew he was to be there. We all went to Honiton that evening, they transferred the security; we went to the Golden Lion inn; the security I understood was executed in London.</p>

               <persName id="t18071202-63-person630">August. </persName>
            - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the commissioners that attended. - Mr. Impey, Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Sertes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bankrupt appear. - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the commissioners wait for him. - A. Till two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. That was two hours beyond his time. - A. Yes. He was then proclaimed in the usual form.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue to attend at Guildhall the whole of the day. - A. I continued from half after ten in the forenoon, till past midnight, at Guildhall; if I was absent for five minutes I left Mr. Hindmarsh, clerk of Mr. Savell, there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bankrupt come during the whole of that time. - A. He did not. The proclamation was made at half after two o'clock. The commissioners signed a memorandum of non attendance before they went.</p>
               <p>Q. to Savell. On the evening of the 17th of August did the prisoner come to your house. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. In the interval between the 4th of July and the 18th of August, had the prisoner access to his books and papers in the presence of your clerk, and occasionally in your presence. - A. Two or three times.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the name of your clerk. - 
               <persName id="t18071202-63-person631">A. James Hegan</persName>
            .</p>
               <p>Q. On the 17th of August the prisoner came to your house. - A. On the evening of the 17th of August, upon my return in the evening, I found the prisoner at my house; he informed me he understood I had received some instructions from the country, and these instructions were to hang him, if possible. I told him I was not aware how he could be in possession of any instructions which I had received, but that I should pursue those instructions I had received, not telling him what they were. He then said he had a family, and he hoped some mercy would be shewn him. I told him to entitle himself to mercy, he must do what was correct. I then asked him for some bills of exchange which he had taken from Hegan, one of my clerks; he said that the bills of exchange were destroyed. I told him I should expect he would bring these bills of exchange to his commissioners on the following day; he said he could not bring the bills, because they were burnt, but that he should attend his commissioners, and endeavour to finish his examination. He went away soon after. I told him if he did not attend he would be proclaimed as a selon, and that he would be liable to suffer death.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoke of some bills he had from Hegan, your clerk, had he access to the proceedings. - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present on the 18th of August when the commissioners met. - A. I was, I remained there about half an hour after the commissioners left. I staid till between two and three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. We have been told that the commissioners signed a memorandum of his default. - A. They did, I signed it, I was the subscribing witness; the memorandum was written by my clerk Hegan. On the 19th I went before the lord mayor, I was obliged to take the memorandum in order to obtain the warrant to take the prisoner; I left the memorandum at the lord mayor's for my clerk Hindmarsh to bring it back again when the warrant was granted. I have never seen it afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. to Page. Do you remember that summons being signed by the commissioners. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner producing that summons. - A. When he first came up he produced a summons, by virtue of which he attended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the commissioners put an endorsement on the back of that summons. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lawes. You saw a paper in the possession of the prisoner. - A. Yes, I saw it in the usual way, in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Not reading it, you cannot speak accurately to its contents. - A. It certainly was the regular summons, or the commissioners would not have signed it. I have no doubt but it was the original summons.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, in point of fact, whether it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020049"></xptr>or was not. - A. I do not; I saw it on the first meeting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Savell. Do you remember the prisoner bringing his summons or his protection. - A. At one of the meetings I asked the bankrupt whether he had his protection; he said he had it endorsed upon his summons, but what summons it was I do not know, I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lawes. Have you yourself made any search for the bankrupt's summons. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any search for the warrant on the 18th of 
               <persName id="t18071202-63-person638">August. </persName>
            - A. I have. On the bankrupt being taken up I looked in the proceedings, I found that memorandum was gone. I have searched almost every paper in my office, every drawer, and every closet, and I have not been able to find it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present at the time of the last examination on the 18th of 
               <persName id="t18071202-63-person639">August. </persName>
            - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this unfortunate man at the bar. - A. I do, I have known him for many years, his brother married a sister in law of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You are solicitor now under this commission, and solicitor in this prosecution against your relation. - A. I am, if he be a relation at all; if I had known that he had been such a man I would have had nothing to do with it. I do not consider myself any relation.</p>
               <p>Q. I think not by your manner; there was a number of bills of exchange out of the bankrupts. - A. As solicitor to the commission I had bills to the amount of a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds. In my absence from town I understood that the bills were given to him for the purpose of his giving them to me when I came to town.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a number of bills out, did you know of their being forged. - A. I have heard there were forged bills, but I never saw any.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not an imputation that he had defrauded bills. - A. No, but that he had defrauded the revenue. I have not heard that they were forged bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the clerks was it that you gave the instructions to, that if this man appeared he certainly would be taken up for the forgery. - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that your clerk told this man that if he did appear the officers were waiting, and he would be taken up for forgery. - A. I never heard such a thing until after he was in custody. The prisoner himself, when he was before the magistrate at Bow-street, said he had been advised by one of my clerks to absent himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at Guildhall on the 18th. - A. I did not see him there, I was not there the whole day.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not given any directions to your clerks on this subject. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. In point of fact had you any order to apprehend him for a forgery. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In conversation with him the night before, had you hinted to him that he would be apprehended for a forgery. - A. I told him he conducted himself very ill. He said, if a man put a knife to his throat, he had a right to take it away. There was a charge against him about the stamps.</p>
               <p>HINRY HINDMARSH. Q. You are clerk to Mr. Savell, the solicitor to the commission. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner on the evening previous to the 18th of 
               <persName id="t18071202-63-person640">August. </persName>
            - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing him on the morning of the 18th. - A. No, I was there with Mr. Savell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the defendant that it was better for him not to appear on the subsequent day. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him there were persons there for the purpose of arresting him if he went there. - A. I did not. On the 18th at Guildhall yard I saw

               <p>Q. I do not understand you what you mean by bills. - A. Bills out, by which a man might get arrested. I did not deny that there were no more bills out; he was told of it the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, the prisoner had some reason to believe his conduct would be enquired into respecting some bills. - A. I dare say he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did not you say if he did come, he would be taken up. - A. No. Hegan was in the coach; he said all the way along, if I was to see Mr. Tucker now I would tell him not to come.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hegan communicate his opinion in your presence that he had better not come. - A. Not in my presence.</p>

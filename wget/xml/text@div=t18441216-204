On Sunday morning, the 17th of Nov., about eight o'clock, my shop was broken open, and I lost three odd boots and two pairs of shoes.</p>

               <p>the 17th of Nov. I was coming home with my milk, and saw the prisoner walking backwards and forwards in Love-lane past Botolph-alley—I went in doors with my milk, and came out again in about five minutes—he was still walking backwards and forwards, and I noticed him very much, so as to be able to know him again—as soon as I noticed him he walked away—I went round with my milk, round Thames-street, St. Mary-at-hill, and different places in the neighbourhood where I serve milk, till I came to Rood-lane—when I came there the prisoner was trying up two or three pairs of shoes in a handkerchief—he walked up Road-lane, and turned down Fenchurch-street—I crossed the road, and went up Paul's Head-court, and saw me he walked away—I went towards Tower-street station, met a policeman, and gave him information.</p>

               <p>Mr. PHIPPS. I live in Westmoreland Buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know John Green. - A. No, I never saw him till I saw the accident. On Monday the 7th of September, I was walking up <placeName id="t18070916-50-crimeloc253">Aldersgate Street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Who was the man that was whipping them. - A. The <rs id="t18070916-50-deflabel254" type="occupation">coachman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18070916-50-defend510 t18070916-50-deflabel254"></join> there at the bar. After he had passed me a few yards, I saw two men coming across the street, and the coach was so near them, that in my apprehension at the time it appeared that he must run over them both. One of the men stepped on one side, and the old man, the deceased was knocked down by the coach and horses; the near horse and the near small wheel went over his head. The coach was instantly stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Who stopped it. - A. I believe the prisoner stopped it as soon as he could; and as soon as the man got up we perceived two wounds, one large wound on the left side of the upper part of his head, and the lesser wound on the right side the lower part.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not die on the spot. - A. No. After the accident the coachman turned the people out of the coach, and put the deceased in; the prisoner then drove him to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. After the accident the prisoner did every thing that a man could do.</p>

            . I was with the deceased crossing Aldersgate Street on Monday last week, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon. I ran as quick as possible, and by some means or other this man was run over; before I could turn and recover myself he was picked up.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a young man and you ran; he was an old man and he could not. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. SQUIRE. Q. You are the surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. - A. Yes. The deceased was brought to the hospital; he died of an inflammation arising from the wounds he received on the left side of the head, and the other on the right side of the head.</p>

I was coming past at the same time this accident happened; the horses were trotting a middling pace; I saw the wheel go over the man, it certainly appeared to be accidental.

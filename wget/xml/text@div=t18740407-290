I manage the Old Catherine Wheel Inn, Bishops-gate Street—I know the two prisoners as customers there—on Thursday evening, 26th March, between 8 and 9 o'clock, Brown came in and asked me whether I would kindly favour him by taking care of some pictures till the morning, and he would fetch them—I knew him by the name of Kemp—ho wished them to be taken particular care of, because he had lent some money on them—I was rather surprised to find six pictures, because I had scarcely room in the bar for them—Smith brought thorn in—these are three of the paintings—they were left that night—the prisoners went away together—they came again the next day, between 2 and 3 o'clock, and brought a cab and took the pictures away.</p>

He also stated that he wished to call Detective Hawkins as a witness.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a tailoress at 31 Sophia-street, Poplar, and am single—on Monday, 10th April, I went to bed at a quarter-past 11—I sleep in a room on the ground-floor, with my mother—my brother sleeps in another bed in the same room—I fastened the door of the room; the shutters were not bolted, they were closed—about a quarter before 2 o'clock I was awoke by hearing a noise in the room—I saw the window open and a man standing in the room—I called out, "Mother, mother, there is a man in the room"—he turned round, got on the window-sill, and jumped down—my brother hearing the noise got out of bed and went after him in his drawers—I saw the prisoner the next afternoon, between four and five, at the top of Dolphin-lane—I called a policeman and gave him in custody—I am sure he is the man—I did not exactly see his face, but I can swear to his build and to his cap and jacket—before I went to bed there was a shift and jacket and shawl on the table—I missed them between 11 and 12 o'clock the next day—I afterwards saw the publican give them to the policeman—I can swear to the things—they are all mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of the last witness, and am a sea-man—on the morning of 10th April I was in bed, and was awoke by my sister screaming out, "Mother there is a man in the room"—I jumped up, he had just cleared the window-sill and I jumped after him in my drawers—I followed him, and he ran into a doorway—I made a grab at him, but he had bolted the door, and was too quick for me, that was at 3, Dolphin-court—I did not catch him—I did not see his face, I saw his dress; he had an old brown reefing jacket on and corduroy trowsers—I stopped outside the house twenty minutes, but he did not come out—I went back, met a police<lb></lb>man, and asked him if he would open the door, and he said could not open it as he did not see the man go in—I was at work the day the prisoner was taken—I went to the station on Thursday morning, and recognised him as the person who had been in our room—I had seen him several times before, I knew him by sight.</p>

On Wednesday, 12th April, Margaret Sullivan gave the prisoner into my custody for stealing a shift a shawl, and a boy's jacket, from 31, Sophia-street, Poplar—the prisoner said, "I can prove that I did not have them, and I was a-bed at a quarter to 11 o'clock"—going to the station he said he was in bed about a quarter to 12, and be could bring witnesses to prove it—I received these things from Jessie Todd.</p>

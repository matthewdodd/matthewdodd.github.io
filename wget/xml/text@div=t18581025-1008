                  </hi>. I am a linendraper in High-street, Deptford—on Sunday night, 12th September, I was disturbed by a noise between half-past 11 and a quarter to 12; a noise as though the whole of the shutters of one side of my front were falling down—I immediately got up</p>

               <p>and went to the window, but through the awning being erected I could see nobody—I was having some repairs done—I immediately partially dressed and went down to the shop, where I found that some prints had been moved out of my window, and that the whole of the shutters had been forcibly taken down from the outside—I found Mr. Stratton there—there were more than four pieces of common prints that had been stolen—I believe the glass was partially broken before, but the hole was made much larger—I had seen the prints safe on Saturday night when I closed—they were in a very high pile.</p>

I keep the Red-cow public-house in High-street, Deptford—that is directly facing Mr. Howes, the last witness—on Sunday night, 12th September about half-past 11, my attention was attracted by a noise as though a shutter was falling—I looked out of the window, and saw Mr. Howes' shutters had fallen—there were two or three men, I could not say how many—I immediately afterwards heard some glass broken, and saw two men emerge carrying bundles under their arms—I could not see their faces—they were about the size and dress of the prisoners.</p>

I had seen the prisoners about before this event took place—I saw them on Sunday night, 12th September, come out of a public-house about 11 o'clock—they got hustling together in the road—I ordered them off—about four or five minutes afterwards they went away towards Wellington-street, Deptford—about eight minutes after that, I went towards Wellington-street, Deptford, and saw the two prisoners come out of an oyster shop and come towards Mr. Howes' premises—Mr. Stratton asked me if I heard some shutters drop—it was about twenty-five minutes after 11 when I last saw the prisoners, before I saw Mr. Stratton—they were then T should say not eighty yards from the prosecutor's premises—I found that at Mr. Howes' premises the shutters had been forced, and I found that a great quantity of print had been taken away—in consequence of some information, on Tuesday morning between 1 and 2 I went to the house where Mr. Lane lodged—he gave me this print—in consequence of what Lane told me, I took the prisoner Robinson into custody at a little after 3 in the morning of Tuesday—I said I wanted him for stealing a quantity of print from Mr. Howes' premises—he said he knew nothing of it—after that I took Brady abont 6 o'clock in the morning—I said I wanted him for being concerned with Robinson in stealing the print—Lane was taken into custody and charged with being a receiver—they were sober.</p>

I live at 20, Old King-street, and am a widow—the prisoner Robinson sleeps there—his sister has two rooms in my house—he was not at home on Sunday night, 12th September—I shut up my house about half-past 10 that Sunday night—I called up the stairs to see whether he was in—between 5 and 6 the next morning I heard some one come in and go down the passage—I looked out of my window and saw it was him, and I said, "You have not been in all night," and he said "No"—in the course of the same morning, Brady came to my house between 10 and 11 o'clock I should think—he came down the steps into the passage—I asked him who he was, and he said he wanted Robinson—I said I did not know whether he was in—he said, "All right, missus," and he went away—after that, Robinson brought a sack down three parts full of something, and gave it to him and he went away—he was in the habit of using sacks.</p>

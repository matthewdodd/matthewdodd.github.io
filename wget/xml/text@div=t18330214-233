            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Whitecross-place. On Thursday night, the 31st of January, I was in Church-street, about six o'clock; I saw the prisoners following two gentlemen - I watched them, and when they got to <placeName id="t18330214-233-crimeloc1306">Hackney-road</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you recollect what my Lord my said to you in last February Session? A. No, I do not recollect being here, but I might have been; I have been here several times - I do not know whether I have been here twenty times; I do not recollect prosecuting two men for stealing a handkerchief of

             - I recollect swearing that I saw Johnson put his hand into Mr. Keat's pocket and take out his handkerchief, and put it into his breeches; but the Jury acquitted the prisoner, because you stifled the case; I began to be a witness seven or eight years ago, in consequence of my father losing some shoes - I have prosecuted persons once or twice for taking handkerchiefs from persons unknown - I will swear it is not five times; I did not get my expences last time - I did not apply for them; I have always been praised by Judges and Magistrates - I did not get my expences, because you stifled the case altogether: I never think about expences - I suppose in the last twelve months I have got 10s. or 12s. - I may have got 2l. in twelve months.</p>

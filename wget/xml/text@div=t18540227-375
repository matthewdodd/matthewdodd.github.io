I saw him again, about 11 o'clock at night—he asked for a cup of coffee, which I served him with—he had a shilling and a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece in his hand—he asked which I would have—I said I was not particular, and he then said, "Take the shilling"—I took it, put it into my mouth, and bent it double—I accused him of that, and of the time before, and fetched the book, and showed him when I took it—I had put down the day—he wanted me to give him the two shillings again—I told him I would not; I would have him locked up—I sent for an officer—he made his way to the door, and he went away—I found two officers—I gave one of them the two shillings which I had received.</p>

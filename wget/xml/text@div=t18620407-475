                  </hi>. I live at Ware-passage, Somers'-town, in the same house with Mr. Price—on Wednesday, 2d April, I was minding my things outside the door—I was present when these two woman were quarrelling—Price was also at the door—he went to separate the two women who were quarrelling, and the prisoner came towards him, made use of the words, "I will settle the b—," jumped on Mr. Price's back, first hit him in the face with his fist, and, before he could turn round, struck him on his head with a hammer—the prisoner was glazing some windows—he is a bootmaker by trade—Price turned round to push him away, and the prisoner fell down—when he fell, he turned round and struck a knife into the thick part of Price's leg—I saw him do that deliberately—Price did not go down—he was senseless; but he did not fall.</p>

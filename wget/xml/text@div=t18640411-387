                  </hi>. I keep a fishmonger's shop in Stanhope-street, Clare Market—on Friday, 11th March, the prisoner came in for a halfpennyworth of stewed eels—she gave me a bad shilling—I told her it was bad—she said, "Is it? here is another one," and gave me a second bad one—I gave her in charge with the two shillings—I saw another shilling and some coppers in her hand when she gave me the two shillings.</p>

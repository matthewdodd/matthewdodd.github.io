                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">grocer, Red Lion-street, Holborn.</hi> I had some transactions with Mr. Kemp, in Albany-street, Regent's-park—in the beginning of March White called on me—he was quite a stranger till then—he said he was going to lend Kemp a large sum of money, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was anxious to know the state of the account between me and Mr. Kemp before he advanced the money—I declined it till I saw Mr. Kemp—White told me that he was a builder in Queen-street, City—he said, if I would not let him see the accounts, would I meet him at Mr. Kemp's—it was at last agreed that White should see the ac<lb></lb>counts—he came to my place in Red Lion-street, and was shown into the parlour at the back of the shop—he looked over the accounts—he said he had a great deal of money that he wanted to lend, as he got such small interest for it in the funds; that he was building eighty houses at Dalston, and had 120 men at work—he said he had a great many houses in the New-road; he had been buying some that day, and he was going to put shop-fronts in them—he said he had a sister in Westmorland, and he owned a mill there—while White was with me in the parlour, my shopman, Hanson, came and made a communication to me—White got up to go away, saying he would see me at some future time, as I was being called away—he went into the shop as if he was going away—I went into the shop and saw the prisoner there—he made a bow to White as White was going out, and White slightly returned it—I then called White back again, and he went into the parlour—I said, "I see you know that person who wants credit in the shop, what do you know of him?"—he said he was a very respectable young man—White then went away, and I went into the shop—the prisoner said, "Good God, is not that old White?"—I said yes, his name was White—the prisoner said it was strange that they should happen to meet there, for he had not seen him before for four years—he said, "No one would take him to be a rich man to look at him, would they? he is one of the richest men in London; he has houses all over London"—the prisoner asked for credit, and referred me to a man named Wilkin, living in Provost-street, City-road—he said he him<lb></lb>self lived at Fulham, that he was in some other line of business, and he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184406100154"></xptr>
               <p>going to open a grocer's shop for his wife to attend to—he then left, and I went to Wilkin's house, but he was out—I then wrote to the prisoner saying I was not satisfied with the reference, and I declined the order—I did not sup<lb></lb>ply him with the goods—on the following day White called again, and I asked what he knew of the prisoner—he said he had not seen him for four years, but he had formerly been a tenant of his, and his father was a clergyman in Wales—I told him the prisoner had ordered goods of me, and that he was going to open a grocer's shop at Fulham—White said he hoped he would be a good customer to me—I said I was not going to serve him, I was not satisfied with his reference—he said, "Poor fellow, it is a pity he should go to ruin for such a trifle as that," asking me at the same time what was the amount of the goods Atkins had ordered—I told him between 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Knowing his father and family so well so many years I will be answerable for him to the amount of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said if I would draw up a guarantee he would call in a day or two and sign it—this hap<lb></lb>pened on a Thursday in the middle of March—I then wrote this letter to Atkins—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>/)—"Sir, Since you were here this morning I have seen Mr. White, his reference, together with Mr. Wilkin's, is to me quite satisfactory. I shall therefore be happy to do business with you, if you please, on the usual terms; one month's credit; an answer will oblige. Your obedient ser<lb></lb>vant, <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD DEAR. TO</hi> Mr. Atkins.") Atkins called the next day and said he had a cart outside, and he would take the goods to save me the trouble of sending them—I said they were not ready, and I would send them—White came to me again the same day—(there had been no appointment for him to come, but he was a frequent visitor about that time)—he said he had re<lb></lb>ceived an order from his sister in Westmoreland for some tea and grocery—he gave me the order, which amounted to about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he received such an order about every half-year to send to his sister, and he promised to favour me with his custom—he first said he would take the goods with him in a cab to the railway, and then he said, "Let them be strongly packed, and send them to Kemp's, in Albany-street. I am going to send some fish, and they can go together"—I sent that order which amounted to between 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—White came again the same day and gave me another order for goods to be sent to his own house in Queen-street—I went with my man with the last order to Queen-street and saw the goods delivered to some female—when White had called on the Friday he said he was going to advance Kemp 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would call the next day and pay me a check for the money for his goods—I afterwards went to the house in Queen-street, found White was gone, and a man named Wilson was there in possession—there was nothing but rubbish found there—I could get no money—I went to Fulham, and could not find the prisoner there—the house was not shut up, and I do not think he was gone—I could not get any money from him or from White—I never saw the prisoner again till he was in cu<lb></lb>tody—I saw White in Old-street one night when I was in company with the inspector, and he ran away.</p>

I have not seen him before for four years"—I am positive he said that—he said White was the richest man in London; he was building houses at Dalston then, and he had houses all over London—White came again the next day—I overheard him say that he would be accountable for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Atkins, net more—I sent the goods to Fulham, by direction of my master, by the carman, William Hunt—they amounted to about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some goods were ordered for White—the first parcel was sent to Mr. Kemp's, by White's order—White returned, and ordered another parcel of goods, which were to be sent to Queen-street—he said he would get a check the following morning—Mr. Dear went with the last goods—White never called to give me a check, or the money.</p>

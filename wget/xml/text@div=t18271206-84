On the 26th of November, on coming home, I thought I missed two cheeses, but am certain that I lost one; I went to Gibson's house, and she desribed the prisoner to me; I went and took this cheese from under his smock-frock, in about ten minutes.</p>

            . I saw two men at the prosecutor's step, as I went in for some butter; I came out in a few minutes - they still stood there; they passed me in a few moments - the prisoner was one, and he had the cheese; I knew him before. Mr. Everard came to me, and I told him they had gone towards Dalston.</p>

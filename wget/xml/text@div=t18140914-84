            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Willat's, pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come and offer anything at your shop - A. Yes, on the 22nd of July, she offered a gold chain for eight shillings; she did not pawn it. I asked her who sent her; she said, her mother. I asked her whether it was gold; she said, she did not know. I found it was gold, but rather inferior gold. I sent it up stairs to my master, she was told to fetch her mother; she then said, he had no mother; her mistress sent her. She had a mistress in White Lion-street; she said she worked there. She was told to fetch her mistress; she said, she would; she went out, and came back with a person, she called aunt; her aunt then stated, that while she was at Newgate market, she broke open her fathers box and took the chain out, we returned the chain to the aunt. The prisoner's farther came to the shop the same day, and offered a silver watch, and a gold chain to it for four guineas; I examined it; it was the same chain. I bid him 3 l. on it. I stopped the watch and chain, he said, he would jump over the counter, and get it. I told him, he need not be afraid, he should have it when my master came home I stopped the watch and chain untill my master came in. I thought I knew the chain, this is the chain.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do; she said, she found the watch chain in the street; she pawned it somewhere in Whitechapple; she gave me the duplicates. I took the chain out of pawn; I afterwards took it to Phillips; I did not know the worth of it, the watch was my own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the chain underneath the window, in two bits of brown paper, I met a gentlewoman that lodged at the house where I do; she pawned the chain for twelve shillings in Whitechaple. I offered the duplicate to

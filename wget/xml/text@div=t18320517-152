             afterwards, and produced to him a sample of the same description of property, and asked him if he knew a person named Carter; he said, "What! has he been saying all about it?" or words to that effect - he then told me he had taken some of these stones, and that Mr. Couch was in want of some of the white ones but not the yellow; he said he had not any of the black ones, but the white drops and stones he had disposed of to Mr. Couch, and he had them from his brother Stephen - he gave another account of them at the Mansion-house, but that was taken down, I suppose; he then said the person said it was no object to him how he became possessed of them, but he gave him 4s. or 5s. for selling them - that he told Mr. Couch he had them from on board a ship; that he had received about 7l. for them, and had sold none at any other place.</p>
               <p>MR FRANCIS HOBLER. I am clerk to the Lord Mayor. I recollect the two prisoners being brought before the Lord Mayor on this charge on the 6th of April - they were examined, and the substance of what they said was taken down - (reads).</p>
               <p>John said, "I sold to the amount of 6l. or 7l. to him, and none to any one else," alluding to Couch, who had just spoken; he then told where he worked - and that he had been ill; Stephen said, "I took them at different times;" Mr. Cath said, "I cannot swear to any of them."</p>
               <p>I have no remembrance of the case; on the first examination Stephen only was in custody - that was on the 2nd of April; there was no statement then made; Mr. Cath said he wanted time, and the parties were remanded till the Friday following, and then that passed which I have read -Mr. Cath made a charge of having lost some agates out of his warehouse; I cannot undertake to state that I took down all that passed - it was not read over to the prisoners.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. May you have omitted something that the prisoners said? A. I cannot say that I wrote down every word but the substance; I might have omitted some things, but these words were used.</p>
               <p>MR. CATH. I was before the Lord Mayor when these men were charged with the felony; I recollect the Lord Mayor asked Stephen where he got the agates which he gave to his brother - he said he had stolen them at different times from my warehouse, (or most likely he said took them,) and given them to his brother; the question was asked of John where he got the agates from, and he replied from his brother Stephen, and he was to have a few shillings commission for selling them - John knew that Stephen was in my employ; I believe John is a wine-porter - he was not likely to be in possession of articles of this description on his own account.</p>

On Saturday night the 3d of October I had been supping in Davis-street, Berkley-square, with a wheeler; I was there about three hours, and had part of two small jugs of ale, and a glass of gin and water - I was perfectly sober. I had got about three quarters of a mile on my way home, and as I turned the <placeName id="t18241028-2-crimeloc14">corner into Westmorland-street</placeName>

               <p>"What money have you got, you b - r." he struck me in the throat: I struggled with him for the umbrella, but the handle came off, and he got the umbrella forcibly from me. I called Watch! the other ran away, and Bussey, the watchman came up - the prisoner had then got my umbrella. I gave charge of him for demanding my money, taking my umbrella, and ill-using me - he struck me four or five times in the throat. The watchman took him: he then threw the umbrella away, and said if the watchman would let him go he would walk quietly to the watch-house, and as soon as the watchman let him go he turned round and said,</p>
               <p>"This b - r wanted to give me 1 s. to ** me," he then struck me again in my throat. The watchman then took him. I am certain he is the man. I never lost sight of him - he has a wooden leg. Nothing passed except what I have stated. I made no proposition to him, nor offered him any money. I had got about 1 s. 4 1/2 d. about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in any part of the transaction propose to give him 1 s, for the purpose he stated - A. Never, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said you lived at Mayo's. at the Compasses, and that is where I first saw you - Witness. Mayo keeps the Compasses. I never saw him till I was at the corner of Westmorland-street.</p>

            . I am serjeant of the watch at St. Mary-le-bone. On the 3d of October, about a quarter past one o'clock in the morning I heard a call of watch four or five times, and ran into Westmorland-street. I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner standing together, arguing - he immediately gave charge of the prisoner for robbing him of his umbrella; I took him; he threw the umbrella away, and said he would walk quietly. I let him go - he turned round, and called the prosecutor a ** - and b - r - he had said nothing of that kind till he had asked me to let him walk alone, and had walked a hundred yards. I have seen him on my beat before, sometimes alone, and sometimes a person or two were with him.</p>

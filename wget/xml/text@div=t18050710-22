               <p>Q. You saw her? - A. I cannot say that I saw her; I missed the article, and immediately I missed it, I ran outside of the door, and asked her what she had got under her apron; she began to be rather sharp; I just lifted up the side of her apron, and there I saw this piece of black holland.</p>

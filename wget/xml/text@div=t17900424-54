I said, yes; Lyon came and spoke to her; and Brown came; and I went for some liquor: a person of the name of Armsby, who lodges in my house, said it is almost seven o'clock: Wigmore pulled a watch out, and said it was seven; I believe it was a gold one: I went out of some errands, and when I came back, Wigmore said she had lost her watch; I asked Armsby what was become of it? she said she did not know? and Lyon said, do not be afraid, mother Hanagan, here it is; and gave it me; and I went and asked advice about it: Brown and Lyon said it was stolen; I wanted to find the owner; and I went to some neighbours, and they told me where to find the owner; I did not part with it, till I found Mr. Rowles, the owner.</p>

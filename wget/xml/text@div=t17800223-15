               <p>He had the shoes in his hand? - Yes. He was running as fast as he could. I cried out stop thief! Mr. Gowin the constable stopped him and brought him back to me. He dropped the shoes before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Did you see him drop them? - No; the other man saw him drop them, and took them up.</p>
               <p>Did you see the shoes in his hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said before the Lord Mayor that he took them off the ground where my stand is.</p>

               <p>How do you know them? give the jury some reason why you know them? - I know them by the toes, and every thing; and I can shew the gentlemen whom they belonged to. (The owner's name was in the shoes.)</p>

               <p>As I was going along by this corner I saw these shoes lying on the ground between the kirb-stone and the wall, I took them up and walked away gently.

               <p>To the prosecutor. What are the shoes worth? - I must have paid seven shillings and sixpence for them.</p>

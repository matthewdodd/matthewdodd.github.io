            . I am a Police-constable. On the evening of the 5th of January I was in Crawford-street, and saw the prisoner with two others - I saw the prisoner take half a ham from the broken square of glass at Mr. Loveridge's shop, put it under his coat, and ran off with it; I pursued, and took the whole three - the prisoner had got about thirty yards from the shop; when I took him he said"I have not got the ham;" I took him and another back to the place - they are continually about there; they had turned up Hector-place.</p>

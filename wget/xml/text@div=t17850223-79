               <p>Can you say whether that was the same bag that you saw before? - No, I cannot; on Saturday morning between one and two, I sent the prisoner to the Bull, in Leadenhall-street, with one parcel, and likewise to the Swan, Whitechapel, with another parcel of garden seeds; these two parcels were delivered very faithfully, and as he was going out of the shop, I observed his coat and hat very dusty, which made me suspect he had been down at the dirt bin, and taken some of these things out.</p>
               <p>Court. Had he any business at the dustbin, as a porter? - Yes, he was a weekly servant, and did every thing in the house.</p>
               <p>Did he ever serve in the shop as servant? No, he used to fist the seeds, and clear them or any thing of the kind, he went out of the door, and I observed his pockets were filled, I sent a servant after him, who came back with him, and I saw the onion seed in his pocket, which I assisted in taking out, and there were several things brought to me, in the presence of the prisoner, which were ten bags, the prisoner brought them himself; there was some onion seeds, and some French beans, and some flower seeds.</p>

               <p>Had you any conversation with him before you went to his lodgings? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time make him any offers of favour or threaten him? - No, I came away with him. he brought several bags of seed, I asked him whose they were, and he told me they were Mr. Lewis's, I cannot say how many bags there were.</p>

               <p>These bags my wife had with peas, to pick the rotten out from the sound ones, she had sixpence a bushel, they were for my master, and these are the bags the peas were in; the seed is my property; till last Michaelmas, I was in the kitchen garden myself, and kept the market; but of late things run bad, and I was obliged to go to service.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did he ever give you this account, he has given now? - No, he had used to have pease to pick.</p>
               <p>Did he say the property was his before? - Never before.</p>
               <p>Court to Field. Did he say to you that the property was his own? - No, he confessed it was Mr. Lewis's.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him an exceeding good character.</p>

               <p>On the 7th of February, between eight and nine at night, the prisoner came to my warehouse in Chiswell-street, I <rs id="t17840225-43-viclabel239" type="occupation">sell various articles</rs>

               <p>Court. Look at the prisoner, be sure he is the man? - I am very clear of the man, he was fitted with a great coat, the price agreed for was twelve shillings; he told me he had not cash enough in his pocket to pay for it, if I would send one of my men to his house with him, he would give him the money.</p>
               <p>Did you know him at all, did he live in your neighbourhood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew his person, then? - Yes, I sent my young man with him, in order to bring the money back; I delivered the great coat to the prisoner, and I sent my young man to take the money.</p>

               <p>Was you present when the prisoner came to Mr. Bryant's warehouse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A servant.</p>
               <p>In what capacity? - In the warehouse; the prisoner came in and told my master he wanted a great coat, he was fitted with one; he put his hand in his pocket, he had not money enough to pay for it, he desired my master to let one of his men step with him for the money, the price agreed for was twelve shillings; he said he lived in Salmon and Ball Court, Bunhill-row; when he came up that court, he desired me to stop while he stepped to the public house for the key, their people were all out, he said; I did not think proper to stop, I walked after him.</p>

               <p>Court. When the coat was fitted on, who carried it? - He carried it under his arm, he went into the public house at one door, and out at another.</p>
               <p>You did not follow him in? - No, I saw him about a week after, the great coat was found at the pawnbroker's, I was to bring back the money.</p>
               <p>Did any thing more pass about the payment? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. Was you present at the time that the prisoner bargained for the coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Tell us the agreement as near as you can recollect? - As near as I can recollect, my master said twelve shillings was the price of the coat, and he agreed to give twelve shillings for it; and my master solded it up.</p>
               <p>Did he put his hand into his pocket? - He did, and said he had not money enough to pay for it, but if my master would let one of his men step with it, he would send the money back.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he offer to pay any part of the money? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you the coat here? - It has been brought to Hicks's Hall.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You will be under the necessity, in this case, of acquitting the prisoner on a point of law, because it turns out on the evidence of the two first witnesses, that the man came in for this great coat, was fitted with it, and that the prosecutor gave the possession of this coat to the prisoner; the prisoner took it away and not the servant, the prisoner promising to pay for it; the prosecutor gave the prisoner compleatly in law a possession of the great coat, upon the usual promise of paying for it; however, being once in legal possession of it, though he did not pay for it, there is a legal remedy which must be against the prisoner by action, but certainly this indictment cannot be maintained on account of the property being vested in the prisoner by that bargain, and there being no property in the prosecutor: you will therefore be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250120"></xptr> under the necessity of acquitting the prisoner.</p>

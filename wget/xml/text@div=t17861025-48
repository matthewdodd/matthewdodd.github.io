               <p>How came you there at that time of night? - I had been at Brentford the day before, and I came to North-hall and then to Pinner, and then to Harrow; the people at the Swan told me their bed was taken up, and they could not accommodate me with a bed, but thought I could get a bed at the Black Horse, a house about half a mile distance; the two prisoners sat drinking in the room, I called for something to drink; I believe I might be in the house half an hour or three quarters; Rudd told me he was going that way, and he would shew me where the Black Horse was, as I was a stranger; accordingly he went out with me for that purpose, and I had not walked with him but a little way, but a few minutes, before I received a blow which deprived me of my senses, nobody was with me then but Rudd to the best of my knowledge; when I came to my senses I found my hands tied behind me, and my legs tied together, then I perceived Giggs on my left hand and Rudd on my right; they beat me very much, beyond what I am capable of saying, they beat me several times, I believe it might be ten minutes before I was robbed, or some such distance of time, I cannot be exact; Giggs unbuttoned the waistband of my breeches, and took my purse out of my right hand pocket, my penknife out of my left hand waistcoat pocket; there was six pounds odd shillings in my purse, as near as I can recollect it was six pounds five shillings.</p>
               <p>In what money? - In gold and silver.</p>
               <p>How many guineas? - I cannot be exact, there were some guineas, some half guineas, some shillings, and some half-crowns.</p>
               <p>What sort of a purse was it? - A silk purse with some orange in it, and the inside of it at one end is lined with some linen; they took some papers out of my left hand pocket, giving an account of the price of pins, my pocket-book was also<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250103"></xptr> taken out, my shoes were taken off, and my hat, stock, and stock-buckle.</p>
               <p>What happened then, Sir? - Nothing but beating, that I can recollect particularly.</p>
               <p>What did they continue beating you after they had robbed you? - Yes, it appeared to me to be a club; one of the sticks that they beat me with I have great reason to believe was the stick I walked with.</p>
               <p>Was you struck with more sticks than one? - I received their blows with a stick with a club at the end, which seemed like the stick I walked with; Giggs was on my left hand when he beat me with the stick; I do not know what Rudd struck me with, but he struck me several times; I remained in this situation till one of them went away, that was Rudd, the other continued beating me till the landlord and landlady from the Swan came to my relief, then Giggs was standing by me; the landlord unbound me and conducted me to their house, where I staid all night; when they came up Giggs was close to me.</p>
               <p>Did he stay there? - A very little time; the landlord and he had some conversation, then he went away.</p>
               <p>Did Giggs go away before yo u was unbound or after? - I believe he did, I will not be particular.</p>
               <p>Did the landlord speak to you before he unbound you? - I cannot say; I spoke to him, I asked him whether they were people of that place; he said, yes; I begged of him for God's sake to unbind me, they unbound me and conducted me to their house.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any personal hurts by their beating? - Very bad, my Lord, so that nobody could suppose that I could survive it, in my head, my shoulders, my arms, my eyes, I am under the surgeon's hands now.</p>
               <p>Was you sober or in liquor? - I was sober at the time; I do business at North-hall, and at Harrow, and at Pinner; I could not get a lodging at Harrow, I called at one house there, Mr. Foster's: after he had taken my knife and unbuttoned my breeches, he cut off a part of the waistband, and cut off my pocket; and just as he had cut of part off my breeches, he took hold of my private parts with the knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>What, as if threatening to wound you? - I expected it, but I received no wound there.</p>
               <p>Which of them did that? - Giggs; I have my breeches and my shirt in Court.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing at the time they did that? - They had a great deal of conversation, but I was so beat about the head I cannot recollect the discourse.</p>
               <p>Did they give any reason for that? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you and Rudd go out of the public road? - No, this was on the turnpike road, or on the grass adjoining to the turnpike road.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Mr. Turner, where did you say you lived? - In Bishopsgate-within.</p>
               <p>Are you married or a single man? - Married.</p>
               <p>Your wife lives there? - Yes, in Clark's Court, Bishopsgate-within; I keep goods there sometimes; I have part of a house.</p>

               <p>Have you lived in London long? - About two years.</p>
               <p>Did you ever keep house in London or a shop? - Never.</p>
               <p>How long had you been from home when this accident happened? - I went out of town on Wednesday about four.</p>
               <p>Where might you lay on Wednesday night? - At the Red Lion at Brentford; I was at North-hall, three miles from Pinner, I walked from Brentford to North-hall, from thence to Pinner, and thence to Harrow, and from thence to the place where this happened; I was very sober, I had not been drinking at all.</p>
               <p>How many miles do you take it to be? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250104"></xptr>Is it two or twelve? - It is not twelve.</p>
               <p>Is it five? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Is it three? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it four? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave Brentford? - In the morning between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Where did you dine? - At a village between Brentford and North-hall; I do not know the name of it, it is near a common near the main road.</p>
               <p>How many miles from Brentford? - I do not know, I never was that way but once before; I believe it is three or four miles; I had no business there, I dined there.</p>
               <p>What time did you get there? - I do not recollect, it might be between eleven and twelve, or some such time that I dined, I bought half a pound of sausages at Brentford.</p>
               <p>What time did you arrive at the Swan at Subury Green? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Had you ever been at Sudbury Green in your life before? - Once before.</p>
               <p>At the Swan ever? - I called there once; I do not know the sign at Harrow where I applied for a lodging, it is kept by one Foster; I suppose it was a little six, it was a very clear evening.</p>
               <p>Closing in by that time I should think? - It was clear enough for me to see any body.</p>
               <p>That was not the object of my question; you asked no where else but chose to walk on to Sudbury Green? - I went out with the prisoner Rudd.</p>
               <p>You had a stick? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did you carry it, under your coat? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any conversation of this sort, that if he would go with you and be your mate, you would give him nine shillings? - No such thing.</p>
               <p>You told my Lord that when the landlord and landlady came to you that Giggs was there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you instantly say to the landlord, for God's sake secure that villain, he has been murdering me almost? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Who fetched the landlord and landlady? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not Rudd fetch them, and do not you know it? - I did not see Rudd there the next morning; he was gone long enough to fetch the landlord and landlady.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect striking Rudd at all? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not? - Swear, I did not if I had not a moment to live; I swear that positively, not at all.</p>
               <p>Now you describe the cutting of your clothes, and another act which you described; what conversation passed previous to that? - There was a conversation between them, but I cannot recollect what it was.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect what Rudd said to Giggs about you before that? - No, I did not; I heard them converse together; I must hear them speak, but I cannot recollect what they said, I was very much intimidated.</p>
               <p>How long had you been drinking with them? - I did not drink with them; I asked the landlord if he knew these two men, for I did not like the looks of them; he told me they were neighbours which he had known many years; I thought myself very safe as they were very well known in the neighbourhood; he did not recommend them.</p>
               <p>It was perfectly well known in the house that Rudd was gone out with you? - Rudd desired Giggs to leave me; Giggs replied with an oath he would not.</p>
               <p>What expression was used? - He said let us leave him.</p>
               <p>What was said besides? - It was let us leave him.</p>
               <p>Upon that he went away, and Giggs staid there doing nothing till the landlord came? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you cry out at all? - I did not cry out much; I said, for God's-sake do not murder me.</p>
               <p>How far had you got from the house? - Some little distance, it might be two or three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250105"></xptr>Did not it occur to you that it was right to call out for assistance? - It did not, he had left off beating me when the landlord came.</p>
               <p>Did either of the prisoners go back with you in the course of the evening? - Not that I heard of; I saw them the next morning in the parlour, in the custody of the constable; I was not at their apprehending.</p>

               <p>This Black-horse is in the road from your house to Harrow? - It is the next public house; it was above half a mile.</p>
               <p>Had you lighted candles before Mr. Turner came in this evening? - Yes, we had; it was got dark; I found him two hundred yards from our house.</p>

               <p>Did he tell you how he had secured this footpad, or where he had left him? - No, he told me that Giggs was with him, that he was just by.</p>
               <p>What stick had Giggs in his hand? - I cannot say; I observed a walking stick in the hands of Turner when he came in, I never saw either Giggs or Rudd with a stick.</p>
               <p>You knew that Rudd was going with this gentleman to shew him the way? - Yes, they went together.</p>
               <p>Were they all sober? - They were chearful, merry.</p>
               <p>These two prisoners had been from their work some time? - I do not know, I was not at home when they came in; Mr. Turner was very sensible; he was not disguised in liquor at all.</p>

               <p>You knew these two men very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you known them? - Ten or eleven years; Giggs has lived in our place all the time; I believe they were farmers men.</p>
               <p>What became of the pocket book? - My wife gave it to Rudd, and the shoes, to take back to the gentleman; when we came back, I found the shoes; they were laying by the side of the road by him.</p>
               <p>Where was this pocket book that was found? - Near to him, just by him, there was his buckle likewise.</p>

               <p>Did any body point out any thing to you, before you untied him? - No, Sir; his hands were behind him, and I untied him.</p>

               <p>When you came up to them, what did you find? - I found Giggs standing by Turner, with a stick in his hand.</p>

I saw something lay on the ground white; I thought it was his handkerchief, but it was his stock, which was tore off his neck, and the stock-buckle was in the ditch, and his hat, and his pocket-book were there; Giggs was there, and he went away, and said he would come in the morning, and bring the club stick with him that Turner had, and then he would come and clear that point up, and he went towards home; Giggs said he found it under Turner's coat; then we brought Turner home, and sent for a woman to wash him, and sit up with him all night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Turner never spoke till after the conversation with Giggs? - No.</p>
               <p>Giggs produced the club? - It was a knotty stick; it did not appear to be like a club; it was two foot long, and a knot at the end of it; I do not know whose it was.</p>
               <p>Did Rudd desire you to look to see if there were any bank notes in this pocketbook, or any thing of that kind? - No, Sir, only to see where the gentleman lived.</p>
               <p>How long have you known these young men? - Above a twelvemonth; I thought Turner as safe with them, as if he was in my house.</p>

               <p>I formerly lived at Harrow, and have a house there now; it is in dispute; I have more knowledge of Giggs than the other, he kept a public house at Harrow, and I have frequently seen him; they were both quiet good sort of men: if they had been tried yesterday, there were twelve or fourteen capital inhabitants to give them characters which was well known.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This man has been extremely ill used and abused; and has met with very violent and outrageous treatment, under circumstances as extraordinary as ever came before a Court of Justice; and I wonder the prisoners have not given any account of this behaviour of theirs; nothing can be more clear, than that they have taken from this man his purse, and these different articles; and his story unexplained, would certainly constitute the crime of robbery; and were it not that there are two or three extraordinary features in the case, I should state it to you, as being clearly against the prisoners; but there are two or three extraordinary features in the case that puzzle me, and leave my mind in some degree of uncertainty, as to what was the object of these two people; for supposing it to be a concerted plan to rob this man; this conduct was so extraordinary, that it seems almost impossible that men should have acted as they did: for you find that after having tied this man hand and foot, beating him, and abusing him, and taking from him all these things, instead of going off with the money, and endeavouring to conceal what they had done; the first step they took, was such a one as must lead to a discovery; they came back to the house, and gave notice, that within two hundred yards of the place they had taken a footpad; when the landlord remonstrated with him about the improbability of this man's being a footpad; he went and carried the things back, and it seems by the evidence of Turner, as if Rudd had done more, and advised Giggs to go away; it is equally extraordinary that when the landlord and his wife came up, Giggs should stay there to be present, to give them an opportunity of seeing him there, and consequently of convicting him. I do not find that there was any reasonable ground for taking the prosecutor for a footpad.</p>

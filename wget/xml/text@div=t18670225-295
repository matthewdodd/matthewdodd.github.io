                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I have been in England ten months the last time—I was an officer of the <hi rend="italic">gens d'armes du Papa at</hi> Rome—I have known Ciocci four months, but I used to know him pre<lb></lb>viously—I never knew him abroad—I never had any relations with him till four months before this affair—I met him in Tottenham Court Road—I was then in queer circumstances—I told him I had no occupation, and he said it would be a very difficult thing for me to find a situation in England, not knowing the English language—he gave me his address, 7, Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road—we did not go anywhere then, but the day afterwards we went to a public-house, and he said that there would be a thing to do in the house of an Italian gentleman, and there would be found several precious stones and cameos—he gave me the address on a piece of paper, which I cannot find—it was "M. Votieri, 24, Upper Park Street," and also the address of M. Soldi, somewhere in the Blackfriars Road, which I have forgotten—he told me that I might do the thing, and that I should take myself out of the position in which I was then—he said I was to enter the house, knock at the door, and ask for M. Votieri; and if the answer was that he was not at home we were to ask to be permitted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250032"></xptr>
               <p>o write a message, and after we were in we were to tie the servant, and on; of the others was to open the door, for the third person, who was outside, in go up stairs, and that up stairs, in the back room, was the studio of M. Votieri, where we should find the cameos, and all the utensils and tools after that we were to go into the front room, M. Votieri's bedroom, and under the bed was a trunk, inside of which we should find some jewellery, and that if we searched the books we should find some bank notes of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and then we were to go into the room on the third floor, occupied by the daughter of M. Votieri, and take all the small jewellery belonging to her—I told him it was a thing I could not undertake to do by myself, and he said that I was to try to find some audacious or courageous person; he pointed out a person named Leoni, but said that I was not to employ him, as he was known to the police—I said that I did not know where to find, one, and during a month we used to meet very often, and he used to ask me whether I had found anybody who would undertake it—some time afterwards I was going up Charles Street, and saw a small shop, at the door of which were Galioni and Rossi talking together in Italian, I believe—Rossi is a barber, and Galioni a shoemaker—I went in when Rossi left, had my shoes cleaned, and told Galioni I was an Italian from Rome—he knew nothing then—I afterwards saw Ciocci, and mentioned that I had had a conversation with Galioni—he told me that Galioni would be a good man for undertaking the business—I told Galioni that I remem<lb></lb>bered his name when I was in the <hi rend="italic">gens d'armes</hi>—I ascertained that he had been in prison, and mentioned that to Ciocci, who said that he was the man who should do for him—Ciocci went to Galioni's and spoke to him; I saw him there the day after—he told me that he took Galioni a pair of boots, but I saw nothing—I cannot say how long he remained at Galioni's, as I went out—I went to Galioni's the same evening, and saw Ciocci there, and after that he used to go there now and then, and then he used to meet at Barriloni's, in Brook's Market, Leather Lane, a very short distance off—I first saw Decola at Galioni's house; that might be two or three days after I saw Galioni—he was there when Ciocci went, and Galioni spoke to him—they continued meeting in that way till the last day of the busi<lb></lb>ness—the first time I met Galioni was three months before the robbery—his wife, I believe, lived with him; I only know her Christian name, Martha—she has been present when we were all four there—I have seen Rossi, the barber, at Galioni's door—on the day of the robbery Decola, Galioni, Ciocci, the wife, and myself were there, and I believe the wife went and borrowed a saucepan to cook some maccaroni—after eating it we talked about the robbery; it was first said that we were to ascertain whether M. Votieri was out, and if he was out Ciocci said we were to ask to be allowed to write a message to him—I was to be the person to knock at the door—Decola was to go in with me, and Galioni was to remain outside—we agreed not to see each other for four days after the robbery—we hod agreed the day before, at the public-house, that the time to commit the robbery was about half-past five or six in the evening—I had been to Barriloni's that day, before I went to the public-house—on the same day Decola went to fetch a bag to put the things in; Galioni was to take it to Park Street—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sort of bag—when we had made these arrangements I started by myself and Decola to Isling<lb></lb>ton, to Upper Park Street, and we watched till M. Votieri and the family came out of the house, at about half-past six, and after they came out Galioni arrived, and after that we knocked at the door—a boy answered it and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250033"></xptr>
               <p>was asked him whether M. Votieri was in; the answer was, "No;" Decola said that he was desirous of writing a message, and the boy admitted us into the saloon; he was then gagged, I opened the door, and Galioni came In and went up stairs—I threw a stone down and made a signal to the police, who came and took Decola and Galioni on the premises—when Galioni came in I went outside the house and held the door—this was on Wednesday—I had communicated with M. Votieri the Saturday before; that was the first time I had given any information to him or to the police—I again communicated to M. Votieri the day for which the robbery was agreed upon, and was aware when I went there that I should find the police on the premises—I knew that M. Votieri was going out that night, and Ciocci knew it also—I have seen Rossi at Barriloni's when I have been there, he was there the night before the robbery—I do not remember whether Martha came to Barriloni's that evening, but she has eome to fetch Galioni at times when we have all been together.</p>

Votieri on the Saturday before that there was a conspiracy concocted to rob the house—I told him that he had a great enemy—he told me that it could only be Bendi or Ciocci, and then I said that it was Ciocci—he said that it was not marvel<lb></lb>lous for him to do this, as he had committed other misdeeds—he did not say that he should be very glad to punish Ciocci—he told me be should be very glad if he could have him taken by the police—he made no arrange<lb></lb>ments for that purpose—it was not by nis desire that I went on with the robbery, but he knew it because we used to watch nearly every night—he told me to acquaint him in case the robbery should be committed—I had known Rossi some time, and also Galioni—I deny that it was stolen from Victoria Station; I had it from a man named Brentini, who is in London—the first time I heard of it being stolen was at Clerkenwell Police-court—I did not take it to Rossi's—I did not sell some shirts or any of the things to Rossi, or to Decola—I do not Know the contents of it, because when I had it it was empty—I am acquainted with these little documents (<hi rend="italic">four bills</hi>)—they went through my hands—I cannot say that they are forged—I have been examined before—I stated that Rotini gave them to me—I found out fifteen days afterwards that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250034"></xptr>
               <p>they were forgeries—I did not after that obtain money on them; it was a loan—I did not leave them as security—Jacomeli gave me some money, and I left the bills with him one evening because I was a little inebri<lb></lb>ated—he gave me the money before I left the bills—I cannot say the date that I left them—I did not know they were false, but I had some suspicion that there was something, otherwise he would not haye left them with me—I had the money before that—I left them after this little suspicion entered my mind—there is none of my writing on the back of these bills—I do not know, this "Saffi"—it is an imitation of my writ<lb></lb>ing—this is one of the papers that I left at Jacomeli's—this writing was on it at the time—I did not represent to Jacomeli that I was Count de Saffi's nephew—I do not know a Count de Saffi, and have not been to his house—I have been to Signor Saffi's—I did not represent myself to be Signor Saffi's nephew, or that that was the endorsement of Signor Saffi—I never said anything—I did not represent that Signor Saffi had given me documents payable to his order—to tell you the truth, I cannot say exactly that there was all this writing on it at the time I left it it Jacomeli's—this country credit was also among the documents I handed over to the gentleman from whom I had the money—I obtained it from Rotini, for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable by the Union Bank of London—these are papers that are worth nothing—I found that it was valueless when I went to the Union Bank, and saw plenty of similar papers on the ground—I never got any money on this.</p>

You must come your<lb></lb>self. This person writing to you would like to help your husband."—I did not tell her to write the last words, "to help your husband"—I cannot read English—the girl might have misunderstood me, and might have written them—I told her to add, "My respects send by bearer"—she is an Englishwoman—I did my best to make myself understood—we were together some time, and we spoke to each other every day in my house—she visits me, but not now, because she is ill—she has been living with me two or three weeks in her own place—after this letter was written I sent it by a man to Covent Garden—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to carry it—I do not know his name—I found him near Newport Market, at the corner—he was one of those shoeblacks who speak Italian—I sent it the day after or a day or two after Ciocci was examined at the police-court—he came out on bail—I do not know of any person going on the part of Votieri to visit Galioni in Newgate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprenticed to M. Votieri, and live at 2, Pleasant Place, Essex Road, Islington—on 23rd January my master went out at a quarter-past six with my mistress and the little boy—I was left in charge of the house, and the police were down stairs—there was a knock at the door at about half-past six, I opened it, and saw the prisoner Decola and D'Angelio—they asked whether M. Votieri was in, and I said, "No"—I let them into the parlour, and got a pen and ink, as Decola said he wanted to write a message—Decola then took me and sat me down in a chair, and then I saw Galioni pass the parlour door with a bag in his hand—D'Angelio had then gone out—Galioni went up stairs—I saw the police strike Decola because he tried to get away—they took them in custody—my arms had been tied, but Dutton loosed me—after the other prisonen were taken to the station I opened the door and saw a horse and cart there, and Ciocci walking along past the door about two yards from me, he asked me what was the matter—it was then about five minutes past seven—I described him to the police.</p>

Votieri's house on 23rd January with Newbold and Barret; we went to the back of the house and got over the wall; after waiting some time we received a signal, on which I went up from the kitchen and took Galioni in custody—I saw Morgan tied in a chair with his mouth and hands tied—on the same evening I received a description from Morgan, in consequence of which I took him to Beak Street, Regent Street, and apprehended Ciocci—I told him it was for being concerned with two others in breaking and entering M. Votieri's dwellinghouse, and asked him if he knew two men, one named Decola and the other Galioni—he said, "No, I don't know them"—I said, "Were not you in Hatton Garden yesterday?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Not at 3, Charles Street, Hatton Garden?"—he said, "Oh! yes, I do remember; I only know him by the name of Antonio; I went there to have my boots cleaned."</p>

I said, "Yee"—there was never a trunk there, only this bag—D'Angelio never brought a trunk there; I am out sometimes, but I never saw one there—I did not see a trunk go from our house to Rossi's—I did not see Galioni take a trunk away.</p>

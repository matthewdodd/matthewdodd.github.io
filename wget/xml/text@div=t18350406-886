                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Woodford, in the parish of Woodford, Essex. On Thursday, the 12th of March, I went to bed at eleven o'clock—I went to bed before my footman—I was called up at three o'clock in the morning by my daughter—I proceeded to her room, and then down stairs into the hall—on the mat of the dining room door I found a pair of shoes with dry dirt on them, and small coal dust on the soles—I found in the dining-room a hat which had been taken off a peg in the hall, and two odd boots, which had been in the dressing-room adjoining my daugh<lb></lb>ter's room—the fellow boots were gone—the dining-room window was open, and the blind drawn down in a particular twist—the window was forced open from the inside—I went into the passage leading from the hall to the kitchen, and missed four coats and a silver sugar-ladle—nine shirts were packed up in a handkerchief, and left at the door of my daughter's bed-room—I missed a lancet-case and a case of instruments—I examined outside the house under the dining-room window directly, (at three o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing,) with a candle, and found the mark of a foot without a shoe—I could trace the toes distinctly—I examined the coal-cellar door—the bolt was shot but the staple was forced open—I am in the habit of having my gate left open, that was always usual—in consequence of information from the police, I went to the station-house, and found the prisoner and my property which I had missed—I took the shoes with me to the station-house, and showed them to the prisoner—I asked if the shoes belonged to him—he said "No," and when he was brought to town I said, it was a pity to let him walk without shoes, he had better have them—he then put them on, and said they were his—I had not told him he had better confess—I did not myself hear him say they were his shoes—I now recognise the prisoner as having been in my service seven or eight years ago, as footman.</p>

On the 12th of March I was the last that went to bed—I fastened the doors and windows—I went into the dining-room and fastened those windows—I bolted the coal-cellar door—that is in the under part of the house—I recollect being called up that night by master—I went into the dining-room with him, and found it in the state he has described—I went to the coal-cellar door—I found the bolt forced, and the door open—I examined the door-post inside—I observed a small mark on it, as if something was driven in on one tide, from the inside—I had seen the silver sugar-ladle safe that night, and placed it in the pantry—I afterwards saw it again—I missed a coat of my own—the kitchen door was fastened when I went to bed—in the morning I found the parlour window open, and the parlour door—to get out of the house, the person must have got out of the window—there were several doors open, but no outer door.</p>

                  </hi>. On 26th March I was with a friend at a house in Southwark—I went there about eight o'clock id the evening, and left about a quarter before twelve—I was sober—at the corner of York-street, my friend asked me the time—I took out my watch—the prisoner and another stood at the corner, and could see distinctly what I was doing—I crossed the road, and proceeded about 100 yards—the prisoner came in front of me—the accosted me, and wished me to go home with her, which I refused—I then proceeded on as far as the corner—the prisoner followed me, and caught me round the neck—a man was in the road, not above a yard or two from me—she noticed him, and let go of me—I went on as far as Maze-pond—I tuned down there; and when I got opposite an alley, I saw the prisoner and another female—the prisoner came, and caught bold of me, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me against the shutters—I then felt a pressure by my right side, and heard a snap, which I thought was my watch-glass broken—I felt a snatch, and the prisoner ran away before I could recover myself—I instantly missed my watch, and was going to run after her, when another woman caught hold of me, and said if I went on she would <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> my bead—the prisoner got away—I had seen her three times—she stood in front of me each time—I am positive she is the woman.</p>

I was sweeping the road at Thomas-street, opposite New-street—I never saw the prisoner before that night, but she is the woman I saw speaking to the prosecutor—it was on a Tuesday, I believe—I recog<lb></lb>nised her the first time I saw her at the police-station—when I first saw her she had her arm round his neck—I saw her once in the middle of Thomas-street, and once in the crossing where she left him.</p>

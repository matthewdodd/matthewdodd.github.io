On the 15th of April, at half-past 4 o'clock in the morning, the officer called me up and I missed these pantiles from my yard.

            . I am a patrol. On the morning of the 15th of April, at four o'clock, I saw the prisoner at Enfield-highway, with a sack on his back, with fourteen pantiles in it - I asked where he got them - he said out of a brook. I said they were quite dry - he then said he bought them of one Scagg. I asked where - he said he did not know - he had never seen him before. I went into the next premises to his, and found twenty-four more.</p>

On Saturday night I met a man in a cart who said he had fourteen pantiles for me - I told him to put them down by the side of the brook, which he did, as I had my child with me. I forgot to fetch them until early next morning. Mr. Swain, my neighbour, had his tiles blown off, and I had the twenty-four to cover over his privy. I told the men' they were there - they had been there for two months before.</p>

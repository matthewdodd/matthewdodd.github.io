                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What do you deal in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In silver, and clothes generally, with officers of the garrison—they sell their clothes to me—it was on the 16th the prisoner came, between seven and eight o'clock—sometimes we have a good many persons coming in, and sometimes none at all for hours—we have not many sailors come—it is quite out of the way for them—my shop is towards the barracks—I suppose I have no trowsers at all like these—I had never seen the prisoner before the 16th—it was on Tuesday the 19th that the policeman came to my shop to ask about these things—he did not search my premises—I was not in at all—I was called to Major Elgin's, and my boy was hanging up the things—these were before the door, and they came and took the things—as I was coming home I met the policeman and my boy going with these things—I heard that these had been stolen—I saw the prisoner before the Magistrate on the following Monday—no one came with the prisoner when he sold them—my boy, Barnard, was by when he did come—my boy has been with me about five months—I have a gas-light in the shop—we had just opened the shop—we close on Friday night and open on Saturday night—the prisoner bringing things that did belong to him I had no suspicion—if he had brought a watch or gold lace I should have said, "Sailors do not belong to gold lace"—the Magistrate asked me what dress the man had who brought the things—I said it was something of a lightish jacket and light trowsers, something like canvass—I said to him, "Why do you sell your trowsers, you wear a pair of light trowsers, these will be handy for you"—he said, "I am rather out of employment, and am short, but I shall soon get in a Government vessel"—the officer sent a note for me to go before the Magistrate—I had noticed one of the prisoner's cheeks appeared rather higher than the other, as if it were swollen—I did not describe him as having dark whiskers—I did not have any further conversation with the prisoner—I said to him, "Clothes are very cheap, I cannot give you I the price you want"—he said he bought them at Portsmouth.</p>

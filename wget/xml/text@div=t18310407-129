             lives in the house - on Saturday night (I believe, the 5th of March,) there came a knock at the door; I heard my father open it, and the prisoner asked if Mr. Smith was at home - my father said he believed not, but the prisoner came in, and I lighted him up stairs; he had a portmantean in his hand, and he asked Mrs. Smith to let him leave it for one hour - she said he might leave it for an hour, but he must fetch it away then, as she went to bed very early; I had seen the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SULLIVAN. I am a Police-constable. On Friday, the 11th of March, I went to the house, and found this portmanteau under the bed.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BAIRNES. I took the prisoner on the 16th of March; he asked me if I knew where Smith was - I said Yes, he was in custody, and had had one hearing, because the property had been found at his house; I had been after the prisoner for five days.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard there were two officers looking after me, and I went to the Red House; I told them I could be taken there at any time, but they took me at the Star and Garter.</p>

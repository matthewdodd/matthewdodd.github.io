                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Albany-cottages, Westend-lane, Kilburn. On the morning of the 7th of May I was spoken to, and went to the station—I there saw a deal plank, which was the property of Thomas Hill Mortimer—it had been taken from outside a hoard where there was repairs going on—I saw it safe on the evening of the 5th of May—it is eighteen feet long.</p>

On the morning of the 7th of May, I saw the prisoner in Mortimer-market, where they are repairing a building, with a plank on his shoulder—I asked where he was going to take it—he said to a ladder-maker's in the New-road—I asked where he got it—he said from Mr. Hyde, a carpenter, in Mortimer-market, it was all right, he bought it for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said he should go back with me to the carpenter where he bought it—he said no, he would not, it was all right—he offered me some halfpence, and said, "Here, you can get yourself something to drink; I have been out with him all day; I am going to take it home"—I told him he should go back—we went back, and saw the person named Hyatt—I asked if he had sold him a plank—he said he should not answer that ques<lb></lb>tion—I then called another constable, and gave him and the prisoner into custody.</p>

            . At five in the Evening, I locked my Stair Foot Door (but not the Street Door) and went over the way. I returned about six, and found my Stair Foot Door open, and a Gown upon the Stairs. Coming into my Room I mist my Goods, and found a Man's Hat upon the Floor. I was informed that Sarah Miller (who buys and sells in Rag Fair) had pawned such Goods as I had lost. I met with her, and she told me she had them from Belmosset, and Sears. I found some of them pawned at Mr. Martins, against White Chappel Church. Some she sold to the Prisoner Weston. The Constable went with a Warrant to search for the rest, at the three Blue Balls in Mansell Street in Goodman's Fields, but the Pawn-broker would not let him search.</p>

On the 12th of April I went to see a friend at Charing-cross, and stopped till 12 o'clock at night, and made my way as far as White Hart-street. I met a woman, who took me to Bradfield's house, <placeName id="t18210411-199-crimeloc1224">White Hart-yard, Drury-lane</placeName>

She demanded the bed and said it was hers, and she wanted to lay down. I said I was rather heavy, and had been drinking and wished to lay longer, and that I had paid for my lodging, but did not object to her laying down; she laid down in her clothes, and in about an hour and a half she said she was very dry, and asked if I had any money; I gave her 3 d. and she went away, and between 10 and 11 o'clock she came up; I saw her take my coat, handkerchief, and jacket, and ran away with them - I could not pursue her. The woman of the house came up. I found my jacket at the pawnbrokers.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and took her about 3 o'clock on Friday afternoon, the 13th, I told her the charge - she denied it; she was very drunk. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110093"></xptr>took her to the watch-house with a deal of trouble. Next morning I found the jacket and handkerchief at Mr. Turner's. I have known her two years, she lived with her mother in Little Wild-street. The pawnbroker is not here.</p>
               <p>Court to CONNOR. Q. Are you married? A. No. I had no money except what paid for the lodging. I paid the woman for the lodging, and she went away. I was sober in the morning, and was obliged to stop there till night, when the landlord lent me clothes to go to Bow Street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He came up to me and said, a woman who had been with him had stolen his money and clothes; I was tipsy, and broke some panes of glass, and was taken in custody for that.</p>

I followed him to a court, and the watchman took him in my presence - I had not lost sight of him till he got into the court, when I lost sight of him for about three minutes; the watch has not been found - I had observed his person; the man I pursued was the man who was stopped - I had not seen the face of the person - I considered it was the prisoner because he ran away; the watchman said he was the person who ran up the court - I had noticed his dress and figure; I pursued the only man I saw running.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Aldersgate-street. I was at the corner of Long-lane, about half-past nine o'clock, on the 1st of November; I saw the prisoner running from Jewin-street - he saw me, and turned round into Barbican, ran up a court, and I went and took him.</p>

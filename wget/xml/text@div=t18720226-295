I am manager to Mr. Johnson, who keeps a boot-shop, at 38, Blackfriars Road—about 4 o'clock on the afternoon of 31st January, the prisoner came in for a pair of cheap boots—I fitted him with a pair at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me two bad half-crowns in payment—I said "They are both bad"—he said "I did not know they were bad; I have just received them from my employer, Mr. Sisterson, of the Southwark Bridge Road"—I said "All I require is good money for the boots"—he said "Let me look at them"—I said "No, they will not go out of my possession"—he said "l am a stranger about here; if you give me your address I will go and get good money for them"—I wrote the address of my shop, and said "Now you had better give me your address, and your employer's, whom you say you got them from"—he gave me the address of Mr. Sisterson, Southwark Bridge Road, and his own address as Bear Lane—at that time my man had sent for a policeman—he came in and asked what was the matter, and I told him he had given me two bad half-crowns—the prisoner said "I am going to get the gentleman good money for them"—the constable said "No, you are going with me first"—with that he made a run out of the shop, but my man stopped him at the door, and he was taken into custody—I gave the two half-crowns to the constable.</p>

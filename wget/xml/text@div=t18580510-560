                  </hi>. I am a detective officer. I was employed to watch Mr. Underwood's premises for some time previous to the 10th April last—on that morning, about a quarter or half-past 8 o'clock, I saw Butler come to the warehouse, from Eastcheap—he opened one of the doors and pulled the shutters down, at the same time looking up and down the street, St. Mary-at<lb></lb>Hill—hethen went into the warehouse and came back again, standing on the step of the door, and looked up and down St. Mary-at-Hill—he then went back into the interior of the warehouse, and in a few minutes brought this bottle containing gin, and pulled it just within side of the half of the door at the same time—he was standing by the side of the bottle when Wyer stepped from the opposite side of the road, took the bottle up, crossed the road, and went into the firm of Harrison and Co., distillers—about a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>after Wyer was in custody, I went to Mr. Underwood's and asked for Butler—Iascertained that he was not there—I went away, returned in half an hour, and he was not there—at a quarter before 11 o'clock I went again, and I then found him at Mr. Underwood's, in the warehouse, and requested him to go to the Seething Lane police station with me, and asked him if he had seen or knew anything of a bottle of gin—he said "No"—I took him to the station, showed him the bottle containing the gin, and asked him if he had seen that before, that morning, or if he knew anything at all about it—he said that he did not.</p>

I was with the last witness on the morning of 10th April—I have heard his evidence, and corroborate it; about half-past 8 o'clock on the Saturday morning, I saw Butler open the warehouse doors leading into St. Mary-at-Hill—he then waited at the door, looking round, and went back into the warehouse, and came forward again, and looked about, as if to see if any one was near; at the same time Wyer came over and took the bottle away—while I had charge of Wyer, Butler brought over this small hamper and basket and gave them to Wyer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

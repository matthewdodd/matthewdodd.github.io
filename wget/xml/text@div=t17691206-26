On the 18th of last Month, in the evening, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw an arm put in round the post, at the door. It took out a dish with four pounds of butter in it, I persued; the evening being dark, I lost sight of the man. I called, Stop Thief! he dropped the dish and butter in the road, and by the fall of it, I knew which course he went; I went past the dish; the prisoner was stopped at the end of Tower street. I cannot swear he is the man, only by his being running. We brought him back to the shop; going out again at the door I picked up two handkerchiefs, and carried them in; then I went to the dish; there lay three more; then I went and got a constable and search'd him, and found four more upon him, and there was another brought which he was seen to drop when he was taken, which, together, make ten. He had on a kind of blue jacket, and I thought arm, which was put in at the door, appeared to the be blue; but it was in and out very quick.</p>
               <p>Thomas Hill. On the 18th of last month, as I was coming out of Thames-street. I heard the cry, Stop thief! I made a full stop, and saw the prisoner running towards me. I saw no foul in the street but him.</p>
               <p>Q. How near you was he, when you saw him at first?</p>
               <p>Hill. Not twenty yards, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Mr. Shepherd's house?</p>
               <p>Hill. I believe it is about a hundred yards distant from the place I took the prisoner; he was running so swift, that when I catched hold of him, it brought me almost round. My brother was with me, and he directly took hold of him. We brought him back to Mr. Shepherd's house. When the constable came, he had four handkerchiefs in his right hand. There was one picked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060020"></xptr> up in Tower-street. A man there said he saw him drop it.</p>

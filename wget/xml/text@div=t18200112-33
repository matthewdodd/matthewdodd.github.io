            . I am apprentice to Mr. Phelps. On Saturday, the 18th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I was going to shut up the shop under the Change, and heard somebody getting behind the outer gate. I took a light to see who it was. The instant the prisoner saw me he ran from behind the gate, and as soon as he got into Castle-alley he called out to somebody. In a few minutes he returned and asked me if I was going to shut up the shop? I said Yes, and he bid me good night. I shut up the shop, locked the outer gates, and went home. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I have seen him at the Change before.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday morning I was sent for to the Exchange, and found the shop broken open - I told the gentleman it had not been done by a regular housebreaker. It appeared to have been done with a knife, and in a very awkward manner. I then went to the apprentice, searched him, and brought him to Mr. Wontner - he described the prisoner, and I apprehended him at a public-house in Dunk-street. He asked me what I took him for? I said I had some pencil-cases, and that the girl he was to meet at night could not meet him. I found a pencil-case and 23 s. on him; I also found an umbrella in the parlour where he had been; he said the umbrella was his sister's. He said he expected to be taken, and he would tell me all about it - I told him to say nothing about it. He said the man that was with him was to meet him that night, and that he had only 20 s. out of the property that was pawned at Greenwich. At Atkins's I found five umbrellas, the duplicates of the property, some watch-keys and seals, a knife, some silver pencil-cases, and a toothpick. I found a knife, two pencil-cases, and a toothpick at Parnell's, as she has stated.</p>

I thought then it had been a grown person, and therefore did not take much notice of it till the next morning, then I sent a person to the work-house to bring her to me that I might examine her and see if there was any ground for the charge. She appeared to be a child of ten years of age.</p>
               <p>What appearances were there upon the child? - When the child came to my house I asked her where she had been, she said her father called for her the last day of Bartholomew Fair. The doctor can say more of the appearances than I can.</p>

               <p>Did there appear to have been a recent injury? - No; by no means. I had reason to suspect she had the venereal disease upon her, and treated her accordingly. In about five or six weeks she was well. It is my opinion that she had the venereal disease.</p>
               <p>You are certain the body had been entered? - Yes; the hymen was broke, and there was an inflammation and other appearances of her having been entered.</p>
               <p>If such an injury as that had been recently committed on such a girl as that, must it not have appeared? - Yes; it had been done some time; the inflammation had subsided.</p>

               <p>Did she say that he did it while she was asleep? - She said she was asleep and that he put his hands up her coats and waked her, just as she told Mr. Noakes.</p>
               <p>To the Girl. How came you to say a boy was concerned with you? - The boy did it after my daddy did it.</p>

I had no bed in the room; a gentlewoman who is here was in the room all the time.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; I saw him the last day of Bartholomew fair at the Hand and Sheers.</p>
               <p>Who was with him? - Nobody but the people of the house; he said his daughter was gone home with the nurse; if I had come a little sooner I should have seen her.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner lodge at your house? - Yes; pretty near a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>What was his behaviour? - Very civil as far as I saw. I never saw the child.</p>
               <p>Who washed his linen? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you see any marks upon it about the time of Bartholomew fair? - I employ a washerwoman; I saw nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason to believe he had the foul disorder while he was at your house? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>When did he leave your house? - The Thursday after Bartholomew fair.</p>
               <p>Jury to the surgeon. Whether it is possible for a man who has not the foul disorder to give it to a child of that age? - It is not; there may be such appearances, where it is not really that disease. My only reason for believing it to be that disorder is its giving way to the usual medicines on that occasion.</p>
               <p>Jury to Hooton. You said the stain on her linen was very bad; what do you mean<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130047"></xptr> by that? What sort of stain was it? - It was of a white colour.</p>
               <p>Did you find any other stain on the linen before that? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you never find any blood? - No.</p>
               <p>Surgeon. The appearance she has described is usual in the venereal.</p>
               <p>If such a child's body is entered, it must be by a great deal of force and violence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Would not that occasion a great discharge of blood? - Certainly; but it was five weeks after the time that I examined her. There could be no appearance of it then.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whether the effect is the same with a child as it would be with a woman after she comes to have her proper courses? - Undoubtly so.</p>
               <p>Then there must be blood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner on the Monday of Bartholomew fair. He came to my house with his daughter about two o'clock, or rather before, and took my little boy and his own girl into the fair; he brought him back about four o'clock. When he came back, he left his girl with me till about seven o'clock in the evening; then he came, and took her home to the work-house.</p>
               <p>Did she say she had been used ill? - No; nor did I see any thing the matter with her.</p>
               <p>Did she seem flurried? - No.</p>
               <p>Jarvis. They came home to the workhouse about seven o'clock.</p>

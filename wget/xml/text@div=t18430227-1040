                  </hi>. I am captain of the <hi rend="italic">Quicksilver</hi>, which trades from Sunder<lb></lb>land to London. The prisoner had been on board one passage—his mother remained in London—he came up with me as far as Gravesend—I then paid him, and he asked leave to stop till the Christmas holidays were over with his friends in London—he afterwards made application to be taken again—I ar<lb></lb>ranged that he was to go to Sunderland, and have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the voyage, and then become apprentice to the vessel—he came on board on Saturday, the 4th of Feb., at five o'clock—I had got all my business done, and was about pre<lb></lb>paring my vessel for the voyage—I took my purse out of my pocket, and put it into the register-box—there were thirteen sovereigns and a half in one end, and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in the other—I put the register-box into a drawer in the state-room—the prisoner was in the cabin—I counted my money before I put it away—he did not see me do that—I cannot say whether he was in the cabin when I did that—as soon as I got my tea I went on deck—as soon as the pri<lb></lb>soner had done his tea I went down to balance my cash—I heard a noise on deck, and the mate said the boat was gone—I determined then to send the other lad and the prisoner to look after the boat—when I looked after the pri<lb></lb>soner he was not there—they were all on board but him—I went down, opened the box, and missed my purse—I have never seen it since—the pri<lb></lb>soner had left his hammock and all his things behind—I gave information.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nephew to one of the owners of this Vessel. I was on board on the 4th of Feb.—I was going as a passenger—I remember the prisoner's being in the cabin in the evening—I saw Captain Smith count his money—the prisoner had an opportunity of seeing that—I saw the Captain put it away—he had his tea, and went on deck—after he was gone up, the prisoner put away the tea things—while doing so he went near the cupboard—he opened the door, which prevented my seeing into the berth, and went into the sleeping berth—I could not see the drawer in which the register-box was kept, but I beard it opened—he came out again directly, and went right out of the cabin—just before this he asked me to go into the mate's bed—I told him it was too soon—he asked me to go on deck, and see the cargo stowed in the hold, but I declined it—in five minutes after he left the cabin the captain missed his money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he leave the cabin more than once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, once before—there was only one way of getting into the cabin, unless by <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> up a board—the mate's berth is not far from the captain's—it is in the same cabin—the mate was in the hold, stowing the goods—he could get into the cabin from the hold by pushing up the board—I never quarrelled with the prisoner—I only saw him that day—no one went into the cabin from the time the captain left the deck, till he came back—I was not asleep—I did not take the money.</p>

I received information on Satur<lb></lb>day night, the 4th of Feb., and went to the prisoner's mother's house—I looked for him in the neighbourhood—I saw him a fortnight after, about a quarter past twelve o'clock at night, between the Angel and his mother's house—he passed me with his mother—I turned round, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>," or something of that sort—his mother stopped—I said, "Arthur, how long have you been home from sea?"—he said, "Not long"—I said, "You must con<lb></lb>sider yourself in my custody"—he laughed—I said, "For stealing some money from the <hi rend="italic">Quicksilver</hi>, a vessel lying at the Tower"—he said, "I don't know it, I never was on board"—he had all new clothes and hat and shoes—I took him to the station, and asked how he got all these clothes—he said he had them at home—the sergeant asked if the <hi rend="italic">Quicksilver</hi> was a schooner or a barge—he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

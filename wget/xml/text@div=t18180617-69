On Wednesday the 6th of May, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I found the parlour window open, and the plate taken off the sideboard. I had been there half an hour before, the window was then shut and the plate safe-it is on the ground-floor; Mrs. Kent had been in the room after I left-the windows were not fast. I heard Mrs. Kent in the parlour, she might have opened the window without my knowing it. There is another house joins ours. I saw some dirt on the carpet, and in the room. I looked out of the window, and saw the gate open, and dirt on the window ledge, as if some person had got in at the window-it is not quite to the ground; there is a fore court to the house, I did not observe any footsteps there. I cannot say whether more than one person had been in. I missed the articles stated in the indictment; there were six table-spoons and a teapot left. I alarmed Mrs. Kent and the servants, and they gave the alarm-Blyth and Lambe went in pursuit. The prisoners were brought to the house about six o'clock. Cook brought the things back.</p>

I saw Lord Holland's groom stop Jackson as they ran - He was one of them-the other three ran off. Lord Holland's servants went in pursuit.

I went to look in the direction they had ran, and found a large silk shawl in a ditch, which had a silver wine strainer in it, broken in two, I gave it to the constable. I found nothing else.

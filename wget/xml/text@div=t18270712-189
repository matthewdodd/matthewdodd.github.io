            . The prisoner was in Mr. Borsley's employ, in a confidential situation. I went to his lodging on the 6th of July, and found these articles; I can swear to some, by their being Mr. Borsley's cutting; and the mark is on the toe, which is usual: the prisoner worked in the house, and has not done journey-work for fifteen months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Can you tell when these articles were in your shop? A. We had no satin of this colour till within the last two months; we might have some nearly like it; he was at our shop from seven o'clock in the morning till nine at night; I swear to the colour of the silk; the foreman is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were such things as these laying about the shop? A. Yes; the prisoner did not work - his duty was to attend the shop, and give out work; his wife sometimes came to the shop.</p>

            . I am a beadle. I went to the prisoner's lodging, and found the property in drawers, and in a chest, which was not locked; he said he knew nothing about them- his wife was there, but said nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I at first had work from Mr. Borsley, and every night I took work home to do from nine o'clock to twelve; if he had brought my book it would show that I had done work for him.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CARTWRIGHT. Here is his book; here are eight pairs of shoes entered, which his wife had to bind; and here are two pairs entered to be made.</p>

I went and delivered him that message, before that I went to the Ship, public-house, with them and saw the two Keylocks, Herd, and M'Bride - Skillow, Watts, and Herd went with me - a great many others were there, whom I did not know - some of them had large sticks.</p>

I saw Herd and M'Bride at the end of the steps - they called me, and asked if I told Sam about the coach.

               <p>"Do not you think it better let alone, for it will bring more trouble." All three said could they have mustered strong enough the night before they would have had him out of the watch-house.

I got out of the way, one of them struck me violently; in falling I caught hold of his coat which tore, and I received another violent blow. William Jones was the man who first struck me. I believe him to be the man. I was at Marlborough-street, and knew him - he is dressed in a different way - he had coachman's coat on, which he was desired to pull off - he had a brown coat under it, which had a rent newly sewn up, but that was not where I laid hold of it. I only heard it tear - the rip was in the back back near the button. I pointed him out from others.</p>

The female was the companion of a woman lately convicted of passing forged notes, and the regular mistress of Jones, who was convicted of a highway robbery; since which, she became a sharer in the fortunes of another hero, who was cast last Session.

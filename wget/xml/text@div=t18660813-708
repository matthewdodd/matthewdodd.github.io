                  </hi>. I am one of the detective sergeants of the City of London Police Force—I produce a search warrant granted by the Lord Mayor—about three o'clock on the 16th July I went to No. 2, New Broad Street Court—the name of "Mitchell" was over the letter-box—I knocked, but could make no one hear—the prisoner was standing outside, and I said to a person standing close to him, "Has Mr. Mitchell gone in yet?" and Mr. Mitchell said, "Do you want to see Mr. Mitchell?" I said, "Yes, I do." He said, "If you go round to Broad Street you will find him at the stables; he has just gone round there"—he afterwards admitted that he was Mitchell—I said, "We are officers, and we have a warrant to search your premises"—I read the warrant to him, and he said, "I have no such papers as are mentioned in that warrant in my office"—I said, "Well, we must go in and see"—he said, "You cannot go in; the place is locked, and the landlord has the keys"—we found it was locked—I put a boy through the window, and he let us in—when inside, Mitchell opened a cupboard, and said, "There are all my papers; these are my desks; that one over the way belongs to Mr. Marshall"—finding they were locked, I said, "We must open these desks"—he said, "I have not got the keys"—I sent for a locksmith, and had them opened—in the top drawer on the left-hand side I found these papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) marked 1, 2, and 3—Mr. Hall, from the Law Institution, was standing by me when they were taken out, and he said, "Why these are the identical papers"—I said to the prisoner, "How do you account for these papers being in your drawer?"—he said, "That is not my drawer; I know nothing about them"—I also found this draft of a letter, marked "4"—Bull found a bottle of medicine which the prisoner said he had been taking for a diseased heart—he wanted to take some of it then, but I would not let him—that bottle was in the same drawer as that in which the papers were.</p>

               <p>[The prisoner's statement before the Lord Mayor was read, as follows:—"I am here, my lord, upon a charge of stealing printed papers from the library of the Incorporated Law Society. It will be necessary to tell you that about three months since I was instructed to obtain a copy of one or more of the monster charter petitions presented to the House of Commons. After making a diligent search at the British Museum and other places I found that there had been three presented, one in the sessions of 1829, 1842, and 1848, and, knowing that those and all other original petitions had been destroyed by order of the House of Commons up to the session</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186608130062"></xptr>
               <p>1850, amounting to eleven tons in weight, being considered by the House of no value, I applied to Mr. Hansard's printing office to know whether they had any waste copies of the petitions in question. The answer was, 'No, they are out of print.' I will explain why I asked for waste copies. Public petitions, after being presented to the House, are printed in large quantities, as you see (referring to the appendices), and they are then sent to the members' residences, public offices, and distributed for the benefit of the public three times a week, to save trouble in constantly referring to the original petitions, which can be seen by the public at any time without the payment of a fee. These copies are called <hi rend="italic">Appendices to the Reports on Public Petitions</hi>, when, after they are circulated to the public, they become waste paper, and copies then may be seen in almost any butter shop in London. Three copies, of course, are kept at the British Museum, under special Act of Parliament. If the original petitions are condemned to destruc<lb></lb>tion, being worthless, of what possible value can the waste copies be? They may be seen at the end of each session sent away from the House of Commons, and other offices, in large quanties as waste paper. There is a book called <hi rend="italic">The Journals of the House</hi>, which contains a record of all its proceedings, present<lb></lb>ments of accounts, public and private petitions, deposits, &amp;c., which is con<lb></lb>sidered to be a valuable document, which book and other valuable papers it was my duty to produce before the courts of law when required—I think some years ago I was of assistance to the gentleman conducting this prose<lb></lb>cution in a trial for perjury against the late Mayor of Rye. With regard, my lord, to the missing papers in question, amongst other places I called at was the library of the Incorporated Law Society, and introduced myself to Mr. Lapworth, the librarian, not as a reporter of the House of Commons, as that gentleman erroneously stated, but as the proprietor of three parlia<lb></lb>mentary works, and told him the object of my visit, which was that I was anxious to find out when the monster charter petitions were presented, and that I wanted copies of them—Mr. Lapworth's reply was, 'If there is anything that will assist you amongst our parliamentary papers, they are at your service'—I immediately made a search and found one presented session 1839, which I took from the book, and came with it in my hand folded up to Mr. Lapworth at his desk. That gentleman said, 'Have you found what you required?' I thanked him and said, 'Yes'—on the other occasions the conversations were much the same, except the last time I called to search for Hansard's Debates for session 1842—on that occasion I left the book without telling him, as Mr. Lapworth had left the library—I think on the following day I wrote and thanked that gentleman for his courtesy, and enclosed in the letter an admission to the House of Commons—I think I called there altogether four or five times—if I had had any felonious intention of stealing any of these valueless pieces of paper I could easily have taken them from the British Museum, or have gone to the House of Commons, having access to all the offices in that establishment, and found some old copies there—I ask your lordship, is it likely that I should sacrifice my position?—I am proprietor of three parliamentary works, I hold an office in New Broad Street at a rental of 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, having, at the same time, the patronage of the Princo of Wales and many leading members of the aristocracy; also the government offices, and some of the first mercantile houses in the city of London—do you think I should sacrifice this position for a few sheets of printed paper that it would be impossible to place a value upon?—if the gentleman for the prosecution will permit me I shall have much pleasure in restoring the missing sheets four-fold—this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186608130063"></xptr>
               <p>cruel prosecution has been brought about by an anonymous letter, which I hare not seen—your lordship is, perhaps, not aware that when I was arrested all my desks, cupboards, and drawers were ransacked; all my papers were taken, both public and private, including letters from the late Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gladstone), General Knollys (Equerry to the Prince of Wales), a bill of exchange for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., an agreement for a lease of my office, which the Metropolitan Railway are about to take down for the extension to Tower Hill, and of which I estimate the value at about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and other papers that could not possibly have reference to this case—I had just finished one of my parliamentary works, and had given instructions to my printer to print 1500 copies, from the issue of which I fully expect to realise 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—another work of a similar character was in compilation, of equal value, but now, unfortunately for me, I am obliged to abandon them through this cruel persecution—if I had had the slightest felonious intention after using the papers complained of I should certainly have destroyed them, but, on the contrary, I did not attempt to disguise them—I did not hesitate to mention the circumstances to my clerks, or keep it secret from any person connected with me in my business; they were oftentimes lying carelessly with other papers in a desk, and it was quite by accident they were not there when the officers came to the place, which I should otherwise have avoided if I felt I had wilfully stolen them—all I have to say, my lord, in conclusion, is, that I beg to express my deepest contrition and regret at what has taken place, and I sincerely hope and entreat that your lordship and the court will take into its serious con<lb></lb>sideration the extreme harass of mind I have already undergone, the im<lb></lb>prisonment I have suffered, and the heavy loss I have sustained, not only in pocket, but position, and give me an opportunity of regaining that character and position by foregoing the prosecution, and granting me an acquittal".<hi rend="smallCaps">

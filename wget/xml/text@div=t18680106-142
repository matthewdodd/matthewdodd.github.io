                  </hi>. I am the wife of Patrick Wren, of 64, Robert Street, Plumstead, a labourer in the Royal Arsenal—on 24th October I was with my cousin, Thomas Whelan—he is married, and lives at 12, Alnwick Street, Plumstead—I left his house with him to go to Woolwich, which is about half a mile off—we left Woolwich between nine and ten to return, and came by Armstrong Street—I have lost the use of my right side, and took Whelan's arm—I was walking with a crutch, as I cannot get on without it—we were walking quietly in the middle of Armstrong Street and talking together, when I saw a man standing by the fence—there are houses on both sides, with a fence in front of them—when we had passed the man about twenty yards Whelan got a blow on his neck from behind, which caused him to fall forwards, and I fell with him, because I had no strength to keep up—after I was on the ground I saw the prisoner beat Whelan about the head with his hands, kneeling with both knees on his chest—I Whelan struggled to get up, but the prisoner got up first and gave Whelan a kick in the side with his boot, which caused him to fall again—I screamed "Murder"—he had taken my crutch amd thrown it away a little way, and I crept after it on my hands and knees and got it—he came a second time, and I said, "You must not kill my cousin"—he seized my crutch again; I said, "Do not take my crutch, as I am a cripple and cannot walk home"—he took it away, wheeled it round, and hit Mr. Waring about the body and head with it; it cracked and wentin two parts, on his body—I was still lying on the ground bleeding and screaming "Murder"—I saw Whelan picked up by two men—when the prisoner was kneeling on his chest Whelan said to him, "I have never offended you in my life, nor any other man, and if it is money you want, I have got none with me"—I saw the prisoner's face when he took hold of my crutch, but I did not know his name till afterwards—I have known him by sight about two years—he lives in Armstrong Street, a quarter of a mile from where I live now—I have no doubt he is the man—I was picked up by a young man—there is no pretence for saying that Whelan did anything to me—he had not got his arm round my neck, if he had I could not have stirred at all—I had not inquired of the prisoner for the way to Burridge Road, or made any inquiry of him previous to his attacking us; I know Burridge Road well, for I lived in Armstrong Street twelve months, and Burridge Road is at the top of it—I was sober, but when he took my crutch he might say that I was drunk, for I was helpless—Whelan was sober, he had no drink in my company, but he was smoking a minute before the prisoner beat him—this is my crutch, it is broken.</p>

I live at 12, Lant Street, and am a labourer in the Military Store Department—on Saturday night, 26th October, I had been out with my cousin, Mrs. Wren—as we passed through Armstrong Street I saw a man standing against the wooden paling before the houses—Mrs. Wren had hold of my left arm—after I had passed the man I got a blow at the back of my head, which knocked me forwards on my face, and stunned me for a moment; when I came to myself I saw Mrs. Wren on the ground—I got up on my knees, and the prisoner stood in front of me, struck me between the eyes, knocked me back, and rendered me insensible—when I came to myself he was leaning upon me, and had his hand be<lb></lb>tween the waistband of my trousers and my shirt—I asked him if I had ever offended him, or if he wanted to rob mo, but he said nothing—I strug<lb></lb>gled to get up, but he managed to get up first, and gave me a kick on my left side as I was getting up, and I recollect nothing more—I saw his face before he struck me the second blow, and the prisoner is the man—I had not said a word to him, nor had he to me—he had not asked me what I was doing with Mrs. Wren—there is no pretence for saying that I was walking with my arm round her neck—Mrs. Wren was quite sober, and so was I—I have been laid up in consequence of this attack, and have been spitting blood—neither of us had made any inquiry as to the way to Burridge Road, nor had I struck him in his face previous to his striking me—I hare been in Woolwich eleven years, and know Burridge Road perfectly well—I always enjoyed good health previous to this attack, but am quite weak and disabled now.</p>

The man had his arm round the woman's neck; they were having high words; the woman didn't seem willing to go. I went up to them and asked the woman what was the matter; the woman said, 'Not much; will you direct me to Burridge Road?' I directed the woman; the man turned his head on one side away from me. The woman was very drunk. I then said, 'What does this b——vagabond want to do with you?'

               <p>breast and knocked him over from the top of me. We both got up and exchanged several blows; we then closed and fell again; I got up first. The man called to the woman to give him the crutch, and he'd soon settle me. I ran to the woman and took the crutch away from her; I then threw the crutch along the street as far as I could throw it. The man was on his feet and rushed at me; we exchanged several blows, we grappled and fell in the gutter; I was uppermost, the man holding me down, under<lb></lb>neath me. We struggled some time; I then got up; the woman had the crutch in her hand again, standing close to me; she was about to hand it to the man, when I snatched it from her. I told him to stand back, or I would strike him with it; I swung the crutch in front of him several times. He persisted in following me. I then struck him several blows with it. Some one in the crowd called out, 'Here's the police; run!' I then ran away and went in doors; I put on my boots and coat and came out again, and I went down to Woolwich, and had my head washed where it was cut. That's all."</p>

I live at 5, Armstrong Street, with my father and mother—the prisoner is a lodger there—I heard a scream in the street on this night—the prisoner, who was in the passage, said, "There is a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> outside, come and see what it is"—this man and woman passed by and stood in the middle of the fence—the prisoner said, "What is the matter, old woman?"—I did not hear the answer, but heard her say to the man, "You want to lead me astray"—the prisoner then asked him what he wanted to do with the woman—I heard the woman speak to the prisoner, but did not hear what she said—the man said, "What is that you say?"—I saw him strike you, and you fell; you were on the ground about ten minutes—I did not see him hit you after you fell, but I saw the woman using the crutch—my mother called me in doors and I saw no more of it.</p>

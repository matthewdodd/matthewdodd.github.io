                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Baste, of Lea Bridge-road he is next door neighbor to Charles Bright, the tobacconist. On Tuesday evening, 12th June, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I was standing at the front window, and saw two men opposite it; they were Baldwin and Bullivant—I then saw Davis come out of Mr. Bright's shop, and the other two crossed over to him—he passed something to Baldwin, and they separated, and crossed over again, and walked along—Davis walked on the same side as Mr. Bright's shop, on the side opposite our house; they took the road towards London—I informed Mr. Bright who was in the garden behind his shop—there was no one in the shop, but Mrs. Bright was in the parlour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist of Leyton. On 7th June, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, I received information, ran up from the garden, and went in pursuit of three boys which were pointed out to me by my child and the last witness—I kept them in sight 200 or 300 yards, for where they are making new basins for the East London water works—Chapman, the policeman, was there—when they had walked about 100 yards, Davis separated from the other two, and ran as hard as he could—I had previously walked very cautiously, for fear they should fancy they were detected, but then I ran also, and seeing a policeman, I motioned to him to go through the hedge, to stop one of them who had gone through—as soon as I came up, they were all three taken by Chapman, and I gave them into custody—I examined my shop, and missed some pipes, which were safe in a glass case on the counter in the morning before I left—Chapman handed me these pieces of pipe; they are my property—1 lost five, which were worth between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—this one is rendered valueless, by being thrown against some brickwork.</p>

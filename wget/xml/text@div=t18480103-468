                  </hi> I live in Arbour-terrace, Commercial-road. The prisoner was in my service—on the 19th Dec., before I went to Church, I put sixteen sovereigns and a half into this purse, which I put in a box, and locked it in a cupboard in my bed-room—the key of the box I secreted under a paper in one of the drawers—the key of the cupboard was left in the door—the prisoner would have access to the room—she was the only person in the house when I went to Church—I</p>

               <p>came back, and found the key of the box where I had left it, but the box was turned round—I opened it, and missed a sovereign—I am quite sure I had counted the money correctly before I went to Church—I counted it day by day, from the Wednesday when I had missed two sovereigns—I put the purse into the same trunk—the key was in the same place where it had been for the last two months—I did not put it into my pocket, the bunch it was on was too large—when I missed the sovereign, I rang the bell—the prisoner came up, and I said, "I have lost a sovereign while I was at Church"—she denied it—I said it was useless to deny it, and it was not the first, second, or third time she had robbed me from the same box, and if she would confess to the whole she had taken, before I called in another person, I would forgive her—she said she had not taken any but the one that day—I sent for Mr. Carney—I saw a sovereign taken from a gown of the prisoner's in my bed-room—I had not marked the money, nut it was new money, which I had received at the Bank in October.</p>

                  </hi>. On Sunday, 19th Dec., I went to Mr. Smyth's, and saw the prisoner—in consequence of what the prisoner said, I went up stairs—she pointed put a gown hanging on a nail—I took to down, and found in it a sovereign—I asked her if that was the sovereign—she said, "Yes"—I gave it to Mr. Smyth.</p>

I went into the house between four and five o'clock in the evening, and the prisoner was given into my custody—a sovereign was given to me by Mr. Smyth—she gave the prisoner into custody for stealing five sovereigns, and one of them on that forenoon—I searched the prisoner's box, and found a quantity of apparel, which she said she had bought with the four sovereigns.</p>

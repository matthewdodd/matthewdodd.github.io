I am a croquet painter, and live at 1, Roxboro' Road, Kentish Town—the deceased Thomas Molloy was seven years in my employ—he was about 16 years of age—I saw him dead—I saw him the evening before; he was then in his usual health—he had had small pox about six weeks before, but was only away three days, and came back cured.</p>

I am a boot and shoe maker, at 30, Bedfordbury—I knew the deceased by sight—on Wednesday morning, 8th July, I was look<lb></lb>ing out of my door, and saw George Patten and a boy named Anthony quarrelling about the ownership of a dog—Anthony struck Patten, and Patten called on Molloy to assist him—they both began fighting Anthony, and the prisoner stepped forward to help him—they fought together, two and two—Molloy and Vickers fought together—it did not last above three minutes—they closed, and were pomelling each other—they both hit as hard as they could—I did not see any particularly severe blow struck by either—I went into my shop for a moment, and when I came back, some<lb></lb>body had the deceased in their arms, and he was carried to the hospital.</p>

I am the wife of George Jenkins, of Davies' Buildings, Bedfordbury, boot maker—I saw the boys fighting—Vickers had Molloy under his arm, and he struck him with his fist very heavily in the side; I should say over half a dozen blows—Molloy groaned very heavily after that; his arms relaxed their hold, and his head fell back—I was panic struck, and begged them to have no more blows, but, being passionate, I suppose he did not hear me—he continued giving him blows—he then threw him on the ground, not violently—the boy struggled very hard in a convulsive manner, and then he was dead—before that he was trying to strike the prisoner as well as he could, but he had no power in his hands—it was on the side, over the heart, that the blows were given.</p>

               <p>excitement, but there was no organic disease—persons are not liable to paralysis without organic disease—I can venture to say that he did not die from excitement—when he was first brought in, I said I could not say what was the cause of death; I gave my opinion after the post-mortem examina<lb></lb>tion—there was evidence of blows on the right side, opposite the heart, and also on the abdomen, near the gastric region, not of a severe character.<hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might a fall have caused the mischief? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in that region, unless he fell against a knob.</p>

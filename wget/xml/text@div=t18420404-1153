                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Daniel Dodson, a bookseller, in Fleet-street. About nine o'clock at night, on the 19th of March, Follett told me something—I instantly went to the front window, and missed book from one of the shelves—I went outside, and looked, but could not see the prisoner—about five minutes afterwards I saw him on the other side of the street—I went across with Follett, and caught the prisoner with this book concealed under his coat—it is the one I missed, and is my master's—the book was at least three feet inside the window—to window was not shut.</p>

It is not likely if I took the book I should pass the shop again. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was another person with him—I saw him put the book down by his left side—I should say three or four minutes elapsed from his taking the book and coining back again—one went to the right, and one to the left—they parted at the window—one engaged the young man that was minding the window in conversa<lb></lb>tion, while the prisoner stole the book—he opened it under pretence of looking at it, and then walked up Fleet-street with it.</p>

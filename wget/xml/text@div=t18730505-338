                  </hi>. I am a photographer, of 422, Mile End Road—about 20th August I entrusted the prisoner with a photographic apparatus the arrangement I made was that he was to go through the country to the cathedral towns of England and photograph a series of views—I was to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187305050043"></xptr>
               <p>pay the whole of the expenses of the journey, and when any profit was made the prisoner was to have a share, but that share has never been divided—when the work was finished the apparatus was to be returned; I gave him no authority to dispose of it, he was to act as my servant—I made inquiries of the prisoner from time to time as to the condition of the lens, and he assured me that it was perfectly safe, and gave me the address of an hotel or coffee-house at Ramsgate, where he said that he had left it—in consequence of what I heard I went to a photographer named Wright, 99, East India Road—I had previously been to Archbutt's, a pawnbroker in Westminster Bridge Road, and had written to the place at Ramsgate—there were three lenses, a camera, and tent—two of the lenses were stereo-doublets, numbered, and I can identify them.</p>

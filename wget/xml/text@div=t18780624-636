                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer of Great Marlborough Street—some property called the Tenter-ground estate was entrusted to me for sale; it comprised 122 houses, a public-house, and a chapel—the sale occupied two days, the 10th and 11th April—Mr. William Hale Willatts was the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187806240091"></xptr>
               <p>owner of the property—a vast number of advertisements of the sale were inserted, and bills of particulars posted, at an expense of more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I paid out of pocket—I saw the accused in the auction-room—I think he bid for the first lot—he was sitting where the vendor's solicitors usually sit, on the left of the rostrum—the property was put up in 100 lots—the defendant went on bidding for about three quarters of an hour, until 21 lots were knocked down to him, amounting to 11,145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then inquired whether the contracts were signed and the deposits paid—my clerk, Mr. Bozley, informed me that the gentleman would do it pre<lb></lb>sently—I insisted on its being done then, and Bozley came back with this cheque for 1,114<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him not to allow it to be crossed—I endorsed it and sent it to Messrs. Hedges and Richards by a gentleman in the office of the solicitors to the vendor to cash it—in the meantime the defendant continued to bid, and ultimately bid for 23 lots more, amounting to 10,945<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making a total of 22,090<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—upon that my clerk brought me this second order for the 10 per cent, deposit—before the gentleman returned who had gone to Messrs. Hedges and Richards the sale had concluded for that day, and the buyer had gone—the defendant had signed the contracts at the time he gave the cheques. (<hi rend="italic">These were signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Caher</hi>," <hi rend="italic">witnessed by R. Bozley</hi>.) The gentleman returned that same afternoon from Hedges and Richards's with a message that they were surprised at the defendant's audacity, or something of that kind; that they had no money of his—the second cheque was sent the next morning, and that was dishonoured also—I afterwards received this letter from the defendant, written on Messrs. Hedges and Richards's office paper, enclosing two stamps and stating that he would be at Barclay's on the 24th, and that the money would be paid there—I went there and presented the orders, and they said they had not heard of the man or had any money of his or any orders to pay any such cheques—these are the contracts, there are 44 of them—matters remained quiet until 6th May, when I received this letter from the defendant, stating that he had been ill ever since the sale—after making inquiries, the vendor's solicitor took out a summons—the defendant did not appear to it—I then received this post-card of 14th May—a second summons was taken out, and the defendant did not appear—an intimation was then given that if he did not appear a warrant would be issued—this second post-card, addressed to Mr. Alderman Hadley, is in the defendant's writing—I have never been able to obtain a shilling on these receipts or contracts, or to recover the expenses incurred by the auction, which, in<lb></lb>cluding my commission, is nearly 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the defendant bid repeatedly for the public-house—a brewer's agent bought it.</p>

Lord Caher, 3, Catherine Court, Tower Hill, E. C., and bears the postmark of Feb. 4,1878—he signed the contracts—I asked him for a cheque—he said he had not his cheque-book with him, would an I O U do—I said certainly not, it must be a cheque—he then took a piece of plain paper and wrote this cheque for 1,114<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., addressed to Hedges and Richards, signed "Caher,"on demand, pay Robert Reid—he tried to cross it, I stopped him and told him it must be an open cheque—I took it to Mr. Reid, and he endorsed it—I provided the defendant with a stamp—I afterwards saw him about signing the cheque for the deposit on the remaining lots that he had purchased, and also saw him sign the remaining contracts—he signed the other cheque in the same way—this is it—I also furnished him with a stamp for that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Hedges and Richards, cornfactors—our counting-house is at 3, Catherine Court; the granaries are at Eagle Wharf, Wapping—the defendant was formerly in our service; I forget when, I think in 1876—we usually called him Butler; I knew that he claimed the title of Caher—his salary was, I think, 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he acted as an ordinary clerk; he was only with us some few months; he left at the end of 1876—since he left we have lent him money; the largest amount, I think, was 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it Was an advance on goods that he had bought at a sale, pictures and tables—besides that I have lent him different small sums, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or a pound, and I believe as much as 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he has said that he had bought goods at an auction and he wanted this to pay for them; and when he has been short of money I have given him a few shillings or half a sovereign out of kindness—I never had any money of his on deposit; I never authorised him to draw on my firm for money—he had no authority to draw on us for any such amounts as those two cheques; the first I knew of it was when they were presented—these letters and post-cards appear to be in his writing—he came in a few minutes after the clerk had gone who pre<lb></lb>sented the first cheque—I said "A clerk has been here with a cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or something like that; how came you to give one of that amount on us?"—he said "Oh, I intended to have seen Mr. Hedges, who, no doubt, would have advanced me the money," and he asked me if Mr. Hedges was in town—I said "No, he is away in the country"—he had been away for a day or two—I think he asked me when he was coming back—I think the defendant's private address was 11, Eaton Street.</p>

The two Women were in the melting Room, and Wilkinson was in the next Room, but nothing suspicious in his custody; whereas in the Womens there was found a Bag of Clippings, and about 10 l. newly Clipt. Another Witness, one Mrs. Pickering, swore that she was wont to lie in the House, and then she saw Mr. Wilkinson and his wife Clip money several things, which was about two years ago. And being ask'd, why she conceal'd it so long; she said it was, because her Husband, one Mr. Pickering, was concerned with them, and therefore she was afraid to discover them. She swore further, That Mr. Wilkinson told her, that he had so much broad money, that he wanted persons to Clip it, and ask'd her to help them to Clip; so she did, whereby she had the opportunity to see them at work; and that she was to have 6 d. in the pound for Clipping the said broad money. Mr. Wilkinson said in his defence, that Malson brought the Bag of Clippings into his House, and that he knew nothing of it; that the Witness was an ill Woman, and went by several Names, no less than Eight. But the Court replied, that she did not deny that; and that he was wont to buy stolen Goods of her, that her Confederates had got unlawfully; particularly, several that Pickering gave her, who is now a Convict in Leicester Gaol, for which Mr. Wilkinson was tried heretofore, and had the Fortune to be acquitted.

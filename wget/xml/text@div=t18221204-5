             (being questioned, appeared perfectly to understand the nature of an oath.) I am eleven years old, and live at Heston, with Mr. Bell. About two or three months ago, in the harvest time. I met the prisoner at <placeName id="t18221204-5-crimeloc22">Windmill-bridge</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18221204-5-crimeloc22" type="placeName" value="Windmill-bridge"></interp>

               <p>"I'll be d - d if I don't have a shoot at you;" I said, " Oh! Ah!" and when he picked up the stones and crossed the road, he said,</p>
               <p>"Do you think I should hit you there?" I said, Oh! Ah! He put the gun up to his shoulder, and put his fingers to the trigger - I put my hands to my face, and he fired off directly; I saw the flash - it hit me is the hands, arms, and face, and in my eye, in consequence of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040004"></xptr>which, I have lost the sight of it. Some of the stones were as big as peas. There was not room for more then two carts to pass between us when he fired. I had no quarrell with him. I never saw him before. When he saw I was wounded, he went and told Mr. Coleman that his gun had gone off, and he had shot this little boy in the face. Mr. Coleman said,</p>
               <p>"Take him down to the canal, and wipe his face," which he did, and rubbed it with brown paper, and took me through the field towards home. He then asked which was my way home - I pointed to it, and he left me to go home; I walked back towards the bridge, and saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. How long had you been in his company - A. About half an hour. He was put there to keep the birds off the barley. I had been talking to him. There were some boats near us with people in them when he fired - they were at the lock below the bridge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he fired his gun before he fired at your hat - A. I did not see him fire before - it was loaded before he shot at my hat. His powder was in a bag in his pocket I - saw him pick up pebbles and put into the gun, and ram ti down after the pebbles were put in. I said Oh! Ah! thinking he was only in fun - I did not think he was going to shoot me. I could have ran away or stooped down if I liked. I did not go before the Justice till about three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>PRESS BELL. The prosecutor lived with me. On the 17th after the accident, he came to my house. I saw him about half-past ten o'clock that night; he was in a dreadful state, and was under the doctor's care ten weeks. I went to a Magistrate about it next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you go to Bow-street - A. About the 16th of November. I know Mr. Haydon - I told him if the prisoner discharged the doctor's bill, and paid the expences my wife had been at, I should not trouble him further. The boy was entirely under my care.</p>
               <p>MR. FROGLEY. I am a surgeon, and attended the prosecutor nine or ten weeks. I saw him the morning after the accident, and found him much wounded from the effects of it. I took several stones from his face, and some from under the skin of his hand. I expected he would have lost both eyes, but he has the sight of one. Some of the stones were very small; the largest was not bigger then a pea. He was unable to leave the house for six weeks. There was danger from the number of the wounds - he was out of danger after six weeks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was an accident. I had the gun in my hand, and was going away from the boy, and getting over a stile - the but-end of the gun knocked against it and it went off. He called out; I ran and picked him up. I saw Coleman and told him of the accident, and went and washed him and wiped it with some paper, having no handkerchief.</p>
               <p>- TRUMPER. I am a farmer. The prisoner was in my service - I set him to keep the crows of the wheat. It was an old gun, and went off very easy at full cock - it was pretty strong at half-cock. I gave him one charge of shot in the morning in a hurry. He was not to shoot the birds, only to make a noise to frighten them away. He was a humane boy, and particularly fond of children.</p>

            , JUN. I work on the canal, and was about fifteen yards from Beckett, in a boat, rather under the bridge when the gun went off - I could not see him; he hollowed,</p>
               <p>"Oh, my eye." I got out of the boat and met him on the bridge. The prisoner was about five yards from me. Beckett said,</p>
               <p>"Take me home, or this boy will kill me." I went away and did not see him washed.</p>

            . I was on the tow path of the canal, about fifty feet from the boys. I heard the gun go off, and immediately heard the boy cry. I sent my son on the bridge and went myself. The prisoner brought Beckett towards me, and said his gun had gone off unawares, and he had hurt the boy's face - he lifted him up to shew me his face. I lifted him over, and he washed him very carefully, and neither of us having a handkerchief, he poured the water on his face with his hands. He was very attentive to him, and appeared sorry.</p>

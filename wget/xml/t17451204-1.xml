            . I am a Constable of Trinity in the Minories, and I was out to search for this Boy three or four Hours, and could find nothing of him. We shut up the Gate of our Parish, and I told the Watchmen, if any such Boy was seen by them, to lay hold on him; for this Boy had been seen by one of the Watchmen. I laid hold on him, and found upon him six Silver Spoons, this Punch Ladle, a Portugal 36 Shilling Piece and the Guineas and half Guinea, two Perriwigs and seven or eight Razors, which I gave to Mr. Mears before he came Home. He (the Prisoner) was ask'd how he came by these Things, and he said he took them out of the Drawers.</p>

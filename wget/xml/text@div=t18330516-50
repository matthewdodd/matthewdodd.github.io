            . I am a constable. I was standing at my own shop-door in Seething-lane, the prisoner and prosecutor were on the other side of the way about four yards from me - I saw Captain Brown with the prisoner by the collar, he immediately dropped the handkerchief from his hand; the boy ran away before I could get hold of him - I took up the handkerchief, and have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman picked the handkerchief up, and not the constable. Witness. To the best of my knowledge I took it up, but I stooped to take it up at the same time as him.</p>

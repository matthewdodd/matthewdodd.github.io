I imagined they were drunken fellows playing tricks with one another; they were very dirty. The prisoner came up first with a pistol in his hand, saying, we are poor unfortunate fellows, your money, your money. Another man came on the other side, rapped at the glass, and said, your money, watches and rings, make no delay; I then gave him my silver, which was about 15 or 16 s. half a guinea, and a silver medal; then he said, your watch, don't trifle with us; I gave him that; then he saw a little ring on my finger, and said he must have that; I told him it was not worth taking, for it was only a burial ring; he said he must have it, and then I gave it him. The prisoner told the coachman not to look at him, telling him, if he did, he'd blow his brains out, and bid him not stir 'till he was at some distance; they then rode off through Highgate. I never saw the prisoner 'till that day, and about 11 or 12 days after I saw the prisoner before the justice: I described the men and the horses, for the prisoner rode a bay horse of no great value. I told the justice, I believ'd the prisoner to be the very man, and upon my oath I believe him to be one of them; I make no doubt of it, tho' I found none of my things upon him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Shepherd confirm'd the above, but would not swear to the prisoner, only said she did think he was one of the men.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Shepherd then. My master ordered me to alight and walk home; I was about 60 yards from them when they stopped the coach; I took great notice of them, for I saw a pistol in one of their hands, and heard the words, deliver your watch, money and rings; I can't say I ever saw the prisoner before I saw him at justice Chamberlayn's; I believe he was not one of the men, but I could swear to the two men that did the robbery. If I could see them: this was about a quarter of a mile from a farm house; I had nothing to assist my master with, and did neither assist him, or run to call any body. The man that came up second was a lusty man, in a light-coloured furtout coat, and came on my master's side; he that came up first had a great coat behind him, but not on; there was one of the men in black, who did not come up: I have seen him several times in London, I think about Leicester-fields.</p>

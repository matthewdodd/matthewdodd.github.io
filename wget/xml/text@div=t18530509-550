                  </hi>. I am a commission agent of No. 12, Laurence-lane, Cheapside. The prisoner was in my service five weeks from 20th Jan. to 24th Feb.—it was his business to settle small accounts for me, he received money of me for that purpose—I was indebted to Messrs. Holmes 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., here is an invoice of it which I have paid since—on 31st Jan. the prisoner brought me this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it has a receipt on it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the petty cash book, which the prisoner kept—he has made this entry in it, "31st Jan., J. Holmes, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>"—that is in his writing—he brought me this receipt on 31st Jan., the day on which I settle my monthly accounts.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WOOLLETT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This receipt was received by you on 31st Jan.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when Mr. Holmes sent in his account I took it out of the envelope containing the prisoner's vouchers, and found out that it was forged—after that it was placed on a file—I have no doubt that I placed it there—I had the envelope in my drawer locked up—I have a most distinct recollection of his giving me this particular receipt—there was a boy there at the time, a cousin of mine; he was not engaged in my service then, he was about a week before the prisoner left, that would be after this trans-action—the prisoner might send him out on errands, he did so very often.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Holmes and Son, of No. 4, Church-passage, Guildhall, builders. Mr. Kettle owed us 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 31st Jan.—this bill is in my writing, but this, "Settled, Jan. 31st, 1853, S. Holmes," at the foot of it, is not my writing, nor that of any member of the firm—I did not authorise anybody to give that receipt—I afterwards sent the bill to Mr. Kettle, he paid me last Thursday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many people are there in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes four, sometimes a dozen, according to the work we have—I do not recollect any of them ever taking money—Mrs. Holmes always takes money when I am not on the premises; if she is not there, the carpenter is generally at work in the shop, and he would take it in that case, or the servant would take it if the party would leave it.</p>

Holmes; it is not like the writing of anybody in the firm—this bill was sent in some time in March, shortly after the goods were delivered—(<hi rend="italic">Bill read</hi>: "Mr. Kettle, debtor to J.

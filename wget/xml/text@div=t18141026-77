In the course of the day I lost it, I believe between eight and nine o'clock. I went to Bow-street to give information, and to enquire about it, and while I was looking for an officer, the officers who are here, came to my house in my absence. I returned about ten o'clock, and found they had the property in their possession.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GODFREY. I am a patrole of Bow-street. On Thursday, the 20th of October, I received private information that there was a barrow wheeling along Broad-street, and a large box upon it. I went to a place in Charles-street, where they supposed the property was; I proceeded along the passage to a back room on the ground floor; I knocked at the door, the door was locked. They asked me who was there; I told them a friend; it was full five minutes before they opened the door. I saw the four prisoners in the room, and a box containing soap, two men and two women. The box was there broken open, the cords cut. Gardner was sitting down on the box smoking his pipe, Yates was on the bed, Crouch was washing, and the other woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260051"></xptr>sitting by the side of her. I asked how the box came there; Crouch said, she and Gardner brought it in out of the passage, supposing it was left by some person. I searched the whole of the prisoners; on Crouch I found two pieces of soap in her pocket, which matched the soap in the box. The barrow was taken to the watchhouse by the watchman found in the street.</p>

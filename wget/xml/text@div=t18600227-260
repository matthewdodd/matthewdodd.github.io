                  </hi>. I was an inspector of the G division of police—on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, 1st February I went with some officers to a house in Featherstone-street where I could command a view of Featherstone-court—I saw Jervis come out of the court—he went a short distance and returned back again to Featherstone-court—he there joined Martin who came out of a doorway—I saw both their hands meet as if one handed something to the other—Martin's hand joined Jervis's hand, who was standing by a barrow—Martin then put his hand into his right hand trousers pocket—they then both came up the court—Jervis was wheeling the truck—they were very close together—I rushed from where I had been concealed and seized both of them by the collar—they struggled, and Martin attempted to sit down—at that time Elliot came to my assistance and we secured them—Mr. Bryant and Sergeant Brannan secured Elliot, and I secured Martin—we forced them into the passage of a house, and I said to Martin, "Well, Dick, I have received instruction from the authorities of the Mint to look after you respecting counterfeit coin"—he said, "I did not know it was bad, Mr. Brannan; I picked it up"—Jervis said to him, "Why the b—y hell did not you drop it"—I then put my hand into Martin's right hand trousers pocket and took from it two packets, one containing four and the other six counterfeit shillings—they were separately wrapped in paper, and all put into one packet—we then took the prisoners to Martin's lodging—Jervis became very violent; we put him in a chair and he said, "If it were not for such as us you would starve"—and he said to Martin, "If you had not been a b—y fool you would have thrown them away"—and he said, "You know you have nothing against me; you found nothing on me."</p>

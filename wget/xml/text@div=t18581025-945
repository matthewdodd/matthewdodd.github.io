                  </hi>. I am a servant out of place, and live at 3, Thomas-court, Duke-street, Grosvenor-square. On Saturday night, about 1 o'clock, I was in Oxford-street with Ann Andrews; and the prisoner and another man came up and asked if we would go and take a cup of coffee; we thanked him and said that we did not want any—his companion asked me if I would take a glass of ale—I said "No"—the prisoner then took hold of my right hand, and his companion of my left; and his companion took my watch from my side and ran away—he broke the ring of it I think—it was fastened with three pins—when he ran away, I took hold of the prisoner; he struck me in the face, and then in the chest, and broke the chain from my neck—it was a heavy blow; my face was black for some time—the prisoner ran away—I ran after him, calling "Police," and did not lose sight of him till he was stopped in some Mews, in South Audley-street—my watch and chain were worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) picked up; I believe it to be mine, but have no private mark on it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Miller, and look after his houses, which are in St. Luke's parish. On the morning of the 17th of July the lead was missed; I had seen it all safe the day before - part of it was left in the house, but it was all cut from the roof; I was looking over the premises, and discovered it - I afterwards compared some which was found at the watch-house, and it fitted exactly.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith. On the morning of the 26th of July I was at work in my shop, and can see Mr. Miller's premises through a hole in my wall - I looked through, and saw the prisoner coming down the stairs with a load under his arm; I went after him, found him with a large quantity of lead, covered with an apron - I took him in the court, and saw the lead matched with the roof, it fitted exactly; he was taken to the watch-house - he had about 30lbs. under his arm, and up stairs I found about three quarters of a cwt.; I had seen him there before.</p>

               <p>What do you know of these scales? - The prisoner Halsey, and Coleman, came and offered these scales to me for sale on the 28th of February; I bought them for a shilling.</p>
               <p>What were they worth? - I looked upon them to have cost about six pence or eight-pence in labour, and then they would fetch about two shillings; I took them out of the prisoner's hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He took them out of Coleman's hands; he did not take them out of my hands; for I had not the scales in my hands afterwards.</p>

I was sitting at the corner of the place; I did not know where they brought the things from; they came and gave me a blanket and a pair of scales; and I did not know where they got them from no more than the dead; I did not; and I was so foolish to take them from him; I have not a friend in the world; I was only brought in this morning.</p>

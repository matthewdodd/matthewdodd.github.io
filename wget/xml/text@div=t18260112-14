I was returning about six o'clock, and saw the prisoner before me, walking arm-in-arm with a man. I overtook them, and as I passed them the prisoner laid hold of my arm; I looked up in her face, and said, "What do you want of me; I don't know you;" she said, "Come home with me;" I said, "No, I have got no money - I want to go home." - The man immediately struck me in my face, and knocked me down, and I saw the prisoner take my watch out of my pocket; I only received one blow - it was a violent one; they went off in a moment. I went to the watchmaker, got the number of the watch, and found it in pawn. She was taken up last Monday - I knew her the moment I saw her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met this man in Drury-lane - he was tipsy, and said he would go home with me; he went home with me to King-street - he said he had no money, and left his watch till he brought me some money - he was two hours in my room, which my landlady well knows; he got up and smashed the window, and was taken to the watch-house for it. My landlady has left the house since.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. I went to no house with her, and never gave her the watch - it is all false.</p>

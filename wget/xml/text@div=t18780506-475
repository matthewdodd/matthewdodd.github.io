I am in the service of Mr. Garnham, a draper, of 107, Oxford Street, which is about 250 yards from Mr. Smith's—on 15th April, about 9 p.m., I served the prisoner with a pair of men's socks, which came to 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a crown; I saw it was bad before I took it up, and asked him how he got it; he said "For a hard day's work in the docks"—my employer's wife gave him in custody as he still persisted it was good, I took the coin from his hand and asked him where he lived—he said "At Wapping"—I said "It is a long way to come from Wapping to Hoxton for a pair of socks."</p>

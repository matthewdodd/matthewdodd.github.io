               <p>Q. You are pretty sure you saw her take something from the counter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite certain now, I take it? - A. Yes, quite certain; I could not find a piece that would suit her, and she went away; I followed her out, and told her she had got a piece of muslin under her arm, and I took it away from her, and I hope you will be as favourable with her as you can; it is marked with the private shop mark at both ends.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. So you saw her do this? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master has two shops, one in Holborn, and the other in Aldgate-street? - A. Yes; No. 316, just beyond Holborn Bars.</p>
               <p>Q. Two shops in this same line of business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your master any partners? - A. No; it goes by the name of Craig and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master is not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Craig and Co. means, you know, sometimes that there are partners in the house? - A. I won't answer for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Is any body here that will answer for it? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, you came by yourself? - A. Yes; it is wrote up, Beehive, from Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say either one way or the other? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you make out the shop bills? - A. In the name of Craig and Co.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have no other master but Mr. Craig? - A. There is a young man, Mr. Harvey, that I call master, but I don't know that he has any thing to do in the business, he is put in by Mr. Craig, I believe, I don't know; when any linen-draper has two shops, there is always a head man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is Mr. Harvey? - A. I don't know that he is more than a servant; I cannot say either one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Don't you know whether this man is a partner? - A. I cannot say; I have not been there a twelve-month; I believe the agreement is, that Mr. Harvey, at the end of the year, when stock is taken, then he is to have a share of the profits; he has lived servant, I believe, with Mr. Craig, five or six years; I have not been with him more than eight or nine months myself, so that I know but little of their connections.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is there any body else belonging to the shop? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, it is very loose, that part of the story, about partnership; if he is a partner, and has a share in the goods, the indictment ought to state it to be the property of Mr. Harvey, and Mr. Craig; because the prosecutor ought to know his own case as to Craig and Co. that means nothing at all many have sleeping partners; the house of Child's it is well known, there is no such person existing at this time; Hazard the same; it is for you to determine; this woman stands charged with a capital offence, at the same time the capital part is clearly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130114"></xptr>taken off, because this young man says he is persuaded he saw her do it, and convinced he saw her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I beg your Lordship's pardon for interrupting you, but if your Lordship thinks it a proper case to go to a Jury, I have a number of witnesses to call, but I should hope your Lordship will not send such a case to a Jury.</p>
               <p>Court. It is for the Jury to determine, it is not a point of law, it is, whether they are convinced of it upon this evidence or not.(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.)</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Kinnard.) Q. Whether you ever looked upon Mr. Harvey as a master? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, if you had occasion to send away a servant, he would have done it without consulting Mr. Craig? - A. Yes; he always takes an account of the cash, and gives it to Mr. Craig.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever appear to be anxious about taking a quantity of money, that he might be interested in the quantity of money taken? - A. No; nor in the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he particular to see the goods delivered into the shop? - A. Not very particular; because they are always to be brought from the other shop; he never buys any goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there were separate entries made of the goods in the shop? - A. They are always entered and sent upon a piece of paper, and they are put upon the file.</p>

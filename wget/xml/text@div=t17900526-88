               <p>Mr. Beth, Prisoner's Counsel. Pray what number do you live at in John-street? - No. 2.</p>
               <p>Do not you bring strange men to your house usually? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Have not you brought strange men to your house? - No; I defy any body to say so.</p>
               <p>Are you a married woman? - No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Does not a gentleman from the city very often visit you? - He does.</p>
               <p>You say you never brought a stranger there? - No.</p>
               <p>What reason had you to suspect this servant that you put so much confidence in? - I put confidence in her because I had a good character of her; I had no other reason to suspect her, than she said two strange men followed her to the house: my servant boy has lived with me near a twelvemonth; I never found him dishonest; the towel was found in her box; I do not suppose she took that with intention to steal it; I think she would certainly have taken something of greater value.</p>
               <p>Did you never bring a stranger there? - I think, Sir, you ask me very odd questions; if I must speak the truth, I never took strangers.</p>
               <p>Had you any suspicion of the gentleman that visited at your house? - I believe that gentleman's character will bear enquiry.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheriff. A gentleman behind is telling her to say no: (the gentleman ordered out of court): I believe her not to be a good woman; her husband has now been in Newgate four years, also condemned for his life.</p>
               <p>Were not there a great many gentlemen that visited your house that you might as well have suspected? - No, Sir; none at all; the property I used the day before I went out of town; and I saw it all.</p>
               <p>Did you lock it up? - The gentleman that put it up is in Court.</p>
               <p>What servants have you? - A foot-boy, and a servant of all work.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner; to search for the spoons: I looked into her box, which was packed up, and tied with a cord; I found no spoons in it; I only found this towel: I enquired about the spoons, but heard nothing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fenton. This towel is my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. What did the prisoner say? - She said, this is my mistress's to be sure.</p>
               <p>- EDWARDS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Penton. I know no further, only that those spoons were lost during the time my mistress was out of town: I had no suspicion of the prisoner till I saw two strange men come home with her; and I asked her who those two men were; it was on Tuesday evening, the 11th of this month (my mistress went out of town on Sunday, and returned on the Wednesday): the prisoner told me those two strange men she did not know; that they were two strange gentlemen to her: and there was a pot of porter standing in the kitchen; I asked her how it came there? and she told me, she fetched it for those two gentlemen, and asked them to eat some bread and cheese; and I asked her what made her leave the house to fetch them porter, if she knew nothing of them? and she said, did I think such genteel men as them would touch any thing? and I made her answer, I did not know; and I took up some knives in the parlour, which I had been cleaning, and I missed those spoons out of the boxes; I missed eleven spoons; I saw them in the knife box in the parlour, on the Monday: when I went up to bed she called to me: I lay in the next room to her: and she said, the clock was gone, which I did not know; and I asked her why she did not let me know the clock was gone before we came up? and she made answer, because she thought it would make me more uneasy.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260082"></xptr>Mr. Beth. These were very genteel people I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen them in your house before? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you present when they knocked at the door? - I was behind them, at the street door.</p>
               <p>Did not they ask for your mistress? - No such thing. I was going of an errand to Park-street: and I gave her the key of the street door, and told her to take care of the door; and she laughed, and said, do you think I will not: I thought these were two clerks, where she lived last: I thought by their conversation they were acquainted, for they were talking very high together.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was you before you came home again? - I was two hours.</p>
               <p>Did you find the men there when you came back? - No.</p>
               <p>Who did they ask for? - They were coming home with her hand in hand: I saw the time piece in the afternoon; I cannot say what hour; it might be about two.</p>
               <p>What time was it that these two men came home with her? - At ten in the evening: the prisoner went out at five, and came back at ten: I left the men on the step of the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. Do not you know that this servant was standing with the door open, in order to bring gentlemen into the house, and do not you know that she has brought gentlemen into the house? - No, Sir; I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know this woman, this prisoner, was often sent out to the streets, at different hours, in order to bring gentlemen to this lady? - She never was sent out before; I always went out myself.</p>
               <p>Have not you brought men when you returned? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed? - They had boots on, their hair dressed, and flapped hats, and great coats, and sticks.</p>
               <p>Were they not as well dressed as this gentleman that visits at your house? - No, Sir; they were exceedingly well dressed.</p>
               <p>Do not you see gentlemen of this lady's acquaintance not so well dressed as they were.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not understand that there has been any imputation thrown on this lady's character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. My lord, I only wish to establish this, that many gentlemen visit that house; that the lady has been in the practice of sending out this woman to bring home gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Court. She has told you she did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. Were not these two gentlemen who called, as genteelly dressed as that gentleman that is at present with the lady? - Yes; as he is now; but he has more clothes; perhaps they have not.</p>
               <p>What was your reason for thinking they were clerks? - Because they had the appearance of clerks; I have seen a great many clerks; and this woman living with a linen draper; as she told me she was going to receive her wages; and I thought they were clerks she had brought to protect her home.</p>
               <p>You do not know that the prisoner was sent out by the lady for any other gentleman? - No, Sir; I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Court. No; he says she never was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My master is gone for; Mr. Walker, a linen draper, in King-street, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

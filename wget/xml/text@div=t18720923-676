                  </hi>. I live at Maidstone—in June last I advertised in the Maidstone papers that I had some grains to sell; I received a letter on the 22nd from William Cartwright, 25, Cock Lane, to send a ton of grains, and direct them to the South-Eastern Railway, Bricklayers' Arms Station, and that he would send a post office order—in consequence of that letter I sent a ton of grains, and on 27th June I received another letter: "I received the grains safe, my cattle like them, and they give satisfaction; the bags will be empty at the end of the week. You can send half a ton more, and likewise half a ton of linseed cake"—I did not send any more grains—I made inquiries upon the Corn Market, and I did not hear any good—I</p>

               <p>wrote to the address again, and asked for a reference—we had a letter, referring to Samuel Beck, 22, Naylor Street; that was on 29th June; the letter is signed William Cartwright—I came up to London on 1st July, and I went to 25, Cock Lane; there was an old man in the front room, and I found the grains there—I asked for Mr. Cartwright, and he said he was not within—I said, "Where does he keep his horses and cattle, and so on?"—he said he thought he was over in the Borough—I could find no such person there—there was no business at Cock Lane, except the old man and the grains—I have not been paid for the grains.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The detective got possession of the grains, and I got part of them back—I went to London about a week or ten days after the grains were sent, just after I got the letter of reference—I knocked at the door and the old man opened it—I asked for Mr. Cartwright, and he said he was not in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Camberwell, and am a short-hand writer—on the evening of Friday, 28th July, I was present at a meeting at the Chartist Hall, Webber-street, Blackfriars'-road—I got there shortly before eight o'clock—I should say there were from 150 to 200 people present—the number increased afterwards to about 500—they appeared to be working men—a person named Bryson was elected chairman—I heard the defendant speak there—three persons had spoken before him, one was a person of the name of Keene—I took a short-hand note of Shell's speech—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"Mr. Chairman and fellow-workingmen—Being called upon to come forward and propose the second resolution to be submitted to your notice this evening, I do so with feelings of great pleasure and satisfaction, because the opportunity which now presents itself leads me to embrace that opportunity for the pur<lb></lb>pose of expressing my opinion as to what I consider to be the policy of the English Government towards that unfortunate country, Ireland, as well as to express my determination and disapprobation of the same. The resolution I submit to you is as follows:—'Resolved, that this meeting do solemnly protest against the base and unconstitutional act of the British Legislature, as committed by them in the suspending of the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland; and further, do hereby tender to Feargus O'Connor, Esq., Member of Parliament, and to those gentlemen who supported him, our best thanks for their manly and patriotic conduct on that occasion; and further, that we do hereby solemnly pledge ourselves, that we will render in the hour of trial our full aid and co-operation to our Irish brethren.' In making a few remarks upon the resolution I have submitted to you, you will at once perceive that the resolution which I have moved may fairly be divided into three points; first, condemnation; secondly, commendation; and thirdly, de<lb></lb>termination. In reference to the act of the Legislature in suspending the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland, it may-perhaps be necessary, for a few moments, that we take a retrospective view of the proceedings of that Legis<lb></lb>lature in connection with Irish affairs. If we look back to history, and trace the proceedings from the time of the Union up to the present, we shall find that the policy of the English Government towards that unhappy country has been one systematic system of coercion. The Irish people at the time of the Union were promised equality with the English people; they were promised that they should have equal laws and equal justice with the English people. Now, Mr. Chairman, although I have not condemned the acts of the Legislature in connection with my own country, I have still to condemn, and more justly too, I think, the acts of the Legislature in connection with Ireland, whenever and by whomsoever an appeal has been made to the Legislature of this country for justice to the Irish people, it has always been met by a system of coercion entirely; the English people have been coerced as well, and more especially of late, than they formerly were. You will remember that the English people, as well as the Irish people, have wrongs which they justly complain of, and they complain most reasonably and most justly too, because, as men and Englishmen, and as the wealth-producers of this country, they consider they have a right to a fair repre<lb></lb>sentation in the House of Commons, which at present they are denied. Such is the case with Ireland; and until, as my friend who moved the first resolution observed, Ireland is fairly represented by the people and for the people, no good will ever accrue either to the one country or the other. We know, Mr. Chairman, that there have been fine spirits of late exhibited in the sister country, as well as in this country; men have sprung up who have declared to the people, and told them and taught them what they are as men,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210218"></xptr>
               <p>what they should be as men, and how they may obtain that which they seek Mitchell, the Irish patriot, who has been condemned and transported as a felon for freely explaining to the Irish people what was their duty, what were their rights, and how they were to obtain them, has been sacrificed and made the victim, for promulgating those principles which I am quite glad to see at present are so prominent among the Irish people. Ireland has been taught by the Apostle Mitchell, and I rejoice to see that, although the Govern<lb></lb>ment has removed him, there are other individuals equally as patriotic as himself, who have nobly and manfully come forward and taken the people by the hand, and declared that they will to the death lead them on, if possible, to victory. Mr. Chairman, I rejoice that such has been the case; and I recommend to the Irish people to follow implicitly the commands of their leaders. I would call also upon the English people who desire liberty, who desire justice, and who desire equality, to stand by the Irish people in the hour of need. As soon as the Irish people are up, as soon as the insur<lb></lb>rection in Ireland becomes general, (as I believe in the course of a very few hours it will become general), I trust that the people of England will rise to support them. Mr. Chairman and fellow working men, for whatever I say I care not, whatever may follow, I as an Englishman consider that on all occasions, and upon every occasion, when my conscience dictates to me that I have an opportunity of speaking to my fellow men in public or in private, I have an unbounded right to tell them what is the honest conviction of my mind; and if I suffer for so doing, I shall only be another added to the band of patriots who have been crushed; and if, working men, you do allow those men who do nobly come forward and tell you your rights, and how to obtain them, if you allow them to be picked away, if you allow them to be trans<lb></lb>ported, to enjoy, I was going to say, but rather to be placed in a dungeon, there to suffer all the indignities which it is possible for a base, bloody, and brutal Government to inflict, you do not deserve the name of men, but you ought to be incarcerated yourselves, your families ought to starve around you, and you ought to go howling through the streets as a base and cowardly race of men. Gentlemen, I am not inclined to take up much of your time this evening. In what I say, however humble it may be, remember I am only a working man, and have not much time to spare to study to make use of fine grammatical expressions. I sincerely and honestly co-operate with the friends of liberty as much as those who have more time to spare and to devote to the cause. But, gentlemen, allow me to ask you if you are men, will ye act as men? (cries of "Yes.") If ye are called on to-night, to-morrow, or at any other time, do not show you are cowards, and flinch, but rally round the standard of liberty, defend it with your lives, and may God Almighty grant we may be victorious, that our enemies may be crushed, that they may hide their heads in the dungeons in the hulks, and that our honest patriots may be restored to us, and that they may take their places is my sincere wish."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what manner was this speech received by the meeting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With applause at various parts of it—the resolution Mr. Keene moved was as follows:—"Resolved, that this meeting views with feelings of distrust and alarm the measure adopted by her Majesty's Government, and sanctioned by the Imperial Parliament, for the suppression of public opinion in Ireland, as tending to the final severance of all amicable relations between the two countries; and this meeting is further of opinion, that the Irish people are fully entitled to a free and independent Parliament, and therefore resolves to render to their patriotic brethren in Ireland their cordial sympathy."</p>

               <p>before the defendant spoke he was introduced by the chairman in the meeting as the secretary—after Shell's speech, some Irish, a deputation of the Mitchell Club, came in—I think Shell was there then, but I cannot be positive.</p>

Can I repudiate this, who bold that constitutional appeals are long since closed against us, and that we have even now no resource, except when we have the means and the pluck to do it. The barricades and the God of battles' No; all the seditions and treasons of these gentlemen I adopt and accept, and I ask for more. Whatever has been done or said by the most disaffected persons in all Ireland against the existence of the party which calls itself the Government, nothing can go too far for me. Whatever public treasons there are in this land, I have stomach for them all.'—"But while we meet the enemy in the Queen's Bench, we have a right to call upon you to sustain us by a firm and universal avowal of your opinion—upon the</p>

               <p>constituents of Smith O'Brien especially devolves this duty—while the British Parliament calls his exertions treason and felony, it is for his constituents to declare, that in all this treason and felony he is doing his duty by them; and more than this, it is your duty to prepare systematically to sustain him, if it come to that, in arms. May I presume to address the women of Limerick? It is the first time I have ever been in the presence of the daughters of those heroines who held the breach against King "William; and they will under<lb></lb>stand me when I say, that no Irishwoman ought so much as to speak to a man who has not provided himself with arms. No lady is too delicate for the culinary operation of casting bullets; no hand is too white to make up cartridges; and I hope, if it be needful to come to the last resort, that the citizens of Limerick, male and female, will not disgrace their paternal and maternal ancestors"——"Now the fact is, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">United Irishman, "</hi> meaning Mr. Mitchell, "is no hero at all, and never said he was: he has only endeavoured to persuade his countrymen that they will never gain their liberties except by fighting for them; and that the only arguments the British Government will understand are the points of pikes, that's all; and he con<lb></lb>tinues to preach this saving doctrine, and will continue so to do, until a considerable number of his countrymen agree with him, and then he hopes to aid in enforcing the arguments practically, that's all. As for the sneaking away of Mr. Mitchell, or Mr. Meagher, or any of them, under the protection of the police, it is merely an untruth; the writer in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> who wrote it, and the editor of <hi rend="italic">Saunders</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Mail</hi>, who we find have copied it, know it to be an untruth."——"How are we to meet that day? In arms, my countrymen, in arms! Thus, and not otherwise, have ever nations of men sprung to liberty and power: but why do I reason thus with you, Irishmen cf Ulster, who never have denied the noble creed and sentiment of manhood? You have not been schooled for forty years in the fatal cant of moral force; you have not been utterly debauched and emasculated by the clap-trap platiudes of public meetings, and the empty glare of imposing demonstrations. You have not yet learned the litany of slaves, and the whine of beaten hounds, and the way to die a coward's death. No; let once the great day of your country's destiny seize on you my townsmen, and the way will be as plain before you as a pike-staff twelve feet long."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Having been arraigned at the bar of this Court to-day to answer to a charge preferred against me by the Gentlemen of the Govern<lb></lb>ment, it is not my intention to follow them through all the mazes and intricacies of the law, for I believe the present existing laws to be so compli<lb></lb>cated and confused, as to pass my humble powers of conception; but although I stand at the bar of this Court to-day, I trust that no man in this Court will for a moment suppose that I stand here accused of any crime, or any act of dishonesty that I may have committed against my fellow-men; no, not with<lb></lb>standing all the difficulties that I feel surround me this day, it is a consolation to me to know, that in standing here my honour and integrity as a man, are not impeached; I am here merely for differing from the Government in opinion; for that, and that alone, and in support of that assertion, allow me to draw your attention to the materials out of which this prosecution has been framed. You have heard that on the evening of the 28th July, a meeting was held at the Chartist-hall, Webber-street, and that I at that meeting delivered a speech which has been termed seditious. Was there ever a more diabolical, a more fabricated statement urged on the face of an indictment than that upon which I have this day been accused? I have been accused of having mali<lb></lb>ciously and wilfully excited her Majesty's subjects to rebellion, and so forth. Now I contend that the remarks I made use of at that meeting are support<lb></lb>able by historical facts. You have heard from the evidence of Wm. Counsel, the Government reporter, that I felt a pleasure and satisfaction in expressing my opinion of the policy of the British Government towards Ireland, and in moving the resolution condemnatory of the base and unconstitutional acts of the British Legislature I stated that it was necessary to refer to history to support the assertion which I then made, and on referring to history, what do we find? why, that up to the period of 1782, Ireland was free from English legislative thraldom, and it was not till that date that the Act 6 Geo. III. passed, which claimed and exercised the power of British legislation over Ireland. Now the mere passing of that Act, even of itself, admits the pre<lb></lb>existence of freedom, and leads us to inquire how a nation, that long before 1300 possessed its own legislature, came to give up to a foreign power the right of self-government. What do we find? Why, that the Irish parliament, backed by the Irish people, exerted this power of independence in legisla<lb></lb>tion for their own country. But passing over that period, and coming down to the time of the American war, when that people revolted against England for attempting to trample on their legislative rights, and insisted upon perfect legislative independence with such an ardour and force of arms, that England became alarmed and proposed a final adjustment, which was entered into. But England never yet preserved or performed a treaty with Ireland; and thus we perceive one encroachment after another, until we come down to the period of 1800, when the Act of Union was carried by the most diabolical and contemptible means that was ever resorted to for a class legislation; which atrocious acts of plunder has at last plunged the country into all the horrors of insurrection. Such has been the policy of the English Government towards Ireland. Will you tell the world, by your verdict this day, that it is sedition for a man to sympathise with Ireland's wrongs? To tell them that they have a right to use any constitutional means which they have in their power to remove the tyrants from power who have brought them to death's door by heir acts of tyranny? Will you tell the world, by your verdict, that it is sedition to tell your countrymen to organize and oppose the same tyrants</p>

               <p>who are trying to reduce you to the same depths of misery and degradation? Will you tell the world that it is sedition for a man to try to unite English<lb></lb>men and Irishmen together? Gentlemen, I hope better things of you; are: are men, I presume, who are moving in what are called the middle circles of society, some of whom, I doubt not, have sons who, when brought to years of maturity, will have to grapple and struggle with the affairs of business; think seriously of the ruin and misery which the atrocious policy of the Government is entailing upon you by seeking to destroy thac spirit of justice and growing intelligence which the working classes are determined to enjoy, and to remove the fruits of those who have so long laboured for the working classes, just as they are beginning to make their appearance. But the working classes are beginning to understand that they are the wealth-pro<lb></lb>ducers, and are entitled to receive a proportionate share of enjoyment, and they are determined to meet from time to time to consider what steps are likely to promote their cause, and to discuss and promote tbeir principles and if the noble Lord at the head of the Government supposes that by employing a few thousand policemen to break the heads of honest and hard-working men, and by employing spies to procure convictions, through the means of prejudiced juries, he will ultimately find himself mistaken. The avidity with which the great majority of the people of this country have adopted the principles of the people's charter, seems greatly to have frightened the noble Lord at the head of the Government; and no wonder, when the eyes of the people being to open, and they begin to inquire how the taxes have become so enormously increased, and when they see nothing but bankruptcy and ruin staring then in the face. This has led a great many men to desire a speedy change in public affairs, and to inquire how this state of things has been brought about, The noble lord has said that the disaffection of the Chartists has been to such an unparalleled extent, as has obliged him to increase the rates in order to support the men who had come forward in order to put down that disaffec<lb></lb>tion; but this lame story has only led the people to make further inquiries, and to adopt such measures as to bring about a better state of things, and the means they had decided upon are the principles of the people's charter. Do you know those principles, Gentlemen?—if not, allow me to refer you to that excellent little pamphlet written by Dr. M'Douall, wherein be states what they are, and what they want. I believe that the principles of the people's charter contain one of the best political creeds that was ever submitted. Its points are easy of conception, and its principles are just. It does not, as some assert, wish to destroy one class of society to raise up another, nothing of the sort; but it does wish to give to all a just political equality. It seeks to give to every man of sound mind, untainted by crime, a voice in the election of the representatives of the people. It seeks to destroy a pro<lb></lb>perty qualification, for the purpose of giving men of talent, without pecuniary resources, an opportunity of obtaining a seat in Parliament. It seeks to pre<lb></lb>vent that disgraceful intimidation and bribery which is carried on under the present system. It seeks to shorten the duration of Parliaments, to keep the representatives of the people honest. It seeks, as nearly as possible, equal electoral districts, so as to give as fair a representation of the country at large as can possibly be obtained. These are some of the leading principles of the charter; and for calling upon my fellow-countrymen to organise, never to cease their agitation, but to avail themselves of every opportunity to forward their cause, I have been charged with all the foul and malignant falsehoods contained in the indictment; and for this the learned counsel wishes to obtain conviction. I feel assured, Gentlemen, that I need not remind you of the</p>

               <p>good conduct and forbearance of the people on 10th April, when the Govern<lb></lb>ment mustered all their forces, and banded all their troops, to prevent the people from getting free access to Parliament. I feel assured that you are already convinced that the contents of the indictment are nothing more than a tissue of falsehoods, and that this is only intended for the purpose of putting down public opinion—of destroying the right of public meeting, and making victims of honest men. Do not lend yourselves as the tool of such a Government; but let your manly and consistent verdict this day tell the tyrants of misrule and oppression, that Englishmen shall inherit the ancient rights of their forefathers, and the gratitude of a grateful people will reverence your memories in ages yet to come.</p>

On the 21st of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing in the shop, outside of the counter; my fellowshopman, who is not here, was behind the counter; these handkerchiefs hung over a rail, three yards within the door - I saw them not a moment before they were missed; I was folding up a piece of print, and on looking round I saw two or three men standing at the side of the window; about a minute after that I cast my eye round, and saw the five handkerchiefs being taken away; the prisoner had just got outside the door with them; I went out and saw him rolling them up, and putting them under his coat - the others followed him; I went after him, and had not got three yards before I said, "My man I want you," his accomplices said, run; I said "If you do I'll run after you;" he ran - I followed, and finding he got the better of me, I called, Stop thief! I lost sight of him for about half a minute; as he threw the handkerchiefs over my head - I was going back to the shop, and the witness gave them to me; I took them home knowing other persons were pursuing him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. He was a stranger to you? A. Perfectly so; he is one of the three I saw outside, and he is the one who had the handkerchiefs - the others got away.</p>

            . I am a cooper, and work at the London Docks; I was in Bishopsgate-street about the length of a house from the prisoner; two young men were near him; I put my chips off my shoulders - I heard him say, Stop thief! and saw him run in the road, and turn to the right towards Moorfields - Holiday came out; I lost sight of the prisoner for about half a minute, as he turned the corner; I am quite sure he is the same man - when he got about ten yards in the road I saw him throw the handkerchiefs down; I picked them up and gave them to Holiday - I took hold of him, and am certain he is the man who had the handkerchiefs; I should not know the others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it dark? A. Yes, it was seven o'clock - I lost sight of him for half a minute; but the moment I turned the corner, I saw him again, and knew him; he was a stranger before.</p>

            . I am a constable; I was standing in Liverpool-street, the prisoner ran by me, and several persons after him - I lost sight of him for a minute, and when I caught sight of him again he was in custody; the prisoner was delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to Saunderson? A. About six yards.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had beeb over the water, and on my return I heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran down Liverpool-street after the men, and on turning the corner they ran too fast for me and got away; I turned back and the gentleman said, "Why this is him," I said, "No, the man is gone on."</p>

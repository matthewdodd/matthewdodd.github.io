                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Parker; we live in Shoreditch; the prisoner was in our service. I left town on the 28th of October, and returned in a few days—she was then gone—I went into her bed-room the day after my return, and opened a box of mine which was there—I found it locked—I missed from it some Irish linen, some cam<lb></lb>bric, and some calico—I missed some petticoats from another part of the house—on the 17th of November, from information I received, I went to the prisoner's mother's, at Gillingham, in Kent—I found the prisoner there—I said to her, "I have come about those things I have lost"—she was very indignant, and said she had nothing belonging to me, not so much as a piece of rag to wrap round her finger—I said it was of no use her saying so; I had lost those things, and there was no one else in the house—I said she had made Mr. Smith, the foreman, some shirt-fronts, which I believed to be of my linen—she said they were not, and was very insolent—I said to our bailiff, who drove me down, "You hear how insolent she is, go and get a constable"—the prisoner then said, "I did take the linen to make the fronts, and about half a yard more to line a dress"—there was one of her boxes in the room—I looked into it, and saw some muslin, which I believe belonged to me—I asked her mother where her other things were—she said the chief of her things were left in town at her aunt's, in Elliott's-row—I went there, and saw a box which the prisoner had had at my house, and in it I found a towel with the name of Parker on it, and in another paper box of hers I found a black figured waistband of mine—I found a baby's lace cap in a box belonging to her aunt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am constable of Gillingham. I was fetched to the prisoner's mother's house—Mrs. Parker said the prisoner had robbed her, and taken some linen and other things—she gave her in charge—I went into the room, and Mrs. Parker asked the prisoner about some other things—she said, "I know nothing of them—the linen I took for the fronts, but not much"—she said Mr. Smith gave her a sove<lb></lb>reign for the fronts—I saw this piece of muslin found—the prisoner said her sister gave it her.</p>

I went to Elliott's-row, and saw a box, which Mrs. Parker pointed out as the prisoner's—I found in it this towel marked "Parker"—I suppose Elliott's-row is three miles from Mr. Parker's, in Shoreditch—I am not aware where the pri<lb></lb>soner's linen was washed, or whether she would have occasion to send to Elliott's-row—this cap and waistband were found in the prisoner's aunt's box up stairs.</p>

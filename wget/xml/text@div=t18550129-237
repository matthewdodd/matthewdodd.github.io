                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. John Thomas, upholsterer, of No. 73 and 74, Bishopsgate-street. The prisoner was in their employment; it was his duty to feed the machine which cleans the horse hair; other boys were employed to carry it away, the prisoner only had to feed it—he has been in the employment turned eleven years, and had 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, but did not lodge there—on the night of 15th Jan., I observed a ladder in the yard, leaning against the shed which is at the side of the premises where one of the machines runs—I asked the prisoner what business the ladder had there; he said that he had a tile to put on—I said, "Well, go up and do it"—he went up, and was out of my sight; when he came down I asked him what he had come down for; he said that he could not find the tile, and he would put a bit of board over the hole; he went up again, taking a bit of board with him—he had no light, it was about six o'clock in the evening, and was dusk—he remained up there a few minutes, and I heard something heavy drop from the roof into the ruins, which is where forty houses are being pulled down—the prisoner had taken up nothing but the board; he could not have had anything in his hand without my seeing him—I left him on the roof, and ran round to the ruins; I found nothing at first, but turned round and saw a little boy, who said, "Mr. Smith, there was a tall man ran out of that corner"—I went into the corner, which was about twenty yards off, and found two bags of hair weighing 42 lbs. with the bags; the value of the hair is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb.—the little boy is not here; I know him, he lives in Newman's-place, Bishopsgate-street; they told me at the Mansion-house that he would not be required, or I would have brought him—I gave one of the bags to him, took the other myself, and we brought them back to the factory—the prisoner was then standing by the engine house door; he had had no opportunity of running away, as I always lock the factory door when I go in and out, and I did so at that time; everybody was gone off the premises but the prisoner and myself, and I had the key in my pocket—</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 651). On 15th Jan. I went to Smith's buildings to search the apartments where the prisoner lived with his father—I found there 11b. of hair—the prisoner was not there, he was in custody—as I was taking him to Newgate after the remand, he said that he would not deny the charge, he would not tell a lie about it; that he carried the hair from the warehouse on to the roof, and then threw it on to the ruins in Angel-alley—I asked him who was going to carry it away, what he was going to do with it; he said that his conscience would not let him carry it away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not say so; he asked me whether I did throw it out, and I told him if I had thrown it out my conscience would not have let me take it away. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am sure I did not put the question to you first; I had not been speaking to you about the charge, except that you asked me what I thought you should get, and I said I did not know; you then said that you would not deny the charge.</p>

               <p>Or did you pick them up? - They picked me up, they stop'd me twice. The other woman took hold of me, and the prisoner took the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was the prisoner that took the watch out of your pocket? - I can swear it was her; the other had her hands about my neck at the time.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman of St. Martins in the Fields. Between two and three o'clock I heard a person call Watch. I took my lanthorn and met the gentleman and the prisoner with him. He charged her with picking his pocket of his watch. She said, she had not taken it, but the other girl had. I bid her give me the watch if she had it. She gave it me, and I delivered it to the constable of the night. The prosecutor mentioned the number of the watch before it was opened in the watch-house. [It was produced in court.]</p>

               <p>As I was going down St. Martin's-lane, I saw the watch lying on the ground, and took it up.</p>

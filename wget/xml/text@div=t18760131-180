                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness—I am now living with her—in 1874 Yurgense came to live there under the name of Ahlborn—Soisson used to cohie there to see him—I believe Ahlborn had an office in Regent Street, No. 20—I have been with him there—in February last year I had a disagreement with my mother and went to live at Hatfield Street, Blackfriars—Ahlborn used to visit me there, and during the last week he lived with me there; we then went together to 95, Borough Road; while there he used to receive letters in the name of Ahlborn, foreign and English letters—I have been to the Post Office in Dover Road with Ahlborn and Soisson when they fetched letters from there; they were addressed to H. Stone, Post Office, Dover Road—at that time they had an office at 15, Queen Street, Cheapside—I have been there and have seen both the prisoners there—I have been there alone for letters at Alhborn's request; I believe they were foreign letters—I removed from the Borough Road to 3, Spencor Street, Clerkenwell—Ahlborn lived there with me also, and Soisson used to come there to see him sometimes, not very often—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing; I wrote it at Ahlborn's request. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "1st, September, 1875" (addressed to Mr. Wagner, of Paris, and signed, 'Albor Yuigense and Co., per proouration.') "We are in possession of your</p>

During the time I was living with Ahlborn I pawned things, these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the tickets representing some of the things I pawned. (<hi rend="italic">There were for bracelets, and articles of wearing apparel and furniture.</hi>) I believe they wanted the money—when I was living in Spencer Street, I recollect going with both the prisoners to the Waterloo Station—they said they were going to Paris; I saw them start together in the train—I can't recollect the date, it was the third day after we were in Spencer Street—when they were together they spoke in German or Dutch; I was not able to understand them—the endorsement "Albor Yurgense &amp; Co." on this bill of exchange I believe to be Ahlborn's writing—I cannot see the signature on this (<hi rend="italic">marked F</hi> 1) it is too much obliterated—the endorsement on these two bills (K and L) I believe to be Ahlbon's; also the signature "Albor Yurgense &amp; Co." to these letters (<hi rend="italic">looking at a number marked B D, I</hi> 1 <hi rend="italic">to I</hi> 13, <hi rend="italic">omitting</hi> 7, <hi rend="italic">also M and N</hi>)—the signature "J. Channon to this bill (A R) is my writing; I signed that at Ahlborn's request, also the endorsement J. Channon"—the signature "Albor Yurgense &amp; Co.," at the bottom is Ahlborn's writing—this other bill (A Q) drawn by J. Channon, is my writing, also the endorsement, I did that at Ahlborn's request—the other endorsement "Albor Yurgense &amp; Co.," is Ahlborn's—this other bill(A S, 1) is drawn and endorsed by "H. Soisson"—those signatures look like Soisson's writing, also this A S 2 and A S 4; it is the same handwriting—the endorsements "Albor Yurgense &amp; Co." are Ahlborn's—the drawer's and endorser's signature to A S 5, I believe to be Ahlborn's, also to A S 6 and 7—the signature to this letter (A G) from Albor Yurgense &amp; Co. to Messrs. Durrschmidt is Ahlborn's—I have seen this cheque-book (A C) in Ahlborn's possession, either in Spencer Street, or the Borough Road, the endorsement "Albor Yurgense "to this bill of exchange (B J) I balieve to be Alhborn's.</p>

Let me know by re<lb></lb>turn of post what 1 am to think, as I should like to be made easy about it as soon as possible"—on the 12th August I received this.

(<hi rend="italic">This referred to the telegram as merely a request to know if the acceptances were genuine, and stated that they were still waiting for a definite reply from their correspondent.</hi>) Between the 17th and 23rd of August I received letters from Messrs.

Perelly &amp; Co.; valued received. Glasgow, Tassie &amp; Co."—the other bill is drawn by Cohen &amp; Tober, no address, accepted by C. Wagner—I never got a penny for that bill, it was returned to me; they were worthless bills—on the 30th August I returned them to Yurgense &amp; Co. in this letter, stating that in default of a satisfactory reply I should take means to regain possession of my acceptances—on the 1st September I received this letter (I 7 <hi rend="italic">already read</hi>), and on the 3rd September another to the same effect—I then received this of the 7th September enclosing two bills amounting together to 2,155 francs 65 cents on Amsterdam and Brus<lb></lb>sels, and on the 8th September I replied, enclosing the bills and demanding the return of my acceptances—I never got any money, I got back the</p>

About October and November I and Trafford had observation of the prisoners movements—on 25th November I went with Mr. Wagner and Trafford to Spencer Street, Clerk-enwell—I saw Yurgense come out of No. 3—he went into a Post Office, I followed him and he was given into my custody by Mr. Wagner—the bill marked F was shown to him, and he said "That is my signature"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him a military certificate exempting Carl Frederick Ahlborn from service—I went to 15, Queen Street, on the second floor, the name "Albor Yurgense and Co," was painted on the door—the room is 9 feet long and 4 feet wide—I made a search and found some envelopes which I produce, with "Albor Yurgense &amp; Co." printed at the top—that was the whole of the property there except a letter or two, a table and a chair—"Albor Yurgense &amp; Co., financial agents, 15, Queen Street, London, E.C." is on the letters—I found this bill (B J) there—I afterwards went to 3, Spencer Street, a bedroom and sitting room on the first floor—I found Miss Channon there—I made a search there and found six dozen aluminum pencil cases, twenty pawn tickets, twelve of them relating to new opera glasses and the other eight to wearing apparel—I also found these two bills of exchange (K and L), and a good deal of unused note paper headed "C. Ahlborn, 20, Regent Street," also the whole of the correspondence from Mr. Wagner which has been read, and these letters from Chantrain &amp; Co., of Brussels, marked P 1 to P 8—since then I have been to Brussels and to Messrs. Chantrain's offices—I there saw ten letters in the letter book, signed "Albor Yurgense &amp; Co., and headed 15, Queen Street"—they were torn out of the letter book in my presence, and I initialled them—I have since received them from Messrs. Chantrain by post—I produce a letter book that was at Spencer Street, and in that are copies of the letters that I received from Messrs. Chantrian. (<hi rend="italic">This correspondence consisted of applications on the part of Albor Yurgense &amp; Co., to Messrs.

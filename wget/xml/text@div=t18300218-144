            . I am book-keeper at the Kent and Essex tavern. I saw the prisoner three times before I received the goods; one time was about a week before I received them - he gave himself the name of Smith, of Halstead, and said he had taken a house at Bockingchurch-street, and had set up a new van to go from and to London; that Mr. Jesup, and Mr. Brockway had promised him the charge of their goods, and he should have a great deal of goods to come to our yard, if I would take them in for him and book them - I saw him shortly before these goods came; he said he expected some goods for Mr. Jesup and Mr. Brockway in a few days, and no doubt there would be plenty sent to go by him; on the 24th of November I received the goods from Blunden, for Mr. Jesup, of Halstead, to go by Smith.</p>

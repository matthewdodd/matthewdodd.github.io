            . I live in Cornwall-court. The prisoner lived in the next room to me. I went with the constable to a house in Parker-street, and saw the fender and some fire-irons, which were Mr. M'Crobie's, who took them to his own house again. The prisoner did not say how she got them. I was sworn before the Magistrate, and stated that she told the constable the property belonged to Mr. M'Crobie, and she had pawned the quilt for 1s. 6d.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took up the prisoner; she said she was very sorry, and gave me the key of the room which she had taken in Parker-street. We found the bed and bolster, the fire irons, and other things, which, she said, were Mr. M'Crobie's, and she had pawned the quilt for 1s. 6d., but she hoped I would take it out and she would pay me - these two chairs were found there.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A young person who was with me took the things out; I paid Mr. M'Corbie 7s. a week the first time I was with him, and then I was away for a fortnight, and returned with the young woman, who took away the things - I took only my own things away - I had paid 5s. of the week's rent myself, and this young woman would not pay the 2s.; but she said if I would go on with the things, she would give up the key and follow me; I saw her again on the Friday evening or Saturday morning, and she told me what she had done; I then took the key, and took my things to the room where hers were; another person persuaded me to return them, which I should have done on the Monday, but I was taken on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character, one of whom said she would take her into her service immedidiately.</p>

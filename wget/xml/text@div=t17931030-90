            ? - He came to my house along with a gentleman of the name of Decosta, and he wanted some handkerchiefs, and Mr. Mendoza looked out three dozen handkerchiefs, and said that he would call at twelve o'clock and pay for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that? - Mr. Mendoza; I cannot recollect whether he bought any that same day or not; he came two or three days after, and he knocked at the door, somebody opened it to him, and the young man that I have got at home came and told me, Mr. Mendoza wanted to speak to me, I was in the counting house, when I came to him, he says to me, I am come for six dozen of handkerchiefs, Mr. Decosta has sent me for them, I cannot exactly say the word, whether I must have six dozen, or I am come for six dozen, or give me six dozen; but I know he said Mr. Decosta has sent me for them. After that I went up stairs, took him up stairs into the warehouse, and he looked out six dozen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300134"></xptr>of handkerchiefs, I did let him have those handkerchiefs, and my partner he came into the room himself about the same time while I was in the place with Mr. Mendoza, and I told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever you told him did you tell him in the presence of the prisoner? - On the contrary I took him aside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass in the presence of the prisoner? - - Nothing more than I let him have the handkerchiefs, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Nathan, in the first place I take it for granted you know Mr. Decosta very well, you live in his house with him? - I beg your pardon, he lived in my house when he was in town.</p>
               <p>Q. As you know him perfectly well perhaps you have had many dealings with him? - I have known him for a number of years, I knew him abroad and I knew him in England.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know his real name? -

               <p>Q. You have told my lord exactly what Mr. Mendoza said to you when he came the second time? - Then he said I am come, or I must have some handkerchief, Mr. Decosta has sent me for them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that was it? - As nigh as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask for six pieces or six dozen? - He asked for six dozen, and not six pieces, I am most certain. To take me on my oath I cannot say whether pieces or dozen, but to the best of my knowledge it was dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. He had bought some of you? - He had, Mr. Decosta has lent me several hundred pounds, I thought I could not refuse Mr. Decosta, and as he came along with Mr. Decosta I could not refuse him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many transactions have you had with Mendoza by the desire of Mr. Decosta? - I don't know that ever he came above twice in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he never came above twice? - I will take my sacred oath that he never came but twice in one day.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times has he came without Mr. Decosta, and as he said by Mr. Decosta's orders? - He never came but that time with Mr. Decosta's orders, the other times Mr. Decosta was along with him; the first time he came, he came from the country with Mr. Decosta, and Mr. Decosta remained in town the same day, and he returned and paid me for these handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in the afternoon Mr. Mendoza came again? - He did, and paid for what he had in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come again after he had come twice that day? - A few days afterwards, whether it was two or three days I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give credit to him on Mr. Decosta having sent him, or on his saying that Mr. Decosta had sent him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you had done twice before, once without Mr. Decosta, and once with him? - No, only once.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the second time when he came in the afternoon, that he came with Mr. Decosta? - He came in, but Mr. Decosta was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he present when he asked you for some pieces of handkerchiefs? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you will not take on you to swear whether Mr. Decosta was present or not? - He was in the house, but whether he was in the room or not I cannot swear.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the handkerchiefs on credit? - He had.</p>
               <p>Q. The second he had also on the credit of Mr. Decosta? - I don't know whether it was on the credit of Mr. Decosta or not.</p>

             in London, a linen draper wholesale, we never sell less than a piece.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Pray how long have you been in partnership with Mr. Levy? - Much about that time, just before that.</p>
               <p>Q. What line of life had you been in before? - A dealer in all manner of articles, jewellery, watches and linen drapery, diamonds and every thing, and deal in them now.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in partnership with Mr. Levy? - Ever since sometime in May.</p>
               <p>Q. You never have been a witness in this court before? - I never was, only I was called to the character of a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you never was in this court only to give a man a character? - I will take my oath and ten oaths unless it was to give one man a particular acquaintance of mine, a character, that was an old man, his name was De Frize, he was here for finding a bank note, I gave him a character.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of being a witness at Worcester? - I was no witness at Worcester, I was quite the contrary; a particular person found a saddle bag of letters, and brought them to me, and I think to my credit and honour I brought the whole up to Sir. Sampson Wright's, and delivered it up to Sir Sampson Wright.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you admitted on evidence for the crown, as an accomplice at Worcester? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give evidence at that trial afterwards? - I told the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you taken up for the robbery yourself? - Who? I taken up! never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Lee? - Yes, by reputation all the world know him; I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Lee, and did Mr. Lee advise you to tell the story about the Worcester business? - After I came to town to surrender myself.</p>
               <p>Court. You said you was not a witness at Worcester, but quite the contrary, what did you mean? - I went down to tell the truth against the young man that had given me the things; I went down by order of Sir Sampson Wright.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he sent somebody with you? - No, I went down by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You said also just now that you surrendered yourself? - I went down to Worcester to sell my goods, a young man knocked at the door where I was in the room, and told me that he had found something on the road of great value.</p>
               <p>Q. You believed him of course? - He shewed me a great quantity of bank notes and other notes, I asked him how he came by them? He said he found them going along the road; I was very much frightened thinking that it belonged to the post office, and it turned out so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What did you give him for them? - How can you say that I gave him any thing for them?</p>
               <p>Court. What did you do with them? - I came immediately to London, and told my father of it; my father says, if you will take my advice, I would have you go immediately to some magistrate, for I don't believe the young man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is this ago? - I am about twenty-eight now; this was about ten or eleven years ago. The young man then went away from me directly, and I went to Sir Sampson Wright's, and told him the things were given me so and so, and he made me sign a paper, and told me that I was to appear at the assizes at Worcester. He did not commit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300136"></xptr>me, nor take any security in the least; I don't know whether he asked my father about security it is so long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying before, that you was not a witness, but on the contrary?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You came from Worcester to London to surrender; you did not say any thing till you came to London. What did you not talk to the farmers on the road about this business, or did you come to London first, and stay till there was a reward offered? - No, I had no reward at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the young man taken up at Worcester; and afterwards you surrendered in town? - I don't know whether he was taken or not taken before; I don't know yet whether he was taken before or after.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go before a magistrate at Worcester? - Because I was very young, I did not know what to do.</p>
               <p>Q. You was old enough to take care of that property that you found in that odd way? - It was brought to me by a person that did find it; Mr. Isaacs can tell you more about the business than I know.</p>
               <p>Court. You was in partnership with Mr. Levy in May; had you articles? - We had, but we have destroyed them some time since.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it dissolved? - About a fortnight or three weeks back; the business could not answer, it was in the linen drapery line.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to dissolve the partnership? - The trade did not answer in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to go about the country? - And before this revolution in France, I used to travel into Flanders and Brabant, but since I cannot go; I used to deal very much in the linen drapery articles, watches, and other articles, and used to buy some for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mendoza? - Ever since I was a child, this eight or nine years by sight, but never having any connection with him, any further than by reputation.</p>
               <p>Q. Never dealt with him? - Never had any dealings with him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever apply to him for the money of these handkerchiefs? - I did; I applied to him when I heard that Mr. Decosta had not sent him; I did not apply to him for the money, but for the goods; the profit was not so great, and I would as soon take the goods again; I let him have the goods on account of Mr. Decosta, and I sold them very cheap to Mr. Decosta.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sell cheaper to Mr. Decosta than to any body else? - I don't know that I did, but he is a man that has lent me great sums of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say on your oath, that you sold to Decosta at a cheaper rate than to any body else? - If Mr. Decosta came into the place, and to say what he wanted, he might have it at prime cost for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any difference in the price of the articles you sold to Mr. Decosta, and those you sold to Mendoza? you sold three pieces to Mendoza before, did you make any difference of Mendoza's paying for them or Mr. Decosta? - He paid twenty-four shillings for them; the price depends on the fineness, in the same parcels we pick out some finer and some coarser, which makes a difference in the price.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write to Mendoza about it, and desire him to give you back the handkerchiefs? - I cannot recollect what I wrote to him; I remember some words that I wrote to him, instead of writing to him at first I did not, I went to a house in Duke's-place where he very often comes to; I said, if you do not give me back the goods that you have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300137"></xptr>taken from me under Mr. Decosta's name, I will get a warrant for you; he did not come with the goods; I saw him two or three times, and he made some frivolous excuse; at last he told me, if you ask me again for the goods, I will give you as good a licking as ever you had in your life. I always accused him of taking them in Mr. Decosta's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the letter, and see if it is your hand writing? - It may be mine; I cannot tell that that is mine or not.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath will you swear that that is not your hand writing? - I cannot say it is not, nor can I say it is.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you believe? - It looks like my hand writing; I believe if it is not mine it is well made after it.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have an answer. Do you believe that to be your hand writing or not? - I cannot swear it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't ask you to swear? - I believe it is my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the contents? - If he did not produce goods or money, I should get a warrant for him, and go to some magistrate and tell the case.</p>
               <p>The letter read.</p>
               <p>If you do not send me my handkerchiefs this day, which you have taken from me, on commission to return them the next day, or my money, I have plenty of witnesses, you will feel the effects; and be assured if you do not come by to morrow you will find the ill consequences of it yourself.</p>

I am surprised at your impudence, writing to me for money or goods, I have none of your goods nor know nothing at all about you; if Mr. Decosta will apply to me, I will speak to him. From one that thinks nothing at all about you.</p>

               <p>I have known Mr. Mendoza for a little time, since May.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him for any goods at any time? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him for any silk handkerchiefs, to Messrs. Nathan and Levy? - Mr. Mendoza to my country house at Bethnal-green, and we sat down and played at cards together, he asked me if I had any handkerchiefs? I said I did not deal in handkerchiefs, but I had lent money to Messrs. Nathan and Levy to go into trade; then says he, when I go to town I will be obliged to you to go with me to these gentlemen, to see if I can get those things I want. The next day I saw him again, he asked me if I was going to town? I said I was; then, says he, I will go with you, and he went with me, and he took three dozen of handkerchiefs the 24th of May, then after having taken them there he went there again, and got six dozen of handkerchiefs. I know no more about the matter.</p>

               <p>24th, Nov. I was proceding towards my home between half-past 9 and a quarter to 10—I went in to fetch a pot of porter at the Pickering Arms, in Pickering-street—I came out with the pot in my hand, and had not proceeded above one hundred yards before I was pounced upon from behind, and the prisoner came in front of me, and took my watch out of my pocket—I struggled with him, and received a blow across the cheek-bone, at the same time fingers were put into my waistcoat-pocket, and a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece taken away—it was so sudden I could not make any resistance—my watch was left, but the case was torn off and lost—I did not give any alarm at the time-—I was close at home, and staggered in doors as quick as I could—I subsequently gave information to the police-constable Taylor, the same night; he came to my place—I gave him a description of the person who had robbed me—the following Thursday evening I saw the prisoner outside the Angel, with three others, and picked him out as the man.</p>

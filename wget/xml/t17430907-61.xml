            . In July last I came home one Night about eight o'Clock, and being tired I went to Bed; the next Morning I arose between four and five, and found my House had been broke open, and all my Things gone; the back Window was unkey'd, and the Window-shutter put up again; there was a Pane of Glass taken out at which a Person might put their Hand in and open the Casement. I took up a Person that I mistrusted, and she cried out Murder, and then the Neighbours described the Prisoner, and said they saw such an one go in, but they did not know her Name. Upon hearing a Noise and Disturbance, the Prisoner who lodged at the next Door, came out; then one of the Neighbours swore that she was the Person that went in and out twice. The Prisoner said if I would not hurt her she would tell me where the Things were, she went with me to the Pawnbroker's and asked for the Things; they brought them out, but would not let me have them without paying the Use, tho' I told them they were my Things that were stole, and there was their Prisoner; the Prisoner ran away and went to her Lodging, and I took her that Night.</p>

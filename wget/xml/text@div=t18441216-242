                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, and live in Winchester-street, Salisbury. About the middle of the day, on the 29th of Nov., I was walking in Ratcliff-highway—I felt a pull at my coat—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I saw my handkerchief in the hand of the prisoner, who was just behind me—I said, "Halloo, my friend, that is my handkerchief, if you will allow me I will take charge of it"—he said, "I was just going to give it you, sir, I picked it up"—I said, "That is impossible, for it is very dirty, and there is no dirt on it"—there was another man, who held out his hand towards the prisoner, as I thought, take it—I had a friend with me, and I said to him, "If you will take to one of his arms I will take him to the station"—the prisoner said he was a married man, and had two or three small children, and bad been very much in distress, and was not in the habit of doing such things—I said, "I would have given you half-a-crown if you had told me you was his in dis<lb></lb>tress"—he said he was very near-sighted, and asked me to look at his eyes—I said, "It is no place to look at your eyes here"—he then became very restive, and tried to get away—he struck my friend, and struck me, and cut my under lip—my friend called out "Police!" and the officer came to our assistance—this is my handkerchief.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When you turned round I did not conceal the handkerchief; I was giving it to you after I picked it off the ground.</p>

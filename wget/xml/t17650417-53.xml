            . I am servant to Mrs. Heath. Last Tuesday morning I went to Mr. Lawson's for some work; he told me he had lost a parcel of brass work; I went up and informed my mistress. A little after that the prisoner came with these, and offered them to sale, and we stopped him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Heath. My husband was a shagreen case maker, and I follow the business: the prisoner brought these sets of brass work, and offered them for sale; I having heard the prosecutor lost some, stopped him and them.</p>

               <p>I belong to the Court of Conscience: there was an execution granted against one Howard; he could not make up the money, but said, If I would take these things and dispose of them, the money should go to pay part of the debt: I was agreeable to it, and very innocently took the things to sell for him, in order to take him out of trouble.</p>

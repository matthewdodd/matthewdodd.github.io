                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 145). On Sunday morning, 21st December, at a few minutes before 3 o'clock, I was in College Street, Camberwell, near Mr. Brutton's house, and heard a noise at the rear, as of forcing open a door—shortly afterwards I saw the prisoner come from the rear of the house to the front, and in attempting to get over the fence he fell, and I ran and caught hold of him—I asked him what he had been doing there—he said that he had been home with the two sons, who were friends of his; he did not say that they were the sons of the owner of the house—I said "What noise was that I heard at the back of the house?"—he said they were very nearly all drunk, and were making a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I said "You must go back, that I may see whether that is correct"—when we got to the back door the prosecutor was just outside it, in his night shirt, with a candle in his hand—I asked him if he had any sons—he said "No; bring him here; somebody has just broken open my door; I will show you"—the prisoner said "I have been to the closet; I came home with the sons, and one is named <hi rend="italic">Fred.</hi>"—he was given into my custody—I searched him at the station, and found on him these two gimlets and this spanner, which is to screw nuts with—he was quite sober—I went back, and found <hi rend="italic">P</hi> 388 examining the place—there were marks on the door which corresponded with the spanner—I have not the least doubt about that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been eight years in the Police—the fence was about 3 feet high—there is a little garden in front of the house—I have made inquiries, and find that the prisoner has been in Mr. Midhurst's service between fifteen and sixteen years, who discharged him for getting drunk—I also found that he has been in Mr. Roche's service three years—Mr. Roche did not say that he would take him back directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sidney Cottage, Camberwell—on 20th December I fastened up my house, locked the back door, and went to bed—I heard a noise at the back of the house between 2 and 3 o'clock; I took a carving knife, went down, and found the back door wide open—it was burst in three places, the two bolts and the lock—I saw a short man on the staircase inside the house, who ran away when he saw me with the carving knife—I did not lose sight of him till he got over the fence and fell down—I saw the policeman at that time—I was then within 6 yards of him, and the policeman brought the prisoner to me—I have no sons and no relative named <hi rend="italic">Fred.</hi>—the prisoner said that he had been to the closet—this iron bar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) does not belong to me—this spade is mine—these two catches for the latch and the bolt were forced off the door—my house is in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 388). On Sunday morning, December 21st, about 3.40, I examined Mr. Brutton's back door, and found it had been forced open—there were several marks on it of a new spanner, which I saw afterwards—the door had also been cut with this spade; I saw</p>

               <p>marks of it—I found this iron instrument in a corner by the door, and the sill was broken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were no nuts on the door which required removing—this is a three-quarter spanner, which is used for turning any nuts—the door was burst open by means of the shovel, the spanner, and this bar—what caused more noise than usual was that there were two wooden supporters—it is a wooden house.</p>

I live at 55, Eagle Street, Holborn—on the Saturday before Christmas the prisoner came to my house to put a knocker on my door—he brought two gimlets and this spanner—he remained there from 7.20 till 11.45, when I left him in the Albany. Tavern, at the corner of the Albany Road, about 20 yards from the prosecutor's house—we had a good deal to drink, and the pair of us had had pretty well enough—I said to him "If I don't come back in a few minutes, or in the course of half-an-hour, don't you wait"—he had nothing like this iron bar in his possession—I have known him sixteen years; he is an honest, respectable mechanic—there never was a charge against him, that I know of.</p>

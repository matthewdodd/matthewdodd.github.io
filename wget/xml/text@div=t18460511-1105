                  </hi>. I live at Knightsbridge-terrace, and am a cheesemonger. I have a friend of the name of Smith, who has assisted me—the prisoner has been in my service ever since I began business, which is five or six weeks—on the 1st of May, about eight o'clock in the evening, I asked the prisoner to go into the cellar with me to look at some butter and cheese—that had been previously arranged with Mr. Smith—nothing was discovered then—about an hour afterwards, at near nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner do something with his hat—I then asked him to go again into the cellar—when we came back Mr. Smith communicated something to me—in eight or ten minutes after, the prisoner left my premises—he was brought back by a policeman—he took off his hat, took two lumps of butter out of it, and asked me to forgive him—they were not entire rolls, they were worth about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Middlesex - I live there, myself and family, and the paupers live under the same roof - I have the management of it; the poor are kept by contract - the house belongs to the parish; the paupers have a great many rooms; I hire the servants - the overseers come there sometimes, but there is no particular room for them - there is no committee-room; they meet in the vestry of the church to do their business - the overseers and church-wardens send a note to me with the paupers, but I place them where I think fit; I buy the provisions, and am paid at per head - I pay no rent; It is part of my remuneration - I have the house and garden, and a small field ineluded in the bargain; the bread and cheese is kept in a room, called the pantry. On Saturday night, the 9th of April, we had eleven fresh loaves brought in - they were placed by themselves in the pantry; I fastened the pantry door myself, between nine and ten o'clock that night, and took the key up to my sleeping room - it is an inside door; I saw that the outer door of the house was barred when I went to bed - I got up next morning between six and seven o'clock, and found the pantry door broken open; the servant maid came down just as I did - I found it out first; the outer door was still barred, but on looking round in the kitchen I saw the casement open, which I had seen fast over night - a small square of glass had been broken before, and mended with a piece of paper; the paper was cut - a person could then put a hand through and open the casement, which was fastened the night before with a hasp; I looked about, and missed three new loaves and a piece of cheese, weighing 6lbs. or 7lbs. - I saw the cheese again the same night, about eight o'clock, in John Weatherley's-possession; I could not swear to it, but thought it very much like ours.</p>

            . I am a labourer. About half-past ten o'clock on this Sunday night I saw the prisoner against a blacksmith's-shop, at Ruislip - he said he had got a piece of cheese, which his sister had given him at Uxbridge, and three half-quartern loaves, and he should he very glad to part with a bit of it to buy him a little beer - I told him to cut off 6d. worth; he did so - I sent that home to my house by my grandson; I paid him for it; I went into Doughty's at the Bell, and saw him; he had the other bit, and said, "Well, you may as well have the other bit for 6d., for I shall only let it get dry and waste it;" I bought it - that is here now; I put it into the bar at the Bell - it laid there till the constable came; I went home when I came out of church and found the other piece of cheese there, but that is not here.</p>
               <p>GEORGE AIRES. I am a labourer. About a quarter-past eleven o'clock on the Sunday in question, I saw the prisoner in a waggon in Mr. Lee's, my master's shed - he had a quartern loaf, and told me he had met with a very good friend, that his sister had given it to him, and he would sell it to any body for 6d. - he would sooner have the money than the bread; I told him I had no money in my pocket but a few halfpence - he said,"How many have you?" I said 3 1/2d., which I gave him; there was a piece broken off the loaf, and he kept that back - I had part of the loaf, and eat it.</p>

            . This cheese is mine - I generally buy 1 cwt. at a time, and put my name on it; I know this to be part of what I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say I took three loaves - I acknowledge myself guilty, but there were two quarterns and a half which were cut, and as soon as I got out of the house, being in a state of starvation, I devoured the half-quartern - now I consider your evidence is very false. Witness. I am not certain whether I lost more, but I only lost three new loaves.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was a large ham and a piece of bacon there, but I always considered an honest man was the noblest work of God, and wished to keep myself honest - I was promted by stasrvation to do it; in my own parish there were new overseers, but they would not take office, and the others had not cleared their accounts - I went to one of the gentlemen, and said if he would give me 1s. I would go off - he refused; I was in want of victuals, and throw myself on your mercy, hoping you will pity a man who has been driven to this.</p>

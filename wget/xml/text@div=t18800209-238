                  </hi>. I am a slaughterman at the Foreign Cattle Market, Deptford—on 19th December a roan bull was sent to me to be slaughtered, and was slaughtered on my premises—the hide was in the ordinary course thrown outside the slaughterhouse door, and left there to be called for—different parties collect them, whoever they are sold to—I missed it next day—I had not sold or given any one authority to take it away—I saw it on 1st January at Osier and Palmer's yard at Bermondsey, and identified it—I had given information, and had gone to his house previously—I met him in the street about 7.30 p.m.—I had been looking for Kern all day, and could not find him—I said "Rickard, I want to speak to you"—he said "What is it?"—I said "Did not you sell two roan ox<lb></lb>hides and a roan bull-hide to Warmington's people I"—he said "Yes, I did"—I said "How did you come in possession of them?"—he stood for a minute or two, and I said "You will have to tell me"—he said "A man came to me and asked me to do a job, and I took about three hides to Bermondsey"—I said "Yes, and you sold them 1"—he said "Yes, I did"—I said "You took the money for them ten—he said "I did"—I said "Pray who was the man?"—he said "I should not know him again if you were to give me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "That is rather strange to a man so well known in the market as you that you would not know the man who was dealing with these hides; is that the only account you can give me of them?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Then I shall give you in custody," and I did so—I knew him in the Foreign Cattle Market.</p>

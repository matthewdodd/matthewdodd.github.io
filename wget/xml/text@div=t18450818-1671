I was walking up Holborn, on the 21st of July, a few minutes before seven o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner with two more persons—he did not say anything to me, but as I passed him he spat a bone into my face—I looked at him, and passed by, as I did not know whether he did it accidentally or not—when I had got about half a dozen yards past, I turned, and looked back, and saw him go to Mr. Elmes, and offer him a bone—the prisoner was eating a sheep's trotter—Mr. Elmes put up his hand to tell him to go away, and he beckoned me—I went up and told the prisoner he was doing wrong, and we could not have a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> there—the prisoner then struck me in the eye, and knocked my hat off, which I lost for some time—I reco-vered myself, and went up to the prisoner again—he struck me in the cheek—another officer came up, and we were getting him to the stationhe was very violent—we were forced to strap his legs—he kicked the strap off, and we were compelled to strap him again—he complained of his anni being hurt by our carrying him, and requested me to release him—we did so, and he made a spring up, caught me round the thighs, and bit me on the side of the thigh—the piece of flesh was very nearly out, and the blood came through my trowsers—we were obliged to secure him again, and it required seven constables to take him to the station—he bad been drinking, but I could not say he was drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of a publican, at No. 88, Holborn-hill. On the evening of the 21st of July, I was standing at the door—the prisoner was standing a few feet in front of me, with a companion—he purchased some trotters—I saw the policeman coming up, and the prisoner seemed to spit something towards him—the officer took no notice, but when he got a little further, he turned—the prisoner came up to me, and thrust a portion of the bone within a few inches of me, and said, "Will you have a bit?"—I said, "No"—he then thrust his face to mine, and said, "Kiss my,—you b—vagabond"—I put my hand against him, and said, "Go on"—he struck me, and I turned and said to Fenn, "Will you allow this?"—Fenn came up and touched him, and said, "This wont do"—he then began to strike Fenn in the face and breast, and his hat fell off—another officer came and assisted in taking the prisoner—Fenn used a proper degree of forbearance towards him.</p>

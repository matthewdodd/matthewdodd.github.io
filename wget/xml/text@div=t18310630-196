            . I am a turnkey of the Fleet. On the 15th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I saw the defendant Bailey at the entrance of the prison; he said he was waiting there for Mr. Marshal, a clerk in the warden's office, but as he did not see him, he thought I might answer his question; he then produced an office copy of causes against Gilbert Rotton, and asked if I would inform him in what Court the actions were - I made no reply; he then asked me if it was not in the Common Pleas - I gave no answer; he then said, "Oh, I see it is in the Common Pleas;" he then asked if I knew in what situation Rotton was in, if he had not applied to the Court for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors - I said I believed he had; he then asked if there had not been a remand to produce further evidence before the Court - I said I believed that was the fact; he then asked if I thought it was possible to supersede the action - I said I thought a Judge was the best to decide that question - he said they were about superseding the action, and we might expect the discharge down in a very short time; that is all that passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know any thing of Rotton or Ivey, before Rotton was committed? A. I know nothing of Rotton; I have seen Ivey coming backwards and forwards - I have been a turnkey two years - a great many persons act, in the Fleet, as agents in the Insolvent Court; I know nothing of their practising in other Courts to get discharges; I know nothing of Bailey practising in that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300101"></xptr>way; Moody acted as a messenger in the Fleet, between prisoners and their friends.</p>

            . I am a turnkey of the Fleet, and have been so nearly twenty years. Rotton was a prisoner there on the 15th of April, and on that day he prouduced a parchment to me, and said it was his discharge - lvey was in his company: they came to the gate together - I just glanced over it, and thought it a very singular kind of a document; I said I thought somebody had been playing a joke with him, that it appeared more like of a writ - they went away, and both came back in about half an hour, with the same parchment, and said it was a bona side discharge; I then took it to the office, and delivered it to Mr. Wiliam Brown, the deputy-warden; neither of them went with me - Mr. Brown said he would examine the book, and give me an answer in a few minutes - he then gave orders for Mr. Rotton and his friend, which was lvey, to be called down into the office - they came out, and lvey said, "There must be a stamp on this;" (meaning a seal) - he went away, as if for that purpose; he returned in about a quarter of an hour - said he had been to the Prothonatary's office, and paid 2s. 8d. for seal; Mr.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you acquainted with lvey before? A.

            . I am deputy-warden of the Fleet. On the 15th of April this parchment was brought to me by Foulkes, the turnkey - I declined taking it on account of its not having the official seal, and not being property drawn up; it was brought to me by Ivey in about half an hour, with an impression on the back, which it had not before - I understood him that he had got it sealed at the Prothonotary's office; I suspected it was not a regular document, and took it to the Prothonotary's office - Mr. Sherwood came back with me, and Ivey said a clerk had got it sealed at the office in the Temple, and paid 2s. 8d. for it; Rotton was present, he demanded to be discharged, and offered his fees - he was detained.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know that is the parchment - have you had it ever since? A. I have not - it is the document originally produced, by the seal and appearance altogether; I can swear to it by the drawing up and the impression on the back - it has been part of the time in my custody; I gave it to Mr. Maule, the solicitor of the Treasury, a few days after - I have seen it several times since; Ivey did not say whose clerk had got it sealed - I knew nothing about Bailey at that time; he was afterwards taken into custody by Ivey, and brought before a Magistrate - that was the first time I heard of him; I then heard he was the clerk who got it sealed - I think Ivey stated, in Bailey's presence, before the Magistrate, that Bailey had got it sealed, and he paid him the money for it- I believe Rotton was supersedable.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you delivered the parchment to Mr. Maule, was Bailey present? A. I believe he was - I do not think, upon recollection, that Bailey was supercedable, as he had given notice under the Insolvent Act - he was bailable.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any application made by either of the defendants for him to be admitted to bail? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. SHERWOOD. I am in the Prothonotary's office. This writ has nothing to do with the Court of Common Pleas one of the seals on it are those of our office; it is not under the seal of the Common Pleas, which it purports to be- the seal here is feigned altogether; the writ is informal, and the seals counterfeit: Sir N. C. Tyndall, whose seal it purports to be under, is a Judge of the Common Pleas, and not of the Exchequer - the defendant was detained under process from the Exchequer.</p>
               <p>MR. EARLE addressed the Court and Jury on behalf of Rotton and Ivey.</p>
               <p>Bailey. I believe you will find on the depositions that Ivey swore he never paid me a farthing - I deny ever seeing Rotton in my life, and Ivey but once or twice, and that in the presence of Moody, who they employed to do the business; it appears the whole of this is laid to my charge- I declare I am as innocent as a child unborn; Rotton promised last Session to provide me a Counsel, but now the blame is laid on my shoulders.</p>

            . My husband is a prisoner in the Fleet -Rotton lived in our room in April last. On the 14th of April Ivey was sent for, by Moody, the messenger - he came between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, on the 15th, and Rotton told him he was going to be bailed out, that he had employed Moody, the messenger, about it, with some solicitor outside, who was to do it - he asked Ivey to lend him a little money, as he was very short, and wanted money to pay his fees as he went out; he did not give him any then - Moody came between eleven and twelve o'clock, brought a piece of parchment, and said,"I have brought your discharge, Mr. Rotton;" he said,"Have you?" Moody said, "You must let me have a lit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300102"></xptr>tle money, Mr. Rotton;" Rotton asked Ivey to lend him some - Ivey said, "How much do you want?" Rotton said 10s. - Moody had asked Rotton for 10s.; Ivey lent Rotton the 10s., and he gave it to Moody - Moody said, "This makes 1l." - Rotton said, "Yes, you have had 1l. now;" Moody said, "This is your discharge, and you must take it down to the gate," upon which Rotton went away with it; he returned in a short time, alone - Moody was not there then, but he came back again in about half an hour with the parchment, and said, "Now it is all right, and here is your copy of causes;" one was a piece of writingpaper, and the other a parchment - I cannot say whether it was the same parchment as he brought the first time; he said he must take it down to the gate again, and he would wait for him outside; Moody went out, and I did not see him any more - Rotton went down, came back again, and said he had been to the gate, and it was not right; he told Mr. Sharp and me so - Rotton desired Ivey to go out himself, and see the solicitor, to see him righted; Ivey had been out of the room, and come back - I do not know where he had been; they had gone down together with the parchment, but I do not know where they went: Ivey had come back before Rotton came and said it was not all right.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Rotton live in your room the whole three months that he was there? A. Yes; I did not sleep in the prison; Mr. Peel and another person lived in the same room with my husband: they were not in the room when this took place - I had often seen Ivey and Rotton together; I never saw Bailey till I saw him here; I have not seen Moody since the 15th of April - Ivey is a carpenter; Rotton's father is a solicitor, I believe - his father never came to see him to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. EARLE. Q. You frequently saw Ivey and Rotton together? A. Yes, several times the week before; Ivey used to come every two or three days, and bring him victuals and what he wanted, also money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say Rotton desired Ivey to go to the solicitor, and see him righted - was the solicitor's name mentioned? A. Yes, it was; he did not know the name: he told him to go to the solicitor - I never heard the name nor where he lived; I never inquired.</p>

             was the first witness against him; he was remanded till the following Monday, at his own request, and on the 2nd of May he was brought before Mr. Alderman Venables; Ivey appeared on that day, but was not sworn; I read the evidence to the Alderman, and he ordered Ivey into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He was ordered into custody? A.He was ordered to find bail, and did so, after the first examination.</p>
               <p>Bailey's Defence (written.) It must appear very strange that Moody is not prosecuted; but the reason is very plain, for the defendants and Moody are endeavouring to throw the blame on me, who was no party in the transaction. The only evidence which concerns me, is that of the turnkley, who swears that I asked him a great many questions respecting Rotton, and how he was to be discharged - but the turnkey's evidence is very much in favour of me; for if I were a party concerned, why should I ask the turnkey questions, and thus create suspicions? Why could I not ask Rotton or Moody? If I had asked them, they could have given me the same information as the turnkey; and therefore I could only have asked the turnkey to satisfy myself that there was no fraud in the transaction, and from a determination not to be concerned in a transaction contrary to law, The defendants counsel throws all the blame on me, to exculpate his clients, but yet he disclaims all knowledge of me in this transaction, and states not that I was to get the writs sealed, but that a clerk of a solicitor was to go to the Prothonotary's. I became acquainted with Moody by visiting two builders named Ward and Richardson, confined in the prison; for whom Moody was accustomed to carry messages, and he asked me to do this for him; and in order that it should be quite correct, I asked the turnkey the questions which he has stated. You will observe that the clerk at Guildhall states that I was remanded at my own request, that I might produce the persons implicated in the transaction.</p>

About two o'clock in the morning I was going home, down Seymour-steps. As I was going down Park-lane, I looked round and saw two people talking by the watch-box, and at the end of the street the prisoner came after me, and walked a little way with me. We stopped at a coach-house, and at the moment we stopped, she unbuttoned my waistcoat, and then my small-clothes. She snatched the watch from me, and went to her companion; she gave the watch to her, and as soon as I could, I catched the prisoner. I never lost sight of her.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I took the prisoner to the watch-house; the prisoner was searched when I was in my box. There were two women with the prosecutor; when he called me there was only one, but when he passed me, there were two.</p>
               <p>- BALL. I am a constable. I searched the woman; I found nothing upon her. The prosecutor told me that he had lost his watch; he was possitive that this woman took it, and gave it to a woman in a black pellise. I took her before the magistrate the next morning. Going to Tothill-fields prison, the prisoner told me to go to a waiter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the woman in the pelisse - A. I did; I took her before a magistrate. I had a search-warrant, and searched the waiter's apartment, and I had him before the magistrate. He was discharged; there was nothing found about him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to her character.</p>

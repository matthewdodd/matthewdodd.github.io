On the 6th of September these weights were in my cart, which stood opposite my premises in a yard; when I got up at six o'clock in the morning they were gone - the gate of the yard had been broken off its hinges before; I found the prisoner in custody with them the same day - he is a stranger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Your house looks into the yard? A. Yes - the gate was down which made the yard open; the sack was at the back of the cart, and the weights under my goods - nobody had any business in the yard; there is a piece of waste ground near there.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 6th of September, at five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming down Little Drummond-street, about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's yard, with this sack rolled up under his arm - I asked if he had any thing there; he said, "You see what it is as well as I do;" I asked if he had any thing else there - he said No, but I found the four weights in the sack; he immediately knocked at his own door, which he was close by - somebody opened it; he immediately plunged in, but I went in and secured him - he made great resistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he had found them? A. Yes - he did not say where; he was not going towards the prosecutor's house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming towards this man's place - the Policeman asked what I had got; I said a sack and four weights which I had picked up in the field.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the other man?</p>
               <p>Eversage. Guyant, I believe. Then he bid me turn round, and drive in at the gate. I heard somebody run down the road; presently after that, the man that stopped the cart, and the young fellow came back to me again; I was ordered to drive till I got to the bottom of the field, then into the next field, and to the bottom of that; then the man that stopped the cart, bid me get off, and come along with him; I begged he would not hurt me; he said, he would not hurt a hair of my head, but he should tie my hands and legs; he tied my hands and bid me sit down.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the cart when he tied you?</p>
               <p>Eversage. Twenty or thirty yards; the other boy was with me; he tied us both, and then went away; he came again almost directly, and asked if I had got a key; I told him, no; he said, he knew very well how to get it open without; then he went away back to the cart, and I heard a great noise, and fire flew at every stroke; the noise continued ten minutes; then the other came, and said, my lads sit still, till<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177206030030"></xptr> we load our horses, and we will come and release you and give you five guineas to yourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any horses they had?</p>
               <p>Eversage. No; they never came near us any more; we sat there an hour and a half till day light; then Thomas got one of his hands out; I desired him to put it in again, left they should come and shoot us; he put it in again for a quarter of an hour; then it was quite light, and we saw the cart and horses. Thomas got loose and untied me; there was a large hole in the roof of the cart, some of the iron had been cut as if with an ax; there were the St. Ive's bag unopened, and another old bag lay near the cart; we took the reins off the horses, and rode to Mr. Hamilton's, and then came to London.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a morning was it when they met you?</p>
               <p>Eversage. Wet and dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it grow light enough while they were with you, for you to observe their persons?</p>
               <p>Eversage. No; the man that stopped the cart had a light-coloured coat and a flapped hat; the other a dark coat, and a cocked hat; the biggest was about five feet eight inches, and the other about five feet six inches; [nearly the size of the prisoners;] when I heard All press's voice afterwards, I said, it was like the voice I heard in the field.</p>

            . I am a cock-founder. On the 12th of October, I set off between one and two o'clock, to go a fishing. I was waiting for an acquaintance; he never came; I went on to the Old Street Turnpike; I asked if the mail cart was gone by? the turnpike man said, no; I waited till Eversage came; hollo, Eversage! said I; he said, ah, are you here at this time? we went on to Enfield. There came a man and took hold of the horse's head and held it fast; Eversage gave a cut; then the man said, if you don't stop I'll blow your brains out; he said, dismount! Eversage went to get down; he said not you, then I got down; I said, I was only going a fishing; he said he knew it, and bid me go on; then I heard him ask if the gate was ready, and the other man said, yes, and ordered the boy to drive in at the gate. I was about twenty yards off I believe, and presently I heard a man say, ho! I turned about and saw him just by me; it was Allpress I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was Allpress?</p>
               <p>Thomas. By his height and voice; which I recollected when I came to Sir John's; he had a lightish coloured coat, and his hat flaped; his coat looked like a surtout coat; he said to me when I was got into the field, halt! I turned about, and he was close on my back; he said, Look the other way, take no notice of me; when I came pretty near the gate, there was a man stood by it, who said go in there; I said in here, Sir? he said, yes, and follow the carriage: by the softness of his voice, he appeared to be the other man Guyant. I had an oil skin over my hat; the wind blew it off; I stooped to pick it up. He then said, don't be afraid; I said, you know I can't help being afraid, being stopped as we are; he said, he would not hurt a hair of my head. They stopped the carriage, and desired me to stand on one side; he then brought Eversage to me, and ordered him to sit down; he tied his hands behind him, and then tied his legs; Eversage desired they would not hurt him, he had a sore leg; he said he would not, and what they were doing was only for their own safety; he took a knife and cut the string, and then tied my legs, which he had a hard matter to do, because I am lame; then he came behind me, and said, put your hands behind you; I did; and he trembled as he tied my hands behind me; then he went away, he returned again, and said, have you got the key? Eversage said, no. The biggest man said, he would find a method to get at it, and away he went. Then I heard him in about a minute, with something like an ax, beating on the carriage, and it struck light several times; then something cracked like the breaking of boards; after the cracking was done; I heard something like a tearing, and I had not heard that long before it was done.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the cracking?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Three or four minutes; one of them came back, and said, as soon as the other men came into the field, and they had loaded their horses, they would give us five guineas. I said, gentlemen, I hope you will not leave us tied, in this deplorable condition; for I did not know when we should get undone; he said, they would not; about a few minutes after that, I listened, and said to Eversage, I can't hear any noise; we sat a little longer, it grew a little lighter, and he said, there is the grey-faced mare feeding; I looked and thought I saw it too; I directly began to wrench, and got one of my hands out; I told Eversage I had it out; oh, said he, put it in again, for if they come they will shoot us. In about ten minutes I wrenched my hands out, and untied my legs,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177206030031"></xptr> and went and got him untied. Then we went to the carriage; the reins seemed to be cut and were loose; the carriage was broke at the roof of it, and there was nothing left in it; there was a little bag I saw near it, with a girt about it and an empty bag. I got up on one mare, and he on the other, and rode to Mr. Hamilton's, at Enfield. When we got into the gate, Mr. Hamilton said, what now? Eversage said, we had been stopped and robbed; he ordered his chaise to be got ready, and came with his chaise, and we followed him. Mr. Hamilton put the bag in the chaise, and we came to London.</p>

            . I am post-master at Enfield. On Sunday the 13th of October, I saw the post boy on one horse, and the last witness on another; which surprised me greatly: I thought some accident might have happened by breaking; I asked what was the matter? Eversage said, they had been stopped and robbed; that the cart was broke in two pieces. I immediately ordered the chaise to be got ready, and went to the place and them with me; there I found the cart in the condition the witnesses have described cut with an ax, or something of that sort; there was nothing in the cart. I made the boy look into it; I found the St. Ives bag unopened, and a large bag ticketed</p>
               <p>"Ferrybridge;</p>
               <p>"I believe there was one letter in that not opened. I ordered the boy to harness the horses, and put them to the cart, and go before me, and I followed them in the past chaise; I put into the chaise the St. Ives bag, the Louth and Ferrybridge bag, and went to the General Post Office. On coming back some people stopped me, and said, they had found a great number of bags. I think there were forty-two; I got out of the chaise, and sent my letter-carrier with them to the office.</p>

I found two parcels in which were contained news papers and letters, hid in a hole of a bank, in a field behind Guyant's house; and on the Sunday after, I found another parcel of letters stuck against a manager in the same field; I don't know how long it was after the robbery; the first I carried to Mr. Hamilton, the other to London.</p>
               <p>- Davis. On the 19th of February I found some letters in a bag, about three-quarters of a mile from where the mail was robbed. I carried them to the Post Office, being late I could get nothing for my trouble. I went again on the 22d. and at the Change saw a great many persons; I went up to them, and saw Guyant and Allpress; when they saw me, Guyant went out at the door I went in at; and they went towards the Mansion House; when I came to the Post Office, a half guinea had been given to the man at the Penny Post, so I had to go to Throgmorton-street; then in the Change I saw them sitting on a bench, talking; when they saw me they went away.</p>

I searched him and found this pocket book; (producing it) I did not at first find the bank note in the pocket book, nor till I came home; then I gave it to Mr. Leigh; it was in a memorandum book in the pocket; it was opened in my presence. I saw the note, this is it. When we brought him to Sir John's, Sir John said to him, here is one of the notes found on you, what have you done with the rest? Guyant said, he had but one more, that he passed away to Mr. Brown, a butcher in Shoreditch. Afterward I went down and found a pistol in a shed, by Guyant's direction. Guyant said before the Justice that pistol was his own making.</p>

            . On the 13th of March last, Guyant was brought to Tothil-fields Bridewell; on Saturday morning the 14th, I went with him to Sir John's from our gaol; there he confessed that he and Allpress committed the robbery, and mentioned some particulars; that Allpress tied the two boys together. After he had been examined, he was committed again to our prison; as we were going back, he said, Mr. Wright, I forgot to tell Sir John where the pistol was; I ordered the coach to turn round, and go to Sir John's again; when we came to Sir John's, he was just going to Brompton; I told him what Guyant said; he said, take him in, and let Mr. Leigh take it down; Mr. Leigh took it down; he said it was in a gutter on the top of a shed. I took him to gaol; on Tuesday morning by his desire, I went down with him to Edmonton; he said, he had some notes there, and he would restore them for the good of the publick; when he came there, he told his man to take the pick ax and dig under the grindstone; accordingly we dug a long while; it was very hard; we dug one of the posts up, and under the post there was this bag; (producing it;) it was very wet; I doubled it up, and put it in a handkerchief; there was nothing in it; he desired me to go into a field behind the house, and there I should find some notes wrapped up in a piece of canvas by mistake. I went to the wrong field and came back, and said, he had a mind to play the fool with me; he said, no; you went to the wrong field, and told me to go to the second, and by the post I should find it; I went and found this pocket, and in it these notes; (producing one 20 l. bank note, two twenty guinea draughts and a 10 l. draught.</p>
               <p>Q. He carried you on purpose to show you the notes he had robbed the mail of?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes; (the notes read.)</p>
               <p>Q. from Guyant to Bond. He asked if I had any papers in my pocket; I gave him my pocket-book; he looked it over half an hour; it is clear there was no bank note in it at that time; he said, there is nothing here affecting you, but a letter about notes becoming due the same night. After he got to Sir John's office; he said there was a 20 l. note in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on his delivering up his pocket book look it over leaf by leaf?</p>
               <p>Bond. I did look over the pocket book, but not over the memorandum book; (the pocket book produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Aldredge. Look on the leaves of this book, and see if you see any of Mr. Guyant's hand writing; can you tell whose hand writing is on that leaf?</p>

            's; then we went to apprehend Allpress; he was on the Fens (the banks of a river) fishing. When we apprehended him, I charged him with robbing the mail; he said, Guyant and himself robbed the mail; we brought him to Sir John Fielding's, and there he said the same; he said, he had a watch which Guyant had purchased with a note he had taken out of the mail. I went to Sir John's with him, and there he confessed in more particular terms.</p>
               <p>Q. You said nothing to induce him to make this confession?</p>
               <p>Landers. No; Sir John told him not to flatter himself with hopes of being admitted an evidence, for he would not admit him.</p>

               <p>Landers. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Leigh. I heard him on his examination, before Sir John, say where the ax was; he described it, and said, it was made use of in the robbery.</p>
               <p>- Gosden. I went to search Allpress's house in the country; I was told there was an ax there, that was broke and rivetted in the eye with two rivets; his wife said it was at his father's; I went there, he had lent it to another person; I went to that person and got it; this is the ax (producing it.)</p>

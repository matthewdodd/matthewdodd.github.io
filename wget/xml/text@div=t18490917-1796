                  </hi>. I am a watchman, in the employ of the London Dock Company. On the afternoon of 17th Sept., I went, in consequence of information, to the jetty of the docks—I looked under a tarpaulin which covered some sugar, and I saw a matted bag of tea, and a short time after<lb></lb>wards I saw the prisoner on board a ship, the stern of which was close to the jetty—I concealed myself, and about half-past four o'clock I saw the prisoner crawling on his hands and knees between the tarpaulin and the casks of sugar—I then saw him with the bag of tea in his hand—I stopped him—I found a quantity of tea loose—I took it up, and took the prisoner to the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When you were watching that bag, did you find it was gone from that spot? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I found it in your left hand—you did not tell me you were looking for your jacket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>, I went in the dock with a truck, and took it to the ship; I laid down my hat and jacket on the tarpaulin, and when I came back they were gone; I was looking for them, and you took hold of me, and said, "I have been looking for you;" the jacket and hat were moved from where I put them, and very probably by this man. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, I found no hat or jacket—he had the bag in his left hand, and his hat in his right hand—this is the bag I took from the prisoner, and this is the tea I picked up—I suppose this came out of the hat—there was a tea-chest at the end of the tarpaulin, and it had been wrenched open and plundered—the tea in the bag, that which was loose, and that in the chest, all corresponded—the chest had been removed from where he was standing—the loose tea was alongside the bag—I suppose this bag contained the whole quantity of tea, and he went behind the tarpaulin to fill his hat and pockets, but hearing me he rose up—when I first discovered the bag there was no loose tea.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a permanent labourer in the docks. On 17th Sept., I was employed shipping tea from the west quay to the jetty—there were several half chests—I placed them near the tarpaulin—my attention was directed to one that had been wrenched open, and was half empty—I ordered the men to put it on one side, and I shipped off the rest—I went round to see if any tea was spilt, and there was not a bit—I looked behind the tarpaulin about five yards from where the chest was, and saw the bag three parts full of tea—I gave information, and a watch was set on it—the tea in the bag was the same quality as that in the chest.</p>

On 17th Sept., the prisoner was brought to me—I said to him, "Are you the man?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You had no business in the docks, and I am sure you had no business in that alley"—he said, "I know I had not, but I was passing along, and saw a little loose tea lying down, and I went behind the tarpaulin to see what it was."</p>

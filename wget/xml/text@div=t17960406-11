               <p>I was passing by Mr. Murray's, a little after nine; I saw the prisoner and another loitering about; I got another person to assist me, and we watched them for a quarter of an hour, backwards and forwards; we observed the window cracked; we thought they were gone away, and we were going to tell the people about it, and saw them come again in a few minutes afterwards; they both went, in company together, to the window again; I saw a hand go through and take the handkerchief, but I cannot say which it was; they both stood together; (the handkerchiefs were produced in Court); I said to the witness, they have got the goods, now we will lay hold of them; this gentleman standing here took the prisoner, and took him into the shop, and unbuttoned his coat; the handkerchiefs were buttoned up in his coat; I took the other about eight yards from the window; the prisoner took to his heels and ran, and the other witness went after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was the other man that you saw at the window? - A. I am positively sure. I heard the glass fly; I said to the witness, I believe it is broke.</p>
               <p>Q. When the man put in his hand to take the handkerchief out of the window, did you hear any noise then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no shutters up? - A. No; it was before they shut up the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see if the window was broke when you were going to tell Mr. Murray? - A. We looked at it was cracked, but, I believe, no part out.</p>

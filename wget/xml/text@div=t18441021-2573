I saw the prisoner on board our vessel, in the forecattle—he had been there several times with us, but he had nothing to do with the ship—he had liberty to go there—I saw him come up from the forecastle, with some<lb></lb>thing under his arm—he went on board his own vessel—I after that spoke to him—the next morning, at breakfast, I missed a jacket out of my chest—I had seen it safe at tea-time the night before, an hour and a half before I saw the prisoner come out of the forecastle—this is my jacket.</p>

I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth</hi>, and saw the prisoner—I told him there had been a jacket and some meat stolen from the next vessel—he said he knew nothing of it—I went down into the hold of the vessel, and found the jacket and two pieces of pork—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it—on proceeding to the station, he said he took the jacket from the prosecutor's chest—after getting to the station he said, "I took the pork."</p>

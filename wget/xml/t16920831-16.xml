There were several other Files and Rubbing Leathers found about the House, besides they denied to open the Door when the Constable desired Entrance; and several other things fit for the Trade of Clipping were found in Basdell's House: it appeared upon the whole    of the matter, that they were all equally concerned for that there was a Melting pot taken out of the Fire by Susanna full of melted Silver, and she was wont to sell the same to a Goldsmith found here towards Westminster; and so to put a better Colour upon the Roguery, she would get Guinea's  changed for Broad-Money, adding withal that the reason why she did  was because she had a Relation in the Country that intended to give legacies all in the Broad-Money.

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Joseph and John Ta<lb></lb>verner—we are button manufacturers, in Bunhill-row. I have known the prisoner very well within the last eight or twelve months—he was jobbing at an acquaintance of mine—I had button-rings and button-shells at the manufactory at Bunhill-row—I missed some of each of them—I received information, and found a quantity of button-rings and shells on Beckley, one of my boys—I took him up into the warehouse—he pulled out the shells, and I placed them on the table—I marked the shells, and left them with the boy—I said, "Do what you were going to do with them"—in about half an hour afterwards I went to the prisoner's house with a ser<lb></lb>geant of police—I asked the prisoner if he had received anything from one or two of my work-boys—he said no, he had not—the sergeant said, "You know better, you know you have received some things, and been giving the boys money for them"—he flatly contradicted that he had seen any boys at all—the sergeant said, "You know you are telling a falsity, you have just given the boy money, and have the articles in your possession"—he searched the place, and found the shells and rings in his pocket, which he had flatly denied—I gave him in charge—I had seen him near my premises before that day, but not on that day—I saw him pass the manufactory a few minutes before he was taken into custody—these are the things—they are mine, and are what I marked and left with the boy.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the prosecutor's service. I remember having some button-shells and rings which he took from me, and told me to give them to Mr. Higgins—I do not know what day it was—it was not ten minutes after he took them from me that he told me to give them to Higgins—Mr. Higgins had asked me to bring them to him, to see what sort of work I did, as I could not earn more than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in nine days—my master told me to give them to Mr. Higgins, they were of no consequence.</p>

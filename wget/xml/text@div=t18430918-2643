I am in partnership with Jules de la Cruez, and have carried on business in the leather trade, in Pinner's-court, Broad-street, since February or March—I first became acquainted with the prisoner, I believe it March; he was then living in Skinner-street, Bishopsgate—I do not know what business he was carrying on there—he told us he was in the shoe trade—I was induced to let him have leather from time to time down to June—on the 9th of July he was indebted to us above 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I became rather anxious to get some money from him, and on the 9th I called on him at his private residence, in Upper Lisson-street, Lisson-grove, where his warehouse was at that time—I told him that I wanted the account—he gave me this bill and two or three others—before he gave it me, I saw him indorse it—this "George Hayward" at the back is his signature.</p>

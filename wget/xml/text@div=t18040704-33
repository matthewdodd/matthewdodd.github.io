             sworn. - The prisoner lived with me in the City, and also in Surry; he came to live with me in the month of December, 1802, as <rs id="t18040704-33-deflabel178" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

               <p>Q. Had you ever given him these things? - A. I never did; I meant to keep these spare cloths in case any friend came to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. He lived with you in the City and in Surry? - A. Yes, my carriage was kept at Mr. Bevans's, in Old-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the cloths that were used in Surry? - A. No, they were used in town.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that he called upon you for a quarter's wages, and you told him that he had taken the cloths - what did he say? - A. He admitted of it very reluctantly; I never saw him after that, I received an attorney's letter from him, but I never paid him; I never took him up at all.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, did not you know where he lived? - A. I thought I knew where he lived, but my coachman told me he saw him in the Strand driving a hackney-coach; it was no use going to where I thought he lodged, I heard he was in custody.</p>

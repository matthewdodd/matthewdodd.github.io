                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Storekeeper's Department of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. It is part of my duty to pay the labourers—the prisoner was a labourer employed there—he came on 9th Jan. to receive 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him a good half sovereign, two half crowns, and two pence—I gave him nothing like this medal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I and another clerk paid upwards of 800 men that afternoon—the money is prepared, and laid out on separate trays, each labourer having a number—I arrange the coin beforehand; each piece passes my observation—I receive the gold from the bankers, it is weighed there, and we weigh it again, to see that it corresponds—I was present when it was weighed—after I had paid the prisoner he returned, brought this coin, represented it as the one he had received from me, and wanted to have a good one given to him for it—I declined to do so, and made a communication to the man who kept the gate of the Arsenal—Keen was present.</p>

MAC OUBREY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that you have an accurate memory of the particulars of each of the 800 men you paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I can tell all the amounts, and recollect the specific coin paid to each, because they vary so little—I can say that I did not give a single bad half sovereign that day—I have never given a bad half sovereign—I do not know whether a bad half sovereign has ever been given in mistake to the men—I believe the men have made demands, but good half sovereigns have not been given back to them in my presence, on such occasions—no such demand has been made on me—I know that the half sovereign was good, by the weight—they are not weighed individually, but 100 half sovereigns are thrown into the scale together—the prisoner was absent a very short time before he returned—any demand made is not listened to till the payments are over—when it was refused to him he was very indignant and abusive, and said that others had got bad money changed for good before.</p>

               <p>not see of what it was composed, but the money had been prepared beforehand, and examined as well—I receive the gold from the bankers, and weigh it again when I give it out to the clerk—the difference between this piece of coin and a good half sovereign would be detected by the scales which I weigh the gold in—I directed a communication to be made to the police at the gate of the Arsenal—I heard the prisoner say that he had received this for a good half sovereign—he requested me to give him another—I told him that I did not think he had received it—he said that he hoped I should give him another—I said that I felt very confident that he had not received it, and I could not do so—he said that it was not the first time the Government had tried to impose upon the men by giving them bad money—it has happened that a person has claimed and obtained the return of bad money, in several instances—the practice has become so general, that we are trying to put a stop to it, and I took particular care that all the gold which went through my hands was good weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you always take care of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, after the many losses I had I took particular care—these demands have been made three or four times for gold, but many times for silver—we get the silver from the bankers, but we cannot weigh it—I always found the gold to be good weight—I believe the prisoner has been working in the storekeeper's department since April last—I cannot tell whether he has borne a good character—the bad pieces of money which were exchanged are kept in a chest in my office—that is my loss—none of those coins were similar to these—they were good representations.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since this, have you altered your mode of weighing the gold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have reduced the quantity weighed at a time, so as even to detect a slight variation—if I do not take care that good money is given to me, I lose it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to your master's house in January - A. Yes, he came to buy great coats on the 13th of January last; he purchased fourteen; they were various prices, amounting to twenty-four pounds two shillings with the canvas they were packed in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they to be delivered - A. They were to be delivered on the Tuesday as he bought them on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. They were to be delivered then the next morning - A. Yes, at the White Horse, Fetter-lane, at ten o'clock; he was going into the country.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he offer to pay you - A. He paid me in notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that did you ask him his name and address - A. Yes, on account of making the bill of parcels out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name he gave you - A. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Fetter-lane the next morning - A. Yes. I met the prisoner in Fetter-lane, he told me that he had been waiting for me an hour or more; I was rather five minutes before my time; he told me he had been waiting for me an hour, he did not think the coach went so soon, it was gone he said; he took me into the White Hart public-house nearly opposite the White Horse. When I got into the public-house he pulled out his pocket book; I asked for a pen and ink to write a receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver him at that time the bill of parcels - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he look at it - A. Yes. The prisoner got the pen and ink, and asked me if I would have something to drink; I had something to drink; I was writing the receipt, and he was counting the notes from his pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass then about the notes - A. The discount was agreed upon the day before; five per cent, discount was to be taken off for ready money; he asked what discount was allowed for ready money at the time that he looked the goods out; he gave the notes to me for twenty-three pounds, they appeared to be bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what they consisted of - A. Two five's, five two's, and three one's, making together twenty-three pounds. I gave him the receipt, I had not two shillings to give him to make the twenty-three pound up.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was the discount - A. One pound two shillings, therefore he wanted of me two shillings change, there was two shillings coming from me to him; he said he would give me the two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took the notes - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the notes - A. I took them to the Bank in about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they out of your possession before you took them to the Bank - A. One note, but not out of my sight. I think it was a two; I took them to the Bank and delivered them to one of the clerks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these notes that you received of the prisoner the notes that you afterwards gave to the bank-clerk - A. The exact notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you take them to the Bank - A. Because I thought they were not good ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the person to whom you delivered them to at the Bank if you were to see him - A. Yes, I delivered them to Mr. Jackson, he was the person I delivered them to, and then they were detained.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had the prisoner left you before it occured to you that they were bad notes - A. I left him in the house, it was the circumstance of his giving me the two shillings, that made me suspect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At what place did you first examine them - A. In Monmouth-street, at one Thorpe's, he is in the clothes line, I had business to do there before I went home. When I went in I immediately pulled out the notes and looked at them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you did not give them to him or that you only looked at them yourself - A. Yes, I laid them down on the counter with my hand upon the remainder.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the remainder - A. I looked at one of the notes, I cannot say whether it was a two pound exactly I clapped my hand upon the remainder.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking over them what occurred to you - A. They looked very faint and the water marks more distinct than I thought they did in general, the water marks stronger, then I took them to the Bank immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they did not pass from your hands into the hands of any body else for the purpose of inspection before you took them to the Bank. -</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask this man, Thorpe - A. I asked him if he could tell, only the two pound note I put into his hands, the note I shewed him he particularly suspected, he said he should have taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon inspection you suspected and carried the whole mess of them to the Bank - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at these, and tell me whether these are the papers - A. They are the same notes; two of five pounds each, five of two pound each, and three of one pound each.</p>
               <p>Q. You have examined all these carefully have not you - A. I have.</p>

               <p>Q. There is no one circumstance which appears genuine - A. No. They do not resemble our notes at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. You do not mean to say that they have not the general resemblance of a bank note - A.Not one of them are genuine bank notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the employ of Messrs. Headland and Kearsley, woollen merchants, at 42 and 43, Gutter-, lane—on Friday, 12th April, I was at the further end of the warehouse., and I observed some one running away out of the warehouse with a piece of black cloth which had been on a pile opposite the door, which was open at the time—on seeing this I pursued him; the cloth was dropped in the street about eight or ten yards from the door—the man had on his head a round brown wide-awake—I pursued him down Goldsmith-street, across Woodstreet, down Mitre-court, down Milk-street, across Honey-lane market, and I lost sight of him in the entrance into Bow-churchyard—in a few seconds 1 saw the witness Dunlevy bring the prisoner down—the man had a brown</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday, 12th April, between half-past 11 and 12, I was in Milk-street, Cheapside—I heard a cry of "Stop thief, "and saw the prisoner running from Mitre-court towards Honey-lane—I saw his face—I am sure he is the man—I saw him run from Mitre-court through Honey-lane market and through a court, leading into Cheapside, towards Bow-lane—I then lost sight of him for a few moments—I went into Mr. Cole's place, a fancy box manufacturer, and there saw the prisoner in a back room—I walked in and got hold of his collar, and said, "You are a prisoner; you have stolen a piece of cloth/' and he tried to knock me down—I got him out of the place, half-way down the street, saw a constable, and gave him in charge—the young man Marian, was down at the bottom of the stairs of Cole's place—I am. quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

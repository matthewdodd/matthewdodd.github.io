             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your partner's name? - A. My partner's name is John-Henry Bluhm; we are ship brokers and ship owners in Crotched Friars: The prisoner was in our employ on the 24th of February, as collecting clerk, and had been so for ten years; there was freight due from Mr. Lee on the Robert and Sarah, and the Hebe Smith, from Hambro's, to the amount of 21l. 12s. 9d. I have his book in which he kept his accounts (produces it), and on the 9th of March, 1801, he gives credit by the Hebe Smith - Received of Mr. Lee 10l. 16s. 4d. -Every thing he received was entered into this book, and paid over to our cash clerk; there is no other entry of money received on that day, and on the 24th of February, no credit is given for any sum; no other sum was due from Mr. Lee, except what I have stated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long did you say the prisoner had lived with you? - A. Ten years; he served seven years to us; if I had not thought him honest, I should not have kept him.</p>

            I believe you are clerk to Mr. Lee? - A. I am, and was on the 24th of February; this freightnote was brought to me but I cannot say what day; these sort of notes are generally left a week or two, to see whether the freight is correct; sometime after it was left, I made payment for it by a draft on Newnham, Everett, and Drummond, of 21l. 12s. 9d. (Produces the draft.)</p>
               <p>Q Do you know whether you paid it to the prisoner, or not? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q Did the person who come put his name on the back? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you remember the person who put his name on it? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-80-person816">A. </persName>
            No; and the reason why I am so certain the person put his name to it is, that I always draw up the drafts, and see the persons who take them put their names on the backs of them.</p>

            . On the 9th of January, about one in the morning, I was coming home. I was passing the prosecutor's shop; the door was on a jarr.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prosecutor's name - A. Lerouche; he is a <rs id="t18140112-34-viclabel181" type="occupation">shoe-maker</rs>

On my seeing the door a jarr I pushed it open; I asked who was there; the prisoner answered, me. I asked him to come out, and let me look at him. When he came out I gave him into the hands of a watchman until I called my brother-in-law up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the shop - A. No, not till I gave him into the hands of the watchman and came back; then we pulled down the shutters and went in; we found the things packed up ready for going away.</p>
               <p>Q What, these things in a basket - A. Yes, on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in the shop at this time sleeping there - A. Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the prosecutor usually sleep there - A. No, he never did in his life; he keeps the shop only, and sleeps in a room up stairs, in the same house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the shop part of the house in which he lives - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing found in the shop besides these things in the basket - A. Outside of the shop was the padlock drawn, and a staple, and the door without any lock.</p>

               <p>Q. Is your shop the bottom of the house in which you live - A. Yes, and part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 9th of January, had you fastened the door of your shop - A. Yes; I came down about five o'clock and found the door fast. Between ten and eleven I went to bed, and about one o'clock I was disturbed by my brother-in-law calling me; I went to the window and asked what was the matter; he said Mr. Rouche come down immediately, the shop is broken open. I came down, and found the shop was broken open, and the prisoner in the watchman and patrol's custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the goods that were found in the basket - A. Yes; I took them to the watchhouse just as they are. The basket is mine; there was some old bits of leather in it. The basket was emptied out, and he had packed up these old boots and shoes from various places in the shop where they were hanging; some were hanging very high. He had packed up thirteen pair of shoes, two pair of boots, and two bottles of blacking.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home; I found this place open as I came by; I could not get in my lodgings, so I went in there.</p>

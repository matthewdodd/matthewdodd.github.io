               <p>I am one of the conductors of the patrol from Bow-street, on the Hampstead-road: On the 14th of September, near ten o'clock, I met the prisoner near Chalk-farm, very near a mile from the prosecutrix's, Taylor and I were in the Lane, and we saw him coming a-cross the foot-path leading from the Lord Chancellor's, at Hampstead, towards Chalk-farm, we immediately seized him; seeing a bag upon his back, we asked him what he had got there; he equivocated very much, first he said, it was a present for his serjeant, and then, that they were given him by some man that he met just before in the fields; we immediately took him to the public-house, at Chalk-farm, we knocked them up, they were in bed; we took him into the coffee-room, we turned the bag up, and out came the live ducks, and two hen fowls with the heads off, I have had them ever since; I fastened his hands, and in consequence of his saying they were given him by some others we went into the fields to see if we could find any more of them; when we got to Hampstead, we enquired, and found that this lady had lost them. (They were produced in Court).</p>
               <p>Freeman. We had had them four months, I have no doubt that they are our's; I saw the hens at Bow-street, and I am sure they were our's, I knew them by their colour.</p>

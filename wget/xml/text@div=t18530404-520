                  </hi>. I am the brother of the prosecutor. He lives in High-street, Woolwich—he is a potato-dealer—I am a potato-dealer, and so was my father—on 16th March, at the prosecutor's request, I followed Hicks from near the Dockyard-gate at Deptford to Woolwich; he was driving a horse and cart, with twelve sacks of potatoes—it was covered with a tarpaulin, but I saw the sacks myself at Deptford, and again at Woolwich—he stopped, with his cart, at the door where I live, at Deptford—I was not dressed as I usually was—I knew Hicks—I followed him in the Lower road—as I followed him, I saw biro get on the cart, and raise the tarpaulin, and take potatoes from the full sacks, and place them in an empty sack, which was on the top of the cart—he was engaged in doing so about five minutes—he held the sack with his left hand, and took the potatoes with his right—I was about 200 yards from him—between the Union and the Antigallican I lost sight of him—it was just before he got to the Union that I saw him do what he did—there were fields there, on both sides of the road—when I lost sight of him, I ran, and the cart was stopped at the Antigallican, and Hicks was on the top of the cart, spreading an empty sack—he remained at the Anti-gallican upwards of an hour—I still stayed, and watched; he then proceeded to Woolwich; I saw him arrive, with the cart, at my brother's house—I saw him remove four of the sacks—the first three were good weight, the fourth was upwards of 7 lbs. deficient—a full sack of potatoes ought to weigh a hundred and a half, which is 168 lbs.—they were all weighed by sworn meters—a sack means a certain weight, not what a sack will hold—the first three sacks were full weight—the weights were in the other scale, three half-hundreds and 4 lbs., as the balance of the sack—the fourth sack was upwards of 7 lbs. deficient—a 7 lb. weight was placed in it, and it did not take it down—my brother said to Hicks, "This is a pretty sack of potatoes, is it not; I can dispense with your services, you had better go"—Hicks replied in language not fit to mention.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potato dealer, and live in High street, Woolwich. Hicks was in my employ as carman—on 16th March I went with him to London—about 9 o'clock that morning I had fifteen sacks lying in my shop, close to the street door—I told Hicks to count them—he did, and said there were fourteen—I told him to count them again, and he would find fifteen—he did, and said there were fifteen—he put them into the cart—I went to the tail of the cart, and took one from him, leaving fourteen—I then proceeded towards London—in passing through Deptford, where my brother lives, I called, and spoke to him—I then proceeded to London, but not in my own cart—I went to Beale's-wharf, Mill-lane, Bermondsey—I bought there ten sacks of French potatoes—I saw the whole of the ten sacks weighed, and they were conveyed by the fellowship porters to my cart—Hicks had arrived with my cart, and the potatoes were put into my sacks and weighed—I was on board the vessel, and saw them weighed—I only saw the prisoner take into the cart the last two sacks—each sack weighed three half hundreds, 168 lbs. net—I got two other sacks from the warehouse; and after they were loaded, I told the prisoner to go on, and to call for my great-coat at my grandfather's, at Deptford, where my brother lives—that was in order that my brother might know that he passed—I went home to Woolwich by the train—I was at home some considerable time before Hicks arrived—before the cart was unloaded, my brother came to the shop, and gave me some information—I directed the prisoner to take the potatoes out of the cart and put them on the weighing machine—I put in the opposite scale three half-cwts. and a 4lbs. weight—I was not in the habit of weighing the potatoes when they came home—the first two sacks were red potatoes, which I had at the warehouse, and were full weight; the third, which was one that came from the vessel was full weight; the fourth, which was the second that came from the vessel, was 7lbs. light—I asked him if he did not think that was a pretty sack of potatoes to bring home—I asked him if that was the same he got from London—he said, "Yes," and he began swearing, and abused me—there were two policemen passing by—I went and stated the case to them, and gave him into custody—I and my brother went to the station—when I returned to my shop I saw the remaining sacks of potatoes—the cart had been unloaded—the sacks stood in the centre of the shop—there were eight sacks remaining—I weighed them; they were all deficient in weight, excepting one; they varied from 7lbs. to 9lbs. less than 168lbs.—the sack that was weight was tied; it was what we call a rider—it was laid on the copse of the cart to balance it—that was tied, and that was full weight—I sent Hicks with fourteen sacks to London—this sack produced by the policeman is mine; it is marked with my name.</p>

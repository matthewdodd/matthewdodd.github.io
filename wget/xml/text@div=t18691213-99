                  </hi>. I have been thirty-one years employed by the Mint authorities—on 3rd December I was near Charing Cross Railway Station, with several other officers—I posted myself there about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, with Sergeant Curley—the prisoner and another man came there at about 3.45—we both knew the prisoner very well—he stood at the rail<lb></lb>way entrance, and we seized him—I said, "Well, Mr. Drew, you are sus<lb></lb>pected of having counterfeit coin in your possession, have you any about you?"—he said "No"—at that time Curley seized him and took from his side-coat pocket a paper packet which he handed to me—I opened it—it contained two smaller packets—the first contained eight bad half-crowns with paper lapped round them, and the other nine bad shillings with paper lapped between them, and I saw the sergeant take a bad half-crown from his waistcoat pocket—I said, "You will have to account for the possession of these, Mr. Drew"—he paused a little and then said, "A gentleman gave me these while I was standing under a lamp post in Parliament Street, and said, 'Hold this money'"—Curley said, "Who was the gentleman?"—the prisoner said, "I do not know, I never saw him before"—Curley said, "Who is that man that was with you?"—he said, "There was no man with me, I swear, and you cannot say there was"—I said, "Perhaps you will tell that tale to the Magistrate; if you do not I certainly shall"—he made no reply—when the charge was read to him he said, "Well, suppose it is, you cannot say that I was going to utter it "or" pass if—he also said, "My name is</p>

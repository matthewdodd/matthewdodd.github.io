                  </hi> I am a general dealer. I got acquainted with the prisoner in Birmingham—I bought a quantity of buttons of Mr. Sylvester, in Great Charles-street, Birmingham—I packed them in a box—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "If you take them to London I can sell them for you"—I said, "Very well, if you get me a customer I will pay you"—I said I did not know where to go—he said, "I have a cousin, named Belasco, in Petticoat-lane; if you send them there they will be safe"—I got a box, packed them with some planes and other articles, and took them in a cart to the railway—he said he had better put his name on the box, and then they would be safe, and they would know who they were for—we sent the box by the goods-train, to Belasco, in petticoat-lane—we arrived in town next day, about half-past six or seven o'clock—he took me to the blue Pig, St. Mary Axe—I asked him if that was where the goods were brought to—he said,</p>

               <p>no; the place where he sent them was not fit for me to go to—I would not rest, and he took me to Belasco's—he went up stairs—I asked the mistress if the goods had come there—she said, no, she knew nothing about them—when the prisoner came down I asked him if he saw the goods—he said, "No"—he went across to a public-house, and said, "I wish you good night"—I went over to a Mr. butcher's, and asked him if he knew anything about him—he said mo, he knew his brother—the prisoner came to me next morning, and had some cloth of me—he said, "I will go and see if I can sill this cloth for you"—we went to the other side of the town—we walked about till four or five o'clock, and them he went off, and promised to meet me at ten o'clock next morning—I went to Belasco's, and asked if the box was there—they said it had not come—I went to Pickford's-wharf, and they proved the delivery of the goods.</p>

I received informa<lb></lb>tion, and went to the prisoner's lodging, in Breton's court, Ratcliff-highway, about one o'clock in the morning—he was in bed—I said I wanted him, for stealing a quantity of buttons—he said, "I have not stolen them; I am a partner; they are here all right."—he he got up, dressed himself, and showed me these remains of the cutlery, and this part of the buttons—the box laid in a corner of the room, broken—the rope had been cut, I found it in the cellar—Poncio gave him in charge—he was out out on bail, and absconded.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Green Man public-house, Hoxton—on the morning of Wednesday, 17th April, I was called out of bed about 2 o'clock by a policeman, and my attention directed to the cellar-flap—I found it raised—the policeman told me somebody was in the cellar—I went down and found the two prisoners in the cellar—the cellar-flap had been secured the night before with two bolts, one on each side.</p>

Q.</hi> Was there a bolt on the front of the flap? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; on the side, not outside, but inside—the blacksmith had been at work that night putting on a chain—the bolts on the flap are not old and rusty—if the front of the flap is lifted, the bolts will work in the sockets at each side.</p>

On 17th April, at half-past 1 in the morning, I was on duty in High-street, Hoxton—I tried the prosecutor's cellar-flap at that time—when I came round at 2, I observed the dust had been pulled out on each side—I listened for some minutes and heard the two prisoners in the bottom of the cellar—I obtained assistance, and called the landlord up—I was admitted by the potman, and followed the landlord down into the cellar—Munton met me at the front of the door of the stair-case leading up to the dwelling-house—I went down by that communication with the house—on searching the cellar I found Litton on the</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Calvert, brewers—they serve the prosecutor's house with beer—on the afternoon of 15th April, I was down in that cellar—I removed the two bolts which fasten the flap down—I let down the barrels and afterwards fastened the flap the same as I found it—I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Munton's Defence.</hi> We are unprepared with legal advice to assist us, and I hope you will pay attention to what the witnesses, have said. The prosecutor states there is no hole in front of the flap; the constable tells us there is a hole where he put his hand down and tried it; the bolts on the flap are at the back; there is no necessity for any breaking to raise the flap, because there is no fastening to the front; the blacksmith had been at work. You can't rely on this evidence as to breaking; then, as to his dwelling-house, it is not his dwelling-house; the flap is on the pavement in the street, ten yards from his dwelling; you have to go up a flight of stairs, and go into another house, so it has nothing to do with his house.</p>

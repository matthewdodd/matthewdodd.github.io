                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe maker—I did reside at Boot-street, St. Luke's, but I have moved since then. On Wednesday, 23d November last, I was at a public-house known as "The Ship," in Glasshouse-yard—I believe it was between 2 and 3 in the afternoon—there was a disturbance there while I was there—I saw a man of the name of Powell there—the landlord and he were fighting—the prisoner and the deceased, Jones, was I there—the landlord and Powell had, I think, two rounds—Jones, the deceased, came up to the landlord while the landlord was kicking Powell, and said to him, "Don't do that"—the landlord had just left off fighting Powell, who was on the ground, and was kicking him—the deceased said, "Don't do that," and the prisoner said, "It is you that has caused all the disturbance," and struck him twice in the mouth—it knocked him down—I then saw the landlord kick Jones while he was on the ground—I was within a yard or two of them all this time—I saw the deceased carried into the tap-room—he seemed to fall on the back part of his head—it seemel to me as if he fell on some man's legs, or against the side of his feet, with his head close to the ground—it was against some bystanders' feet.</p>

I want 21. for the table;"Powell said," Well, we will get it mended for you"—one word brought up another, and one began to smash the glass—Fox saw one man smashing the glass and ran at him, and I saw him struck by the man that smashed the glass—I saw Jones, the deceased, fall—Fox was fighting this man, and Jones ran between and said, "Fox, it is not <hi rend="italic">him</hi>"—after the man struck at Fox the two began fighting—they were in front of the bar—Jones ran between them to part them, and as Fox was striking this man he was fighting with, Jones popped between, and the blow intended for the other happened to catch him in the mouth—as soon as he struck him in the mouth (it was only a bit of a tap) down Jones fell—he was very intoxicated—he was only struck once—I was by and saw it all—he fell when he was struck—he fell quite straight, and caught his head against the boards at the side of the wall; against the skirting board—he fell straight on the floor, with his head on the skirting—I lifted him up and put him in the parlour—some of them made use of very bad language, "Let the b—lie; he is shamming"—some of his shopmates said—that he was insensible when I picked him up—I just saw a little streak of blood from his mouth; that was all—it was bleeding very little indeed; just as if from a scratch.</p>

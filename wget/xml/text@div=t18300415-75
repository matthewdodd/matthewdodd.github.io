               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were very charitable to this woman? A. Yes - I believe it was a shilling I gave her; I do not think it was a sovereign - it was not my watch, for I had it at the Mariners; I was in liquor - I never saw her in my life; the other public-house was the Robart Arms; I do not remember playing at billiards, or throwing my purse on the table, and challenging them to bet a sovereign - I was only in the bar at the Mariners with the landlord; I do not recollect throwing my money down - I swear the prisoner followed me to the Robart Arms; she took part of my gin and water I believe, but I do not recollect - I know I had my watch there in my pocket; I believe I took it out there, but I do not know.</p>

            . I keep the Robart Arms, Ratcliff. I saw the prosecutor, and a woman with a child come in shortly after him; he went to sleep, but I did not see any watch - I do not know who the woman was. Cross-examined. Q. What part of the house did the prosecutor go to? A. To the tap-room and into a side box; the bar is opposite to it - he was very much in liquor; and did not seem to know what he was doing - he went to sleep on the table; I think he was awake when she went away - he had paid for the liquor before she went; she went in about ten minutes afterwards - no other persons were in the tap-room.</p>

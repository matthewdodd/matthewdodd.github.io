               <p>JOHN LEPPINGWELL. On Tuesday, the 27th of February last, I was in Shoreditch, at about a quarter past seven in the evening. Thompson passed by me opposite Shoreditch church; I looked at him, because I thought I had a knowledge of him; afterwards I came to an entry which leads down to Cooper's-gardens, and he was then accompanied by Boston; the two prisoners stood before me across the path, and would not allow me to pass; they did not say any thing to me, I put my right hand up to part them to get between them. When the prisoner Boston saw my hand was engaged, he snatched at my seals that hung to my watch, which was in my fob; I felt him get hold of them, and I put my hand down to save my watch, and the chain gave way. We pulled, and then the chain gave way; he took both chain, seals, and key. Boston then ran down Cooper's-gardens; Thompson went back again, towards Shoreditch Church. I have never got my properety again. There must be considerable force used to get the chain away.</p>

               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG. On Wednesday, the 28th, I was going down Worship-street and saw both the prisoner; I let them walk on until they got very near our office, I on one side, and they on the other; when I got close to the office, I called out to them halloe, I want to speak to you; one came just halfway across; and said he. and I said and you and all; meaning the other man. They then both came across, and I said, here is a man in our office, I want you to look at, and see if you know him; they both came; and I put them into the office; and I then sent for the prosecutor, and from his descriprion, I found them out.</p>

               <p>The prisoners called three witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

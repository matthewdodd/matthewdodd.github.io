                  </hi>. I reside at St. Paul's-row, Camden-town. The prisoner was in my employ about four months—on 26th April I had two sovereigns in my pocket, which I received from my wife that morning—I am positive they were good—I gave the prisoner a sovereign, about 11 o'clock in the forenoon, as he came and said he wanted some bran for the horses—he returned about dusk that evening, and brought a man with him—he said the corn chandler's shop was closed, he could not get the bran; but this man was a coachman, in the neighbourhood, and he would let him have some—he said, "Here is the sovereign back"—I took it, and put it in my left trowsers pocket, where the other was—the next morning, for the first pay<lb></lb>ment</p>

               <p>I had to make, I tendered the two sovereigns on the table, at a tavern in the City, and the man said one was bad—I looked, and it was bad—it had not been out of my sight—it was given back to me; I took it home, and showed it to my wife—I put it on the chimney piece in the dining room—I should know it again—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can swear to it by a peculiar mark along the edge—on the Sunday following, I discharged the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn merchant, and live at No. 61, Great College-street. On the evening of 1st May I saw the prisoner at my shop:—he said, "I owe you for a truss of hay, and I will pay you"—he laid a coin on the counter representing a sovereign—I walked round the counter, picked it up, and from the lightness of it I detected that it was bad—I told him it was bad—he said he was not aware of it, but if it was, it was one of Gray's—I weighed it while he was there, to convince him that it was bad—I returned it to him, and he went away, saying he should take it back again to Mr. Gray—on Tuesday morning, 2nd May, Mrs. Gray brought me a counterfeit sovereign—I gave it to the constable about ten minutes afterwards, and he marked it.</p>

On Monday, 1st May, the prisoner came there—he gave me a sovereign and asked for change—I put the sovereign to my mouth and bent it—I called my husband, and he sent for a policeman and gave the prisoner into custody—the prisoner was asked where he got it, and he said he had given a man change for a sovereign near Guildhall, that he had just twenty shillings and no more, and this was the sovereign he took for the silver.</p>

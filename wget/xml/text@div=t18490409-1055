This order (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) was brought by Crawley—he was there when I went there, at seven o'clock in the morning, or it might be three minutes after; it was scarcely light—he had a man and a cart with him—in consequence of receiving this order, twenty-five sacks of flour were delivered to him—there were fifteen sacks of household flour, and ten sacks of No. 2—they were delivered by the order of Mr. Empson—here is the delivery-book—Crawley has signed it, in the name of John Roberts—on 20th Dec. Crawley brought this other order for twenty sacks—I delivered the quantity mentioned to him—he had again to sign the delivery-book for them—they were taken away the same as before—it was about the same time in the morning—they were there when I came—seven o'clock is the time to deliver.</p>

Q.</hi> What is the way in which this flour is sold in the market, by samples or by description? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That all depends on the person who buys it—most persons know the character of flour, and buy it without a sample, and an order is given by me to deliver it—if a person were to get this order, it would not act in the same way as a bill of parcels; it is a delivery-order—I am known as a dealer—it would be known in the trade to what description of flour my order pointed—if my order were brought to a person who knew what the flour trade was, he would know what he was buying, on my order—the flour which is consigned to me is of a particular sort—I have a certain connection that I go amongst, and sell it to—this order is like a dock-warrant—I should buy flour on a note of this kind, if I knew the man whose flour it was, but I should like to know the quality of the flour—I issue perhaps four or five of these orders in the course of a week—I had one cus<lb></lb>tomer named Wilson—I did not sell to Wilson about that time; he never bought this quantity.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I am a carman and coal-merchant—Peacock employed me on 14th Dec. to fetch some flour from the railway station—he first spoke to me about fetching it as I was washing my van before my own door one morning between twelve and one o'clock—he said, "Holloa, Crawley, how are you?"—I said I was rather slack of work—he said, "I can give you an order to cart some coals"—I said, "I expect a country job; I cannot do that"—he said, "Well, I expect I shall buy some flour worth the money;" and he asked me how much I would cart it for—I told him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sack—he said it was to be carted from the Bricklayers' Arms station to his house—I said I would not do it under 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sack; he said he could get it done for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I did not care about it—a few days after, I was coming out of my door to go after some coals in my cart, and he said, "Good morn<lb></lb>ing;" I said, "Good morning"—he said, "I have got an order for twenty-five sacks of flour, it belongs to a man of the name of Roberts"—he gave me this order (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) for twenty-five sacks—he told me to go and get them; and he said, "Sign Roberts, or what you like"—he told me I was to get it early in the morning, but it was all coming to his place—to the best of my belief it was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon when he brought this order—I said I could not get it away myself with my horse and van—he said, "Can you hire?" I said, "Yes, I can; I often hire from Mr. Boddy, close by me"—we went to the public-house, and had a drop of gin—I think he stood one drop, and I stood another—I went down to Boddy's in the even<lb></lb>ing; I saw his foreman, and made an arrangement with him for the following morning-next morning I went to the railway station, about half-past six o'clock; I took my own van and horse, and Boddy's man went with me with his cart and horse-when I got to the station I gave in this order to a person there; he said, "You must wait, you cannot have the flour till the delivery-foreman comes"—I went to a coffee-shop, and while I was there, a tall man came in, and in consequence of what he said I went to the station and obtained the twenty-five sacks of flour, leaving the order there—the man who came into the coffee-shop helped to load the flour—I afterwards described that man to Peacock, and he said he thought, by the description I gave of the man, that he was the man of whom he bought some of the flour, of the name of Bailey (that was when we were in prison)—having obtained the flour, I drew it from the station, and took it to Peacock's shop in St. George's-road, near the Elephant and Castle, it was there unloaded, and placed in his shop—I noticed the mark of "J. M." was on the sacks—Peacock then went with roe, and we had some half-and-half to drink—I was not paid in money, I had a sack of oats for my horse and some chaff to the value of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which the job came to—he asked me if I had signed the name of Roberts in the book—I said, "Yes;" he said, "That is all right, old fellow"—I had signed the name of "Roberts"—a few days afterwards, on 20th Dec, I went again to the station—it was on Monday morning, about half-past six o'clock, when I started from Boddy's—I took an order there for twenty sacks—this is the order, I received it from my wife on the Sunday night when I came home, and she told me something, in consequence of which I got ready, and went on the Monday morning—I got Boddy's man and one of his horses—the order I got was signed "Roberts"—I got the twenty sacks, and took them to Peacock's house—I was paid for that in corn and chaff—he asked me if I had signed the name of "Roberts"—I said, "Yes;" he said, "That is all right, old fellow" Peacock said he bought the orders of two men, Bailey and Wilson; and had</p>

I had been drinking; if I had been sober I should have given every information—Peacock did not tell me not to tell anything about it, or to disguise anything—when I was locked up, he came to my wife, and said I was an innocent man, and what was done was done by his desire; she was broken hearted about it—Peacock told me at the time why he wished the name of Roberts to be used—he said he had bought it of a man named Roberts; and said, Sign Roberts, or what you like, it is all coming to my place"—I had never fetched anything from the station before—I have taken goods there, but I never fetched anything away with orders—Peacock keeps a corn dealer's shop—I believe he took it two or three years ago from a man named Perry—I was taken up, and Peacock came before the Magistrate—to the best of my belief I was only examined once before the Magistrate—Peacock did not appear on that occasion—he went to my wife, and said I was discharged from custody—I saw some books produced at the office, they were in a handkerchief—I believe Peacock brought them himself—I do not think they were looked at—I did not direct my attorney to summon Peacock to appear—he did summon him, and he appeared.</p>

               <p>really positive—he said it was purchased of Mr. Wilson, and the signature of Wilson was on the receipt—I asked him if he knew Mr. Wilson—he said he had never seen the man that he purchased it of in his life before, nor had he seen him since, that he had called a few days before, with the samples and left them, and he called again and he gave him an order, and be sent it in on the 20th and called the same day for the money—I asked him if he knew who was the carman that brought the flour—he said he did not know who was the carman—after this explanation of the twenty sacks, I asked him to go back to the 14th and see if he had not received twenty-five sacks of flour—I do not recollect that I mentioned any names then—he went through his files and beyond the 14th, and said he could not find any receipts, and therefore he had not had the flour—I saw a cash-book there, and I asked him if he could find anything in his cash-book that would tally with the amount—he said, "Nothing of the kind"—I asked him if it was usual to buy sacks of flour without knowing the name of the person he bought them of—he said it was quite usual with him—I asked him about buying the twenty-five sacks generally—I do not know that I mentioned any name—I asked him whether he had any of the flour in his possession—he said he had not, he had sold it—he said he could not recollect who he had sold it to—I asked him whether the sacks had been returned—he said he believed not—he said he seldom gave himself any trouble about the sacks, it was seldom they were returned—I showed him these two orders—he looked at them, and I said particularly to him, "Do you know Empson P—he said, "No, I bought the flour of Wilson"—I asked him particularly if he had seen any orders—he said,"No," I had the orders with me, the questions and dates were given from the orders.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was the day on which you put the prisoner through this course of cross-examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect the day—I found it out on 1st February—I was not sent to Peacock's, it became me as manager to make these inquiries—I saw Peacock in his own shop—there was corn and flour there; not a great deal, there might have been forty or fifty sacks—I will not swear there were not a hundred—Mr. Church, the solicitor, was present—he took notes—I have never seen his notes—he was not seated at a table—he stood against the counter, and took it down there—I do not know that Peacock saw him writing—he could have seen him if he thought proper—I have no doubt that he saw him—I did not wait to give Church time to take down all the answers—I had not arranged the plan of operations with Church before I went there—we had no idea of Peacock being in the situation he was—Mr. Church's notes have not been read to me—I will not pledge myself that I have left out nothing that occurred—I have left out nothing—part of the answer Peacock gave me was "I cannot tell without looking at my books"—I asked him to look over his papers—he produced two books—there were other books produced at the police-court, he had some books in a handkerchief—I did not leave him a summons to attend the police-court—I did not desire him to attend—I will swear that no notice was given him in my presence—I believe a notice was sent him by the Magistrate, and he attended, and brought his books—I do not recollect that he invited the Magistrate's attention to them, I believe he did not—I think I should have recollected it if it had been so—I should suppose he brought them for the purpose of giving information—I saw in the handkerchief what had the appearance of books—the Magistrate and I had been talking the matter over, and when Peacock came with his books, he was slipped into the dock—I did not know that that was to be done—I did not apply for a summons for him—I do not know that one was applied for—I know he was there—I saw the other man Crawley—when I asked him, he said he did not know anything about</p>

               <p>them—I <hi rend="italic">told him I was</hi> in possession of information—he then said he should answer no question, I could just go and do. what I liked—I cannot <hi rend="italic">say that he</hi> was drunk; he was not sober—I saw a woman at the door—I did not see any family—I did not go to Peacock's premises after he was locked up—I had been there several times for the purpose of seeing him, and he was away—his wife did not show me over the stable.</p>

On 22d Dec.; he made application to me on that day—I went and looked at the flour—he said he had purchased it <hi rend="italic">of some</hi> man—I think it was Bailey or Wilson—I have always found Peacock to be an honest well-conducted man—I never heard anything against him—I know his hand-writing—these orders are decidedly not his handwriting—I have seen orders like these—if I were furnished with an order of this kind I should send to the railway and get the articles—I have bought orders on the railway, but they have been printed from the Corn-Exchange—there would be nothing at all unusual in buying orders of this kind—I do not know Mr. Empson's signature—I never purchased any of him—I know that he had flour at the station.</p>

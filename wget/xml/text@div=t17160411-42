Another depos'd she heard her say, Her Master had enter'd her a little before she was awak'd, and then found herself in an uncleanly Circumstance: This Evidence swore she kept a young Man Company, and that she was with him 2 or 3 Hours at that Time. A Midwife depos'd the Prosecutor came to her, to know if she were with Child, and desir'd her to search her, to see how she had been injured; which at last she did, but found no Marks of Violence nor Pregnancy. And some others gave Evidence to make it appear a Malicious Prosecution, occasion'd by the Prisoner's Wife.

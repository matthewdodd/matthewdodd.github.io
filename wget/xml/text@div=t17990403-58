               <p>Q. He searched him you mean? - A. Yes; Mr. Perry has had them ever since, and likewise the half-crown that I gave the Jew.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a constable; I was passing by, and saw the prosecutor, and the prisoner, with a basket of oranges; I stepped up to them, I heard the prosecutor saying the money was very bright, and he did not think it was good; I looked at the money, and saw it was bad; Stephens marked it, and then gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Stephens. This is the same money.</p>
               <p>Perry. I took the prisoner to the Compter, and searched him there; I found 
upon him two half-crowns and two shillings bad; he had a half-guinea, a seven-shilling piece, two half-crowns, and five single shillings, which the Lord-Mayor supposed to be all good, and which he returned him.(Mr. Parker proved the money to be counterfeit).</p>

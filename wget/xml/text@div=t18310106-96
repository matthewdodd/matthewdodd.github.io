The prisoner was in our employ; I sent him out last Wednesday, about two o'clock, to various places, with articles, but not this coffee-mill; I expected him back in about an hour and a half or two hours, but he never returned; I saw him next day at Guildhall, with the mill, which is one of our make, and I believe to be ours - it has no mark on it; he had been about three months with me, and we had a satisfactory character with him.</p>

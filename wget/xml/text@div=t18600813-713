                  </hi>. I live at Hendon—Between 12 and 1 o'clock on the morning of 12th July, I turned out a mare and two geldings on a green at Collingdeek Lane, Hendon—they belonged to my father, Samuel Clark—at 6 o'clock that morning they were missing—I went in pursuit with Williams the constable, and traced them beyond St. Albans—when I arrived at Red<lb></lb>bourn I found the mare and one gelding in the pound—that is about 19 miles from where I lost them—the other gelding returned home at 6 o'clock on the Saturday morning—they were stolen on the Friday—Brewer, the constable, gave up the horses to me—the value of the horses was 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the mare 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the pony 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I accompanied Clark to Red-bourn, and saw the pony and the mare in the pound—the prisoner was in Redbourn police-station—about 11 o'clock on the night of Thursday, the 12th, I saw him at Hendon, just about fifty yards from where the horses were; he was by himself—he had his boots in his hand and his coat across his shoulder—I spoke to him—all that I could understand that he said was "London"—when he was delivered to me at Redbourn he had neither boots nor coat on.</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday morning, 13th July, I saw a lad about 16 or 17 years old, with two horses and a pony, at the Bald-faced Stag where I was stopping, near Edgware; it was a little after three in the morning—he was driving them towards Edgware, coming from Hendon—I knew that the pony belonged to Clark—the boy had no shoes or coat with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am keeper of the toll-gate at St. Albans—on Friday, 13th, about 8 o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoner coming with a horse and a pony—St. Albans is on the London side of Redbourn—he was driving them towards St. Albans—I asked him where he brought them from, and he</p>

               <p>talked that language that I could not understand what he said—I afterwards asked him where he was going to take them to; he pointed towards St. Albaus—I asked him for the toll, and he turned his pocket inside out—he understood me, but I could not understand him—he had a rope over bis shoulder, and I told him that I must have that for the toll, and that when his master came and paid the toll he should have the rope—I took the rope—it was something similar to a cart rope—the horses then went through—he drove them on towards St. Albans.</p>

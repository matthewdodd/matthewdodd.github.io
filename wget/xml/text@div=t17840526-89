               <p>Prisoner. A man gave me the trunk opposite St. Paul's, to carry down to this gentleman's lodging; ask him if there was not a sailor came next day and owned the clothes? - Yes, but the prisoner told me afterwards that, that man only came on a false pretence to get the clothes away from me.</p>

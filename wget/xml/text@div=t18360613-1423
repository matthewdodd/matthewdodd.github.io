                  </hi>. I live in Sandford-lane, Stoke-Newington, and am a laundress. On the 27th of May 1 placed seven shirts and a towel is a basket, and gave them to my little girl to take to the owner, Mr. Brown—in consequence of what she told me, I went to Mr. Brown—I found the shirts there, on the table, in the parlour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nearly eleven years of age. I received a parcel from my mother on the 27th of May, to take to Mr. Brown—I took it in a basket—as I was going along I met the prisoner—he asked me where I was going, if I was going to his house—I asked which was his house, and said I was going to Mr. Browns—he said Mr. Brown was out, and the servant had sent him to meet me—if he met me in the field he was to take them—I said he must not tumble them—he told me to wait in the field till he came back with the money—I said I could not, because mother wanted me—he ran across the filed with them, and I went on with the other two shirts to Mr. Cullen's—I called at Mr. Brown's as I came back, and asked if they had got the shirts—the groom ran after the prisoner, and caught him against Thirty-Acre-bridge—I ran after the groom.</p>

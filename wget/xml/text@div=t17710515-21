            . The prisoner on Ash Wednesday, ordered me to fetch a mould and a ladle, between three and four o'clock at noon; the ladle was in the back kitchen. I took the ladle to him in the parlour; there was a cart load of dirt, which I was to sist over the garden; while I was in the garden fisting the cinders, I stood near the parlour window; when I fetched the ladle he bid me turn the carpet half way up, which I did. I saw him take the mould out of a bag that lay upon the carpet. I stood pretty close to the window. I saw him with the ladle take some mould out of a watering pot, that I brought him; and I took him some water at the same time, to sprinkle the earth with. Whilst I was fisting the cinders I saw him put some of the earth into the mould, then he squeezed them together; then he laid some pieces of something along the mould; then he joined the two moulds together, the metal was on the fire; the prisoner called me, whilst I was fisting the first sieve, and asked me if I had taken any metal from off the music. I asked him what it was; he said a piece of tutenage; he called up to his mamma; she told him it was under the green cloth by the window; he put it in the ladle, and I saw it melted; then he put the moulds inside a stand and screwed the stand together; then I saw him pour the metal in the mould; then he unscrewed the stand and took the moulds out, he opened them and took out some pieces and broke them in half; then he throwed the coin upon the hearth; soon afterwards he took them up and put them upon a chair; just at that time the bell rung, he came to me and said he had looked through the door and it was one of his creditors, so he went up stairs; before he went up, he put the moulds into a bag, and he put the earth and ladle on one side; he took the bag up stairs with him. I went and answered the door; after the man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150035"></xptr> was gone, he came down stairs again; while the man was there the house door was open, I saw these shillings, he had covered them with a spotted red and white handkerchief. I counted them, there were fifty-three shillings, which I did suppose were for shillings, they lay upon the chair; they had a sort of a yellow cast, the size of a shilling, with a king William's head upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what was upon the other side?</p>
               <p>Clark. I did not take that particular notice. I do not believe there was any thing upon the other side; then he brought down a bag and fixed a thing on the top of a little table, and it turned round like the flie of a jack; he opened the thing and fixed it on the table and turned the thing round; he put the shillings in and took them out. I saw him take them off the chair from under the handkerchief. When he came in again at night, I asked him what he was making with that metal; he said some dumps for a dancing master's son.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any bad money of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes; I have had the same as these shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where they the same colour as them you saw when they were given you to pass?</p>
               <p>Clark. No; they were not; they whitened them with the stuff they had mixed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner at the bar whiten them?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes; he rubbed them with his thumb and singer with something red; I don't know what it was. I have seen him beat it in the mortar, but never saw him mix it; when he had coined them he separated them that were in long rows, and put them upon the marble harth, then he put them in a chair and covered them with his pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what day of the month it was?</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the house that time?</p>
               <p>Clark. About a week; this was before I gave warning.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he made no secret of this matter?</p>
               <p>Clark. No; it was made no secret, nobody came into our house?</p>
               <p>Q. You had lived there about a week?</p>
               <p>Clark. Not so long I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How large is the room?</p>
               <p>Clark. A large room.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the room is the fire place in?</p>
               <p>Clark. On one side.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you stand to the parlour window?</p>
               <p>Clark. I stood as close as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. The sash up or down?</p>
               <p>Clark. Down.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from where you stood was the fire?</p>
               <p>Clark. About so far; (describing about four yards.)</p>
               <p>Q. What, was the dirt put into the moulds?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you speak of tutenage. What colour was it?</p>
               <p>Clark. Of a kind of yellow cast.</p>
               <p>Q. And your master made no secret of it?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, it is a pity but they did make a secret; they bring goods or any thing in, and make no secret of it.</p>
               <p>Q. He left them upon a chair?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they altogether or separate when you saw them upon the chair?</p>
               <p>Clark. They were broke; they were all separate.</p>
               <p>Q. What number did you see?</p>
               <p>Clark. Fifty-three.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in some confusion when this man knock'd at the door, and the young man went up stairs; your business was to talk to this man at the door?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time had you to go into the parlour?</p>
               <p>Clark. While the man was talking, and making a noise at the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. You was talking to the man till he was gone?</p>
               <p>Clark. No; I shut the door before he went, and left him making a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. When the door was shut, your master was safe enough from the man?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did your master stay up stairs after the door was shut?</p>
               <p>Clark. Some time after; I saw the money while the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think?</p>
               <p>Clark. I cannot say the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150036"></xptr>Q. Which door was shut when the man went away?</p>
               <p>Clark. The street door; we do not let them into the garden when they come.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You look'd at these shillings?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes; I thought them the same make as the shillings they had given me to pass: it made me very cautious not to take them to put off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to your master when he came in at night?</p>
               <p>Clark. Only I asked him what he was making; he said, dumps. I said I would never take any more to pass, for they were the same as he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay after this?</p>
               <p>Clark. About three weeks; I would not carry a shilling to pass, and they turned me out. My old master beat me. This young man was guarded out by my master with a drawn sword. He turned me out at half an hour after twelve at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to after that?</p>
               <p>Clark. To one Mrs. Boucher's, an acquaintance of theirs. I live with one Mr. Clift now; I have lived there two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Clift and your master have had some law-suits together I believe?</p>
               <p>Clark. That is nothing to me, If I had not been with Mr. Clift they would not have served me with a copy of a writ, because I said a relation of my master's had taken bad money to pass.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Clift had some dispute with Mr. Byerman, I believe?</p>
               <p>Clark. I believe they had; I knew Mr. Clift before I went to Mr. Byerman's. Mr. Clift gave me warning upon that affair. I have three masters here that I lived with. It was the lawyer I carried the copy of the writ to, who insisted upon my going to the sollicitor of the Tower.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that piece of money ( shewing her a piece of foreign coin.) Do you think that was one of the fifty-three?</p>
               <p>Clark. I am sure it is not; they offered me 200 l. to go abroad; if they can hurt me they will. I know that is not one of the shillings.</p>
               <p>Isabella Walker. I lived with Mr. Byerman, the first day that ever I caught him doing any thing, he asked me to beat some quick silver and brick dust together. He put the quick silver into the mortar, and I beat it up with the brick dust; it mixed together; he took his buckles out of his shoes and cleaned them; he would not let me stay in the room, but bid me go up to make his bed; when I came down with the pot I saw him at the sink, rubbing something upon a shilling, between his finger and thumb, he said he took these bad shillings upon a journey, and as he had taken them he should get them off; there was some money laid down upon the dresser, and I think one of, the bad shillings lay upon the drawers. I went with one of these shillings to buy some rabbits, the prisoner and his mother were there upon St. Thomas's day; it was I think Friday, and bought a rabbit, the gentleman never disputed them, and I wondered why I should; after that time I thought they were not bad; but upon Christmas day in the morning the because cupboard door was left open, there was a large saucer quite full of this bad money; they had heads upon one side, and nothing at all upon the other. I thought directly they were some of the same shillings I had seen in the window; at Christmas day at night my master and mistress used me very ill, my young master was there at the same time, and told me not to take any notice of what I had heard or seen, for it was not his fault, and desired I would not say any thing about him. I came away in the morning; I locked the door and put the key under it; and went away and never came again for my wages; that time and Christmas day was the only time I ever saw them, that was the only time I ever saw him rub them. I borrowed three shillings once of the father, and a five and three-pence. I changed the quarter of a guinea, and put the money into my pocket. I looked at it; it was all good, I put it among the other money. I offered a shilling afterwards, the woman said that it was a bad shilling. I went back and told the woman she had given it to me. I went home to my master and told him of it; he said the woman at the chandler's shop had given it me; and he bid me go and break her windows.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some quarrels with your master while you was there?</p>
               <p>Walker. Only one.</p>
               <p>Q. When your master was cleaning his buckles with this stuff, you said he sent you out of the room?</p>
               <p>Walker. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150037"></xptr>Q. You say a little before you went away. the prisoner said he hoped you would say nothing about him?</p>
               <p>Walker. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was in debt, and had his creditors come after him?</p>
               <p>Walker. Yes; a vast many.</p>

               <p>Q. Is she a married woman, or a single woman?</p>
               <p>Osborn. She has a husband.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been her general character during that time?</p>
               <p>Osborn. She has lived backwards and forwards, in places and out of places, several times. I never knew her live long in a place.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a creditable person, to be believed as a witness, upon her oath?</p>
               <p>Osborn. I do not think she is; I have known her six years.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, do you not think she is to be believed upon her oath?</p>
               <p>Osborn. Because, if any person offends her she would not scruple any thing. When her brother offended her, she told me she would swear sodomy against him, and I persuaded her not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the time she told you?</p>
               <p>Osborn. She told me two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. At a time when her brother had not offended her?</p>
               <p>Osborn. Yes; and when her brother and she quarrelled, she would swear, by God, she would do it.</p>
               <p>Q. But did she do it?</p>

            ; the manner in which she described it was not like such a thing; she gave no account of any press; I served my time to a button maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that silver could be melted in an iron ladle?</p>
               <p>Clarke. That is a matter of doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of tutenage?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I can't tell: I don't think it could be melted in an iron ladle without a furnace.</p>
               <p>Q. Is tutenage softer or harder than silver?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I rather think it softer; if there is an air furnace it would melt of itself?</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it would not melt without a furnace, or being blown under?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Would tutenage put into a hot coal fire melt?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I should think not; I should think it would not melt without the fire being blown under.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of this metal being melted in an iron ladle?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; nor any mechanic whatever, I am sure.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150039"></xptr>Council for the Crown. Is there no putting something among the metal to soften it?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I cannot say; I think tutenage will not melt without a draught, or blowing under it.</p>
               <p>Court. Tutenage is a mixed metal, I think?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I believe a substance of itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a sort of copper?</p>
               <p>Clarke. They call it white copper.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of this coin that has been produced?</p>
               <p>Clarke. It appears to be silver alloyed with copper.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know where he was on Ash Wednesday?</p>
               <p>Burn. I cannot say; I was at Mr. Byerman's to spend the evening; he was not there: I went there a little after, and staid there all the evening: I asked for him, and he was gone out. I was in the parlour and the kitchen; Mrs. Byerman was in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was old Mrs. Byaman at home?</p>

               <p>Q. What time did she come home?</p>
               <p>Burn. Some time in the evening; I cannot tell exactly what time.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it hurried?</p>
               <p>Burn. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go to pay a visit when your child lay dead?</p>
               <p>Burn. Yes; I went there almost every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live?</p>
               <p>Burn. A whole week at my mother's.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him come in, but saw him when he was in the house?</p>
               <p>Burn. I was in the parlour when he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him come in?</p>
               <p>Burn. I saw him come in.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him come in at?</p>

               <p>Burn. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him knock at the door?</p>
               <p>Burn. No; I heard the bell ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before dinner, or after?</p>
               <p>Burn. After; I was in the house before dinner: I went to dine with my mother, at the next door; they asked me to stay dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who?</p>
               <p>Burn. Mrs. Byerman herself.</p>
               <p>Q. You said they?</p>
               <p>Burn. It was Mrs. Byerman. I went in, between twelve and one, and she asked me to dine. I went home and dined, and came in again about two. My child died the tenth of February. I had been a week before at my mother's.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him come home?</p>
               <p>Burn. Between nine and ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not at home from that time?</p>
               <p>Burn. No; I asked his mother for him; she said he was not at home.</p>

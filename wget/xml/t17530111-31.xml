            . On the 30th of Dec. betwixt seven and eight o'clock, I was going into a coffee-house; when I was at the corner of Fenchurch-lane, the prisoner was behind me, and I felt him put his hand into my pocket; after that I put my hand in and missed my handkerchief; I had just before used it in blowing my nose; I turned about and saw there was nobody near me but the prisoner; I jumped upon him, he shamm'd the fool or being fuddled ; I pushed him into a coffee-house, there were gentlemen that knew me, who searched him, and found these nine linnen handkerchiefs upon him of different quantities and qualities. They were produced in court, but nobody owned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your's amongst them?</p>
               <p>Gabriel. No, it was not, my lord.</p>

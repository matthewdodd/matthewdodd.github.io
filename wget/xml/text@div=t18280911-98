            . I have a brother in Mr. Colwell's employ; in consequence of instructions from him, I went to the prisoner's shop in Tottenham-court-road, and saw the prisoner there, or a person very much resembling him, of his age and appearance - I was there five or ten minutes; I believe the prisoner to be the man - I do not know whose shop it is; I saw two tea-pots there which my brother had described - here is one of them, which I purchased; it was about five o'clock in the afternoon when I went there - there was then a mark on the bottom of the tea-pot above the name of Dixon and Son; my brother was waiting at the corner of Howland-street while I went to purchase it - I saw another tea-pot there with a similar mark; I described those marks to my brother - I went to the shop again between eight and nine o'clock, and saw the same person, (I will not swear it was the prisoner) - the same tea-pots were then produced to me, but the marks were altered by scratching over - I could not discern an N and X which I saw on it before; I bought that tea-pot for 2s. and brought it to my brother - this is it; the shop is the second door from Howland-street, on the left hand going from St. Giles'.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Colwell. My brother delivered this tea-pot to me - I can see the remains of the mark N and X on it now - it is a private mark of my own, to tell the invoice price, which was 5s. - we have a discount off that.</p>
               <p>MR. COLWELL. In consequence of information from Dodd, I went to the prisoner's shop in Tottenham-court-road, on the 25th of August, with three officers, and saw the prisoner - it was the Monday morning after the Saturday that the tea-pot was bought - the officers searched the premises, and found several things of mine which were marked, and brought them away - I left several which I knew to be mine, but they were not marked; I brought away another tea-pot, on which I could discover the mark, though it had erasures on it, and the original wrapper which had been on it in the shop - I know the wrapper, from the number which corresponds with the number on the tea-pot - here is N X on it - that was on it when found; I have not the least doubt of this, and the one bought by Dodd, being mine; here is a snuffer-tray - the same alteration has been attempted on that; the original mark was I E; there are two or three more marks made to obliterate it; here is a nursery lamp with the same obliteration - I cannot discern the original mark on that: here are a parcel of cocks which I know to be mine by the wrapper they are in - there is W H on them, and R N; they are marked singly - the wrapper was turned inside out when I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110075"></xptr>them, with the writing inside; here is a cock I can speak to decidedly, it was marked E of - there has been an attempt to obliterate it, but there is enough for me to know it; I know these cocks to have been in my possession, and I should think they were never sold; here is one of Chubb's patent locks, No. 1323, which is the number in my invoice - I never remember selling it; here is a parcel of stove screws - they have an original mark on them - other marks have been added to confuse them, but I know my original marks - they are in a paper which also has my mark on it; here are some more screws - the original mark has been f p - it has been altered into a T; another parcel of screws, which were marked f p, is now altered to T R; here is a salt-cellar, marked f a; a set of fire-irons, which I know by the pattern, but the marks are taken off by emery paper - they were bought of a particular maker, and are a pattern we generally keep; another pair of fire-brasses, the original mark was F R X- I can swear positively to them; another pair have a mark taken off the place where I mark my goods; here are three other pairs, the marks on which are taken out - the goods were produced by the prisoner; I shewed him several parcels as they were found - he said he had had them a long while in his house; I shewed him these six cocks which were in paper, and asked how long he had had them - he said for some years; I said that was quite impossible from the bright appearance of them - he said "You know they keep bright for a long time if kept in paper;" I took them up, and seeing my mark on the bottom of the paper, I said I knew fully that he had not had those in his possession six months, as they had not been in mine so long; he told me he had bought the goods at Braid's sale; I believe there was a sale of Braid's stock about four years ago; he particularly spoke of having bought these cocks there, and said he had bought all the goods at sales generally; I had no dealing with Braid; I had the prisoner taken to Bow-street; he gave an account there of how he got them.</p>
               <p>MR. WOODS. I am clerk to the Magistrates of Bow-street-office, and took the examinations in this case. I did not take down one word that the prisoner said - it is not the practice.</p>

               <p>MR. COLWELL. He said he had bought them of a person named Ward, and then said Harry Ward. (Henry Ward, my servant was tried here yesterday.) I believe in answer to a remark of Sir Richard Birnie's, he said"I bought them all generally of Ward;" I afterwards saw Ward at Bow-street, and the prisoner recognized him as the man he bought them of - I did not mention the tea-pot he had brought to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were there a great variety of articles at the prisoner's shop? A. Yes; it was chiefly filled with old cranks - there were some other things of the same description as mine; I have two persons who serve in my shop besides myself - I sell my goods with the private-marks on them, and cannot swear I never sold the tea-pot; the six cocks in the paper I speak to from the paper, but two others are marked on the cocks - I speak to them decidedly; the paper has certainly been in my shop - I speak to the lock by the number, I did not take the number down myself; we never sell stove-screws - there is a private-mark on the paper, but not on the screws: there is generally a difference in stove-screws, I can tell mine from another make - I asked him about the fire-brasses, and these curtain bands, as I knew them by the pattern, he said he thought they came with other things from the sale - Braid's was the only sale he mentioned; he did not mention Ward's name at his own house - he said at Bow-street, that he bought that lock of Ward; Sir Richard Birnie asked where he got several other things, he said "I bought them of Harry Ward;" he said so of the fire-irons and cocks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were all the things produced at Bow-street? A. They were; he said he gave 34s. for the lock - he might buy it much cheaper at Chubb's.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You do not know the cocks, but the paper - do you send out the paper with cocks? A. No; if the paper had been with its right side out, I could instantly have told what cocks they were - I know the lock from the number, for I was one of the first who had Chubb's locks, and it is an early number; the mark on the paper of screws was outside, and a pattern-screw tied outside - I had missed the curtain bands about six months ago, and had not sold them; I never knew of Ward having sold him any things, he was not authorized to do so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you sold six cocks together, should you send the paper with them? A. I might then, but do not remember selling six together - I may have thrown aside my papers as waste when the goods have been sold; it is often done - mine is a large business; I could not miss these goods without taking stock - Ward's name is Henry, he called him Harry familiarly; Ward was present during part of the examination - I never sell stove-screws, and do not think others do, they are for use in the business; I never knew an ironmonger sell them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Colwell to Scoltock's shop, I know it was his house, I had seen him before, and knew him: I told him I had a warwant to search for property which Mr. Colwell suspected to be there - he was behind the counter, and told us to go on with the search for he had nothing but what belonged to him: I searched and found a good many things - all Mr. Colwell claimed were laid together; and when I asked the prisoner where he bought them, he told me he bought them of a man who hawked them about - I did not ask him the man's name, he said he should know him again if he saw him; these goods were in his presence at the time - I heard the conversation between Mr. Colwell and him about the cocks; he said that parcel of six cocks had been in his possession a long time, and he believed he bought them at Braid's sale - there was a great quantity of all sorts of ironmongery about the shop, fire-irons and cocks; at Bow-street, he said he had given 24s. or 34s. for the lock, but it had been so long in his possession, he could not call to mind the sum; I think he said he had it two years, I am pretty sure he said so - the brass-irons, and other things, he said he bought of Ward: Ward was brought in, and he said he was the man, and that he had bought the lock of him.</p>

            . I was formerly in Mr. Colwell's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110076"></xptr>employ; Henry Ward was also in his service - I saw him take a set of common steel fire-irons one evening up to Scoltock's shop in Tottenham-court-road, I went with him - they were similar to those produced; he came out without them, and shewed me 3s. - they were Mr. Colwell's irons; I think it was about two years ago - I went with him again very shortly after that, and he took six beer cocks - it might be a week or more after he took the fire-irons; Fryett had brought the cocks down from the shop - I think they were taken away loose, not in paper; Ward took them into Scoltock's shop, came out without them, and brought 6s. out in his hand - I never went to the shop after that; I recollect this patent lock - I know Ward had one of these from Mr. Colwell's; I saw him take it out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the prisoner near Mr. Colwell's shop? A. Yes, two or three times; he came and knocked at the iron rails, Ward went out to him - I saw which way he went, and Ward followed him; I was examined at Bow-street, and was locked up with Scoltock and Ward afterwards - Ward grumbled, and said to Scoltock,"You know you only gave me 5s. for the lock;" I did not hear what passed further - Ward had told me in the prisoner's hearing, that it was the same lock as what I had to do with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you go and tell your employer what had been done? A. No; I was taken up and examined at Bow-street - I was out on bail; I was at the bar yesterday, and was let off - I believe evidence was offered; I do not know anything about it, but I was acquitted.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. After you were at the bar, did any witness stand were you do now? A. No - I told Mr. Colwell about the fire-irons before yesterday - I surrendered here yesterday.</p>
               <p>MR. CHARLES CHUBB. I know this patent lock by the number to be one I sold Mr. Colwell; here is an entry in our books made by my father, who is at Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>The Court called on Mr. Adolphus to elect on what article he proceeded, and the six beer cocks were fixed on.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to THOMAS DODD. Q. Do you mean to say you can tell the beer cocks, which you say were taken to Tottenham-court-road? A. I do not mean to say I can swear to them - I saw the cocks; there were six.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw the cocks taken out of Mr. Colwell's passage by Ward; they were carried to Scoltock's by Ward, who came out with 6s. in his hand? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. How do you know he did not receive a great deal more? A. I cannot say; only that is what was in his hand.</p>
               <p>The Record of Ward's conviction was here read.</p>
               <p>JOHN UPSON. I was examined on Ward's trial - he is the person I saw at Bow-street, and of whom the prisoner spoke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the things conscientiously, thinking them honestly come by - this man represented himself to me to be in business in Belton-street, and that it was the remainder of his stock; I gave a fair and honourable price for it - he was formerly a master smith in Belton-street: the fire-irons are from the country.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hatsell depos'd. That coming from the Tavern the 5th of April at Night, he found his Room open, upon which he turn'd the Key, and fetching the Watch he search'd the Room, but found no Body. Next Morning missing his Goods he made further Enquiry, and understood that a Porter had been with his Landlady the Night before in his Name, desiring the Key of the Door might be left at Tom's Coffee-House, for Mr. Hatsell was gone to my Lady Sherley's, and would not be at home till Eleven: After a strict Search Mr. Hatsell found out the Porter, who gave such a Description of the Person who sent him, that he did believe it to be the Prisoner, who was Servant to his Barber, and accordingly apprehended him.</p>

             the Porter depos'd. That the Prisoner came to him and enquired for one Nash, a Porter, who he told him was gone into the City; upon which the Prisoner desired Candey to go of an Errand for him to Devereaux Court, but he not liking his Looks would not obey his Orders: Afterwards he found Nash, whom he sent, and got the Key, by the Help of which he came to Mr. Hatsell's Chamber, and took the Goods mentioned in the Indictment.</p>

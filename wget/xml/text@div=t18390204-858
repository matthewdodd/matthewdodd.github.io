               <p>in the house of Charles Ernest Rackwitz, a baker. I have known the prisoner eighteen or twenty years—we were in the habit of visiting each other—her husband holds a respectable situation in Doctor's-commons—on Monday, the 14th of January, I changed a cheque at Barclay's bank—my landlady was with me, and she took the money, all but 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which she gave me—the money was a £10 note, three £5 notes, and a sovereign—after I got home, I paid my landlady the £10 note, and two of the £5 notes—I put the sovereign into the other £5 note, and put them together into my purse, which I put into my pocket—I afterwards put it into my table-drawer in my front room—the drawer was not locked—that was between four and five o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner was in my room at the time—she came about four o'clock, and drank tea with me—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. To fetch a loaf from below, and we had a little gin and water together about seven o'clock I said to her, "I am very tired, and if you will excuse me, I will go to bed"—I was fatigued with the walk in the morning—she said, "I will go up stairs with you"—she did so, and assisted me to bed she wished me good night, stooped over the bed and kissed me, and went away—I heard the private door slam—I did not go to sleep, but about ten minutes after, I got out of bed, put on my shoes and cloak, and went down stairs to get my purse out of the table-drawer, but it was gone—I am quite sure I had put it into the drawer.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the White Hart, in the Walworth-road, about half or three quarters of a mile from the prosecutrix. On the 14th of January, between seven and ten o'clock in the evening, I gave the pri<lb></lb>soner change for this note—I knew her before, and have not a doubt of her being the person—I knew her name, and put it on it myself—I have written "Sagger, Manor-place, 14 January, 39"—I afterwards paid the note to the Excise.</p>

               <p>I changed any other £5 note that day, but I cannot be certain, I only sur<lb></lb>mise the time, I fancy it was after tea—my attention was not called to this for nine days—I had forgotten the transaction then, except by the parties referring to some money I had paid to the Excise—I had paid sixteen guineas to the Excise—I think it was three £5 notes—I paid it, I think, the Wednesday after I took the note—I could not have written the name and address on either of the other notes, for I wrote it when the prisoner changed it—I did not notice whether I wrote names on the other notes—I have written Mr., not Mrs. Sagger, on this note—I knew her to be a married woman—it was written in her presence—I said,."Your name is Mrs. Sagger, I believe," and she said, "Yes"—I was certain of her person, but not exactly of her name at the time—I had sent goods to her house, and knew her as a customer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Batts. About a quarter to nine o'clock on the evening of the 4th of October, I was at the Adelaide Gal<lb></lb>lery with Amelia Cox—I went up to the electrifying machine—the pri<lb></lb>soner was standing on my right-hand side—I was being electrified—my dress was pulled up from the bottom—I went to knock it down—the pri<lb></lb>soner was standing by my hip—I struck her—she had not got her hand quite out of my pocket—I dropped my hand and said, "My G—Mrs. Cox, I am robbed"—she said, "No, you are not"—I said to the pri<lb></lb>soner, "Yes, and it is you"—I took hold of her arm, then of her hand, and my purse was in her hand—she dropped my purse down at my feet—she said, "I have not got any thing, feel"—I said, "Yes, you have dropped it"—I never let go of her till I gave her in charge—my purse contained ten shillings and three sixpences—this is it—I picked it up at the time—I had made it myself—it is joined in the middle.</p>

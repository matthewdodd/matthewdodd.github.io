             sworn. - I am an extra constable, at Shadwell: On the 5th of October, at five o'clock in the morning, I was standing in St. George's Parish, I saw the prisoner, and another, coming along, I knew him immediately, he had got something upon his head; I put my band to it, and found this piece of a bell, wrapped up in a black gown, and the other immediately ran away; when I stopped him, he said it belonged to the other man, who had ran away; it is a ship's bell. (Produces it).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Robert Richardson, that ran away when I was taken into custody, called me out of bed that morning, and asked me to go with him to fetch a bundle, and he would give me a shilling, which I did, and he took it out from behind some rails; he said, he had left it there the night before, when he came from work; I did not know it was stolen; I could have proved that he called me up that morning, but I did not expect my trial to come on so soon.</p>

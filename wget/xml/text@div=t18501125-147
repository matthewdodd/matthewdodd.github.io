                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Weir, who lives in Windmill-lane, Stratford, in the parish of West Ham—I know the prisoner—on Monday evening, 4th Nov., I was in the back kitchen about eight o'clock—there is a door which opens from that to a street by the side of the house—I had a gold chain round my neck—there were two seats and a key, and a ring attached to it, and a silver watch—I had a brooch in my gown—I had the candle in my hand—I walked to the safe to get out the supper—the side door was ajar—I did not see the prisoner—he came in, and came behind me—he said, "You b——, you shall pay for all"—he took hold of me by the throat, took the brooch from my gown, and the watch and seals, and chain from my neck—the chain must have broken—I did not hear anything fall, but they were all gone from me—the prisoner had the watch in his hand, and he was going out—I screamed "Murder!" and my husband stopped him, and took the watch from him—I afterwards</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness. On Monday evening, 4th Nov., about eight o'clock, I was standing at my front door—there is a door from my back kitchen which leads to a bye street—I heard my wife scream, and I ran to the side-door—I saw the prisoner coming out, I laid hold of him, and took from him my wife's gold guard-chain and silver watch—he had them in his right hand—I called, "Police!" and endeavoured to detain him—he resisted, and tried to get away—I laid hold of him, and struggled with him—we both tumbled down together—he at last got away, before the police were there—I examined the back kitchen, and found near the door the two seals, and key, and ring, which my wife was in the habit of wearing—my wife had a brooch that night, which has never been found since—I saw a cap near the door—I do not know whose it was—I know the prisoner—this is the watch, and guard, and seals, and key, and ring—they are all my property.</p>

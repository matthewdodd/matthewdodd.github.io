I had a daughter, Elizabeth Evans Cross<lb></lb>ley, who was born on 18th July, 1845—in consequence of some communica<lb></lb>tion I called on the prisoner and his father on the 18th August last in Ely—I said I understood the prisoner was engaged to my daughter; that it was very much against my wish, an my daughter was only eighteen years of age the 19th of last July—I told him that if he did not break off the engage<lb></lb>ment I should take my daughter home—she was then living with her grand<lb></lb>mother—I am a widower—I have two other daughters, of the ages of sixteen and seventeen—I permitted my daughter Elizabeth to live with her grand<lb></lb>mother because the old lady was left alone, and we thought it would be com<lb></lb>pany for her—I saw her frequently, mostly twice a week, sometimes three or four times—the prisoner said nothing to me as to whether the acquaintance was continuing or not—the only reply he made was, "I love her"—I did not give my consent to the marriage; it was very much against my consent—I was not aware that she had left her grandmother's house—she is entitled to one-third share of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that becomes absolutely hers when she is twenty-one years of age.</p>

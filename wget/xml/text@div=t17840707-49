               <p>Mr. Brown lives in the country entirely, and he put me in the care of the office, my daughter and me were sitting in the kitchen very serious, and I heard the parlour door screech, and I sent up my daughter to see who was in the parlour, and if it was a thief to call Mr. Brown down, and I followed her up for fear he should knock her down, and that man came out of the parlour with the coat and the hat covered with that coat he has on, he said your servant; we took him, and he slipped the coat between the parlour door and the stairs, he brought it out of the parlour, and my daughter held him by the cuff of his coat tel Mr. Brown came down. (A paper handed to the Court.) The prisoner cannot speak good English, he is a Venetian, he is aged eighty-four.</p>

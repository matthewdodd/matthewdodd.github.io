               <p>FRANCES ANDERSON. I am thirteen years old, and live in Mercers-row, Shadwell - my father goes out with vegetables. On the 4th of June I was going to the corn-chandler's, and saw the prisoner go behind the prosecutrix, at the bottom of Mercer's-row, knock her down, take off her shawl, and run up the court; I knew him before - he sits at the bottom of the street with apples and gooseberries; I never saw O'Hara before - she was going along, and she sat on the prisoner's chair; he walked up a street with her - he let her go again, and she was going away, when he came behind her, knocked her down, and ran into his own house, about six yards from his stall - she came to the top of the street, and called Watch! and Police! the Policeman came up, and asked me to show him where he lived -I went with him, and knocked at the door; the prisoner opened it, and gave the shawl out.</p>
               <p>ELLEN O'HARA. I never saw the man before, and was not walking with him, nor sat in his chair, nor in any chair; I did not know he had a stall.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 4th of June, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, I was in my room, and heard the prosecutrix sing out Watch! and Police! I ran down to her - she said she had lost her shawl; Anderson told me where the prisoner lodged, and said she had seen him knock the woman down and take the shawl - I knocked at the prisoner's door, which was bolted, and he opened it; his room being dark, I did not know whether the shawl was on the bed, or under it - I asked him for her shawl; he gave it to me, and said he took it to take care of, as she was in liquor, and did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300099"></xptr>know what she was doing - he said no more, and I took him to the watch-house; he is a labourer at the docks -I saw his stall there after nine o'clock, but it was not there when I took him; the prosecutrix was in liquor, for I locked her up all night to take care of her - she did not know what she was doing.</p>

            . The stall was there when the Policeman took the prisoner by - I am sure of it, for I ran and told my mother of it, as he was taken; I saw the prosecutrix in the chair, and she then walked away with him.</p>

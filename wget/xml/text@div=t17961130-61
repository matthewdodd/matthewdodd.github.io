               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner been in that situation with you? - A. I believe eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. You had placed a considerable considence in him? - A. Very great.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you employ a person of the name of Keene as your currier? - A. I did; he is the son of a Mr. John Keene, who had had our business many years back; he was employed soon after the death of his father.</p>
               <p>Q. The basil skins, the subject matter of this indictment, had they occasion to be sent to your curriers? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose are those basils used? - A. For covering a particular kind of tin-box called, by the Officers of Ordnance, magazine boxes, that is the only purpose for which they are used by us; they are used by other people for caps.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. They were the property of the partnership? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. From some intelligence that you had lost some skins, you were led to Mr. Graves's? - A. Yes; he is a leatherseller on Fish-street-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any skins? - A. I never found the skins; I found there had been a sale there of skins of that quality.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Has it never happened that when basil skins have become mouldy, or are injured, that they have been sent to the curriers to be put in a proper state? - A. I cannot say that; a currier cannot do them any good if they are damaged very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Keene was your currier? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To the time of this information, whether you had not the best opinion of the prisoner? - A. Certainly; he had our full confidence, a general good character.</p>

            Keene is to be called as a witness-do you give him a good character? - A. I certainly thought well of him, or I should not have employed him.</p>

               <p>Q. He was admitted a King's evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You appeared before the Magistrate to prosecute Keene? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. It was in consequence of Keene's evidence that you were enabled to lay hold of any facts against Davidson? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. If the skins are mildewed, you can brush it off, and would not lend them to the currier? - A. No, I should not.</p>

               <p>Q. They were black basil skins - were you in the habit of taking black basil skins to curry? - A. I had about a dozen and a half from Mr. Esdaile to black about three years ago, but they were quite a different sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these skins sent you that Mr. Graves had - did you ever have skins of that sort to curry? - A. No; they are always ready done.</p>
               <p>Q. You received a great many things from Mr. Esdaile as a currier? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you took that examination, did you apprise the prisoner of the consequences of making any confession? - A. I have the minute in my book in these words -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mr. Esdaile).

            Before the examination was taken down, had not you, in the presence of a Mr. Wyatt, promised to the prisoner, that if he would tell you the truth, you would not appear against him? - A. I certainly said something of that sort; I told him I had a suspicion he had sent some hides from my house improperly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you promise him say at he confessed the transaction? - A. I certainly and, and sent him about his business.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That promise was not relative to the present subject of enquiry? - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300082"></xptr>Q. Did you, when you promised him favour, specify any particular charge against him? - A. I did; I said, he had sent hides of mine to Leadenhall to be re-sold, this was on Thursday the 27th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you promise him that favour? - A. Upon suspecting Keene of having sent some hides to Leadenhall-market; I went with another person to Keene's, and charged him with the fact, which he denied, and afterwards confessed, I then said, he must have an accomplice, he said, he had an accomplice, who was it? he said, it was Davidson; I said, he must go with me to my house; Mr. Wyatt and the witness and I went to my house; I sent for Davidson, and told him I had information that he had sent some hides improperly from my house, he denied it; I said, he had better confess it, as I had sufficient proof of it; he solemnly denied knowing any thing of it; I produced Keene to him, and then he acknowledged it, and begged for mercy; I took one to one side of the house, and the other to the other and dismissed them, and hoped I should never see them more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It appears from what this gentleman has said, that he promised him favour if he would discover the transaction.</p>
               <p>Court. I have taken it thus, that he made a promise of favour if he made a discovery of a transaction respecting some hides.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Esdaile, in that conversation, charged him with delivering hides to the currier, and promised him, that if he related the truth of the transaction he would be kind to him. The charge here, is delivering hides to the currier.</p>
               <p>Court. The indictment is for basil skins.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Basil skins are hides.</p>
               <p>Mr. Esdaile. No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Court. This circumstance, of the basil skins, was not known nor Heard of at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Esdaile. It was respecting the hides, they both protested they knew of no transaction besides.(Mr. Colquhoun then read the minutes from his book of the examination.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mr. Esdaile.) Q. Did not you see Davidson the night before the examination? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In the morning, before the examination, did not you say you would admit him King's evidence? - A. No; I had no communication with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mr. Colquhoun.) Q. Was there any examination taken down at the prisoner's final examination? - A. No.</p>

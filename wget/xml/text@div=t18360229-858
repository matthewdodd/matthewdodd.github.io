                  </hi>. I am apprenticed to my brother, John Geevan, and live in the house. The prisoner was his housekeeper up to the 11th of February from the 24th of November—I marked some candles, having sus<lb></lb>picion, and sent them down into the kitchen, for the use of the house—I called in a constable on the 11th of February, who searched her box in her presence—it was not locked—he took out six mould candles, and one kit<lb></lb>chen candle—four of the mould candles were what I had marked—he them went to a chest of drawers in her bed-room, and found eleven glass bottles, rolled up a separately in paper—the drawer was not locked—she said she took them to make ornaments, and produced some bottles which she had made some kind of ornaments of.</p>

I went to the prosecutors's house, and searched the prisoner's box—I found six mould candles, a kitchen candle, and the phials she said the property belonged to her master, and burst out crying.

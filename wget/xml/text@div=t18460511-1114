I am the wife of David Levy; we live in North-row, Covent Garden-market—On the 28th of April the prisoner came there—she went first to a lady who came to me, and the prisoner said she came from Worcestershire up to London-bridge, and she was to meet a lady who was to take her to service, but she waited there and no one came—I agreed to take her at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-week first, and to raise it afterwards—she went out for some sugar, and as she was going, a man said she had got a bundle—I watched to see where she went—she looked back and saw me—I went and took her, and this printed cotton dropped from her—I charged her with steal<lb></lb>ing it—she said it was her own, and that I gave it her—I had not given it her—it is mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She did give it me: she sent for my clothes, and they did not come, and she gave me this; she quarrelled with me on Monday because I had not got the dinner ready: I had not been in London more than a week; a person sent for me, and said she would give me a situation: I came up by the train from Worcester to London: I had very little money: I did not like the ways of my master; he was very forward with me, and I complained to my mistress. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She made no complaint to me—she had no money when she came to me—I took her out of charity—she was only with me four days.</p>

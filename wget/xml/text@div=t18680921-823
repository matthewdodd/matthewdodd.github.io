                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of 1, Elizabeth Street, Poplar—the prisoner is my landlord, and resided in the same house—on Tuesday evening, 8th September, about 7.45, I was in my room with my daughter; the door was closed—the prisoner suddenly came in, with a spade in his hand—he hit me two blows on the forehead with it, and I fell down insensible—I had not spoken to him at all that evening—my wounds were dressed at the station the same evening—I was sitting in a chair by the window, and the prisoner threw a saucepan into the room, and then came in with the spade—it was my saucepan, and was kept on the landing outside.</p>

I am the daughter of the last witness—I came home about 7.40, and went to our room—the prisoner came up, burst the door open, and threw in a tin saucepan, and two iron ones, and then a small washing tub, which struck me on the leg—I called my father, and the prisoner then came into the room, with the spade in his hands—he struck my father before he could ask what was the matter, and he fell—I caught him—the prisoner then struck him another blow across the nose, and the third blow glanced off his head on to his elbow—he was insensible for twenty minutes.</p>

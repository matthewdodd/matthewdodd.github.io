On the 14th of June, about five o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in Bentinck-street, half a mile from Langham-place—he was carrying this bundle—I asked what he had there—he said, "What is that to you? I wish you would mind your own business"—I said, "I shall take you to the station-house"—he said, "Let</p>

               <p>me go; it is all right"—I found this coal, soap, and candles in the bundle—he said they came from a gentleman's house in Langham-place, and than that they came from Sir Gilbert Heathcote's-before I got to the station-house, he became very obstreperous and wished to get away, and! I was forced to call in the aid of another police-constable.</p>

I am upper-housemaid to Sir Gilbert Heathcote—his house is in Langham-place—the family are out of town—I and another maid were in care of the house, and the prisoner, slept there by order of Mr. Robins, the auctioneer, his master, to take care of the house—he slept in the under-butlers pantry—he had slept there about two years—he has a key of the area gate, to let him in at night; has he cannot go any farther than the lower door—he slept there on Saturday night, the 13th—the soap and candles are kept in the still-room drawer, which is unlocked, near the coals—I do not know whether the soap is my masters—my master had pieces of coal like these—I never gave him any of these things—I had so much under my care, that I could not miss so small a quantity—we have soap of that colour and quality—the candles—I have are six to the pound.</p>

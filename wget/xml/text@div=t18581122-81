                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 244). I was on duty on Sunday. 21st November, at Spread Eagle-court, Rotherhithe, about a quarter past 11—I heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in the court and went to stop it—there was a mob of about fifty persons—I dispersed them as well as I could at first—I went away a short time and then they commenced again, and I went back—I apprehended one person that was the principal cause of the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—the mob being so strong, he was rescued from me by the others—during the time he was being rescued, Berry said, "We have got the old b—down here now, and we will pay him," and with that, Mahony picked up a large piece of brick and threw it at me, and hit me on the nose and made me quite insensible at the time—Mahony left the court for a short time—he returned home again—I afterwards saw him go into his house—I got further assistance from the station—I went to the house and tapped at the door—I could get no admittance that way—I took hold of the top of the shutters which were very slackly fastened, forced them, and went into the house—I went up stairs and found him in bed with two small children with his boots and trousers on—I told him I wanted him for assaulting me, and I took him—he said nothing—I went down to the surgeon after that, and had my nose dressed—when I returned to the station, Berry was brought there by another witness—he was in the mob the whole of the time—he tried to rescue Mahony on the road to the station—I told him I should charge him for attempting to rescue Mahony—he said that he never attempted to do such a thing—he tried to pull Mahony away on the road to the station—Boyle struck me two or three times in my face with her fist, white I had got Mahony in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 495). I was with Fuller when this <hi rend="italic">row</hi> took place in Spread Eagle-court—I saw Mahony take up a brick and throw it at Fuller—I went immediately and took him into custody, and he was rescued by the other two prisoners—I was struck by Berry in the eye twice and just in the cheek—Mrs. Boyle scratched my face—Berry attempted with several others to rescue Mahony from my custody, and I had a brick thrown at my head, which rendered me senseless—they rescued him—I do not know who threw the brick.</p>

I went and apprehended Mrs. Boyle on Monday last, about 12 o'clock in the day—I went to a house at Rotherhithe where I found her—I told her that she answered the description of a person who had assaulted the police at Spread Eagle-court on the previous night—she said, "I did not do anything, I was there all the time, but I know the party who did it"—I said, "You must go with me"—she said, "I can't go, I did not do anything;" and then she said, "I was not there till the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was all over"—she said, "I could not assault the police, because I had a child in my arms."</p>

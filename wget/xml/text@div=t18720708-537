I live at 6, North Street, Whitechapel, and am a coal<lb></lb>dealer—I shut my shop door on 20th June, between 11 and 12 o'clock—I was awoke by my wife about 2 o'clock in the morning, and heard someone going down stairs—I went down and saw the prisoner at the bottom of the stairs turning round to go through the shop—he went out of the street door, which was wide open—I pursued him and saw a constable take him—nothing was stolen—there was a square of glass over the door which had been cracked, that was completely broken out in the morning, and a hand put through could reach the bolt—as far as I can judge that is the way the door was opened—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man I followed—I</p>

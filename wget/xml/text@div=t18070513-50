            . Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes. On the 2nd of May she came into my house about nine o'clock in the morning; I went with a pint of beer to the top of the court where I live, I was not gone above five minutes, and as I was coming home my daughter informed me she had seen her go to the pawnbroker's; my little girl had watched her into the pawnbroker's. When I went in I missed a handkerchief I had bought for my little boy that is gone to Teneriffe. I <rs id="t18070513-50-viclabel305" type="occupation">keep a public house</rs>

               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into her house, I asked her for the money she had of mine; she said you will make away with that half guinea as you did last night; I told her I wanted to buy a gown; she gave me the handkerchief as part of payment out of the half guinea. I pawned the handkerchief for a shilling; I told her I had pawned it for a shilling; I told her if she would return me the remainder of the change, I would take it out of pawn.</p>

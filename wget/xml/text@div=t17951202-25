               <p>On Sunday the 11th of October, about three quarters past ten o'clock, I went to meet the prisoner, by appointment, at <placeName id="t17951202-25-crimeloc132">the Mitre, in Goswell-street</placeName>

               <p>Court. Q. How am I to know that this was not a fair transaction between the prisoner and the witness; it might be a fair exchange? I have nothing to do with French money, sitting here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gullen. A. I believe we can prove the value.</p>
               <p>Rogers. I did not know that they were French till I examined them afterwards, they were mixed with the others.</p>
               <p>Court. You have failed in proving your second count; it is now for you to make out your first: they are charged as being in the similitude of an English shilling, and that they were sold at a lower rate than they imported.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed afterwards? - A. I went away, and immediately communicated it to the Public-office; I went with the officers; Mr. Pullen was sitting in the same parlour where I purchased the money, and he was apprehended on the 16th of October; he was sitting with three or four other men at the table; there was an old stocking lying on the table; where he was leaning; it was opened, and found to contain a quantity of dross or folder, or something of that sort: Lillywhite went out for the officers, and when they came they apprehended him.</p>

            You have seen this man frequently at this house before? - A. I believe three times before; I went with a view to find out the business; when he was examined before Mr. Colquhoun he denied my having seen him before, but I had seen him at that house three times before, getting parcels out of the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you tell the magistrate that you had seen him sell bad money three times before? - A. I told him that I had seen him take money out, and deliver it three times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear now, that upon the prisoner's examination before the magistrate you said you had seen him selling bad money before? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. That was taken down in writing, was it not? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you saw him do this? - A. In the parlour; Mr. Ward, the landlord, was in the bar, I think, I am not quite sure; I saw the prisoner there the very night before; I went into the passage, and asked a young man if Mr. Pullen was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean young Mr. Ward? - A. He was standing in the passage, at the place where the serve the gin.</p>

               <p>I am a constable: On the 16th of October, I went with Rogers to a public-house, in Goswell-street, to apprehend the prisoner; we went four or five times before we could find him; we had something to drink; every time we found him there about seven or eight o'clock in the evening; Rogers gave me the signal that that was the man; I saw some lead, or something in a bag upon the table; I went out for the officers, and he was apprehended; I did not see any thing taken from him; there were several persons in the room.</p>

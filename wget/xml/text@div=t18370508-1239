                  </hi>. I was shopman to James Brown, of Shad well High-street. I hung this printed cotton outside the door, and missed it between three and four o'clock in the afternoon on the 12th of April—I went to Harris's, the pawnbroker, and saw the prisoner Moore there, and this cotton—I took her and sent for the policeman—I then went to No. 9, Union-street, and found Martin—the was in bed at Moore's house, and had a basket by the side of the bed, in which the officer found these other nine yards of printed cotton, which is ours—she said she bought it of me, but I had not sold it—it is the only piece I had of that pattern—it was all in one piece when we had it, and they had cut it.</p>

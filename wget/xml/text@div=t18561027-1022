The prisoner was employed there to clean boots—on 27th Sept, at about 7 o'clock in the evening, I went to the tap of the hotel, and asked for the porter—the prisoner asked me what I wanted the porter for—I told him I wanted change for four sovereigns, and he said he would get it for me—I gave him the four sovereigns—he said he would go to the baker's shop; and I told him if he could not get all the change, to bring back as much as he could—he went away, and did not come back again—I saw him next morning at the soup kitchen in Windmill-street—I asked him for the money—he said he had not got the money, he had lost it—he said, "Do with me what you like."</p>

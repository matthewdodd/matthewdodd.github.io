On the 1st October, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop, I was attending there; she asked to look at some gold seals - she stood at the counter, and had a white handkerchief in her hand. I shewed her a great number of seals in a tray, she examined many of them, and said they were too high a price - they were from a guinea and a half to three guineas; there was a great number at all prices - I believe the lowest she asked the price of was a guinea and a half. She said she was sorry for having given me so much trouble, and declined purchasing - she was going away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect her - A. From the manner in which she pulled the seals about I suspected she had one in her handkerchief, which was still in her hand. I went between her and the door, shut the door, opened her hand, and discovered three gold seals in her handkerchief, which were my husband's property. Before I opened her hand she asked me why I stopped her? I said, because she had got my property. I opened her hand, and found them; she then begged of me to let her go; I refused, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Your counter is made with a glass upon it, so as to leave but a small place to put goods on - A. It is. I rather think her handkerchief was on the counter, but I cannot say. I shewed her a good many seals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the seal hang from the handkerchief - A. I saw a small part of it out of the handkerchief.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was called upon to take the prisoner into custody at Mr. Davis's shop. Mrs. Davis said, in her hearing, that she had stolen three fine gold seals, and that she had taken them out of her handkerchief. I took her into custody, searched her, and found half a crown and 1 s. on her, in a chain purse. Mrs. Davis gave me the seals, which I produce.</p>
               <p>MRS. DAVIS re-examined. These are them; they are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270044"></xptr>worth five or six guineas. Nobody was in the shop but myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent. I do not know how the seals came into my handkerchief - I cannot account for it. I merely went in to ask the price, not intending to buy, as I had not sufficient money.</p>

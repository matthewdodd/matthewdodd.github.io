                  </hi>. I am part owner of the <hi rend="italic">Ealing Grove</hi>, which was lying in the West India Docks—Doe was my apprentice. On the 11th of Oct., there was a cask of rum in the after-hold—I came on board that morn<lb></lb>ing—the</p>

               <p>mate reported to me that the cask of rum had been spiled—I went below, and found the cask had been spiled, and in Rainey's berth I found four bottles of rum—he was a sailor in the ship—two bottles of rum had been previously found in Doe's chest—I then sent for an officer who took the prisoners—I have compared the bottles of rum with that in the cask, and I believe it is the same—neither of the prisoners had any business with any rum—I asked Rainey about it, but he denied it till he was in custody—they confessed it before the Magistrate—I saw Mr. Ballantine sign this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the depositions</hi>)—this is his signature—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—The prisoner Rainey says, "I had a sixpence in my pocket, and I said, 'Let us have a pot;' Doe said, 'We will have plenty to drink, let us have some <hi rend="italic">soft tack</hi>;' I handed Scorey the sixpence, and he brought on board some onions and bread; Doe then said, 'Let us have a drop:' I said, 'I don't mind;' Scorey said, 'You had better take rum, because it belongs to the ship;' Doe said. 'Rum is a very strong thing;' Scorey said, 'It will do very well when beating down channel;' Doe said, 'Take a bucket;' Scorey went up and brought a bucket down; he said, 'The two of you go, and I will go on deck to keep a look-out;' we heard a tap, and blew the light out; Scorey then struck a lucifer, and held it down to us; Doe pierced the vent, and he held the bucket while I drew the gimlet out; Scorey met us, and took it from us; we did it between us.'

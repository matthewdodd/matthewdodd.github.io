I heard a noise in the empty house, No. 52, Noel-street, on the night of the 14th Nov. about eight o'clock—I saw the front door of the house was open—I ran to it and saw the figure of a man go towards, the stairs—I heard some one in the back kitchen at the rear of the house—I went down stairs, took a match out of my pocket, got a light, and saw the prisoner get out of the window to the yard—I went out at the front door—I sent to the station for a bull's-eye—I at last took the prisoner out of a water-closet at No. 11, Montague-place—I had had such an observation of his person as to say he is the same man I saw in the kitchen—this copper was behind the front door of the house, I had heard a noise in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. James Levers, a boot and shoemaker, in Brompton-terrace. These boots and shoes are his property—they were safe in his shop about ten o'clock in the morning, on the 2nd of Sept.—I recollect seeing them there—about three in the afternoon my atten<lb></lb>tion was called by some person, and I missed four pairs of boots and one pair of shoes—these are one pair of the boots.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 3rd of Sept I was walking in front of Mr. Mullen's, I saw Robertson [Note. <hi rend="italic">Robertson has died since his apprehension</hi>] standing in front of Mr. Levers' window, and a young man who is not here—I saw Robertson take up a pile of boots and shoes—I told Parsons, and we went and overtook him at the corner of Sloane-street—one of them ran down Sloane-street—Robertson was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 169.) From information I went to No. 6, William-street, Lambeth-walk, on the 7th of Sept. and took the prisoner, and told her it was for unlawfully pledging boots at Mr. Dicker's shop—she denied it—I searched the house, and found a quantity of duplicates in a letter, purporting to come from Tothill-fields prison, in the name of Ro<lb></lb>bertson—I asked her who the letter was from—she said her brother.</p>

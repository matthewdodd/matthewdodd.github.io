               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever deal with him before? A. Never - it was at half-past eleven o'clock - my servant came back the last time about twenty minutes to twelve - the prisoner had no donkey with him.</p>

I am servant to the prosecutrix - I remember the prisoner being at the door - mistress<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040123"></xptr>sent me for change - I went to several places, but could not get change - I came to the door, and told the prisoner I could not get change - he said if I would give him the sovereign, he would go to the public-house and get change - he went in at one door and out at the other, and I never saw him afterwards - I had given him a sovereign to get change - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did not you go into the public-house? A. I did, and he was gone - there are two doors to the house - I was not frightened - I never dealt with him before - it was about a quarter before twelve, on Tuesday, the 2nd of September - mistress bought two rabbits, and he left some behind him - I did not count them - we gave them to the policeman.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS re-examined. When the prisoner was pointed out to me, he said, before I spoke to him, "I hope you do not think I am the man who stole the sovereign?"- we were talking about the thing at the time.</p>

            . On Tuesday, the 2nd of August, I was in Tottenham-court-road, and saw the prosecutor and prosecutrix talking to the prisoner, opposite a public-house - I heard the prosecutor saying, if a policeman came by he should give him into custody - he saw me, and gave the prisoner into my custody - he told me he was innocent; that all he had to sell that day were two bushels of onions, one bushel of which he sold to Mr. Shoolbred - I found 13s. 6d. on him - seven rabbits were brought to the station-house.</p>

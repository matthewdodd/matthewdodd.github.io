            . The prisoner came to my father on the 3rd of March - my mother was ill in bed, and I paid him two half-crowns, and two shillings - he wrote this receipt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). As respects the charge of embezzlement of Â£1. 2s. 10d., on the 8th of March last, that sum was received by me on that day, on my master's account, and was in my possession at the time I was taken by a policeman, and taken from me on the same day, the 8th of March, by him, which prevented my paying it over to my master - at the time I was taken, my master owed me 16s. for a week's wages, and my clothes, worth between two and three pounds, were in his possession - as to the other charges, many of the figures are written in pencil, as is usual in the trade, and from the lapse of time, I cannot speak to the particular facts, but throw myself on your merciful consideration.</p>

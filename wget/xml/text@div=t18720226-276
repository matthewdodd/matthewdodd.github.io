                  </hi>. I live at 21, Queen Square, Westminster, and am a tailor—on 2nd February, about 12.45 in the morning, I was going home, and as I passed Gardener's Lane I saw the two prisoners—the man came behind me and put his hands over my mouth—he then dragged the button off my coat, and dived for my watch—he put his knee on my spine and laid me in the road—the female prisoner said "Jim, have you got it?" and he said "No; I have not got at the b—yet"—my coat had been com<lb></lb>pletely buttoned up—when I got rid of his arms I called "Police" and "Murder," and when I got up I did not see anyone, so I ran on home, and met a policeman at my own door—the prisoner did not get my watch—he took my chain—they both ran away when I got up, and I lost sight of them completely—I was called up about 2 or 3 o'clock that morning, and went to the police station at Rochester Row, where I identified the prisoners—they had my hat as well as my chain—I was slightly in liquor, but I was quite sensible, and knew what I was about—the man had dark whiskers, a Paisley scarf, and a wide-awake—the woman did not do anything, but she was there.</p>

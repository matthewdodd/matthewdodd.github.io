                  </hi> I am assistant to William Isaac Miles, an ironmonger—on 11th October, the prisoner came and gave me this order; it is addressed to Mr. Miles, and signed, H. O'Brien—"Sir, be kind enough to send 1 saw, 1 short plane, 1 long do., 2 chisels and 1 hammer"—he said he had received the order from Mr. O'Brien three days since, and it ought to have been brought there before, and that Mr. O'Brien had left his house three or four days—I supplied him with the articles; some of them are here—I was about to pack them up, and he said he had better take a tool-basket to save my packing them, and he knew the man had no tool-basket—Mr. O'Brien had.</p>

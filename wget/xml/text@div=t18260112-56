I missed this property on Saturday week; she has been five years and a half with me; I called on her at Giltspur-street, prison, where she was confined, to knew if she wanted any of her clothes; I asked her what had become of six spoons - she said they should be returned to me; I asked if there was any thing more; she said there were two sheets, and all should be returned; I missed a pair of sheets upon examining; I found the property at Guildhall; these things were my own property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did she send<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120031"></xptr>any communication to you about the property before you went to her? A. Certainly not; I went to make inquiry of her as well as to offer her linen; I said nothing to induce her to say any thing. I have heard she was connected with a fortune-teller; my spoons and table cloths were returned, with some sheets, which were not mine, but were as good. I am single, and she acted as my housekeeper - she is a widow, and, I believe, has three children.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS MASSEY. I am in partnership with Mr. Wiltshire, but not in this property. I accompanied him to the Compter; he asked her about some spoons, and two table cloths, which she said should be returned. Mr. Teague cautioned him not to have them returned except through the officer.</p>

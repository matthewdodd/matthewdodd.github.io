                  </hi>. I live in Baker's-rent, Hackney-road. I have known the prisoner since last summer—I had a difference with him once, but it was made up the night following—on Tuesday night, the 21st of June, about half-past nine o'clock, I went to the Victoria public-house, in Hackney-road, in company with Richard Wheatley—the prisoner was there, in company with a young woman, named Rachel Adams, and two more, sitting on each side of him—I known Rachael Adama ever since I have known the prisoner—I never lived with her—I had no conversation with the prisoner—I did not drink with him—he left the room, and came down stairs before I did, and stood in the passage—I followed him in a few minutes—when I got down stairs I saw him pull out a large knife from his right-hand pocket—I dare say it was six inches long, handle and all, when it was open—he said he would stab the first one to the heart that came near him, and made use of a very had word—I immediately went up to him, and told him to shut up the knife, and not stab my cousin with it—James Spencer is my cousin—there had been a few words before I came into the parlour, but I had not heard them—he had said something which I had heard mentioned, and in consequence of that I said, "Don't stab my cousin"—he told me to get away, or he would serve me the same, and he immediately up with the knife to make an attempt to strike me—I parried the blow off with my left hand, or it must have struck me—I had made no attempt to strike him—he followed me twice on my head, and made it bleed—I was staggering towards the pavementhe followed me up and stabbed me in the chest, making use of a very bad word—I was as sober as I am now—he said he would stab me to the b—heart and he <hi rend="italic">jobbed</hi> the knife into my chest—I was immediately taken off to a doctor at the corner of Crabtree-row, and my wounds were dressed—the prisoner went into a tobacco-shop—I saw him go in—I did not give him any provo<lb></lb>cation before he struck me.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many persons were there at the beer-shop, beside yourself and the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A great number—there might have been twenty—it was half-past ten o'clock when I got there—I went with Wheatley—I had ben to bed, but got up to go to the neees<lb></lb>sary, and then went with him—I can't say whether Adams had been living with Spencer—I have seen her at his room—as the prisoner at<lb></lb>tempted to strike me, I parried the blow off with my left hand, and I must have struck him them at the side of his face—he then followed me up with the knife, and struck me twice—only two person at the beer-shop were friends of me and my cousin—I dare say I knew half a dozen in the room by speaking to them—I was not fetched to the house for any parti<lb></lb>cular reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you know there was any intention of stabbing your cousin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because there had been a few words beforehand, which I had been told of by my cousin, when I came to the public house—I was not fetched to make a party against the prisoner—I had no reason to know that I was to do so—the prisoner stood in the passage, opened his knife, came to the threshold of the door, and said he would stab the first person that came near him—he did not say he would stab my cousin—my cousin went near him, and wanted to get the knife out of his hand—I wanted to do so too—I did not lay hold of him and shake him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Don't you know from Spencer, that when he struck Adams in the prisoner's presence, he said he would serve her b—y man the same? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He never told me so—I did not strike the prisoner purposely, it was in warding off the blow—it was not a blow to irritate a man—I hit him in the face, against the jaw—he was standing with his back against the public-house—if nobody has gone near him they would have been safe—I and Spencer went to him, and one more, who went to try to get the knife away—the prisoner said, "There is no law for a knife, "and stabbed me—he knew away—that the parties who were with me knew me—Spencer did not appear elevated—I was sober—a drop of beer will take effect sometimes—it did not do so that night—none of the party appeared to be drunk when they came up-stairs—I left the house about a quarter to eleven o'clock—there was about twenty of us leaving together—the prisoner had two friends there—they were drinking with him, I can't say he knew them before—I only went there to take part of a beer; that is all—I had heard nothing about a dispute between the prisoner and Spencer—Wheatley did not bring a message from Spencer—he told me nothing on the road, I will swear.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a willow-cutter. I was at the public-house with the prosecutor—the prisoner was there in company with Rachael Adams—I had kept company with her before that and I had fallen out with her about a week—I did not strike her that night—I said I would strike her when I got down—but I do not think the prisoner heard that, because he was looking another way—about a quarter before eleven o'clock, the landlord desired the company to go, because one of then began to sing—the prisoner went down first and I followed—he was in the passage when I got down—I saw him put his hand into his pocket and pull out his knife—he came out into the passage and stood with his back against the window of the tobacconist's, and said he would stab the first man that came near him—I was standing close against him, and went and tried to lay hold of his hand, to get the knife away from him—he then said he would stab the first man that came near him—Monksfell came and laid hold of his collar and said, "You shan't stab my cousin"—the prisoner had not done any thing to him to provoke him at all—he said no<lb></lb>thing in particular to him—he had the knife in his hand, and Monksfell went to get it from him—he laid hold of his collar, not roughly—they both stood still when he caught hold of his collar—he then said, "I will stab you if you don't get away from me"—then Monksfell said, "Is there any law for a knife?"the prisoner made answer "No," and immediately made a stab with the knife, but the first stab did not go in any where—he made a job—I should think it would have gone at his head if it had touched him, but it did not—Monksfell them struck the prisoner directly—he had hold of his collar at the time—the prisoner then struck at his head twice, and then, as Monksfell was reeling away, he caught him by the side of the ribs with the knife—Monksfell called me, and said he was stab<lb></lb>bed, and I took him to the doctor's—the prisoner backed himself into the tobacconist's and he had the knife in his hand then—I went away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have said you don't think the prisoner heard what you said to Adams, was not he sitting close to her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but he turned his face the other way—I was about two yards from him</p>

               <p>when I said it—I will not swear that he did not hear it—the prisoner did not stab me at all—I got out the way—I went up to him and tried to get the knife from him—and he shifted it behind him, from one hand to the other, to prevent my getting it from him.</p>

             laughed, and said, good bye till I see you again; she repeated it again, opened the door, went out, opened the door a second time, put her head into the shop, laughed, and repeated the same words again; I thought it strange, and I had some suspicion of them, they had long red cloaks on; I examined the window of my shop, and missed six pair of silk and cotton stockings that were tied together; I then pursued them, and saw them in a pawnbroker's shop the corner of Bridge-street and Parliament-street; I accused them of having stolen some stockings, they both denied it; I laid hold of Sullivan's cloak, drew it on one side, and one pair of stockings dropped from her, I then observed her drop two pair more; Murphy no sooner saw me secure Sullivan than she made her escape; Sullivan went down upon her knees immediately, and begged I would shew her lenity; I kept her in custody, and took her to my house, and from thence to Queen-square Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found the other three pair? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be in company with each other? - A. Yes; they went out together.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these stockings? - A. They cost me four shillings and sixpence a pair.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time they were in the shop, did you observe any thing from which you could suspect they had taken any thing? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they near the window in which these stockings were? - A. Not while I was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you bring your wife here? - A. She is in a very forward state of pregnancy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in the shop at the time with you? - A. Yes, all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know these stockings to be your's? - A. Yes, by moving them in and out of the window for a long time; they are an article we fell very little of; I am confident they were in the window within an hour and a half of their coming.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HINDE sworn. - I live with Mr. Wassell, a pawnbroker, in Parliament-street: On Saturday the 15th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the two prisoners came to our shop together, but for what purpose I do not know, for there was a dispute between them, and they were turning out of the shop again; Mr. Appleby then came up, and accused them of robbing him; he pulled the prisoner Sullivan's cloak, and then I saw a pair of stockings in his hand, I did not see them drop from her; I then saw him pick up two more pair; Murphy then ran away, and Sullivan went upon her knees, and begged for mercy; I afterwards saw the other prisoner return to the shop-window; I went out and secured her, but found nothing upon her; she had a bundle the first time, but she had none the second.</p>
               <p>Sullivan's defence. I bought those stockings of a man in a public-house for twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Murphy's defence. I know nothing at all of it.</p>

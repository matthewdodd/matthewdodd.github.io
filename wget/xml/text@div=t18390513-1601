                  </hi>. I live at Perrivale. I am a farmer—on Saturday night the 20th of April I had some hay in the barn, and about seven o'clock next morning I missed five trusses, but three of them were left on another part of my premises, away from the barn—two of them were gone altogether—I tracked some hay from the barn, to the foot of the bridge, where it had been thrown down, and a quantity of it was left—it had then</p>

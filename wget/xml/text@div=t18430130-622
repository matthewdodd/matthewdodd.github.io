                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Webb, a cheesemonger, in the Edgeware-road. On Sunday, the 8th of January, I was in company with a person named Howard—I bad been to Dr. Vaughan's chapel at Kensington, and was returning from there about one o'clock—we entered Hyde-park by the Kensington gate—there is a public footpath there, leading by the barracks, which are on the left-hand side as you go into the park—I observed a sentinel there pacing backward and forward in front of the railings that separate the park from the barrack-yard—it was the prisoner—his sentry-box I think was inside—I saw none outside—I and Howard stopped there—we were attracted by the soldiers in the yard in their undress—they were sweep<lb></lb>ing—they had caps on which hung over the side—one of the men jumped on the stool (on which, I suppose, the soldiers sit) leaning on a spade, looking down, and the others were sweeping underneath him on some paved stones—when we stopped to look, the men in the barrack-yard called to the prisoner, "Send them on"—upon that one of them said, "Hit them with your car<lb></lb>bine"—I could not see who it was said that—the prisoner upon that said, "Go on," in a very imperative tone—Howard said, "I am not aware that we are doing any particular harm"—the prisoner said still more imperatively, "Go on, Sir"—I said, "I certainly shall not run away"—we had moved a few paces after he spoke the first time, and were proceeding slowly along—we were not within any part of the barracks—I was on the verge of the foot<lb></lb>path, which is about ten feet wide, the verge furthest from the barracks next the roadway—after I said, "I certainly shall not run away," the prisoner instantly knocked me down—I was in advance of him, going from him—I had my back to him—he came behind me, and struck me on the left side of the head, and I fell on my right side in the road—I was completely stunned by the blow—when I recovered myself I was bleeding dreadfully from the head, the blood was streaming in torrents—my hat was cut through both the outside and the lining—I bled very much indeed—the blood stained my outside coat, and second coat, my waistcoat, through my stock, shirt, and flannel shirt, to my skin—I was assisted to Mr. Morris's, and had my head dressed—I had not said or done any thing more to the prisoner than I have described, before he knocked me down.</p>

               <p>there was not sufficient room for it to stand—he was pacing backward and forward in front of the barrack gate, outside the gate—it was not at the barrack gate that I stopped, but beyond, nearer the Kensington-gardens gate—I was able to see obliquely into the barrack-yard—I was not immediately on the beat of the sentinel—I was a short way from the sentry-box, on the footway, and the sentry-box was inside—I was more than a yard from the sentry-box—I do not know the distance—we crossed the footpath to go in at Kensington-gardens gate, and stopped on the footpath to look at the sol<lb></lb>diers—I have told all that took place on this occasion—I made use of no expression besides what I have described—I said I certainly should not run away—I had said nothing befoie that—no remark passed from me or Howard to the soldiers—I did not say, "Let us stop here, and see these scavengers violating the sabbath, instead of being at church;" nor, "They have not been long up, they have got their nightcaps on"—I distinctly swear I did not—I will swear I did not use the term "cap" at all, nor did Howard—we did not continue using expressions of that kind for some time—the prisoner did not repeatedly request us to go on—he said twice, "Go on"—those were the only words that passed from the sentry to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not go on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I considered I was on a public footway, and we had not been on there more than a minute and a half—I had no particular reason for not going on—indeed, we were moving on slowly—I did not say, "Who do you desire to go on, you b----soldier? you may go on and be d----"—that is different from the expression which the prisoner imputed to me in the officer's room—it was, "I shan't go on, you b----soldier, go to h----"—I swear solemnly that I never used such words—I was not using any language of that kind when the prisoner struck me with the carbine—Mr. Smith was behind me—I had never seen him previously—when I was knocked down he came up, shook me by the hand, and said, "I saw the villain knock you down, and I shall be happy to help you bring him to justice," or some such remark—but I have an indistinct recollection of the words—I believe he gave me his name.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 8th of Jan., I had been with him to chapel, and about one o'clock, we were in the footpath leading to Hyde-park, by Kensington-barracks—as we went by, we observed the soldiers in the barrack-yard—the prisoner was the sentry on duty outside—he had a carbine—I and Fitch stopped to see the soldiers in the barrack-yard, as they had just come out of their stables with their brooms up—the footpath is very wide there—we were standing on the side nearest the carriage-road, the farthest from the barracks—as we were standing looking at the soldiers, the soldiers hallooed out to the sentry, "Send them on!"—another immediately told him to knock us down with his carbine—with that the prisoner came up and ordered us to go on—I said, "I am not aware that we are doing any harm"—he again ordered us to go on in a more imperative tone—Fitch replied, that he cer<lb></lb>tainly should not run away, in a very temperate tone—we moved on—I was moving on when the blow was struck—I was a little in advance of Fitch—I</p>

               <p>did not see the blow struck, but on turning round, I saw Fitch down in the carriage-road—his head was bleeding, his clothes stained with blood, and his hat cut—the soldiers did not offer to assist him in any way—I assisted Fitch, after he recovered himself, to the doctor's to have his head dressed—neither I nor Fitch did or said anything to the soldiers besides what I have stated, before the blow was struck—I never used any such expression as, "You b----soldier, go to h----," or anything of the sort, nor did Fitch, in my hearing.</p>

On Sunday, the 8th of Jan., about one o'clock in the day, I was in Hyde<lb></lb>park, near the barracks—I was about three yards behind Fitch—I was pass<lb></lb>ing along the public footpath, going the same way as Fitch and Howard—I could see all that took place between them and the prisoner—they stopped together—I stopped about three yards behind them, looking at the soldiers in the yard sweeping—when they stopped, I heard the prisoner say to them, "Go on"—they did go on, directly, about half-a-yard, not much, I should suppose—the men in the yard sung out, "If he don't go on, knock him down with your carbine!"—the prisoner immediately said, "Go on"—they did not go on, and he knocked Fitch down with his carbine—he laid hold of his carbine with both hands, and struck him over the side of the head—Fitch laid down—he seemed stunned, to me—I walked up, as quickly as I could, to lay hold of him—I said, "You are cut"—the blood streamed down his face—the prisoner turned coolly round and put his carbine to rights again—the blow started the ramrod—I was not close enough to see whether the blow started it, but I saw him put it down after—neither Fitch nor Howard used any violent or provoking language to the prisoner, previous to his striking the blow, nothing more than I did myself, turned round and smiled—no violence was committed by them to the soldier, or any abusive language used—they did not say, "You b----soldier, I shall not go on; go to h----!"—I was within three yards of them, and should have heard if they had.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a soldier in the 8th Guards. I was on duty in the barrack yard on the 8th—the prisoner was on duty, and the two witnesses were standing on his post—I did not hear any of them making any remark—they seemed pointing to the men in the yard, and appeared to be speaking—I was not near enough to hear what they said—I heard the sentinel tell them to go on twice—I saw the blow struck by the sentinel—I hare known the prisoner two years—he was a well-conducted, orderly man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corporal, in the 8th Hussars. The prisoner was in my regiment—he was the quietest man in the regiment—I did not see the blow struck—I heard the sound of it—I was twenty-five yards off—the ramrod of a carbine is tolerably loose—what I heard was the barrel come against the man's hat—the prisoner was on his proper line of duty—the orders are to keep the beat clear.</p>

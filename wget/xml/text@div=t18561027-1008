               <p>the mob rushed on him, and struck him with their clenched fists—there were from fifteen to twenty surrounding him; all against him, and hooting and howling shamefully—had it been dark, instead of daylight, I firmly believe they would have killed him—he was retreating from them all the way.</p>

               <p>husband and the prisoner and the prisoner's wife—we were going up Pelham-street—the prisoner could not get to his own home, for the prosecutor's father took and crossed the road and waved a handkerchief in my brother in law's face, and with a very bad expression he asked him if he could fight—my brother in law said, "You can strike me if you like, I shall not return it"—with that the mob rushed round—he got a little way past the mob when one of Mr. Baker's colleagues turned and called me and the prisoner's wife very bad names—my husband said, "You can't mean them, you mean your own acquaintances"—a man then knocked my husband down, and he got up and fought—the prisoner then came to take his brother away, and they could not get away—they were retreating, and the prisoner took out his putty layer and said, "The first man that approaches me I will give it him"—he was retreating back out of the mob, and I firmly believe he would have got from the mob had not the young man rushed on him at the time the mob were in front, and they were both knocked down and very ill used—my brother always carries this knife in his pocket, he is never without it, he uses it in his trade.</p>

                  </hi>. On 7th Aug., between 5 and 6 o'clock I was passing down Pelham-street. I saw the defendant and his brother and their two wives passing down the street—there was a mob, which attracted my attention—the first I heard was the elder Baker calling to the prisoner's brother to fight, and he put his handkerchief in the prisoner's face and called their two wives two b——w——the prisoner's brother was knocked down and was being trampled on, and the prisoner drew his putty knife from his pocket, and said, "The first that comes to me I will use this"—the prosecutor then ran and jumped on his back, and he turned round and crushed him against the wall, and I believe they both went down, and had not a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> come up I believe the man would have been killed.</p>

Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I keep a general shop—I have only had it these three weeks—my father is beadle of Goldsmiths' Hall—I was passing from Whitechapel—I have not been taking a very active part in this—I have not got the case up—the prisoner went with his back to the wall, he backed the man against the wall—he did not stab him at all—he struck him with the knife backwards, I should say once or twice—I did not see that the prosecutor was carried to a surgeon—I saw the knife taken out of the prisoner's pocket—I was close by him—there was a mob and his brother was on the ground being kicked—the prisoner was at the end of the mob—they were pressing on his face—I was by the side of him—he did not go to his house at all—he did not go to the door; I am quite sure of that—he attempted to get to his door, but could not.</p>

On 7th Aug., the prisoner came to the Court in answer to a summons he had taken out against Baker—I was not in Pelham-street, but I saw their conduct after they got outside the Court—there was a great uproar, and some time after Stokes got out, he came back and said he was afraid to go home for fear they should do him some violence.</p>

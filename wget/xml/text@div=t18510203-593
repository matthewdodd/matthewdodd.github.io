                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. John Tucker, silk printer, of the Abbey Mills, West Ham. In Oct., in consequence of information, I missed some silk handkerchiefs—this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Tucker's—it is not in a state in which it is allowed to go out of the pre<lb></lb>mises—we never sell handkerchiefs in this state—the prisoner was em<lb></lb>ployed on the premises to the time of his being taken up—in June last his work would take him to the drying-room where the handkerchiefs were kept when in this state—he had no business to take any of them—after being dried they are glazed—this has not been glazed.</p>

I am pay-sergeant in the Third Battalion of the Grenadier Guards—the prisoner is a private in the same battalion—on 22d November, about a quarter-past 3 in the afternoon, I left my room in St. George's barracks—I locked the door, and left everything perfectly safe—I had a box in the room, which was locked, and in that box was my cash-box, which was also locked, and which contained 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money, or thereabouts—there was one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 79,603, date 30th September, 1865, one sovereign, and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, or thereabouts, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I re<lb></lb>turned to my room about ten minutes past 5 the same afternoon—I found my door had been opened, my box broken open, the cash-box taken out and also broken open—the centre compartment of the cash-box, which contained the money, was taken away—I at once reported the loss to the sergeant-major and the adjutant—we then searched about the barracks, and in so doing we found a key placed between some packing-cases in the pas<lb></lb>sage below my room—that key opened my door easily—it had been taken from the door of the room below mine—I applied to the sergeant who occupied that room to see if his key would unlock my door, and when he went to find it, the key was missing—on further search about the barracks, the centre compartment of my cash-box was found, also placed among some packing-cases—the prisoner lived and slept in a barrack-room, close to my room door—this is the note I lost (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

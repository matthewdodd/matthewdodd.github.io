Information was given to me, and I went to the blacksmith's shop where the asses were, on the 28th of June- I took them, and told the blacksmith he should not shoe them; the two witnesses saw them, and swore to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to a fair to sell combs, and such things - I met a man and his wife with these two donkeys and another; they said they wanted to sell them - one was 12s. and the other 5s.; we walked some distance, and I said I would give 10s. for one, and 5s. for the other - I then brought them to Hounslow to see if I could make a few shillings of them; I left them to be shod, and while they were there the constable went and took them - I sent a boy for them, and the man said he would put him in gaol; I went to him and said, "Who is the man who is going to take them?" and they took me before the Magistrate.</p>

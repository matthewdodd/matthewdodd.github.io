                  </hi>. I live in Ironmonger-row, St. Luke's. About twelve o'clock at night, on the 4th of September, I was in the Waterloo coffee-shop, having a cup of coffee—Church was there—Williams came in soon after—I sat down and fell asleep—I had two shillings, three sixpences, and a silk hand<lb></lb>kerchief in my pocket, and a handkerchief round my neck—in about two hours I awoke and found my pockets turned inside out, both my handkerchiefs and my money gone—these are my handkerchiefs.</p>

I was sent for to the coffee-house, and saw the prisoners—the prosecutor said he was robbed, and Williams was given in charge—as I was taking him he said he did not wish to go with<lb></lb>out Church—I went back and asked Church if he had any thing about him—he said he had not—I was told that Church had been sitting by the prosecutor—I I went to search, and these two handkerchiefs were fastened with a pin under the seat where Church had been sitting—I then asked Church if he had any money, he said no, that he was assistant waiter inthe house—I found one shilling in his fob, and the other shilling and two sixpences in his stockings—the prosecutor said one of the sixpences was a Queen Victoria, and this is one.</p>

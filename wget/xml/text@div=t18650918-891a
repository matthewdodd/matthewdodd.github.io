                  </hi>. I live at 14, Fitzroy-street, Fitzroy-square—in December, 1864, a little after Christmas day, Kelly came to my house and took a room—he signed this paper—I think there was a name put up, but I cannot remember what it was.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was an agreement between William Whack, of 14, Fitzroy-street and Messrs Collier, Kelly, and Son, to let an office. Signed Collier, Kelly, and Son, Witness, F. Whack</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Kelly come much to the office? Yes; he came there very often—there was no person occupying my room of the name of Hamilton from Christmas to April—Kelly was there shortly before I was summoned to appear—a short time before Kelly came a person named Hamilton rented my rooms—he was not there when Mr. Kelly came—he might have left a month—he owed something when he left.</p>

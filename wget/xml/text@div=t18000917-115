               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not confess before the Magistrate, that you had robbed your master, and then laid it upon Ellis? - A. I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>Q. It were you that took these ear-rings out of the shop? - A. Yes; but I had them from Ellis.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you not called upon to account for how you came to take your master's property to your father's house? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, whether you did not confess, before the Magistrate, that you had taken various articles out of your master's shop? - A. I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was this before Ellis was taken up? - A. About a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. You were quite shocked at hearing this wicked boy, Ellis, talk of felling his master's property, and Fogharty offering to buy it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think it an honest or a dishonest thing? - A. A dishonest thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have been shocked at doing such a thing yourself? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever tell your master of it till Fogharty and Ellis were taken up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You expected then, that you and Fogharty should get clear if you swore against Ellis, did not you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you keep this secret? - A.About a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you confess, before the Magistrate, that you had taken some of your master's property? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q.Many hundreds, perhaps? - A. Yes.</p>

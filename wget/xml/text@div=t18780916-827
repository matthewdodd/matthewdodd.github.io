                  </hi>. I carry on business as a hop merchant at Three Crowns Square, Southwark—on 11th January I called on the prisoners at their brewery—I saw Henry Cutler, and offered him some hops for sale, which he bought of course as a brewer for the purpose of using them—the prisoners carried on business in partnership as brewers and beer retailers at Barnes—the terms were three months' credit—on 17th January they gave me this bill of exchange for 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I gave them a sale note—the hops were sent to them before I received the bill; I think between the 11th and 17th—I presented the bill myself when due, and it was signed "No effects"—I have not received one farthing from them in respect of this transaction—the whole of the hops came back into my hands from Mr. Bull some time afterwards—after that a prosecution was instituted against me for fraudulently marking these hops, and I was fined and paid 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I have been carrying on business on my own account without any partner—it might have been some time in January when an old man in my sight put on the false name of Day of Morden on the pockets of hops—I do not know that that has any<lb></lb> thing to with this matter—I do not know that a number of gentleman con<lb></lb> nected with the hop trade were making inquiries before I parted with the hops—I did not want to have the hops back—they were bought in the trade, and</p>

               <p>delivered at the warehouse in King's Head Yard—they were not sweepings, they were trimmings—they were not packed there—I bought them packed—they were in pockets—the old man did not put on the false name with a stencil plate there—it is a thing that is often done—there is nothing par<lb></lb> ticular in it—it was done at White Hart Yard, where I moved them to, and from there they went to the prisoners'—I did not know that I was going to be prosecuted—I saw Mr. Day or his son—it was not through the kindness of the Magistrate that I was not committed here for trial—there were several adjournments, and you appeared to prosecute me—Mr. Bridge did not cancel the order for the giving up of the hops—he never gave an order—I got back the hops with the forged marks on them—I did not say that they were put on at the prisoners' request—I might have said it was a thing that was often done in the trade—I did not know that the hops were under Mr. Bull's control till he came and asked me the value, or rather my son, for I was not present—they were delivered at my place—they went to the Hop and Malt Exchange—the manager of that concern had them there—I did not send them to a respectable firm of which my brother-in-law is a member—I did not ask him to send them—I did not send them to White and Morgan's—Mr. Bull did, I believe—I did not get them back again from them; it was Mr. Bull who got them back—they did not come back from him; they remained at the Hop and Malt Exchange—White and Morgan did not sell them for Bull—I had them back from Bull—I had no control over them when he had them, nor at White Hart Yard—it was not by arrangement that they were to be got back in order to defeat my prosecution—I cannot tell you exactly how soon it was after I had been fined that I made this complaint; it was shortly afterwards—I am accustomed to sell hops to brewers—I never had a previous transaction with the prisoners—the contract was made by Lawless, my traveller, with Alfred Cutler, the brother of the prisoners—he would not make a sale without my consent—he told me that the Cutlers were willing to buy some if I would go down and see them—when I went I saw Henry Cutler, and, I think, his brother Alfred—there was a little conversation with Henry; I do not remember what it was—I had never seen him before—I paid all my own expenses when before the Magistrate—Mr. Bull had nothing to do with it, only as a witness—Mr. Bridge did not say that this was not a genuine prosecution, but brought by me to extort money—I am prosecuting this case myself, and pay my own expenses—I have talked to Mr. Bull several times, I don't know about these proceedings, he is my witness.</p>

I only knew Mr. Bull in this transac<lb></lb>tion—I made his acquaintance shortly after I had sold the hops, I dare say the beginning of February—he came to ask me the value of the hops—I should think proceedings were instituted against me some where in the beginning of May—the liquidation petition of the prisoners was filed in February—I wrote to the prisoners on the 15th of May, "We must stick together like cement"—I cannot recollect now what I meant by that—it had nothing to do with this matter—I really can<lb></lb>not tell you now what I meant by it—the acceptance had been dishonoured at that time—I did not offer to surrender the acceptance if either of them would go to the police-court and swear that they had asked me to put the marks on the hops for the purpose of deceiving their men—I did state in my deposition "I might have asked William Cutler to state before the Magis<lb></lb>trate that he had induced me to mark them so in order to deceive their own</p>

               <p>men"—it is often done in the trade—I swear most undoubtedly that I did not offer to give up the acceptance if they would swear that—I never offered to give it up—I wrote this letter of the 18th to the prisoners: "Can you or Mr. Granville help me? Ask him at once. Get what you can from him. Let me hear from you on Monday with the remittance. Do not fail. "Mr. Granville was the guarantee for the payment of this—I suppose he was a friend of theirs—I do not think he would pay a shilling—I have his guarantee in my pocket—I purchased these hops a week or two before I sold them—they cost me between 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a lamp manufacturer, of 447, West Strand—on 22nd January last William Cutler came to me—he had arranged with me a day or two previously to pass over some hops to me which I could realise on, sufficient to pay 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., money that he had taken of mine just previously, out of a bill he had got discounted for me—I was to pay out an execu<lb></lb>tion in addition—the execution, with expenses, amounted to about 111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was an execution upon his own property—he afterwards came to me—he said he could not let me have the hops unless I paid another execution out for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was an execution at the suit of a Mr. Parsons on a bill drawn by Granville on Cutler—I paid that, and also the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and got the Sheriff's receipt—I then received the hops—there was no bargain as to the price of the hops—he represented that he had a great quantity of hope so well bought that he was thinking of turning hop merchant, and he had either got his cards printed or was about to do so—I, knowing nothing of the value of hops, said "You must send me sufficient for the purpose"—he said "You need not trouble yourself about that, I will take care of that," and the hops came to me under those circumstances—I was to realise upon them, and recoup myself—I got possession of them on the 23rd, and received this invoice the same day (<hi rend="italic">They were invoiced at</hi> 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)—nothing had been said previously about the price—I went direct to Mr. Morgan as a stranger to offer them—a friend accidentally introduced me to him.</p>

I do not myself discount paper; I gene<lb></lb>rally get it done; I am not in the habit of discounting; if I want to get a bill of my own discounted I get it—I do not as a rule raise money for other persons on bills—Sir William Russell took my bills; I did not get any of his discounted—I should not think my transactions with Mr. Cutler during 12 months amounted to 7, 916<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I will not swear it—I have not had his cheques in blank to fill up for what I liked—I can't swear I never had such a thing; if I did I never made use of one; it was left with me by accident or posted to me for some purpose—I had cheques of his on his bankers, and he had cheques of mine on my bankers, and I used to use it for his convenience and possibly for mine—I don't think I placed a sample of these hops in the hands of Baker, White, and Morgan; I will not swear I did not—Mr. Morgan, the prosecutor's brother, told me that these hops were false, and not Day's of Morden, but that was not the result of any sample; they obtained the information and let me know it; that was a month after I had got them; I immediately went to, Mr. Morgan and told him what they said—I don't recollect the date—this letter to Mr. Morgan is my writing, and is dated 15th February (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—possibly I sent a copy of that to Cutler—I attended on every occasion when Mr. Morgan was before the Magistrate—the hops were ordered to be given back to me, and I sold them on a three months' acceptance for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got poseession of them immediately on the close of the police proceedings—I don't know whether in all my transactions the cheques were those of William Cutler; Cutler Brothers very likely—I never had any pecuniary transaction with Henry.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no case to go to the Jury. The charge was not for obtaining the hops from Morgan, but for disposing of them otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade. Where goods were sold at a great sacrifice there might be something to answer, but here the goods were sold at a profit. Further, the property which the section of the Act intended to cover must be "the property of the bankrupt divisible amongst his creditors." In this case no property passed at all. The forgery of the trade mark by Morgan prevented any property vesting in the Cutlers, and they did wrong in treating Morgan as a creditor</hi>.</p>

It must be a very common thing for brewers to dispose of some of the hope which they purchase and do not use for brewing.

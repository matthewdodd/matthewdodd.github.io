            . I live in Buckle Street, White-chapel. I left the prisoner a lodging; he paid me well two years; his family was large, and in the winter time he pawn'd a blanket and sheet; I told him if he'd put them in their place again he might go about his business, but he did not, so I took him up. He told me where he had pawned them, and I went and fetched them accordingly.</p>
               <p>A Pawnbroker. I len't the prisoner 2 s. upon the blanket, and have since delivered it to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>A. Pawnbroker. The prisoner pledged a sheet to my wife for 15 d. I have since deliver'd it to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My wife died and left me five children, my poverty was great, and it was a very hard winter. I went to borrow a shailing of the prosecutor's wife, and she gave me liberty to pawn these things.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk to Collet and Cox, Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, I met him on the 6th of October in Milk-street, Cheapside; he was selling peaches, I purchased three of him, I gave him six-pence for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tender him for payment of these? - A. A shilling; he said that he could not give me a sixpence; I saw he had plenty of silver in his hand; I asked if he could give change for a seven shilling piece by giving half a crown with it; he said he could give change<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040088"></xptr>for the two seven shilling pieces which I had in my hand, by giving me half a guinea and three shillings; I looked at the silver, I did not particularly look at the half guinea, the silver I thought looked very well, I put it all in my pocket; when I got to the top of <placeName id="t18051204-72-crimeloc442">Milk-street, Cheapside</placeName>

               <p>Q. In consequence of that was you determined to find out the prisoner? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you for that purpose mark a seven shilling piece? - A. The seven shilling piece was not marked any more than it was crooked; Mr. Hemmit informed me on Friday that he was in Wood-street, with peaches; I went to him again and agreed for six-pennyworth more of peaches, and offered him the crooked seven shilling piece that I had of Hemmit; he took the seven shilling piece in his hand, and with the other hand he took out the silver from his pocket, and made an excuse that he could not give change; at the same time he conveyed my seven shilling piece I do not know where, and dropped a bad seven shilling piece out of his mouth into his hand; I observed what he was going to do; I believe I then gave him a shilling, and he gave me a six-pence; I told him I could do without changing the seven shilling piece; I demanded my seven shilling piece back again, he gave me a bad one, it was a flat one, quite new; I am sure that the one I gave him was a crooked one, and an old one; I told him that was not the seven shilling piece that I gave him, he said it was; I told him I had now detected him, and he should go before a magistrate; he then told me, for God's sake not to say a word, he would give me my seven shilling piece again; I told him he had cheated me before; he said he would give me the whole of it; he would give me the seven shilling piece and the whole of the money I had taken of him the first time, if I would not say a word about it; at the same time he had the seven shilling piece in his hand which I gave him, ready to give me (the crooked one); I beckoned to my friend Hemmit, who was on the other side of the way, he came and laid hold of the hand in which my good seven shilling piece was, and enclosed it; I laid hold of the other hand, we walked with him towards Guildhall; in Cateaton-street we met two constables, Phillips and Pope, we delivered him up to them.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the seven shilling piece which was in his hand? - A. When we delivered him up one of the officers took it out of his hand; then they conducted him to the Castle-tavern, till the alderman came, they searched him there; I saw what was found upon him; I have got the bad seven shilling piece, I have kept it ever since; I produce it, and here is the half guinea and the three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. The half guinea and the three shillings is the first transaction in Milk-street; who gave them to you? - A. The prisoner on the 6th of October:</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no particular mark on the seven shilling piece, only it was crooked; you have seen a thousand others crooked? - A. To be sure I have seen others.</p>
               <p>Q. You received a seven shilling piece of him that day; what was the number of seven shilling pieces that he had in his hand? - A. I did not see any other, he had this seven shilling piece in his hand, which he dropped out of his mouth, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Oh! you believe; are you sure? - A. It was done very quickly.</p>
               <p>Q. You produce half a guinea here to day, how many hands has that half guinea been in? - A. It was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never part with it when there were thirteen or fourteen more persons in company? - A. I shewed it to people, it was never out of my sight; it was never shewn to more people than when we took him to the Castle tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. Might there not be five or six more people when it was shewed about? - A. There might be?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Are you sure that it is the same half guinea that you received from him? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>- HEMMIT sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live with Mr. Thomas in Wood-street, he is a furrier.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a friend of Mr. Boune's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He communicated something that occurred in October, and described the person of the prisoner to you? - A. He did, on the 11th of October I saw the prisoner in Wood-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know the prisoner by his description? - A. I had dealt often with the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your seeing him, you communicated it to Boune? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave Boune a seven shilling piece to offer? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Boune went up to the prisoner, and after a little time did he call you to him? - A. He did. When I came up to him he was tendering money to Boune, and telling him to take money, for whatever he liked. I immediately took hold of his hand and proceeded towards.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040089"></xptr>Cateaton-street, from whence the officer took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that seven shilling piece, and tell me whether that is the seven shilling piece that, you tendered to Mr. Boune that day? - A. No, that is not, it is quite strait.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the officer search him? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say it was a crooked one that you gave to Boune? - A. It was a crooked one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you hear what the prisoner said as relative to the money that he had given to Boune on the sixth, and on the eleventh of October? - A. He said that he did not remember that he had given him any, but if there was any bad he would change it.</p>

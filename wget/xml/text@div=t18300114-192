             WESTCOTT. On the 10th of December, I took the prisoner, and found in his pockets six duplicates, three of which are for these articles; I charged him with taking the tools; he said "I do not deny it."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You never asked whether I had pawned the planes? A. Yes I did, and you said I do not deny it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had been left in the house with his master's son, who was a notorious pick-pocket, and had been twice in prison, and he had persuaded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140090"></xptr>him to pawn the tools to raise money he had received on his master's account, and which the son had taken from him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GLIBBERY re-examined. Q. Is there any truth in this? A. There may be in some parts, but the principal part I can stoutly deny; he behaved well for about six months, but he is a most notorious liar, my son-in-law has been wild, but I can declare the prisoner has been 100l. out of my way; I have heard that my son has been charged at Clerkenwell, but not till lately - I should think that has nothing to do with this case; I can swear to these planes and this tool.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PAUL. I know these tools to be the prosecutor's property; I missed them about the time the prisoner was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HENRY WESTCOTT. The prisoner said he certainly had taken them, and said to one of the sons as we were going to Bow-street, "You have done for yourself now."</p>

                  </hi> I am single, and live in St. Ann-street, Westmin<lb></lb>ster—on the evening of 7th November, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I went to the White Horse public-house in Orchard-street—the prisoner was there quarrelling with another woman—I advised her not to quarrel, and she came round and used very abusive language to me, and when I came out, she continued to call me bad names—I walked after her to know what cause she had for calling me such names—she went into her own house, and threw a jug at me—the jug did not strike me—she then brought out a poker, and struck me on the forehead—I fell to the ground, but in two or three minutes I got up and walked away, and went back to the White Horse—I then came out, and was going with another woman up Orchard-street, and the prisoner met me with a knife, and struck me in the left arm with it—I bled much, and was taken to the hospital—I was a week lying in bed.</p>

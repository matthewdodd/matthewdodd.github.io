                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 139.) On Tuesday, the 29th of March, I was in Greenwich fair, in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner there—he was pointed out to me by a respectable tradesman, of Deptford—I watched him, and saw him put his hand into a man's pocket, and take out this handkerchief—I took it out of his hand and laid bold of his collar—he then escaped—I pursued him down the fair—I took him again about seven o'clock the next evening—I do not know the person from whom the hand<lb></lb>kerchief was taken—I gave him a push, he turned round and looked back, but I had no opportunity of speaking to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker at Deptford—I was at Greenwich fair on Tuesday night, and saw the prisoner—he looked very uneasy—I was looking at Richardson's show—I turned round and looked at him—he was very busy trying several gentlemen's pockets—he attempted several gen<lb></lb>tlemen first who were together, and then two or three single gentlemen—I went down the fair, and in about ten minutes-met the policeman, and gave him information—we came back together into the fair, and in about half an hour fell in with the prisoner—I pointed him out to the policeman—there was a gentleman standing looking at a show—as soon as the gen<lb></lb>tleman stopped, the prisoner went behind him and began to feel his pockets—I walked to the side of the gentleman—the policeman was behind us—presently some one gave the gentleman a push—I turned round and saw the policeman close to the prisoner—he was too quick for the policeman and got away from him—we pursued him down the fair—he was not taken that evening—the next evening the policeman called for me to go up and recognize him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He said at the office that he saw me from a quarter past seven o'clock till a quarter past ten, picking gentlemen's pockets; why did he not take roe then? I can swear I was not there. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I said, "Making the attempt"—if I had seen him pull the handkerchiefs out I should have charged him.</p>

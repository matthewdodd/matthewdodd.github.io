            . I am an officer. I assisted in taking the prisoner with the shoes; there was no man near him at the time, but I saw a man soon afterwards - the prisoner was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a man by the side of me. Witness. No, there was not.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he was intoxicated and had quarrelled with a woman, that on going down the lane, a man, who was assisting him home, gave him the shoes to hold while he took some tobacco from his pocket, and he was apprehended by Crabb, who had followed him, to prevent his illusing the woman.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CRABB re-examined. Q. Did you go there in consequence of his ill-treatment of a woman? A. Yes, a respectable gentleman called me as he had ill-used a woman - the people had got her away; he said she was his wife, and he threatened to murder her - he was not drunk, but had been drinking; I had seen him go up the lane before, and he had no shoes then but those on his feet.</p>

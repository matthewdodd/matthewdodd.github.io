                  </hi>. I live at 74, Lincoln Street, Mile End—about 8 o'clock on the evening of 21st March, I was walking in the Mile End Road—I saw the prisoner leaning on a post at the corner of South Grove—when I came up to the post, he advanced and looked me full in the face—he then made a snatch at my watch and chain—I had a small parcel in my right hand, which kept my watch from coming out; but the chain and seals, worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., were taken—he ran down the grove—I am positive he is the man—I had seen him about the neighbourhood before—I went down to the Bow Station and identified him—I saw him three times after I was robbed, but I could not see a constable to give him in charge—he had no whiskers when I saw him—he wore a dark coat, like the one he has on now.</p>

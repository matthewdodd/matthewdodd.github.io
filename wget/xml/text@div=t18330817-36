            (police-constable G 196). On the 20th of June, I went out in consequence of some information from Kelly - I saw Thomas in Coleman-street, very drunk - Kelly went after a woman who had just left Thomas; but he came back to assist me to take Thomas to the station-house - we there searched her and found on her 9l. 10s. in gold, 1l. in silver, and one penny and a farthing in copper - when Kelly was gone after the other woman, Thomas bit me, and I was obliged to call Kelly back - some money had fallen from Thomas before I came up - in going along she said, "It was not me that robbed the captain, it was Deaf Poll" - we had not then mentioned any name to her; we did not know what it was - sergeant Beresford and I then went to No. 4, Ball-court, and found the prosecutor there - I did not know who Thomas meant by Deaf Poll.</p>

             (police-sergeant G 8). On that afternoon Thomas and two other women were brought into Bunhill-row station-house - I searched Thomas, and found on her four sovereigns and some silver - I then picked up another sovereign - I asked her if she had any more money; she denied it - I searched her further, and pulled out the corner of her handkerchief from her bosom - I found in it four sovereigns and a half - I then found some more money on her, making in all nine sovereigns and a half, 1l. in silver, and one penny and a farthing in copper - she said, "Deaf Poll took it from the captain and gave it to me," - I received information and went to No. 4, Ball-yard, where I found the prosecutor sitting - he went to the station-house and saw Thomas - he said, "That is the woman I saw in the house," and I took her before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not Thomas very drunk? A. Certainly she was; when Smith was brought into the station-house, she said that she went up stairs to lay down with the captain, and when she awoke he was gone - that she came down and found him deploring his loss; and she had lost 2s. of her own.</p>

             re-examined. Q. You left Smith without awaking her; did she come down to you in the room below? A. I never saw her till they brought her to the station-house - I went into a room below, but no one came till the officer came and said they had got my money; I had left Smith on the bed; she appeared to me to be really asleep - the door of that room was not open, it was shut; but I don't know that it was fastened particularly - I will not say - there might be a bolt or something on it - I did not unlock it to get out; I opened it by the latch - the room might open on the stair case - I will not say - I am sober now - I did not give either of the prisoners any of my money to hold; I saw Thomas down below when I went up stairs, and I did not see her afterwards - I did not see her in any room but the room below; that was before I lost my money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not go with these women to a number of public houses? A. I only recollect being at the Leopard - I was a little bit tipsy; I might send out one of the prisoners with money for gin; I did give them some - I don't recollect who I sent, but I think it was Smith; that was after I got my money from the public house; we were then in the bottom room; I don't recollect anybody being there particularly, but Thomas and Smith - I don't think we had any dinner; I will not say that I might not hand my money to one of these girls to take care of.</p>

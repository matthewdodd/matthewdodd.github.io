               <p>HENRY JACKSON sworn. - I live at Beckenham, in the country of Kent; I saw the China bowl on Friday, the 1st of May, in the possession of the prisoner; I met him in Cloak-lane with it in his hand, in consequence of which I applied to the Lord-Mayor for a search-warrant; I challenged the bowl as mine; he said it was not, I was mistaken; I did not take him into custody, I took the bowl from him, and lodged it at a person's house, Mr. Schroeder's, upon College-hill; on Monday, the 4th of May, I went with a Marshalman and a search-warrant to the prisoner's lodgings, in Bow-lane, Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner in those lodgings? - A. No; I found there a shirt, two neckcloths, a cravat, two handkerchiefs, four waistcoats, a pair of knee-caps, and a night-cap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long is it since this man was in your service? - A. In December last.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it is usual with you, when your servants leave you, that they should give an account of every article in their possession? - A. I did not look over his linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Not his own linen, but you expected him to give an account of every thing that passes through his hands belonging to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep several servants? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it happened that other servants have been accused by you of similar transactions? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who lives with the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a woman lives with him? A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. The night-cap and the waistcoats, where did you find them? - A. The Marshalman found them in his boxes; the waistcoats I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the bowl? - A. There is a certain chip in a very particular place that I can certainly venture to swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. You have occasionally given this man some old clothes? - A. I have, but never linen.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PARROTT sworn. - I am one of the Marshalmen: On the 4th of May I went with a search-warrant to No. 31, Bow-lane, a widow lady keeps the house; in the back room, at the up per part of the house, I found these things in a box. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>ISAAC NEWSOP sworn. - I was with the last witness; I know no more of it than he does.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Jackson. Q. When was it that you had the bowl from the prisoner? - A. Friday, the 1st of May; I took it from Mr. Schroeder's on Monday, the 4th.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had the bowl for six years; the person who saw me buy it is dead, and therefore I cannot bring him to prove it; when that bowl was cast. I should think more than that one would have been cast at the same time, and Mr. Jackson ought to be particularly careful before he takes an affidavit to it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him. a good character. <rs id="t18010520-12-verdict65" type="verdictDescription">

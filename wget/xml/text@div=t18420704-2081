                  </hi>, I keep cows, and live at Hagerstown. The pri<lb></lb>soner came into my service on the 1st of June—on Wednesday morning, the 15th, he came to work about a quarter past six o'clock, he asked me to let him go home, and about a quarter past seven he passed through the shop, by the window—in consequence of something I called him back to the dairy, and saw something under his left side rather bulky—I asked him, and he said he had nothing there—I was not satisfied, pulled his coat open, and one of the gaiters fell from under his coat—I gave him no leave to take it away—I took off his hat, and there found the other gaiter—these are them—they are mine—he said he did not intend to steal them, he meant to ask me what I would take for them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant N</hi> 15.) I was called—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner running, and the prosecutor after him—I pursued, and he was stopped by a gentleman—I took him—be said he did not intend to steal the gaiters, but to ask his master if he would sell them—after that he begged his master not to charge him, he would pay him any thing he liked for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>, I went into the cow-shed, and got these gaiters; I brought them in; he said, "What have you got there?. I said, "Your gaiters, will you sell them?" he hit me in the face, and told me to go; I was going, he ran and stopped me. <hi rend="largeCaps">

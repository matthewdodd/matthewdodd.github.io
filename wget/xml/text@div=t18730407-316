                  </hi>. I keep the Barley Mow public-house, Paradise Street, Rotherhithe—I took Charles Gibbons into my service on the 28th February—in consequence of certain facts which came to my knowledge I gave in<lb></lb>formation to the police, and on Saturday, 15th March, I had a constable watching the premises—I was in my bar parlour and saw the constable follow the woman in—he seized her as she took Some money from the bar, and my foreman pushed the man into the bar parlour to me—he dropped on his knees and said, "Pray forgive me, for the sake of my poor wife; I will never do it any more"—I waited a moment and said "What do you mean, Charles I forgive you for what?"—he got up, sat on a chair, and said "I have never done anything; I never did anything wrong to you; what am I here for?"—the detective came back and took him, after locking the woman up—he was searched and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver was found upon him.</p>

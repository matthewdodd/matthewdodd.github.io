I asked my young man if he had sold any; he said no: about three o'clock I went out, and said about half an hour; when I came back again there were two cakes more gone; and with one he had detected the prisoner: I found her in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170017"></xptr> shop: she desired I would forgive her, and said she never would do so again; she being an old offender, I charged the constable with her, and charged her with taking the other two cakes. I hearing her husband was an honest man, I applied to him, and had a cake of soap brought to me from him.</p>

            . I am a relation to the prosecutor, and his apprentice; just after the soap came in, the prisoner came in for half a quartern of tea, and while I turned my back there was a cake of soap missing; she was just gone: about an hour and half after I went in to dinner; she came in again and asked for half a quartern of tea; as soon as I had weighed it she would not have it, but would have a halpennyworth of sugar; after she was gone there was another cake missing: I went in again to dinner, and in less than five minutes she came in again, and asked for half a quartern of tea: I challenged her with taking some soap, and having some under her arm; she went out at the door: I followed her, and pulled her cloak aside; there I saw a cake of soap under her arm; there had been about half a pound cut off, at one end, for a sample: I brought her into the shop, and in two or three minutes my master came.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

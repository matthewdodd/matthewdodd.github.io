                  </hi>. I am a carman. On the 15th of July I went to the Three Compasses, in Little Guildford-street, St. Saviour's, for some beer for supper—I had a jug with me—Mr. Cole and Mr. Parsons were there—I drank some beer with them—while standing there the prisoner came in and called for a pint of beer—Mr. Peacock, the landlord, drew it—he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out some halfpence; it was not sufficient; he then pulled out an old coin—the landlord said he did not take such money as that—he drank the beer, and wanted another pint—the landlord refused—he struck the pot on the counter twice—the landlord came round from the bar, turned him out, and closed the door on him—about five minutes after<lb></lb>wards he came back and rapped at the door—I, being close to it, opened it—I was going home, and before I could get away from him he cut me on the head with a pair of tongs, and I fell senseless on the ground—when I came to myself I was at the station-house—I was hurt on my head, my left knee, and both my legs—the skin of my head was broken—it bled a great deal—a sur<lb></lb>geon's apprentice attended me for about ten minutes—I did not go to him again—I had never seen or spoken to the prisoner before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a job-master, and live in Little Guildford-street. I was at the Three Compasses—I did not see the prisoner come in—I saw him come out of the tap-room—no one interrupted or said anything to him—he asked for a pint of beer—he had got a little bit of tin in his hand, which the landlord refused to take—he then turned out with a little <hi rend="italic">tiff</hi>—in about ten minutes he came in again, took a pint pot up, and cut three holes in the counter—the landlord was sent for—he came out of the parlour, and the prisoner was put out of the door—in about ten minutes or a quarter of as hour he came back, and beat the door three or four times, apparently with a weapon—the prosecutor went to carry a pot of beer home for his supper, and he caught the weapon on his head—I heard a loud cry for me—I stepped out immediately—I saw Butterworth lying on the ground, and the prisoner beating him with the tongs—he struck him in my presence—I went and took him by the collar, put my foot behind him, and he fell in the gutter—I imme<lb></lb>diately took the tongs and pushed them into the street—a man took them into the public-house—they were very heavy—he had gone home for them to his own house—when I went up to Butterworth the blood was streaming down on the flag-stone—if I had not rescued him he would have been seriously injured—he was insensible for about an hour and twenty minutes—he was wounded all about his face—we took him on a stretcher to the station—a surgeon was sent for, who washed and dressed the wound—it bled a great deal—the blood lay next morning on the stones—this is the weapon—(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

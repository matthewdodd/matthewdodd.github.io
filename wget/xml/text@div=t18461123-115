                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, and live in Old Gravel-lane—I have a shop in Mr. Walker's yard—the prisoner was my foreman for one year and eight months—Cannan has been my apprentice three years—he was to work under the prisoner—I was out a great deal, and left a great deal to the pri<lb></lb>soner—having missed things I spoke to Cannan, and in consequence of what he told me, on the 6th of Nov., I asked the prisoner how became to take such things as Cannan had told me of me of, and why he should rob me—he said he did not—the next morning I gave him into custody, and I went with Cannan and the officer the same day to search the prisoner's house at Oldford—I found there some pieces of wood—here is part of a bolster, which is a piece of wood that goes under the carriage of a wagon or a van—I brought it away with the constable—I know it to be mine by comparing it with the others in my shop—there were several of them cut out of one tree at the time—the knot fol<lb></lb>lows, so that they all correspond—the prisoner had no right to take any of this property—I had an iron chain brought to me by Mr. Cookson of Wap<lb></lb>ping—it was worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I missed it, and shall have to make it good—it was a close linked chain used for shipping—there were twelve or fourteen fathoms of it—I had missed a wrench, worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been apprentice to the prosecutor for three years, and have been working under the prisoner since he has been there—in Aug., 1845, I recollect his taking twenty-four feet of old boards away—he said it was to make a pig-stye—I have seen it at his house since, and I believe it to be the same wood—I recollect a chain being brought to Mr. Gunner's place to be repaired—the prisoner took it away from the shop—he said he was going to sell it, and wanted me to help him take it away—it was very nearly half a hundred weight—I never saw it after it was taken away—it was taken at dinner time, between one and two o'clock—my master was mostly away—the prisoner had the command of all the place.</p>

(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

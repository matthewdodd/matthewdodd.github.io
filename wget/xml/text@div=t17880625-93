               <p>I am father of this child.</p>
               <p>What age is this child? - She is six years and eight months, seven years old the 27th of October.</p>
               <p>Is the child capable of knowing the nature of an oath? - No, I really think she is not.</p>
               <p>Is she a quick or backward child of her age? - She is very quick, very artful.</p>
               <p>But not of knowledge enough you think to know the nature of an oath? - I do not think she is.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of this business of your own knowledge? - No further than the prisoner being a very intimate acquaintance; he took the child out on the Sunday, in the afternoon, last Sunday was a week, I lodged in his house for some considerable time before this, not now; he took her out about half past two, as near as we imagined, and she came home between five and six, he always sent her home by herself; she would come home when he put her into the way, she had been out divers times, he frequently asked my wife to let him take her out, he knows the child better than I do myself, she came home between five and six, I did not observe any thing was the matter with her, she said nothing at all; on Wednesday in the evening my wife was looking out the foul clothes for washing, and she saw the child rubbing herself at bed time, I was in bed, in the same room, and she says Kitty, what is the matter with you? she thought the child might be chased; Oh, mammy, says she, I am so wet you cannot think, and my wife took up her clothes, and found her thift in as terrible a condition as could be, and she said, she was afraid she was ruined; my wife shewed me the linen, and I said, I really think the child has the foul disease upon her, it had that appearance; I observed a very great running, and a very great stiffness upon it.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the person of the child? - After I had taken the prisoner into custody, I did, but not before; I took him into custody on Thursday last, about twelve, that was the next day, I went to the prisoner where he was at work; I said Mr. Fyson, I want to speak with you; and the man was ready to sink into the earth; oh, says he, Mr. Sweetman, I am sorry for any thing I have committed; says he, Mr. Sweetman, a guinea or two shall not be deficient; pray do not mention it to any body; says I, how came you to use the baby in that manner?</p>
               <p>Had you said any thing to him? - I said, Mr. Fyson, I am very sorry the affair should happen, you doated on the child so, more than I did myself, I charged him with the action, says he, I handled the girl, I cannot say what possessed me to do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250101"></xptr>it; I really do not know; says I, Mr. Fyson, it is not a guinea or two will satisfy me, I will have you before a magistrate, so come along; says he, Mr. Sweetman, I'll follow you with all my soul; and he went with me out of the shop, he wanted to go over to the Horse and Windmill; no, says I, and I delivered him into the officer's hands, he confessed it to the officer, I heard him; says he, I am very sorry for the affair, I cannot deny but I am guilty of the matter.</p>
               <p>What matter? - Of the injury he had done the child, he said, he had handled the child.</p>
               <p>Did he ever say any thing more? - No, we took him before the justice immediately when he was examined I insisted upon it that the child was foul, he denied it intirely; Mr. Wilmot sent for Mr. Brown, he could not come for a considerable time, and with a deal of patience, he came, then he had the man examined in court, and found him to be foul; Mr. Wilmot said, you villain, where did you get this disease? says he, I caught it of the prosecutor's wife about six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Was that true! - No Sir, my wife said, if the gentlemen will withdraw, I will be examined, she was within an hour or two of being delivered; she was delivered last Sunday, she was here on Saturday all day, the midwife is not here; here is a woman here, that was at her delivery.</p>
               <p>Court. If I had known as much of the case as I do now, I would have put off the trial to the next sessions; did the man ever acknowledge to have done any thing else to the child but handling her? - No, no further; I went last Sunday, and the child shewed me the place where the affair was committed, upwards of two miles off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's counsel. You seem so candid, Sir, I shall only ask you a single question. The child was out of your company, and out of your house? - Yes, I was at home all the time.</p>
               <p>She could not have been at home without your knowing of it? - No.</p>
               <p>You said nothing more to the prisoner at first, than what you have mentioned? - No.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon; this child was brought to me on Thursday morning last, I examined it, and thought there were some symptoms of a venereal complaint.</p>
               <p>Were the symptoms such as enabled you to pronounce with any certainty? - I thought it really was so; I thought there were some symptoms of a local complaint, it had all the symptoms of a venereal complaint, not a lues, but a gonorrhea.</p>
               <p>Might no other cause of inflammation produce the same symptoms? - There might such things happen.</p>
               <p>Have you, either then or since, been able to ascertain with any certainty, whether it is a venereal complaint, or might it proceed from other causes? - I have often known children to have similar complaints, and I have found afterwards that the parents had something of that complaint upon them.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say with certainty from whatever cause the venereal complaint proceeded, that the complaint is venereal? - According to some symptoms.</p>
               <p>But I ask whether all the symptoms might not be occasioned from inflammations proceeding from other causes? - They might have originated from other causes.</p>
               <p>Would not a greater length of time have enabled you to pronounce for certainty, whether the child's complaint was venereal or not? - It might so, I never saw it but that once.</p>
               <p>Then probably from your examination, you are not able to pronounce with certainty, that the complaint is venereal? - I had only a slight investigation of her.</p>
               <p>Let you have seen her once, or twenty times; let your investigation have been slight or minute; are you able to pronounce this for certainty, that the complaint is venereal? - I really thought it to be material.</p>
               <p>Do you think so still? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250102"></xptr>Are you sure in your opinion? - I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Would not an inflammation in those parts, arising from any other accidental cause, produce the same appearances, from over exertions; suppose now for instance, from very violent exercise of any kind, the child had been hurt in those parts, might not the same symptoms appear? - They might.</p>
               <p>Then it would depend on time and observation to ascertain, whether the complaint was venereal or not? - I have often observed complaints of a similar kind, I never could account for it, but some times I found out that the parents had a venereal complaint, and it might have been contracted from the parents.</p>
               <p>Were those infallible symptoms, or such as might arise from any other cause? - They certainly are doubtful symptoms, but I really supposed it to be venereal.</p>
               <p>Do you give a certain or a doubtful opinion? - A doubtful opinion, but my opinion is, that it is venereal.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards attend at the justices? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Has he any venereal complaint? - He has some symptoms of a venereal complaint likewise.</p>
               <p>Are his symptoms more or less certain than those of the child? - They are local; but his is certainly a venereal complaint.</p>
               <p>Was you there when the prisoner said he had got it from the prosecutor's wife? - Yes, the woman was present; she said she would suffer herself to be examined; she was not examined.</p>
               <p>Did you hear this man say any thing what intercourse he had had with his child? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Court. Does there happen to be any medical gentleman besides Mr. Brown in court.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Mr. Ball I understand is a gentleman of skill.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Ball. Will you have the goodness, Sir, to withdraw with Mr. Brown into the Lord Mayor's parlour, and examine this unfortunate child?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ball. Yes, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Did the child complain of any disorder before last Sunday week? - No, I do not know that I ever observed any thing on the child in my life, before last Wednesday morning, I did not observe the child's linen before then discoloured or stiffened, last Wednesday morning about seven or eight, I was getting up, and dressing myself I saw something on the child's shift, says I, Kitty what is this? says she, it is the child has puked over me, that is the child I have in my arms, then I went out to work, and thought no more of it.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the person of the child at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you know nothing more but what the child told you? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Did the child ever complain of any ill treatment from the prisoner? - No never, but always was extremely fond of him.</p>
               <p>Was the child kept pretty strictly at home? - No Sir, I cannot say but she is a very forward fond child.</p>
               <p>She runs about and plays with great boys? - I do not know, I go out at seven in the morning, and come home at night.</p>
               <p>Does she not run about the neighbourhood with a strict attention of her parents? - Yes, she does.</p>
               <p>And is some times hours together without the knowledge of the parents? - She is.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever observe any thing particular in the prisoner's behaviour to the child? - No Sir, but always very fond of her.</p>

               <p>Has she the venereal complaint? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it manifestly so? - Clearly so.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Brown. Are you of the same opinion? - I am.</p>
               <p>Are your doubts removed now? - Yes, it is very clear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt to Mr. Brown? Is not it possible for a venereal taint to be got or acquited in different ways than from a man's penetrating a child or woman? - I have observed that children have had it in that manner without the least penetration.</p>
               <p>Court. It certainly may, and clearly by contact, without penetration.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. It may be got by sitting on a seat at a necessary, or by touching a child with his finger? - It may be.</p>
               <p>Court. You have had now two opportunities of examining this child; is there any appearance of laceration? - Not in the least, no laceration of the parts.</p>
               <p>Then you perceive from the appearance of the child's person this crime could not have been committed, could she have been penetrated by a grown-up man? - I think not.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Ball. (The same question.) - Why my Lord there is certainly no appearance of laceration, nor should I hardly have supposed there could have been any, I do not see any thing like that laceration having been made, nor any wound that has been healed, it seems to me quite unaccountable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt to Mr. Ball. Would it not in a child of that age if penetrated by an adult be exceedingly visible? - I should apprehend so.</p>

               <p>I am a bell founder, I have known the prisoner six or seven years, he has worked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250104"></xptr>for me that time; I never saw him indecent in any respect, not even in his conversation; he behaved with decency and propriety in every respect.</p>
               <p>The Jury upon giving a verdict guilty of the attempt, and being informed that they must either convict or acquit the prisoner under the indictment, which was for the complete crime, and not for an attempt, the foreman pronounced the word Guilty; upon which the learned Recorder thus addressed them: - Gentlemen, In order to find the prisoner guilty, you must be satisfied on your oaths, that the prisoner has completely entered the body of this child, and has had the same knowledge of her that any of you have had of your wives; I feel some anxiety that you should clearly understand this case, and the question which you are to determine; leaving the determination of it to you. The verdict which you first delivered in, I confess, appeared to me to be a declaration of the truth of the fact according to the evidence; it appears that this man has been guilty of a very gross and brutal attempt, to do an act, which neither has been nor could have been completed; if that is so; if that is your opinion of the fact, (for you are to judge of the fact and not me, I am only to tell you my opinion of the law) I can tell you with confidence, that if your opinion of the evidence is what you have now stated, you are bound to find him not guilty; you do not acquit your consciences and your oaths as Jurors, if believing he has been guilty of the attempt, you find him guilty of the complete charge; but if you are certain from the evidence that he is guilty of this complete crime, you will declare so by your verdict.</p>
               <p>The Jury immediately found a verdict, of course</p>
               <p>

               NOT GUILTY

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Although I could not help feeling some anxiety about the event of this trial under this indictment, because I always wish the law to be administered dispassionately, yet till this very respectable jury had declared their verdict, it was not proper for me to say any thing of the motives which excited so great a doubt in their minds, who would not have entertained any doubt under other circumstances; (but the nature of good men's minds is so much offended at that conduct that has been clearly committed by you) and my opinion of these gentlemen is not altered by their finding that verdict; and I am happy in knowing that the consequence of that verdict is not a total impunity for your offence, for the law prescribes a different punishment although under a different prosecution for the offence that has been proved against you; and these gentlemen having done their duty, and repressed those honourable feelings which led them to be under some little danger of going beyond their duty, I shall certainly take the opportunity of bringing you to that punishment which you deserve; therefore I shall certainly order you (the Grand Jury being discharged) to be detained till the next sessions, in order to be prosecuted for the attempt. This poor man, the prosecutor, cannot afford the expences; I shall therefore make him a liberal allowance. Allow the prosecutor five guineas for the expence of this prosecution, and bind him and his witnesses over, to appear and give evidence on a bill of indictment against the prisoner, before the Grand Jury at the next sessions, and let the prisoner stand committed till the next sessions.</p>

On the night of the 5th of August, about eleven o'clock, I and my servant shut up the house; we fastened the doors and the windows. I called my servant up at six o'clock the next morning; she came down stairs and came up to me. I saw the street door open as I came down stairs. The kitchen window was open, but not the parlour window. Upon my looking about I missed all the articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since seen the watch, the plated teaspoons, and the handkerchief - A. Yes, in the prisoner's possession; the silver tea-spoons, they were sold. On the 6th, in the afternoon, the prisoner came to me. I saw my handkerchief hanging out at his pocket; it struck me that it was mine. I told him so. He took it out, and said it was not mine. I knew it then. I then had him taken in custody. He ran away from me; I called for assistance. He told me he was not the person that broke my house; I told him he was.</p>

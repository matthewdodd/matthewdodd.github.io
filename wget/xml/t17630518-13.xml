On the 29th of April last, about 9 in the morning, I had been gone to a lady in Red-lion-street, and on my return in about half an hour I found my shop shut up; there was the prisoner, they told me he was taken with a trunk of mine on his back. He said, he was going to make water by my shop and the trunk fell upon his knot, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176305180009"></xptr> he walked away with it, not knowing he had it on his back. They shewed me the trunk, it was a large trunk an ell long, which had stood on my stall-board at the door; the board is about three feet from the ground.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you there? - She enticed me there; when I came in the room she asked me for something to eat and drink, I told her, I could not afford to give her any thing to eat, but a pint of beer she might have, and we had a pint of beer; and then she asked me what I would give her, and I could not afford to give her but 6 d. and 6 d. I gave her; then she fastened up the door, and put the candle out, and we went to bed; and I took my breeches, and laid them under my head; and my money and watch were in my breeches; it was a silver watch, I was offered three guineas for it: I fell asleep, and she took this watch and money out of my breeches; I awaked when the watchman went three, and she was gone, and my breeches laid on the pillow, and my money and watch were gone; in that situation I was not willing to leave the room, for fear any thing should be laid to my charge, till the landlady came to see whether all her things were there; which she did, and found them all there; and I found this purse that my money was in, and a farthing on the floor: it was the prisoner's lodging; the landlady went with me to the justices: I was on the search after the prisoner, from the Monday to the Friday: on Friday she came to the same place again, and hired another room, and the landlady let me know, and I took her up. I never was along with any other woman but this.</p>

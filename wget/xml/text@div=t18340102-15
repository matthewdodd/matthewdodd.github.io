            . I am an officer - I took charge of the prisoner at Mr. Blackmore's - I observed the state of his clothes - they had what I considered to be leather-dust on them - they were soiled as a person would be who had carried leather; at the Compter I took his hat off in consequence of what Pallet said, and showed Pallet his hat, which was all over mud - he said, "That confirms my opinion, for his hat fell off;" he was asked if it was his own hat, and he said it was - it was quite wet, as if it had fallen in the road - it was a very muddy evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Where did you ask me to own my hat when you had me in custody? - A. In the first place, I asked if it was your own in Mr. Blackmore's warehouse, and in the Compter again; and you acknowledged it was your hat; and you had it all over mud - I know nothing about your hat falling off; but after what I heard from Pallet, I took it off in the Compter, and held it to Pallet in the Compter - I saw the dust of the skins on your clothes in Mr. Blackmore's warehouse - I told you it was what I called leather-dust; but I understand it was the bark of the leather.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.State what passed at the Compter? - A.When we got into the Compter, I took the prisoner's hat off, while the officer was untying his hands - without saying a word to any individual, I took it to the window, and examined it, and said, "Oh, that satisfies me;" which was all that passed - it was not very much soiled - it was all over mud - the prisoner made no observation about it that I recollect - no question was put to him about the hat in my hearing - I had not called the officer's attention to the state of the hat before I got to the Compter - it occurred to my own mind when I got to the Compter - I walked with the officer to the Compter - I walked behind him; not side by side - I did not remark on the hat till I got to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was examined, the officer swore he saw the dirt of the skins on my coat, which is false - when I got up in the morning I had no more dirt than I had at night; and Pallet will prove it - my hat was only soiled with the sprinkling of rain.</p>

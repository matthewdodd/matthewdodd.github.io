             desired I would go along with her to my Lord Mayor, in order to get a warrant, as she had lost a gown; but we could not have a hearing then. There was a young woman there, who said she had an acquaintance in trouble in the Compter. She asked me if I should like to see the Compter. I told her I had never seen such a place, and should like to see it.

             and I went along with her; when we came there, we saw this man at the bar, and one Litchfield. The young woman that took us there asked us if we would have any thing to eat or drink, and said if we would get any thing, she would pay for it. We staid about half an hour; when we came down stairs the prisoner followed us, and asked us to go to a public house to drink. I said I had rather not, I rather chose to go home. We went to the corner of Honey-lane market to a public-house; presently<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280007"></xptr> Litchfield came in. After that they both insisted on our going to some gardens. We told them we had rather go home, and desired they would not detain us. I told them my nearest way was down Cheapside; they told us the nearest way was through Newgate-market. When we came out, I requested they would let us go home. The prisoner begged I would not make myself uneasy, we should be at home by six o'clock; that he would go and have some tea, and we should go home directly after. I told the other young woman, that it was so far from our house, I would go home with her, and turned, thinking to get away, then they lugged me back and brought us away, and said we should go along with them. When we had gone a great way, we came into a road. I said I did not know where I was, and insisted on going no farther. The prisoner told us we were only going down this road; he brought us to a public-house, the sign of the Bull's head; this was when it was about dusk; there they said they intended to go a little farther, saying they could not have tea there. We insisted on going no farther, and that we would go home. Then the prisoner said we should go in there and have something; then he dragged me in, and called for a bottle of cyder. All the while we staid there I begged and intreated to go home. I was very uneasy. The prisoner insisted that we should not go. A man that was in the house said he would join company with us, saying he lived just by. They brought us into a little room. The prisoner said he could not drink cyder, he called for some beer; there were us four, and that other man. We staid a great while in the room. I insisted upon his letting us go; but he would not; he insisted I should drink, and I drank but a little of the cyder. I said I was very uneasy, and got upon the table to jump off to get out of the room; he dragged me down, and insisted that I should not stir, for he would see me home. When they came to pay, the prisoner came to me and asked me if I had any money, saying he had not money to pay the reckoning. I said I had none. Then he said he could not go, and if I would give him any he would go directly. I gave him eighteen-pence and two-pence, thinking to get away. He said that would not do, he must have a shilling more. I told him I had no more; then he said he could not go, he must stay longer. He said the reckoning came to three or four shillings. I told him I knew how much it came to, and if it came to more I must borrow it of

             gave me a shilling, thinking to get away from them, not knowing I had given a shilling before. He called for the reckoning. It came to nineteen-pence half-penny.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did you give him in the whole?</p>
               <p>M. Warnett. I gave him two shillings and eight-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not return the rest of the money after he had paid the reckoning?</p>
               <p>Warnett. No, he did not. We proceeded out of the house, us four; the other man that joined us in the public-house did not go with us; there was a woman and two girls stood at the door as we came out, we asked them which was the nearest way to town; they told us, if we would go with them, they would put us in the nearest way. The prisoner dragged me away, and said we should not go with them, we should go with, him, and he would shew us the nearest way; he then dragged me down the road, and in the road he threw me in a ditch. I screamed out murder. I got out again, and he pulled me down in it again, and jumped down himself, and some how or other he got me out again. I went to scream out; he said if I did, he would cut my throat from ear to ear, or stab me. He dragged me along after that, and got me into a field. I said, Pray let me go home, for God's sake let me go home. He said, God d - n you, you b - h, can't you hold your tongue? If you will not, I'll cut your throat. He dragged me a great way up the field. I cried and screamed, and said, For God's sake let me go home, and when I come to London I'll go any where with you, thinking to get away; he dragged and forced me along. When we came a good way up the field, he asked Litchfield whether he would go any farther; he answered no, he would not; then the prisoner took and threw me down on some hay. I cried out, For God's sake only let me go. For God's sake take my life. Do any thing in the world with me, only let me go home. He d - d me for a b - h, and said if I spoke a word he would cut my throat.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to you?</p>
               <p>Warnett. He put what he had into my body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do it by force?</p>
               <p>Warnett. He did. I cried and screamed, and strove as much as I could that he should not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the words what he had?</p>
               <p>Warnett. I mean his private parts.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280008"></xptr>Q. Did you feel any thing come from him?</p>
               <p>Warnett. With the horror and fright I was in. I do not know whether I felt any thing come from him or no, I swear it was against my will and consent.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening was this?</p>
               <p>Warnett. It was duskish. I do not know. After that he put his hand up my body. I cried and screamed, and said, O! for God's sake dont. He put his fingers in my body, and said if I did not hold my tongue he would cut my throat. He asked me whether I ever f - t. I told him I did not know what he meant by it. He said if I did not know what he meant, he would make me know before he left me. Then he put his private parts into me again. I cried and screamed, and begged him for God's sake to let me go.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not feel something come from him?</p>
               <p>Warnett. I believe I felt something come from him then; but I was in such horror, I thought he would have killed me; with the fright, I am not certain. Litchfield called to him and asked him whether he had done with me. He said no; but he would lay in the field all night. I begged he would go home. He said he would not. He staid a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any thing to you after the second time?</p>
               <p>Warnett. Yes, he put his fingers up my body again. Litchfield called to him, and begged of him to come away. He said he would not. I begged he would let me go, and told him he knew I was an honest girl. He said, D - n his blood, he knew I was: for I had never known a man before, and he did not know what to do with me hardly. Litchfield came to him and begged he would come away. He said he would not. Litchfield took hold of him, and dragged him from off me. Litchfield bid me get up and come away: he had the other girl with him. With my fright I did get up; but hardly knew how. I begged of Litchfield to let me lay hold of his coat: my hat and cap were off, and Litchfield bid me put them on: they hung behind me. He bid me come along, and he said he would shew me the right way to London. The prisoner followed us.

             was along with me. We went around another field. Litchfield led me, and it brought us to some houses. I took it for a barn. I thought it was needless to call out to them houses, for I saw no body in them. They were new houses just doing up. When we got a little farther, I heard a coach go along; it past me in great speed: the prisoner was behind a hedge, but he came up to Litchfield and said, D - n your eyes, why did not you stop the coach? Now we might have got a good booty, and you have let it go. Did you ever see such a d - d fellow in your life! Litchfield said he did not think of it. We came on a little farther. I thought I saw a light (it was dark then). I saw a woman come to light some gentlemen out of a house. I was afraid to run to them, till I thought I could get up to them, fearing they should drag me away again. When I came so near that I imagined I could make my escape, I ran up to one of them, and laid hold of him; his name is Ham; he is here.

I told Mr. Ham how I had been used by the prisoner. The others, Mr. Wooden and Mr. Thodey, were there also. I told them the same as I have here. The prisoner said I was a vile woman, that I had lived with him seven months, and that he had kept me seven months. The gentlemen said if it was so, they had no farther business to trouble themselves about it. I told them he was a vile man, and informed them who I was, and where I lived; that I came out of place but on Tuesday morning last; that I knew nothing of him, and had never seen him till that afternoon. Curtain said the same, and that she had not known the man till that afternoon. Mr. Ham said he would take it into consideration, and if we would charge them, and the woman of the house would send for a constable, they would secure them. Then the prisoner and Litchfield wanted to go away. A carpenter and another gentleman stood at the door to prevent their making their escape. The constable came in. I charged the prisoner. He told the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280009"></xptr> constable I had lived with him fourteen months; but that gained no credit. When they heard he differed in his story, they all thought he was in the wrong. Then the prisoner said he had a wife, and she was a little jealous of him, and he kept me private, because she should not know any thing of it. They were both taken into custody. The constable said, the prisoner must have his hands tied, he having made a resistance. He was very obstropulous. He said he was never tied in his life, they might take hold of him, and he would go with them; but if they would tie him, they must do it by force. They were obliged to lay him down all along on the floor to tie him. They were both taken to the watch house, and on the morning following, which was this day week, carried before Sir

               <p>Q. Were not the prisoner and you very familiar in the Compter?</p>
               <p>Warnett. No, I believe he did not kiss me once there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any body in the field where the hay was besides you four?</p>
               <p>Warnett. No, not that where they used us so ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make all the resistance you could when he threw you down on the hay?</p>
               <p>Warnett. I did. I begged and intreated him to let me go, and cried out murder, and he stopt my mouth with his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. After his throwing up your petticoats, how long was it before he got into your body?</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. A minute?</p>
               <p>Warnett. Above a minute</p>
               <p>Q. Two minutes?</p>
               <p>Warnett. I believe it was above two minutes. I was struggling to get up, that he should not lie with me. I did all I could, and screamed out, and kept my legs together as long as ever I could.</p>

             doing at the time?</p>
               <p>Warnett. The other man was laying with her at the same time. My spirits were so far gone, that I was forced to resign to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make resistance the second time?</p>
               <p>Warnett. I did; but not so long as the first. My strength was quite spent. I was quite gone. I was afraid they would murder me. They had a dog, and I was afraid he would set the dog upon us to kill us.</p>
               <p>Q. What place was it where you saw Mr. Ham and the other gentlemen?</p>
               <p>Warnett. That was the Nag's Head. They told us it was leading to Hackney. We had come a good way before we came to that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your home?</p>
               <p>Warnett. My home is on Saffron-hill, at Mrs. Winter's, in Blue-Court. I lodged there after I came out of place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a promise to return your money again?</p>

            . The first time I saw the prisoner was last Thursday was week. We were at the Mansion-house: we walked from thence to Wood-street Compter. There I saw Litchfield and the prisoner. From thence we went to a public-house in Honey-lane market, and had some beer. The prisoner begged of us to go there, and Litchfield came in after us. Then she was for going home to tea; the men said we should go to some gardens to drink tea along with them. We told them we had rather go home; but they insisted upon it we should go with them. Then we went all down Bishopsgate-street, and never stopt till we came to the public-house in the road. In going along,

             turned down a lane, and the prisoner dragged her back. I really do not know whereabouts that lane is. The prisoner took hold of her arm, and Litchfield laid hold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280010"></xptr> of mine; they bid us not be uneasy, for we should be at home by six o'clock to drink tea. I aid that I did not like to take hold of a man's arm I did not know. We were carried to the Bull's Head, a public house; they wanted us to go a little farther, but we would not. They wanted us to go in there; we were not for that; but rather than go further, we went in just to drink, not thinking to stay. We went into a room. They called for a bottle of cyder; there was a gentleman joined our company there; he continued there till we came away. He told us he used the house, and that he lived just by.</p>

               <p>Q. How long might you stay at that house?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I fancy we might stay there about an hour, or an hour and a half. The prisoner sung, and that other man came in, and begged of him to sing. He sung a good many songs. We both got up, and immediately insisted upon going, and they said we should not, they would go presently, and would see us safe home. I rung the bell for the waiter to come and take the reckoning. The prisoner sent him away, and said he did not want to go; he would have another pot of beer. I said, You may have as many pots of beer as you will; but we will go. The gentleman said he should sing another song. Warnett paid the reckoning. She got upon the table to come away, and the prisoner pulled her off the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pay the reckoning?</p>
               <p>Curtain. She gave the prisoner the money to pay. He asked her for money to pay; she said she had none. Then he said he had none, and he must leave his coat to pay the reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay any part of the money?</p>
               <p>Curtain. No, she gave me money to pay. When we went out of the house, a woman and two girls were standing at the door: we asked her the way to London, she told us she was going to London, and she would shew us. The men told us that was not the way, they were going right, and they would shew us: they took us quite the wrong way. They took us into a road we knew nothing of. We said that was not the road we came. We begged they would take us to the right road. When we got down a lane, the prisoner dragged

The prisoner pulled her out of the ditch, and I saw him throw her in again the second time, and he pulled her out again a second time; after that they swore if we did not go along with them into the field, they would cut our throats.

               <p>Curtain. He dragged her. She seemed to make all the resistance she could, and so did I; but it grew so dark I could hardly see. I saw him throw her down in the field. She called out to me, and said, Molly, for God's sake! there is a man in the field. I said there is no man. They said if we made the least noise they would cut our throats from ear to ear.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it she said she saw a man in the field?</p>
               <p>Curtain. That was before she was thrown down.</p>

               <p>Curtain. [She described it by pointing to a place about three or four yards distance ] The prisoner called to Litchfield, and said, Blast you! you have carried them far enough. Litchfield said, Yes. Then they dragged us to the hay, and threw us down upon it. I saw him throw her down before Litchfield and I got up to them.</p>

               <p>Curtain. I think it was an hour and a quarter. I and Litchfield were on the hay on the other side at the same time. After Litchfield had done what he pleased with me, he called out to the prisoner, Will you go? The prisoner called to him, and said, Blast her! have you not f - d her yet? The other said, No. After some time Litchfield said, Now will you go? The prisoner said. No, blast your eyes, I will not.

             was lying down, and he upon her. Litchfield threw him quite off. She got up, and begged she might lay hold of Litchfield's coat: he said she might; and bid her put on her cap; which she did; and we went away, and left the prisoner lying down in the field. We did not meet with any body till we got into the road but a gentleman's coach. The prisoner, who was following us, stooped down under a hedge: after the coach was gone by, the prisoner said to Litchfield, Blast your eyes! why did you not stop that coach? Now we might have had fifteen or sixteen guineas. Litchfield said, I did not think about it. We walked a great way<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280011"></xptr> before we could see any body, for the value of a quarter of an hour, till we came to the road; then Molly Warnett told me she saw a light: I bade her hold her tongue, for we should see somebody presently: just as I spoke the word, a gentlewoman was lighting some people out of a house. We ran to them as soon as we could, but was afraid to speak to them too soon, fearing they should prevent our making our escape. The gentleman that I ran to is named Thodey. I begged of him, for God's sake, to take care of me!

               <p>Q. Did she speak that aloud?</p>
               <p>Curtain. She did; a great deal louder than I do now. She cried out all the time she was upon the hay, and he bid her hold her tongue, or he would cut her throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see her lying?</p>
               <p>Curtain. I could; it was a little cock of hay, such as haymakers make in the field.</p>

The girls complained they had been used in a very gross manner, that they had been ravished, and kept in the field a great while. Warnett seemed to be in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280012"></xptr> very great fright. The men desired we would not mind what they said, and told us they were a couple of impudent strumpets. The prisoner said he had kept a lodging for Warnett seven months in Purpool-lane, Gray's-inn-lane. The girls laid open their case in a more plainer manner than they had before. Warnett said she never saw the men before that day, and she left her place the Tuesday before. We thought proper to secure the men. The woman of the house sent for an officer. When he came, they wanted to make their way out of the house; but we prevented them. The prisoner said he would be led along; but he would not be tied, unless it was done by force. One of the gentlemen that was with me threw him down, and the officer tied him. Then they took Litchfield and we tied him, and tied them both together. While the prisoner was down, he said he would be revenged if ever he got loose. We ordered the two girls to be kept in the watch-house that night, and carried the men to New Prison. We attended them to Sir

            . I was in company with Mr. Ham, coming from Hackney last Thursday was sevennight, when, just against the Nag's Head in Hackney road, there were the two young women and two men. We were crossing the road very near the public-house. The girls slew to us and asked the way for Holborn. We said we were going to town. The girls desired we would protect them, saying these two men had used them very ill, and threatened their lives. We went into the public-house. They told their story before the landlord and landlady. The landlady advised to send for a constable. We sent for one. He came.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the girls tell you had been done to them?</p>
               <p>Wooden. The women told us that they had used them very barbarously, and that they had lain with them by force, and threatened to murder them. They desired we would secure the men and not let them go: they were greatly afraid the men should get away. They appeared in great confusion, and cried very much. Warnett cried the most. We thought proper to secure the men. The prisoner said he would not be tied, unless we did it by force. I believe he offered to strike. He was seized by Mr. Thodey, who got him down, and we tied his hands, and then tied the other man and him together. The prisoner behaved very desperate. He said he had taken a lodging for Warnett in Purpool-lane, where she had lived seven months. He called her a cruel jade for saying he used her ill. She said she came out of place but the Tuesday before from Mr. Alexander's in Shoe-maker-row.</p>

They told us they fell into their company promiscuously; that one of them had been to my Lord Mayor for a warrant, and the other accompanied her there, and that those two men took and kept them out till that time of the night, and would not let them go home.

            . About half an hour after ten o'clock last Thursday, at night, I was with the other evidences near the Nag's Head in Hackney road, when the two girls flew to us for protection: they first asked their way to town. We asked what part of the town they were going to. They said to Holborn. We told them we were going to town. One of them catched hold of Mr. Ham, and would not let him go. They seemed very much frighted. They said they had been badly used. We went into the Nag's Head. They told us that the prisoner and Litchfield had used them both very ill in the field. We thought at first they had been some prostitues: we could nto think otherwise; but when we came to hear how they had threatened the girls lives, and how they had used them, that they had thrown Warnett into a ditch several times, and had lain with them both, an officer was sent for, who took charge of them. I was not at the examination of the men before the justice. I am a baker by trade, and obliged to be out about my business.</p>

            . I talked with her a good while before I examined her. I found she had been used extremely ill. All round the thick part of her thighs, to the size of four of my fingers, were as if she had been cut with a horse-whip. She said it was with the violence of her struggling. I examined her other parts, and found her body was inflamed and torn; that is, her private parts. I observed her linen, and saw she had been used indecently. If she had not been debauched, there would not have been what I saw. I asked her her age; she said seventeen. I said, It is very odd to me a person of your age should be in this condition. She said, That was done with his fingers. He has torn me. I have examined her since, and I found that appearance on her thighs was gone. I asked if she had drank any thing that occasioned such an inflammation. I was told she drank nothing but tea and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to have been deflowered?</p>
               <p>E. Ham. She did. I observed that all the back part of her thighs, from under her hams up towards the thick part of her hips, was all daubed with clay and dirt. I asked how that came. She said it was done, when he dragged her on the ground with violence.</p>

We had five or six pots of porter and cyder, and brandy. There was a gentleman there. I sung three or four songs. I took her round the neck and kissed her as I would my wife. She was all the same as my wife, as agreeable as if she had been my wife. Going over the fields, I remember I saw a man in the hay-cock. I said, My dear, will you sit down a bit? she said, No. Going on a little farther, running and playing with the other young woman, they fell down in the hay-cock; we played with them. I lay with her; she was rather tightish. She was as agreeable to it as I was. I never threw her into any ditch, nor never was in a ditch with her, When we came up Hackney-road, we had agreed to take a room and live together. I was for going home; but they asked us to go in and drink at the Nag's-head. We drank with them in the house. I did not observe their talking to the gentlemen before they went into the house, and when they found we would not go with them, they gave charge of us.

            . I am a slender acquaintnce of the prisoner's. I saw him on that Thursday between five and six-o'clock at the Bull-Head at Haggerstone: there was another man and the two girls with him. I was in the yard when they first came in. Then I came into the room where they were. I heard the prisoner sing. I thought it was very agreeable. He sung a good song. I took my beer and went and sat down facing him in the same box. One of the gentlewomen seemed to be found of my nosegay. I gave it her. She put me out a glass of cyder. They were very jocose together. We went into another room by ourselves to hear the ladies sing. They sang a little bit of a song, which was very agreeable. There was nothing but modesty on both sides. The girls did not appear to be there against their wills, but far from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner kiss the young women?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I did not. I was with them as near as I can guess about four hours. We had three pots of beer together. The girls went out into the yard, and when they came in again, they each of them took their place. I paid for three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280014"></xptr> pints of beer, and I believe the prisoner paid part, and the other man the rest; but I cannot be positive of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the girls pay any money?</p>
               <p>Jackson. The girls paid no money; there was no occasion for that. I settled my reckoning and went about my business. They were up at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of the girls getting on the table?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No, there was no getting on the table; there was no fear of that; there was no attempt to go away, nor no dragging.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner take his money from when he paid?</p>

            . About five o'clock, or between five and six, that afternoon, the two girls and two men were in a hay-field belonging to Mr. Bocock at Haggerstone. The prisoner was one of them. When we had made the hay-cocks up, they tumbled them about; tumbling one another on the cocks.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear the women sing?</p>
               <p>Murrel. No, I did not. I staid there I believe an hour, and came away between seven and eight o'clock. One of the women went out to make water in the yard; then she came in and called the other out; then they both came in, and sat down by the men again. They were willing to sit down and abide by the men. They were as agreeable as the men were. I could not tell whether they were not man and wife. There were twenty or thirty of us in the field. If the women had a mind to get away, they had opportunity enough; there was nobody hindered them.</p>

I was going to Rosemary Lane with a pair of breeches, on the Thursday before last, when I saw a mob before the Mansion-house. I went in there. I saw these girls. They said to me, What are those fellows here for? I said I did not know: I suppose for a robbery. After that I went to Wood-street Compter. I was up stairs eating bread and butter. Those two girls came there. Warnett asked if any body could get them any victuals. She gave me a shilling, and I went down, and into Honey-lane market, and got some, and ordered a pot of beer up; they asked the prisoner, Litchfield, and me to eat some; they both eat and drank: then the girls went down stairs, and the prisoner and Litchfield went into the tap-room; but what they had to drink I cannot say, they proposed going to drink tea somewhere. I will not say downright the girls asked the prisoner to go to White Conduit House. Then they went to an ale-house at the corner of Honey-lane market. I went and drank with them there. They appeared very agreeable there. I went away, and did not see them go out of the ale-house.</p>

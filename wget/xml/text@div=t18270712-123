I was robbed about one hundred yarns from Gravel-lane.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. I was in Ratcliff-highway, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, and followed him till he was stopped - I had lost sight of him for about half a minute; he was running first, but there were others close after him - I did not see Webb till I brought him back; when he came up he said, "This is the rascal who took my seal and key - search him;" I did so at the watch-house, but nothing was found on him; he said he was running home to Lower Chapman-street, but he was going quite a contrary way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to my sister's - a mob gathered; the gentleman had lost his seals, and was going to take me, as he said he thought I was the person.</p>

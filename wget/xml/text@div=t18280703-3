            . I am a patrol of Hackney-road. On Saturday morning, the 24th of May, about a quarter or twenty minutes after four o'clock, I and Warner were standing together, about a mile or more from Mr. Mash's - Warner said, "Here comes a lad driving a cow," and as soon as I turned I saw the prisoner; he left the cow and ran- I saw him with the cow for about two minutes; he was driving it towards us; I drew my cutlass from my side and ran after him, but he got away - we came back to the cow; a man said it belonged to Mash - we took it back; I called Mash up, leaving Warner with the cow, and while Mash was getting up Warner got the cow into Mash's field - I pointed it out, and Mash claimed it; it was the cow I had seen the prisoner driving; I had seen the prisoner before in our watch-house, and knew him - I am certain he is the man who was driving the cow; he was taken on the 16th of June.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the morning of the 24th of May I was with Smith, and saw the prisoner driving the cow - it was about half past four o'clock, as near as I can guess; he was coming towards us; I spoke to Smith, and as we went towards him to stop him he left the cow, and ran across the fields to Bethnal-green; Smith pursued him - I remained with the cow, and took it to Mash's field; Mash came in about five minutes, and claimed the same cow as I had seen the prisoner driving; it had not been out of my sight; I am positive of the prisoner's person - I had seen him before; he was about a mile or more from Mash's house.</p>

            . I am a dyer. I was at the corner of Artillery-lane, heard the cry of Stop thief, and saw a man running - I pursued him into the public-house. I only lost sight of him in turning the corner. I laid hold of him in the public-house - it was the prisoner. He said if I would go aside he would deliver it up. I saw him deliver it to the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a refiner, and live at No. 137, Goswell-street. I know the prisoners—Polack and Barnett were at my place on 11th July, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I buy metals to melt—I enter them in a book—without looking at the book, I remember what took place—they came to sell some silver spectacles and three rings—I cannot tell how many spectacles there were, but they weighed five ounces odd, and they came to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there might have been twenty pairs—they are different in weight—I gave 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce for them as old silver—I afterwards melted them, I think on the following Monday—they also brought three rings—I delivered one of them afterwards to the officer Jack<lb></lb>son—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the others are sold—I think it was 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I gave for the rings—I am a dealer besides a refiner—I knew both of those men before—this dealing took place in the shop—I think they were with me twenty minutes, at the outside—I cannot say which of them spoke, which produced the things, or which I paid.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Mills. Q. I believe you are the associate on the Oxford circuit? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in Court during the trial of the ejectment? - A. Yes; (produces the will set up by the lessor of the plaintiff); it was delivered to me by order of the Court, and I have kept it ever since for the purpose of putting the matter into a course for investigation.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in Court when the prisoner at the bar was examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the will, and look at the name of William Austin; did you hear him depose any thing relating to that will? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. State the substance of what he said upon that occasion? - A. He swore that he was present at the execution of it, at Isgar's house at Bath; that he saw it executed, and that Mr. Lewis signed it, and that he, and Isgar, and Bowden, signed it as witnesses; he described Mr. Lewis to have singularities in his person and his age; I knew the man myself, and he described the man exactly, as having a squeaking voice, and tossing his head about, a peculiar way that he had: it was a very close description of the man; he underwent a very long examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the signature of William Austin, what did he say about that? - A. That it was his writing; he said Thomas Bowden signed it; that he knew him, and he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who wrote that name of Thomas Bowden? - A. I understood him to say that Thomas Bowden himself wrote it; the third name was Joseph Isgar, and he said they were all three there, and that they all three attested the execution.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing that was said by him, relative to the 10th of August, the date of the will? - A. I remember he said, the testator himself filled up the blanks, the words tenth August, and 1791, were the hand-writing of Mr. Lewis, as well as Henry Lewis, and that the endorsement upon the cover was also his writing."The will of Henry Lewis, for Mrs. Kane, Monmouth."</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his saying any thing about another part of that will? - A. Yes; he said there were two parts, and that Mr. Lewis left one, and took the other away with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that both the parts were executed, or only the one you have in your hand? - A. I think both.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any question put to him by Lord Kenyon? - A. Yes; my Lord Kenyon asked him whether it was sealed in their presence, whether the wax was put to it in their presence, and whether it was sealed with wax? and he said, yes, it was sealed with wax, with a candle; upon which my Lord Kenyon turned to the Jury, and said, it was sealed with a wafer.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Mr. Lewis? - A. A clergyman, a very honourable and respectable man, a man of property; he was a very shy man, a man of great nicety, a man of honour, and rather an odd man.</p>
               <p>Q. Were his habits of life with those of his own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110072"></xptr>rank, or persons of lower rank? - A. With persons of his own rank.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not in the habit of associating with persons in the situation of the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. With respect to this candle and the wax, of course you don't mean to speak to every thing that passed minutely? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he believed it was sealed with wax? - A. He said it was sealed with wax.</p>
               <p>Q. And that he believed there was a candle? - A. I cannot speak to the particular expression.</p>

            ? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the copy of the record, did you examine it with the record? - A. I did; it is a true copy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Q. Had you been acquainted with Mr. Lewis long and intimately? - A. I have been concerned for him in business about seven years as his attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you likewise attended the trial at Hereford, and was examined as a witness? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar being examined as a witness? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the substance of his evidence? - A. Lord Kenyon put a question to him, what was done with the candle? the prisoner said, that it was made use of to seal the will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lord Kenyon put any other question? - A. He asked whether he saw the will sealed? he said, yes; that it was sealed with wax, and that they made use of the candle for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether he stated at what time of day the will was executed? - A. I don't recollect; he said it was at Isgar's house, but I cannot recollect what time in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether it was stated by the witness to be day-light or candle-light? - A. Daylight.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he say whether it was executed on the day of the date? - A. No; he said, the reason why it was dated the 10th was, that the blank was not long enough to fill in a longer date.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whether he disclosed the day? - A. Yes, he did; and said, positively, it was executed between the 20th and 27th of August, 1791.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state whether the other witnesses attested it or not? - A. Yes; he said, they were all there; and that they all signed it in each other's presence, and in the presence of the testator.</p>
               <p>Q. During your acquaintance with Mr. Lewis, had you any conversation with him upon the subject of a will? - A. Yes; I was in London with him in the year 1789, to attend the hearing of a cause upon a bill filled by him, to set aside his mother's will; he was taken ill at Peele's coffee-house: while he was writing a letter, he fell in a sit, and I thought that a proper opportunity to hint to him, that it was sit that he should settle his own affairs; he said, that he never had, and he never would, the law should make his will; this was in the year 1789. In the year 1791, I believe, in the summer, I was applied to on behalf of a poor relation of his, a Mrs. Harman, who is one of the paternal heirs, in order to prevail upon him to relieve her distress; I gave the letter that I received from her to Mr. Lewis; Mr. Lewis, at that time, was a little embarrassed in circumstances, his answer was to me, Mr. Stokes, she must wait till I am dead, when she will have all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, at that time, any conversation with him upon the subject of a will? - A. I don't recollect whether I had at that time. In the month of October, 1793. I received a writ from Mr. Jacobs, of Bristol, against Mr. Lewis, in order to hold him to bail, upon a debt of between forty and fifty pounds; I saw Mr. Lewis upon the subject; and on the 22d of October 1793, he dined at my house, and a conversation then again ensued between him and me, respecting his affairs; he then again said, he had not made his will, he never would make a will, the law should make his will; I can speak with certainty to the day, from the bail-bond. At other times I have heard him say precisely the same, frequently; and his aversion to making a will arose from the reasons he gave me, respecting his mother's will; he had had a very expensive suit about his mother's will, he had tried two ejectments upon it, and one suit in Chancery.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you frequent opportunities of seeing him write? - A. Many times.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are perfectly conversant with his hand-writing? - A. Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Q. Do you believe that

             to be his hand-writing? - A. I do not; I am positive it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the words "tenth of August," and"1791," and tell me if you believe them to be the hand-writing of Mr. Lewis? - A. I believe it not to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any word of that will, or in, or about it, that appears to be his hand-writing, or a figure? - A. Not one.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that cover; do you believe that direction to be his hand-writing? - A. Not a bit of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these Henry Lewis's written there,(the paper found at Holland's house), see if you believe any of them to be Mr. Lewis's hand-writing? - A. Not one; the first appears a closer imitation of Mr. Lewis's hand-writing than any of the others.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what passed at the trial at Hereford, the prisoner, and Isgar, were committed?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110073"></xptr>- A. They escaped from the Court, and were afterwards apprehended; Austin, Isgar, and Sir John Briggs, were all in Court; Lord Kenyon asked for Sir John, but he was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he live? - A. At Skinfreth, in the county of Monmouth; I am impropriator of the parish; I recollect his coming at that time to me to agree for the tithes; he was a stranger then; he came, I understand, from Devonshire.</p>
               <p>Q. You attended the search at Mr. Crossley's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Mr. Crossley to do in the cause? - A. He did not appear at Hereford at all; people of character, at Monmouth, were concerned on that side.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Mr. Crossley's to search his house? - A. Yes; he had been apprehended before.</p>
               <p>Q. When? - A. On the 7th of October last.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any papers there? - A. Yes,(produces them), these; which purport to be letters from Mr. Clarke to Mr. Crossley, I found in the desk; and this cover of a letter I found upon his desk;(producing it); which cover had the Hereford postmark. I asked him for the contents of it; he said, he knew nothing of it, it had been destroyed; I thought it my duty to persist in the search, and he opened a private drawer, of which he had the key, and in searching the drawer, he kept under his hand two small papers; I asked him frequently for the papers, and at last he gave me this paper, (producing it); it is a letter from Austin to Mr. Crossley.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when Austin was searched? - A. No; a man of the name of

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. If I understand you right, my Lord Kenyon asked the prisoner, after the examination of the Counsel, what was done with the candle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that his Lordship first suggested the idea of a candle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you have seen the execution of a great many instruments, deeds, and so forth? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Perhaps you are aware that these things are more commonly executed with wax than wafers? - A. I have seen them both ways.</p>
               <p>Q. In your practice, which is the most general? - A. Wax.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that it was stated there was not room for a longer word than tenth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking at the will, in point of fact, is there room for a longer word? - A. There is not.</p>

               <p>Q. The same ink with the signature of Henry Lewis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, in 1791, you were applied to by Mrs. Harman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She was in very necessitous circumstances? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Lewis said, she must wait till I am dead, and then she will have all? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, I believe, part of the estate goes to the maternal heir, and part to the paternal heir? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in point of fact, it don't all come to her? - A. Mr. Lewis suffered a recovery, or else she would have had all.</p>
               <p>Q. In 1789, he declared he would make no will? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not die till 1795? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had time to alter his mind, as he certainly did, with respect to the lady having all? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the hand-writing, I suppose, all you mean to state is, that, to the best of your knowledge, it is not his hand-writing? - A. Upon my oath, I believe it is not; I believe I have seen him write a thousand times; I have five or six quires of paper of Mr. Lewis's writing by me.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with Mr. Lewis the deceased, the testator? - A. Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. Are you at all related to him? - A. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. You were intimately acquainted with him? - A. Yes, for several years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever, at any time, hear him make any declarations respecting his making, or not making a will? - A. I have heard him several times declare, that it was his intention not to make a will.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you charge your memory to any length of time, before he died, with any declaration of that sort? - A. As near as I can recollect, the last time I heard him, was within two years of his death we were always upon perfect terms of friendship, but not with the intimacy that we used to be, because he has been in our house for a fortnight together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him, at any time, make a declaration, or not, that his mind was at all,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110074"></xptr>changed from what he had expressed to you before? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. You don't bring these declarations nearer than two years before the death of Mr. Lewis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had not been so intimate within those two years, with Mr. Lewis, as before? - A. I did not so frequently see him; but we were on the same intimacy.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you a memorandum-book of Mr. Lewis's? - A. Yes; it was found by me, among his papers; it is a book in which he kept an account of payments to his servants employed in husbandry, at his house at Hygga; I received a great number of Mr. Lewis's papers after his death, for his heirs at law, which I searched, after the will was brought, by Isgar, to Monmouth, and given to Mrs. Kane, to endeavour to find the second part, or to find any memorandum of Mr. Lewis's noticing where he was upon the 10th of August, 1791; and I found this book, with this memorandum, in the handwriting of Mr. Lewis; I had it in a trunk with other papers which I received from Mr. Jenkins, a clergyman, in Devonshire; the second copy of the will was not found among those papers which came to my hands. (Reads) "August 10th, 1791."Paid her (meaning Mrs. Elizabeth Perry, whose name appears at the top of the page) 19s." Nor was there any letter, or correspondence, whatever, from Isgar to Mr. Lewis. The reason why I was minute in the search was, that that will was put into my hands by Mrs. Kane and Sir

               <p>Q. Have you, since that time, discovered any such duplicate, or any trace of such a duplicate? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you discovered any trace of a correspondence between Isgar and Mr. Lewis upon the subject of a will? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at this book; whose hand-writing are those entries? - A. Mr. Lewis's; it is his pocket-book, Baldwin's Journal for the year 1791.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find any entry in that book of the 10th of August? - A. Wednesday, the 10th of August, is an entry of Mr. Lewis: "Paid for a"quarter of mutton, and peas and beans, 5s." He kept a house at Hygga, at that time, and no where else. (Reads.) "Saturday, the 7th of August.(in the hand-writing of Mr. Lewis) "Paid Eliza-"beth Jones, for her attendance as a witness at two"commissions, 7s. 6d. Received for 10lb. of but-"ter, 6s. 8d. paid for candles, out of the same,"41/2d."</p>
               <p>Q. What distance is Hygga from Bath? - A. Thirty-five miles; the journey is difficult and tedious, by the Severn intervening. I received this pocket-book, since Christmas, from Mr. Williams, the attorney for the plaintiffs, in the ejectment, which is since the trial at Hereford.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there are blanks between the 22d and 27th day of August? - A. All the days are blank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. In the first book you produced, I think there is no entry in the month of August, 1791, after the 10th? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. In this latter book there is no entry between the 22d and 27th? - A. No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you concerned for Mr. Lewis? - A. Two or three years.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110075"></xptr>Q. The last two years of his life? - A. No, up to the year 1793; I think, for the last year and a half, he was not at Monmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Stokes was his confidential attorney before that? - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. And from that time he chose to employ you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, the superscription upon the letter was less like his hand-writing than the signature to the will; then the signature to the will is more like his hand-writing than the superscription upon the letter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say that you have any doubt about it? - A. No; but very reputable gentlemen have thought otherwise; it appears to me, upon a close inspection, to be an imitated hand, with a pen drawn over every stroke more than once, the letters are jagged.

               <p>Q. Is that the one you gave to Mr. Stokes? - A. Yes, here is my name upon it; there was a bill with it; this appears to be the bill, but the letter I put my name upon.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect what month this was in? - A. I believe it was in April; he asked me, if I knew one George Crossley, and if me and Austin would go to London with him; I replied, if he would pay the expence, we would go; he saw Austin and me together afterwards; he gave Austin two guineas, and me two guineas to come to town; Sir John Briggs told Austin he was to go with me to have a fresh will executed.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did you go up to London or not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Holland and Austin together? - A. Yes, previous to that time; I believe that paper was brought by him at that time, I am not quite sure; Austin was to have 100l. for putting his name to the will of

               <p>Q. Should you know that note if you saw it again? - A. Certainly, I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that note before, (shewing it to him)? - A. Yes; I saw it written by Mr. Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the note again, and tell me if it is in the same state in which it was, when it was given to Austin? - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether those words were interlined at the time? - A. Yes; there was an objection made by Mr. Austin, respecting the bearer, in consequence of that, the name of James Smith was put in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing with respect to the date of the year? - A. I believe the date was put then as it stands now; it was 5, and turned into a 4 at the time. I was by when it was wrote.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was it altered? - A. Because it was dated a wrong date.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, you went up to London? - A. Yes; on Saturday the 25th of April, between five and six in the morning, and arrived in London, on Sunday morning about ten; we came as far as Newbury, and there I lost my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to in London? - A. I went to Mr. Noad's, in St. Martin's lane; Austin, I believe, got down at the White Horse cellar; I staid in London seven or eight days; Austin came there the same Sunday while I was gone to Mr. Crossley's; after dinner he came again, and I saw him; he staid a little while, and then he and I went both to Mr. Crossley's together, about six or seven o'clock in the afternoon, to the Adelphi, at the request of Sir

               <p>Q. There were two papers brought? - A. Yes; Mr. Crossley kept the other; after they were signed, they were taken into the other room; the next day I called, and saw one in Mr. Crossley's possession; the other was put up in my presence in a case, directed to Mrs. Kane, and delivered to me, and I carried it to Monmouth; the other was left with Mr. Crossley; Edwards was with me when I carried it from Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. After you left Mr. Crossley's house that evening, what became of you and Austin? - A. We went back to Mr. Noad's, and I believe he went out with some friends, and went home the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. You staid longer? - A. Yes, there was an attachment against me; I staid to put in bail; Mr. Crossley got me an attorney of the name of Price; I never spoke to him to do it.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Have you been served with a process in consequence of an indictment for perjury? - A. I have not; they might have found ten bills upon the evidence of Mr. Crossley, and such people as he may bring forward.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. You swore the same then, however that you do now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And both these in the teeth of what you had sworn to at Hereford? - A. Yes; I was compelled to do that; Mr. Crossley arrested me, and put me in a lock-up house in London; he pretended I was doing all right and deceived me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know that you were doing wrong? - A. I did not know that I was swore to it, or else I would have seen him further; I have got a soul to be saved I hope as well as you, and I will speak the truth for all you, or any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see Sir John Briggs, at Mr. Crossley's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This letter produced is dated the 29th of September; you were then in gaol at Hereford? - A. I saw the letter before it was sent.</p>
               <p>Q. You were then in Hereford gaol? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And so was Austin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were in considerable distress both of you at that time? - A. I don't say but I was.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if that letter was written by Austin, it was written under the pressure of great distress? - A. It might be so; I don't know but it was.(Stephen Bataille was called in, but did not appear).</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any belief about it; have you seen any person write like that? - A. I do not recollect that I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at it again? - A. I really don't know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Porties? - A. Yes; clerk to Mr. Crossley, a deaf man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he clerk to Mr. Crossley in April, 1795? - A. I seldom went to Mr. Crossley's house for some years past; I have seen him there very often at a desk, but being short-sighted, I could not see very well his writing.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember giving Mr. Porties's any money in behalf of Mr. Crossley? - A. Yes; in November last.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of November? - A. I have got the draft here for it, (producing it); it is a draft of Mr. Frasi's, his nephew; I gave this to Mr. Porties at my house, 9l. upon account of Mr. Crossley; there were twenty-four guineas left in my hands, after his goods were sold, and I gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Mr. Porties to-day? - A. I have not seen him since that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Up to that time, do you know whether he was living at Mr. Crossley's? - A. I should imagine that he was; I don't know that he was, because I very seldom went to his house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You know I will have a direct answer; how late have you known him to live with Mr. Crossley? - A. He was with him when I paid him that money in November.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that hand-writing, and tell me if you know that? - A. I cannot say, unless it is Frasi's.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Bataille to-day? - A. Yes; about half an hour ago, in the other room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what is become of him? - A. No; I have been looking for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body speak to him? - A. No, only my clerk; I desired my clerk to keep him company; he is here, his name is Stockdale.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at the will again; can you or not form any judgment whose hand-writing that is? - A. I really cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see him write? - A. Yes; frequently.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. What are you? - A. An attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. This appears to me to be rather a common hand? - A. I have no doubt, in my own mind, as to his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. But it appears rather a common hand? - A. It is a clerk-like hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Such a hand as attorney's clerks usually write? - A. Yes; it appears so. It is the character of his writing; I have no doubt but it is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Adair. Q. He wrote for you, and you know his characters well? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Why have you been out of the way? - A. I have been speaking to some people, and taking something for my refreshment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mills. Q. Were you, in the beginning of 1795, in the employment of Mr. Crossley? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of a man of the name of Porties? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He went by the name of Day, I believe, besides? - A. I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had opportunities of seeing him write? - A. Yes; he used to give me his sheets of paper when he was writing a brief, for me to make another copy.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that paper carefully, (the will); whose hand-writing do you believe that to be? - A. Porties's; except the names that I see here; and I don't think he had any thing to do with either of the names.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, the latter end of April, the 26th, on a Sunday, being at Mr. Crossley's houses? - A. Yes; I went there about eleven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there? - A. John Upsall, and John Porties; Upsall was dressing himself, and cleaning himself; and John Porties was going to clean himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Crossley there at any time that morning? - A. I did not see him till half an hour, or three quarters, after my arrival there, and then he came into the office.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came into the office who was there? - A. Myself and Porties.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any body coming to the house, and being with Mr. Crossley in the room? - A. I don't remember any thing of any body being in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Crossley in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the servant-maid at that time? - A. There was a servant-girl, her name is Hannah.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Hannah there at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you dine at Mr. Crossley's house that day? - A. Yes; in the back dining-room, with Mrs. Crossley and porties.</p>
               <p>Q. Who dined in the front parlour? - A. There was a gentleman there, and Mr. Crossley, dining together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the dinner that you had brought from Mr. Crossley's table, or served up fresh? - A. It was brought from the front to the back dining-room to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body eaten of it before it was brought? - A. Yes; Mrs. Crossley was uneasy about its being so long.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know who it was that was there? - A. No; I heard, when I was at dinner, that it was Sir John Briggs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, after dinner, any body coming to the house; or in the course of the afternoon? - A. I remember somebody in the evening, when it was quite dark, coming to the door; I opened the door, and it was a person I don't know but by his face, that I have seen at Mr. Crossley's.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know him if you were to see him again? - A. Yes; I have heard his name since is Isgar; he came to the house about eight o'clock, there was a person came with him, but I could not see who it was because there was no light in the passage, it was a person from Bath; I told Mr. Crossley that the fat man from Bath was come to speak to him, with another man, and I did not know what business they came about, and then I went into the kitchen; Mrs. Crossley was gone out, and had left no lights out for the office.</p>

            Then, when you went into the kitchen, where did these men go to? - A. They went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the kitchen when you went there? - A. There was the maid there, Hannah.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Crossley again that evening? - A. Yes. Hannah gave me a bason of tea; Mr. Crossley came to me about ten o'clock, and gave me two guineas to go and take a place in the Bristol-stage, or the Bristol-mail; and I was to ask at an adjoining coffee-house for a bed for a gentleman. I took the two guineas, and the book-keeper was out; I went to the coffee-house, and spoke to the waiter, and he called the chamber-maid, and she said, there was plenty of beds; I went back, and Mr. Crossley let me in, and I returned the two guineas to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any gentleman with Mr. Crossley after you gave him the two guineas? - A. Yes; they went out of the house about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing Porties that evening? - A. Yes; he left the house about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how Porties was employed between six and ten? - A. I was sent, at six o'clock, for a two shilling stamp, by Mr. Crossley, and I could not get one, because it was Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Porties employed about in the afternoon? - A. He was in the office with me; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110080"></xptr>he had orders from Mr. Crossley not to leave the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Upsall again that evening? - A. I did not see him, but after Mr. Crossley and the gentleman that was in the front parlour were gone, between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing that brings it to your memory that he returned at that time? - A. We had something to eat; the servant-maid was there, and I advised Upsall to go to bed, that his aunt might not see him in a state of intoxication.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the 26th of April; do you remember any thing about a hat? - A. I cannot positively recollect; I went to Mr. Parker's, and got a stamp, I went to Mr. Crossley's house with the stamp, I went to knock at the door, I used to go into his office without knocking at the door, I went that day and the door was fastened, and so Mr. Crossley came out of the front dining-room and opened the door, and I gave him the stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door so much open as to give you an opportunity of seeing who was in the room? - A. No; I did not see any body in the room. The next morning I went into the room, and Mr. Upsall and Frast, and Mr. Crossley, were there; and there was no ink-stand in the office at all, Mr. Crossley told me they were up stairs; I went into the front dining-room for an ink-stand, there was a smell in it that I could not tell what it was; and Upsall said, there had been some stuff put into it to make writing appear old.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know yourself what that smell was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try the ink, and use it? - A. No; I did not take any notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a man of the name of Holland? - A. I never knew Mr. Holland but through Mr. Crossley; I never saw him but two or three times in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the will again; you have said, that will is written by Porties; have you any knowledge when he wrote it? - A. I did not see him write it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the first time you have seen it? - A. No; I have seen it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a will of that sort in Porties's hand-writing, in Mr. Crossley's possession? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. That appears to be rather a common hand-writing, such as attorney's clerks usually write - there is nothing very particular in the hand? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen a great deal of the hand-writing of clerks of attorney's? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. This transaction that you have been speaking of, so minutely, was in April, 1795, was it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upwards of a year ago? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, possibly, this might have happened on Sunday the 19th of April? - A. I don't know any thing about that; I am speaking the truth. I know it was Sunday the 26th, because I have read the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. It is because you have read the sessions-paper then, that you say this happened on Sunday the 26th? - A. I know I was at Mr. Crossley's on Sunday the 26th; and when I read the trial I recollected all the circumstances that I have told you.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you remember that this was Sunday the 26th of April? - A. Because I never in my life staid so long in his house as that day.</p>
               <p>Q. But might not that Sunday, when you staid so late at Mr. Crossley's, be the 19th instead of the 26th? - A. No; it was the 26th.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you say it is the 26th from what you have read in the trial, or because you remember the circumstances? - A. I know it was the 26th; and I am very sorry I have lost a book in which I had my memorandums all the time that I was clerk to Mr. Crossley.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you refreshed your memory by reading the trial? - A. I did not think any thing about it till after the trial of Mr. Crossley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you conclude that it was the 26th by reading that trial? - A. You misunderstand me.</p>
               <p>Q. You never thought of this business till after Mr. Crossley's trial? - A. I did not think that Mr. Crossley was guilty of any such thing till after his trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think of this Sunday, the 26th of April, before Mr. Crossley's trial? - A. The 26th of April I have told you what I know; I am a foreigner, and I wish to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. And I want to know how, or why, you remember this particular Sunday? - A. Because I have never been so busy on any Sunday so long as I have been in the house, except that Sunday.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure that the day of the month that you were so busy on were the 26th of April? - A. Yes; I remember it perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you recollected that you were busy on that day before you read the trial? - A. No; I never thought of it.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How came you to think of it when you read the trial? - A. Because, when I see all that was in the paper, they were circumstances that I could have that knowledge of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Has there been any quarrel between you and Mr. Crossley? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care what you say; were not you in his debt? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Never in his debt? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He never claimed any debt by a fancied execution? - A. No; never against me.</p>
               <p>Q. There has been no misunderstanding between you and Mr. Crossley? - A. No; I never had any misunderstanding with Mr. Crossley.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110081"></xptr>Mr. Mills. Q. You have been out of the way for some time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at the instigation of any body, or of your own account? - A. It was because I have endorsed bills for Mr. Crossley; and Mr. Crossley's name nor being upon them, he desired me to keep out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. During what period of time was it that you were desired, by him, to keep out of the way? - A. About the end of August last.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you absent yourself? - A. Till after Mr. Crossley was acquitted.(John Porties was again called upon his subpoena, but did not appear).</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Isgar coming to your house? - A. Yes, on a Sunday morning, and I think it was the 26th of April; he left town the first of May, which was the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the first of May? - A. Because he had some business with one Akerman, and he told me to be sure he had the right day down in his pocket-book, and I reached him the almanack.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come with him? - A. No; he said, there was a Bath boy come up, and he expected him presently; and he afterwards came, and slept at my house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, during their stay at your house, see Mr. Croseley with them? - A. With Isgar frequently; I never saw him with Austin; nor I never saw them all together.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them left town first? - A. I don't know whether he slept at my house one night, or two; but he left my house before Isgar.</p>
               <p>Q. They both slept at your house on the Sunday night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they go to bed? - A. In very good time; by eleven o'clock I am sure they were.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they go out? - A. I cannot say; they were in and out several times.</p>

               <p>Q. Then we see how accurate you are as to dates, for if Sunday was the 26th, Saturday could not be the 1st of May? - A. It was according to the almanack.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was Sunday the 26th? - A. Because he went away the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was the 1st of May? - A. Yes; I saw Akerman enter it is his book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Q. Whatever the day of the month might be are you sure it was the Saturday following the Sunday? - A. Yes; only a week intervening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Had you seen Austin often? - A. No; I never had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never seen him before this Sunday? - A. I believe I did see him once before, but I cannot say that I should know the person again; but I saw him on that Sunday, and likewise at Hereford.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Dauncey. Q. Do you know Isgar? - A. Yes; I went with him from Bath to Monmouth, on the 5th of May, 1795.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the business on which Isgar went? - A. I did not know till we were half way there; he said, at a public-house that we were at, that he was going to carry a will there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he carry any thing? - A. He did, he shewed me something like a letter, but what was inside, I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the direction? - A. Yes, to Mrs. Kane, Monmouth; when we got there he enquired for Mrs. Kane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body call upon him at the inn at Monmouth? - A. Yes, a woman; she said her mother wanted to speak with us, and therefore I thought it was Mrs. Kane's daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at Monmouth? - A. Till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go away together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. This paper that you talk about, you never had in your possession? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time? - A. About ten or eleven o'clock at night, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see distinctly what was upon it, could you? - A. Yes, I did, it was in the shape of a letter, and I saw it was directed Mrs. Kane, I was close to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he show it to other people? - A. Yes; and told them it was Mr. Lewis's will.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner Austin being in gaol at the same time? - A. Yes; he came in some time after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever remember hearing him say any thing about Isgar? - A. Yes; I heard him say that he had two guineas sent him to carry him up to London with Isgar, and Isgar had two guineas at the same time; and I cannot say whether it was after or before, but there came a man in that gave them a guinea a-piece. Isgar and Austin; and when they had received this money, I said to Austin, you have met with a friend; yes, said he, and so has Isgar; I said, Mr. Austin, "I don't find you have any occasion to fear, as Isgar says, he can free you;" Austin said, "he cannot free me; I can free him, for I can prove him not writing any name but his own name, and he cannot do so for me."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more to you? - A. No;

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. How long had you been in gaol? - A. I came in, in March, 1795.</p>
               <p>Q. So they made a full confession before you? - A. No more than this, in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. They confessed the whole before you? - A. They confessed so much.</p>
               <p>Q. They talked together without the least reserve? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much are you to get for this piece of business? - A. I suppose all my trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. You have made no bargain about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the gentleman was that gave them the guinea a piece? - A. No; it was a poorish man that brought it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in goal before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you write? - A. Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say, or write to any body, that you were hired to do this piece of service? - A. No; I never was.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor have never said you were, nor wrote that you were? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Not that you know of; you must know whether you wrote it or no? - A. Yes; Mr. Austin desired me to write a line to Mr. Crossley, that he had never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you never say that you were to be well paid for this piece of service? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. But if you have, you must know it? - A. I might have said it, if I have been intoxicated; I believe I never did say so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Adair. Q. They got you to write something or other to Mr. Crossley? - A. Yes, to tell Mr. Crossley that he had never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever made drunk by any of these people? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Did you never say any thing about a suit of cloaths? - A. No; that was Austin said it, and laid it upon me; he said, he was to have a new suit of cloaths and 10l. and half a guinea a day, because Austin had proposed to turn King's evidence, and Isgar got the place before him.(The will read).(The paper found at Holland's read). See Trial of Crossley, page 372.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. My Lord, we wished to have that read, to shew that the devises are similar, but the dates differ, this being dated the 27th of July, 1791.(The note found in Austin's hat read.) See Crossley's Trial, page 372.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. You have known the witness Isgar some time? - A. About thirty years?</p>
               <p>Q. You have known him during the whole of that time not to be the best of characters? - A. His general character was tolerably fair till very lately.</p>
               <p>Q. He has been in different walks of life? - A. Yes; he was some time in London.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They are asking you as to Isgar's character.</p>
               <p>Witness. I beg your pardon, I have known Isgar but four years, I never heard a worse character; I have known Austin 30 years; his character has been tolerably fair till this affair happened, or till within a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>DEAN called in again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Have you known Isgar long? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know any good of him? - A. Yes, I have known him do a great deal of business, and used to be a very honest man one time.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of business? - A. He was a baker, and then a sheriff's officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a sheriff's officer yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you examined once in a cause at Taunton? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know him to be a good character, perhaps? - A. I have had a good deal of faith in him, for he owes me 2 or 300l. at this time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I was quite unprepared for trial; if your Lordship will give me leave, I will read my defence (reads). The crime I am charged with is a sufficient apology for want of ability to state my defence. The evidence of Isgar is totally false; it is true I did not know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110083"></xptr>the testator, but Isgar got me to subscribe as a witness; I saw it signed by a person assuming the name of Henry Lewis; it was done at Bath, in August, 1791, the day it bears date; Bowden wrote that name himself; all that story Isgar has related to the contrary is totally false.

            , Mr. Crossley, and Mr. Clarke, I never saw Sir John but once before the Hereford assizes, after I had been with the will at Monmouth; Mr. Crossley I did not see till he was brought to goal; I witnessed the will at Bath, and not in London; one of my witnesses is in Wales, but the Court, in their justice, thought proper to bring on the trial, a Mr. Harrison, who refused to witness the will, because he did not know the testator; from these circumstances, and the cause being called on at the time, I am unprepared with the means of retaining those gentlemen at the bar that are necessary for my defence. Under all these disadvantages I stand at this bar; and whatever my sate may be, I am entirely innocent of the fact charged against me; in August 1701, I used to go frequently backwards and forwards to Isgar's house for money, and there was one Bowden sitting in the chair: I asked for Isgar; he said he was in his office; upon that Isgar opened the door immediately; now, says he, Mr. Austin and Mr. Bowden will you walk in; he said, gentlemen, we want you to sign a will; I said, is it a will, and Bowden said, aye, boy, that is right, let us see if it is a will; I was opened, and we read about two lines of it; I had asked the gentleman if his name was Henry Lewis, he said it was, and when he came to sign the day of the month, there was not room, and the gentleman said it was no odds, I will interline it, and Isgar said that would not look well in a will, and he put down the tenth, and I never heard any more of it till about a fortnight before I was subpoenaed to the trial.(The prisoner called the following witnesses, who deposed to the same points to which they deposed on the trial of Mr. Crossley, see page 379, &amp;c.

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the month? - A. No; it was while we were in winter quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing particular pass between you and Mr. Lewis, at that time? - A. Yes; captain Rudder, of the Monmouth militia, desired me to go to see him at Honiton, which at his desire I did; he asked me to sup with him, with Mr. Price our quarter-master now, which I declined, in consequence of having the command of near an hundred men; I met Mr. Lewis at a public-house, at Honiton, I don't know the sign, it was head-quarters; he asked me how I was, and when I had heard from my relations, I told him, not a long time; he told me, he had heard that I was going to be married, and he thought improperly, and begged me not to do it; I told him that I was determined; he said, if I would not marry, he would alter his will in favour of me; he said, I should reap the benefit of it immediately, or something of that kind; he paid me two or three other compliments, which it is not necessary for me to mention.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about your father and mother? - A. He asked how my mother was particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about their death? - A. Yes; he said it was improper for me to marry, because I should have a title, and he did not doubt I should have a fortune enough to support that title, and desired me not to marry for that reason, as my friends at present were in confined circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state to you how you were to become a man of fortune? - A. No; I understood from him, that he would alter his will in my favour; a great deal more passed that has escaped my memory, and I mentioned this to five gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Daunrey. Q. You are not in the army now? - A. I am a half-pay officer.</p>

            , who was called upon that trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to give evidence about some shoes your father brought from Monmouth for your sister, did he bring his books up with him? - A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell him it was not material, that he should produce his books? - A. I told him it was not necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. For what reason did you tell him that? - A. I had no particular reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the books? - A. I called upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110084"></xptr>him at Monmouth, as one of my father's tradesmen, to enquire whether he had been there on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first know, that the 26th of April was a material day to enquire about? - A. On or about that day, I thought from information I got.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom had you that information? - A. From a friend of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that friend? - A. Mr. Crossley; I look upon Mr. Crossley as a friend, because he was so far connected in this business.</p>
               <p>Q. What connection had Mr. Crossley with this business? - A. I thought, by the acquittal of Mr. Crossley, he had proved his innocence.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you first acquainted with Mr. Crossley? - A. I believe it is near a twelve-month now; it was after the Hereford assizes.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you had better spare the examination of this young man as much as you can.</p>

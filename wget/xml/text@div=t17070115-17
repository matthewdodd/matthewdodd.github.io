The Prisoner, in his Defence, brought divers Witnesses to prove that the Deceased fell upon the Prisoner first, knockt him down, beat Teeth out of his head, wounded him in the Face, before the Prisoner struck him. The Surgeon, Doctor and Apothecary that open'd and examin'd the Body of the Deceas'd, deposed that his Death could not be caused from any Wound that had been given him, but from a very ill Habit of Body, and that there was not the least sign of any Bruise. The Prisoner produced divers who deposed, that they knew the Deceased to spit great quantities of Blood for several years before this matter happen'd. Abundance of Witnesses were called to his Reputation, who gave him the Character of a very honest Man. The Jury considering the whole matter <rs id="t17070115-17-verdict84" type="verdictDescription">

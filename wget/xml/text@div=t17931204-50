               <p>I am a servant to my brother. On the 10th of November, about eight in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came into the coffee room at the George in Aldermanbury, he placed himself down in one of the boxes for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, where this great coat was laying on the box; I see him take hold of the coat to put it underneath his own coat, two or three minutes afterwards, after the coat was lost out of sight, he came out of the coffee room, I watched him, and he attempted to go out of doors, I saw part of the great coat hanging down under his own, he had a great coat on, I stepped up to him and took him by the collar and said, halloo, where are you going with that great coat? The prisoner replied, I have got no great coat; immediately as I took him by the collar he dropped the great coat from behind, I sent for a constable and took him into a back parlour and had him searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took up the coat? - I did, and delivered it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this a woollen cloth coat? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are brother to the person that keeps the inn? - I am.</p>

               <p>I was not in the coffee-house at the time; I was there in the morning, but I went away, and left the great coat; I was not there at the time the prisoner was there. This is the coat I left there. I know it by the buttons, size, and pockets; I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came to this gentleman's house on the 10th of last month, which was the Sunday, I came into the coffee-room, and called for a glass of rum and water; I stayed there some time, I cannot recollect the time, about twenty minutes after I called for the rum and water, and paid for it, at the same time as I was sitting in the box; before I went, I took the coat which laid on the table; I had my own on at the same time; at that time I was rather intoxicated, and did not know myself very well; I took the coat, and went as far as the door of the coffee-room, where I was stopped, there I found I had my own coat on; and Mr. Clarke took the coat away from me out of my hand; I was so giddy at the time, I could scarcely recollect who stopped me; then I immediately delivered the coat, according to what they took from me, and said nothing at all, as I found I had got my own on, I recollected that I made a mistake; for my intentions were not to have taken away the coat, I assure you, it was through mistake and intoxication, that I had that misfortune.</p>

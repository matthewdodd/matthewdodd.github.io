               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take any lodging at your house - A. Yes, about four months ago she took a two pair of stairs room weekly of me; she was to pay three shillings and sixpence a week; she paid me regular for six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come to you as a single woman - A. The prisoner first came about the room; she said there was another woman, and they would pay the rent between them. The room was furnished when she took it. There was sheets and blankets as part of the furniture, a pail, and a flat iron. The other woman left the room first, and when the prisoner left the room there was a fortnight's rent going on. After she had left the room I went into the room; I missed a sheet, a blanket, a pail, and a flat iron. In about a month afterwards I saw the prisoner; I asked her what she had done with the things that she had taken out of my room. She said she had not taken them; it was the other woman that had taken them. I told her she was the person that took the room, and I should look to her for them. The prisoner was a civil good sort of a woman. The other woman that was with her abused me very much, or else I should not have done what I have.</p>

I am turned thirteen years of age, and am the daughter of the prisoner—I live with her, at 4, City Gardens—my mother had a baby, nine months old, named Edward—she fed it at the breast—she was not a sober woman—she was sometimes drunk—very often, a good many times a week—she would go out to drink, and drink in the house, too—when she went out she left the baby at home, only my little brothers and sisters had the care of it; the oldest is turned nine, and the other turned seven—while she was away it did not get anything to eat—she would remain away all the morning, from about 9 till dinner time, 1 o'clock—I was not at home—I used to go over very often—I only lived on the other side of the way—I used to see her go out and come home—she used to go out again in the afternoon, and stay about three hours, and then she very often came back drunk—I have seen her feed the baby a little when she came back, with her breast—I don't know why she only gave it a little—she took it away—the baby used to cry a good deal when she was away—sometimes I have seen it lay on my sister's arm, and sometimes in my bro<lb></lb>ther's arms, crying—I saw no milk or sop, or any kind of food—I have seen</p>

I am the wife of James Scope, of 4, City Gardens—I have known the prisoner about four years, and I knew the dead child; I saw it after it was dead—I never saw the prisoner ill-use it—she used to go out and leave it with the little ones, sometimes for two or three hours, just as it happened, not always alike—sometimes I have seen her come home in drink, a great many times—she is very much given to drink—I very seldom went up stairs; I have gone up sometimes, when I heard her beat the chil<lb></lb>dren, to take their parts—she was very cruel to them—I never saw her hit the baby—I have seen the baby lying on the floor, when I have by chance gone in—I have heard it crying; it was very ill a little time before the prisoner went away; it could not cry then; it was too ill to cry—it had measles—I think it was too ill to cry, about a week or a fortnight before the mother left it; it was in that time that I found it lying on the floor—it was not warmly dressed—it had nothing on but a little frock and petticoat, no flannel, or anything of the kind, when I took it to the workhouse—there were other children in the room at the time I saw it lying on the floor—I never saw the prisoner feed the baby.</p>

I was at the Islington Police Station, on Tuesday, 1st September, when the child was brought there by Mrs. Scope—it was very much emaciated—I accompanied her with it to the workhouse, and then went to 4, City Garden Row, where I found the prisoner, drunk—she was in the room of a lodger—I found four other children there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The baby was very ill from the first About the latter end of June it had a sudden attack of diarrhoea. I had not the means of paying a doctor. I got an order from the Islington Workhouse, for the parish doctor, Mr. Turner; he attended it for several weeks. The child was very much reduced by the diarrhoea, because it would not keep anything, even the milk from the breast, on its stomach. It was getting a little better, and then the other children had measles, and the baby took it, and never retired afterwards. On 1st September, I left it on the bed for a few minutes, and while I was away, Mrs. Scope took it to the workhouse. No doubt the baby was fatigued and exhausted, and caught cold. I was locked up for an assault on Mrs. Scope, and I never saw the child afterwards. I was very much ill-used by my husband, both by blows and kicks, while I was pregnant with this child; and it was never well from its birth.</p>

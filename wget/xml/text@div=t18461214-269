                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman.</hi>) On the 2nd of Dec., about ten minutes to seven o'clock in the morning, I was on my beat in Bread. street—the prisoner passed me, and crossed to the opposite side of the way, with this box under his arm—I followed and overtook him in the act of crossing Cheapside from Bread-street, and asked what he had got there—he said a box which he was going to take to Mr. Jones, of Clerkenwell, near the work-house—he named some street, but I did not understand what, and said, "What street did you say?"—he said it was just by the workhouse, but he could not tell the name of the street—I asked him where he brought it from—he said from Mr. Hasletine, of Horsleydown—I asked him if he went to work so soon in the morning as that—he said he went at six o'clock—he said his master let him in, and told him to take the box to Mr. Jones the first thing in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I asked him if his master had given him the box himself—he said no, he told him to take it—I asked what the box contained—he said Mr. Jones only wanted the box—he did not say what it contained—I asked him to let me look at it—I took it, found it was unlocked, and contained papers and other things—I told him I must make further inquiry about it before I let him go farther—he said Jones and his master were both booksellers, and that he had been with Hasletine eight months and a fortnight—I took him to the station, searched him, and found a tobacco-box, a memorandum-book, and two duplicates for a coat and pair of shoes, which he said were his own—the prosecutor's house is in the parish of the Holy Trinity the Less.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of William Sellers, who was formerly ostler at the George livery-stables, Blackfriars-road; we keep the Farn ham Castle pub<lb></lb>lic-house, in Little Trinity-lane—I forget the name of the parish. This work-box, the papers, and other things in it, are mine—we lost a tobacco-box like this, but I will not swear to it—on Tuesday evening, the 1st of Dec., about half-past six o'clock, I was counting the money out of the box—that was the last time I saw it—it was in the bar, and contained the license of our house, and the excise license, and various bills and papers—the prisoner was our pot<lb></lb>boy at the time of the robbery, and for about three weeks previous—he went home at night—on Tuesday night he went home about half-past ten—I got up next morning at a quarter-past seven, and found the street door unbolted—before I</p>

                  </hi> I am a chimney-sweeper, and live in Trinity-place, which is at the back of the Farnham Castle. Last Wednesday week I got up, to go to work, between five and six o'clock—I went to work at Watling-street, and heard St. Paul's clock strike six as I was coming to Walling-street—I passed along the back of the Farnham Castle in Trinity-place—I observed that the back parlour window-shutters were open—I did not see any one there—I had seen the prisoner the morning before, that was the Tuesday, between five and six o'clock, in Little Trinity-lane, where the Farn<lb></lb>ham Castle is—he was walking to and fro by the house, in front of it—he said he was waiting to get in—he said he had made a mistake in the hour, he had got up rather earlier.</p>

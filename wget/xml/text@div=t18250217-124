I found it again on the 25th or the 28th of January, in a mews, in Queen-street, Lincoln's-Inn-fields, and knew it. The officer then sent it to me: its tail was cut short, and the mane pulled thinner; but I knew it again.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 23d of January, I apprehended the prisoner at his house, in Arbour-square, Commercial-road, and found four horses in his stable, where he was cleaning harness. I said nothing to him about them, as I did not take him about horses. I took them all four to the stables of Bishop, my brother officer, in Queen-street, Lincoln's-Inn-fields, on the evening of the 23d, for safety. They were advertised. Morris saw one of them at Bow-street, and claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You had not particularly noticed this horse? A. I rode it to the stable.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MORRIS. I saw it at Bow-street, in possession of Ellis, who had taken me to the stable: he is not here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the fence rather old? A. It was sufficient to keep the horse in; two others, which were in the field, remained there: it was old, and had done work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 17th of December, I bought this horse at Woodstock fair, and left it at the Blandford Arms public-house for five weeks, as it was lame.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Blandford Arms, at Woodstock. On the 17th of December, I remember the prisoner buying a horse, in my master's yard, of a tall thin man: he paid for it at our bar: it was lame, and remained five weeks in our stables, when he fetched it away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who is the tall thin man? A. I never saw him before nor since. It was a brown horse, with two white hind legs, and had a little white on the fore leg. I showed it out for the man. I do not know what was paid for it. I have seen it since in Morris's possession, and am sure it is the same. The tall thin man slept at our house that night, and left in the morning. I have lived there six years.</p>

In turning about, I took my Hand off, and saw the Prisoner in a black silk Cloak, close at my Right-side. I ask'd her, why she crouded me so? She look'd full in my Face, and at the same time I perceived her Hand on my Watch; but presently she took her Hand off, and the Dial-plate of my Watch being outwards, I did mistrust I had lost the Case, but I gave her a Push, and said, You Toad! What Business has your Hand on my Watch? My Hand? Says she; and went off in a Hurry down the Steps. In pushing her my Watch turn'd, and I saw the Key-hole on the Backside. I cry'd out, Stop Thief! she has stole my Watch-Case. So I follow'd and took her. I steal your Watch-Case? Says she. I received the Sacrament this Morning. That's nothing to me, says I. The Beadle search'd her slightly, but could not find the Case.</p>

            . I am a plaisterer. On the 7th of September, about six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner, and another man, go up to his house, in Silver-street, Stepney, with two bundles; they came out again, the prisoner came out first, with the blinds covered over, in his hand, and went towards Stepney-green.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 8th of September I had orders to watch the prisoner's house. I saw a cart come to the door about eight o'clock in the morning; a person put a stove in it, and a bundle which contained a blanket and other things - I saw them handed out to the man who drove the cart. I followed the cart towards Stepney-green, the man driving fast. I was fearful of losing sight of it. I overtook it at Trafalgar-square, and told the prisoner I was an officer, and that he had stolen property in the cart. He whipped the horses very hard, and also struck me with the whip while I held the horse; he jumped out of the cart, and made his escape. I took the property to a public-house. I went back to the house, a woman opened the door, and as soon as she saw me, she attempted to shut it, I got in, and found the prisoner up one pair of stairs. Powis asked him where the stove was which he brought there on the Saturday? he said he knew nothing of it. I asked if his name was Gale? he said it was. I asked him where the horse and cart where? he then said his name was not Gale, but his real name was Tilling - I took him into custody, and detained the woman; the horse and cart, he said were not his. The prisoner is not the man who drove the cart.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH POWIS. I went to the prisoner's house; he said his name was Gale. I told him I thought his name was Tilling - He said it was Gale; the cart had the name of Gale upon it; afterwards he said his name was not Gale but Tilling. He said he could tell something about the robbery.</p>
